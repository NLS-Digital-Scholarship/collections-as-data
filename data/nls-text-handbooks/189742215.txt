Introduction
Britain 1986 is the thirty-seventh official handbook in the series; it has
been prepared by the Central Office of Information on behalf of the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The handbook is widely known as
an established work of reference and is the mainstay of the reference
facilities provided by British information services in many countries. It
is sold by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office throughout the world.
Britain 1986 describes many features in the life of the country,
including the workings of the Government and other major institu¬
tions. It does not attempt an analytical approach to current events.
Care should be taken when studying British statistics to note whether
they refer to England, to England and Wales (considered together for
many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which
comprises England, Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom
(which is the same as Britain, that is. Great Britain and Northern
Ireland) as a whole.
The factual and statistical information in Britain 1986 is compiled with
the co-operation of other government departments and agencies, and of
many other organisations. Sources of more detailed and more topical
information (including statistics) are mentioned in the text and a guide
to official sources is given in Appendix 2.
The text, generally, is based on information available up to August
1985. s

Land and People
Introduction
Britain comprises Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) and Northern
Ireland, and is one of the member states of the European Community. Its full
name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The word Britain derives from Greek and Latin names probably stemming from
a Celtic original, which is also reflected in the name of the region of
north-western France (‘Brittany’ in English) settled by migrants from Britain in
the fifth and sixth centuries ad. Although, in the prehistoric time-scale, the
Celts were relatively late arrivals in the British Isles (following cultures which
had produced such notable monuments as the stone circles of Avebury and
Stonehenge) it is only with them that Britain emerges into recorded history, and
the term Celtic is often used rather generally to distinguish the early inhabitants
of the British Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon invaders.
Following sorties by Julius Caesar in 55 and 54 bc, Britain was occupied by
the Romans in the first century ad and an ordered civilisation was established
under their rule for two or three hundred years except in the territory north of
Hadrian’s Wall (the wall across northern England planned by Hadrian, Roman
Emperor from 117 to 138 ad) and in some western areas. Christian missionaries
arrived not only in Roman Britain but also in Scotland and Ireland.
England and The final Roman withdrawal in the fifth century, however, followed a long period
Wales of increasing disorder during which there began raids on the island from
northern Europe—mainly by peoples traditionally described as Angles (from
Schleswig), Saxons and Jutes. It is from the Angles that the name England
derives. In the following two centuries the raids turned into settlement and the
establishment of a number of small kingdoms (with the Britons, or Celts,
maintaining an independent existence in the areas now known as Wales and
Cornwall). Among these kingdoms, more powerful ones which claimed over¬
lordship over the whole country were established, first in the north (North¬
umbria), then in the central area (Mercia) and finally in the south (Wessex).
However, the rise of Wessex in the ninth century under the leadership of Alfred
the Great (849—99) was contemporaneous with further raids and settlement
from Europe, in this case by the Vikings from Scandinavia. In the tenth century
the Wessex dynasty defeated the invading Danes and established a wide-ranging
authority in England. A second wave of Danish invasions, however, led to the
establishment of a Danish dynasty in England between 1017 and 1042, when
the Wessex line was restored.
The last successful invasion of England took place following a disputed
succession when Duke William of Normandy (a duchy established by the Vikings
and owing only nominal allegiance to the French king) enforced his claims by
defeating the English at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. There was considerable
settlement by Normans and others from France, French became the language of
the nobility for the next three centuries and the legal and, to some extent, social
structure was influenced by that which prevailed across the Channel. The
monarchy established by William and his successors was (except in intervals of

civil war) considerably more effective in administrative and military terms than
its predecessors and it began to establish its authority over increasingly wide
areas of the British Isles. This policy was pushed forward with most energy by
Edward I (1272-1307). His most lasting success was in Wales, the main
stronghold into which the Britons had retreated. With the death in battle in
1282 of the Welsh Prince Llywelyn the royal authority became firmly established
there. Edward gave his own heir the title of Prince of Wales' which has
subsequently been bestowed upon the eldest son of the sovereign. The rising led
by Owain Glyndwr at the beginning of the fifteenth century showed strong
continuing Welsh national feeling but a new dimension to the situation was
provided by the accession to the English throne in 1485 of Henry VII of the Welsh
House of Tudor. Wales was politically assimilated to England under the Act of
Union in 1535.
A more difficult problem concerned relations between England and Scotland.
Hadrian’s Wall had proved no insurmountable barrier between the Romans and
their northern neighbours, and far-reaching expeditions both by the Romans
into Scotland and by the Scottish people known as Piets into England took
place. In the sixth century the Scots from Ireland or ‘Scotia’ settled in the area of
Scotland now known as Argyll. Lothian was English in population, and Welsh
Britons moved north from the invading English into Strathclyde. A united
kingdom, under the Scots king Kenneth MacAlpine, emerged in the ninth
century while Scotland, like England, was endeavouring to defend itself against
the Vikings. The establishment of a powerful monarchy in England, however,
especially after the Norman Conquest in the eleventh century, was to pose an
intermittent but considerable threat to Scottish independence throughout the
Middle Ages and well into the sixteenth century.
The eventual unification of the crowns reflected the fact that, after the
Reformation (Henry VUI’s breakaway in 1534 from the authority of the Roman
Catholic Church), old national antagonisms had become less important than
religious differences. Following the death of Henry’s daughter, the childless
Elizabeth I in 1603, the Protestant James Stuart, James VI of Scotland (son of
Mary, Queen of Scots, whose grandmother was a sister of Henry VIII), was
welcomed to the English throne as James I. England, Wales and Scotland were
henceforth known as Great Britain. Apart from the union of the monarchies,
however, England and Scotland remained separate during the seventeenth
century, except for an enforced unification by Oliver Cromwell early in the period
of the Commonwealth (1649—60) after he had defeated royalist forces in
Scotland. By the beginning' of the following century political and economic
arguments for a closer union were apparent in both countries. Eventually, in
1707, both sides agreed on the formation of a single parliament for Great Britain
although Scotland retained its own system of law and church settlement. The
union was put under strain when Queen Anne died in 1714 and George, Elector
of Hanover (descended from a daughter of James I) succeeded the Stuarts on the
British throne. ‘Jacobite’ rebellions, aiming to restore the Stuarts to the British
throne, took place in 1715 and 1745 but were unsuccessful.
In Ireland, out of a patchwork of Celtic and pre-Celtic peoples similar to that in
Britain, a number of kingdoms had emerged before the Christian era; any
supremacy established by one over the others in the following 1,000 years was of
a temporary nature. In cultural matters Ireland compared favourably with most
of Europe during the Dark Ages and Christianity survived in Ireland when it had
been displaced for the time being in England by Anglo-Saxon invaders. Ireland,
however, did not escape the incursions of the Vikings, who dominated the
country during the tenth century.
LAND AND PEOPLE
3
In 1169 Henry II of England launched an invasion of Ireland, the overlordship
of which he had been granted by the Pope, who was anxious to bring the Irish
church into full obedience to Rome. A large part of the country came under the
control of Anglo-Norman magnates but their descendants tended to assimilate
to their new country and little direct authority was exercised from England
during the Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
Henry YIII’s assumption of the title of King of Ireland in 1541 arose from his
desire to apply the Reformation settlement and thereafter the religious issue was
to produce far-reaching consequences. The determination to establish royal
authority in Ireland was strengthened during the reign of Elizabeth I by the fear
that the country might be used by Philip of Spain in his efforts to subjugate
England, and a series of campaigns were waged against Irish insurgents. The
main focus of the resistance was the northern province of Ulster and, with its
collapse in 1607, Ulster became an area of settlement by immigrants from
Scotland and England. (There was settlement by immigrants elsewhere in
Ireland, though on a lesser scale.)
The English civil war of 1642—52 led to further risings in Ireland which were
crushed by Cromwell. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 was followed by
the accession of the Roman Catholic James II to the throne in 1685, and there
was more fighting after his deposition three years later in favour of his nephew
and son-in-law, the Protestant William of Orange and his wife Mary.
During most of the eighteenth century there was an uneasy peace and towards
its end various efforts were made by British governments to achieve stability. In
1782 the Irish Parliament (dating from medieval times) was given legislative
independence; the only constitutional tie with England was the Crown. The
Parliament represented, however, only the privileged Anglo-Irish minority, who
had obtained possession of most of the agricultural land, and Catholics were
excluded from it. Against the background of an abortive rebellion in 1798 and
the prospect of intervention by France (with which England was at war between
1793 and 1800) the Irish Parliament was induced to vote for union with what,
from 1801, was to be the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland.
The ‘Irish question’ continued as one of the major problems of British politics
during the nineteenth century. In 1886 the Liberal Government introduced a
Home Rule Bill which would have given an Irish Parliament authority over most
internal matters while reserving to Britain control over external affairs. This led
to a split in the Liberal Party and the failure of the Bill. It was not until 1914 that
Home Rule was enacted by the Government of Ireland Act. Its implementation
was, however, prevented both by the threat of armed resistance on the part of
the Protestant majority in Ulster and by the outbreak of the first world war.
A nationalist uprising in Dublin in 1916 was suppressed, but with the end of
the first world war a guerrilla force known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
began operations against the British administration. In 1921 a settlement was
reached under which six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster received
their own Parliament, but remained represented in and subject to the supreme
authority of the British Parliament, while the remainder of Ireland as the Irish
Free State (later to become the Irish Republic) became a self-governing state
outside the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Channel Islands Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not part of the United
and Isle of Man Kingdom, they have a special relationship with it because of the antiquity of
their connection with the Crown. The Channel Islands were integrated into the
Duchy of Normandy in the tenth and eleventh centuries and have been
territories of the Crown since the Norman Conquest. The Isle of Man was under

the nominal sovereignty of Norway until 1266 when it was ceded to Scotland,
subsequently passing to the Earls of Derby for a period but eventually coming
under the direct administration of the Crown in 1765. Today the territories are
Crown dependencies, with their own legislative assemblies and systems of local
administration and oi law, and their own courts. The British Government is
responsible for their defence, their international relations and. ultimately, their
good government.
The position of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man in the European
Community is broadly that the islands remain outside the Community except
for customs purposes and for certain aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Community provisions relating to the free movement of people and services do
not apply.
The Four Lands
In the following pages there are brief descriptions of a number of aspects of
social, economic and political life for each of the four countries, England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, with some additional material on the political
situation in Northern Ireland. (Statistics on the four lands are contained in
Table 1.)
England is predominantly a lowland country. There are upland regions in the
north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian mountains and the Yorkshire
moorlands) and in the south west in Devon and Cornwall. For the most part,
however, the country is undulating or flat and, in the south, crossed by low
ranges of hills including the Cotswolds and the Kent and Sussex Downs. The
greatest concentrations of population are in the London and Thames estuary
areas, the West Yorkshire and north-west industrial cities, the midlands
conurbation around Birmingham, the north-east conurbations on the rivers
Tyne and Tees, and along the Channel coast.
The Church of England, which was separated from the Roman Catholic
Church at the Reformation, is the Established Church in England, with
privileges balanced by certain duties which it must fulfil; the Sovereign must
always be a member of the Church and appoints its two archbishops, 24 bishops
and some other senior clergy.
England has no government minister or department exclusively responsible for
its central administration of domestic affairs, in contrast to Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. Instead, responsibility is shared among a number of gov¬
ernment departments, whose responsibilities in some cases also cover aspects of
affairs in Wales and Scotland. There are 523 members of Parliament for England
in the House of Commons, and arrangements are made for the discussion of
regional affairs. Traditionally, of the two major political parties, the Conserva¬
tives find their support chiefly in suburban and rural areas, while the Labour
Party derives its main support from urban industrialised areas. In the 1983
election England returned 362 Conservative members of Parliament, 148
Labour, 10 Liberal and 3 Social Democrat. Local government is administered
through a two-tier system of counties subdivided into districts, except in
London, where local government is the responsibility of the Greater London
Council (GLC), 32 borough councils and the Corporation of the City of London.
A major reorganisation of local government will be implemented in April 1986
when the GLC and the metropolitan county councils ol Greater Manchester,
Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West
Yorkshire are due to be abolished and most of their functions transferred to
London borough and metropolitan district councils.

Eight ‘standard’ regions in England are delimited principally for statistical
purposes: South East, East Anglia, South West, West Midlands, East Midlands,
Yorkshire and Humberside, North West and North. They play no part in local
government and do not always coincide with the regional units adopted by
central government departments.
The legal system of England comprises on the one hand a historic body of
conventions, known as ‘common law' and ‘equity’, and on the other, parliamen¬
tary and European Community legislation. Common law stems from the work of
the king's judges after the Norman Conquest of 1066 who sought to bring
together into a single body of legal principles the various local customs of the

Anglo-Saxons. Great reliance was placed on precedent, and the practice of
reporting on cases commenced in the thirteenth century. Equity law derives
from the practice of petitioning the king's Chancellor in cases not covered by
common law. The English legal system is therefore distinct from many of those
of Western Europe which have codes deriving from Roman Law. The Habeas
Corpus Act 1679 is a fundamental statute forbidding imprisonment without
trial.
The Economy Up to the eighteenth century the English economy was mainly agrarian and the
chief manufacture was wool cloth. London as the capital city, and a major port
and mercantile centre, and the textile areas (East Anglia, south-western
England and West Yorkshire) were the most populous and prosperous regions.
In the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, however, rapid growth took
place in the midlands, the north west, west Yorkshire and the north east, where
the coalfields and iron ore deposits permitted Britain to become the first
industrialised nation, basing its wealth on coalmining, on the manufacture of
iron and steel, heavy machinery and textiles, on shipbuilding and on trade.
London enhanced its position with the growing strength of the economy but
East Anglia and the west country, remote from areas of industrial development,
were affected by agricultural depression, and entered a period of relative decline.
In the twentieth century, the second period of industrialisation, based on new
sources of energy, new manufacturing industries and new forms of transport,
has continued to change the broad pattern of regional and industrial develop¬
ment in England. In the 1920s and 1930s the northern industrial centres saw
their traditional industries weakened owing to fluctuations in world trade and
competition from other industrialising countries and, in some cases, from
substitute products. London, its surrounding counties and the West Midlands
generally benefited from the newer, more mobile, industries. These included
chemicals (such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, plastics and artificial fibres),
electrical and electronic engineering, vehicle manufacture, aircraft building,
instrument engineering, aluminium and rubber manufacture and a wide range
of consumer goods, including processed food, drink and tobacco products as
well as durables.
In the second half of the century economic and population growth has tended
to favour smaller towns and rural areas, particularly those in the South West
and East Anglia. A number of industrial areas (in the North, the North West,
Yorkshire and Humberside and the West Midlands) have suffered over the last
decade as a result of the decline in manufacturing employment. Through its
regional industrial policy the Government aims to reduce regional disparities in
employment opportunities by making investment incentives available in the
areas of greatest need, including those which have been dependent on declining
industries. Measures also exist to revive economic activity in inner urban areas.
East Anglia, still largely agricultural, has been the fastest-growing English
region in both population and employment since the 1960s. Particular growth
points have been Peterborough, the east coast ports (which, besides benefiting
from relative proximity to the northern European Community countries, have in
some cases become important bases for the development of gas resources in the
southern North Sea) and nine towns receiving population overspill from
London. Food processing, agricultural machinery, vehicle engines and elec¬
tronic and instrument engineering are the strongest industries, and the
service sector has been growing in Cambridge, Ipswich and Norwich.
Greater London and the industrial cities of the West Midlands, the North West,
Yorkshire and Humberside and the North continue to represent the largest
concentrations of manufacturing industry. London is an important area for
products of all kinds including food and drink (especially brewing), instrument

engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, clothing, furniture and
printing. Of importance in the surrounding south-eastern counties are oil
refining (along the Thames and near Southampton), pharmaceuticals, pumps,
valves and compressors, instrument engineering, electronics (particularly in
Berkshire and Hertfordshire, and around Chelmsford), motor vehicles, aero¬
space, building materials, timber, paper and plastics products. There is
diversity, too, in the North West, with significant activity in food processing
(especially grain milling, bread, flour confectionery and biscuits), chemicals,
textile machinery, insulated wires and cables, computers (Manchester being one
of the largest centres in the country), motor vehicles, aerospace, clothing, glass
making (with the world's largest flat glass maker, Pilkington, in St Helens),
paper and rubber products. Lancashire is the centre of the cotton and allied
textile industries.
The characteristic manufactures of the West Midlands are metals (steel tubes,
iron castings and non-ferrous metals), machine tools, electrical engineering,
motor vehicles, carpets, pottery (with over 80 per cent of Britain's ceramics
industry located in Staffordshire) and rubber production. Of the other regions,
Yorkshire and Humberside has important shares of cocoa, chocolate and
confectionery production, iron and steel, machine tools, textile machineiy,
woollen and worsted goods (producing about two-thirds of Britain's wool
textiles), carpets, clothing and glass containers. The North has general
chemicals, iron and steel, process plant, shipbuilding and marine engineering,
and clothing; the East Midlands has steel tubes, iron castings, over two-thirds of
Britain s hosiery and knitted goods industry, and footwear: and the South West
has food processing (especially dairy products), aerospace and paper products.
In agriculture, the number of mixed holdings has been falling, as part of a
general tendency towards greater specialisation. Dairying is most common in
the west of England, where the wetter climate encourages the growth of good
grass; sheep and cattle are reared in the hilly and moorland areas of northern
and south-western England; and arable farming, pig and poultry farming and
horticulture are concentrated in the east and south. Horticulture is also
important in the West Midlands. Forestry is mainly found in the North, South
East and South West regions. The principal fishing ports are on the east coast
and in the South West.
England has plentiful energy resources in its coalfields and has access to
offshore oil and gas reserves. About 60 per cent of Britain’s deep-mined coal is
produced in the East Midlands and Yorkshire coalfields, the former being the
most productive in the country. The electricity grid of England and Wales is one
of the largest interconnected power networks under unified control in the
Western world. The world's first large-scale nuclear power station was estab¬
lished at Calder Hall in Cumbria in 1956, while substantial investment in
reprocessrng capacity is being undertaken nearby. Other nuclear power stations
are on coastal sites, including eight around the coasts of southern England.
Important mineral deposits in England include aggregates for the construction
industry (sand, gravel and crushed rock), industrial minerals (including clay,
salt from the North West and china clay from Cornwall), tin ore, also from
Cornwall, and iron ore from the East Midlands and Humberside. Water
resources include the Kielder Reservoir (Northumberland), one of Europe’s
largest man-made lakes.
A motorway network has been constructed in England since the 1950s and
comprises four long-distance arterial routes linking London and the cities of the
midlands, the North and North West and the South West, and over 30 shorter
motorways. Priority is being given to completion of the London orbital route
(expected in 1986) and schemes of industrial importance. Inter-city travel has
been improved by the introduction of high-speed rail services which are among

the best in the world in speed, frequency and comfort. Many ports have been
equipped to deal with new developments in shipping (such as container ships)
and to take account of changes in the nature of trade brought about by the
increase in oil traffic through North Sea ports and the growing proportion of
trade with the continent of Europe. The major airports are Heathrow (the
busiest international airport in the world) and Gatwick, both serving London,
and Manchester, Luton and Birmingham.
Employment in service industries has accounted for an increasing share of
total employment in recent years, expansion being particularly marked in
financial and business services. London is one of the world's leading centres of
banking, insurance and other financial services. Decentralisation of some office
services from the capital has led to a growth of office employment in the South
West and East Anglia in particular. London and the surrounding counties
account for two-thirds of advertising and market research activity, more than
half of all services offered by research establishments (other than those attached
to businesses), half of central government services and nearly half of non-food
wholesale distribution in England. After London and the South East, the North
West, with its main centre in Manchester, has the next most important
concentration of service industries. Tourism, catering and the leisure industries
have also expanded. Over half of expenditure by overseas visitors in Britain is
spent in London, while the South West is the most popular region for domestic
tourism. Each region has its own particular attraction for tourists. For example,
a number of areas including Northumberland and Cumbria (whose peaks
include Scafell, England's highest point, at 978 m, 3,210 ft) have hills and lakes
which attract walkers, climbers and riders.
Cultural life in England takes so many forms that a brief summary can only
attempt to suggest its variety. London alone has about 100 theatres, including
some 40 in the ‘West End', together with fringe and suburban theatres, about a
dozen major centres for music concerts, ballet and opera, four major art
galleries, a dozen major museums (with over 80 smaller galleries and museums),
some 400 public libraries, and over 140 West End, local and independent
cinemas. In a typical week there are many lectures, poetry readings, and jazz,
rock or folk music performances. Leisure facilities include discotheques, bingo
halls, amusement arcades, ice and roller skating rinks and swimming pools.
With its ceremonial occasions, palaces, other historic buildings and shops,
London is also one of the world’s leading tourist centres. About 15 attractions
(Westminster Abbey, the Tower of London, Madame Tussaud’s—an exhibition of
waxworks of famous people—the London Zoo, Kew Gardens and the major
museums and art galleries) each receive more than a million visitors a year.
Because of its size and its position as the capital city, London is not
representative of the rest of England, but much the same broad range of cultural
interests is reflected in many other cities and towns. The English Tourist Board
lists some 1,230 art galleries, museums and similar institutions in the rest of
England. Distinctive features of the northern industrial cities are special social
clubs, working men s clubs, which attract well-known entertainers. In addition,
many rural or outdoor recreations are strongly supported and there is active
interest in numerous games and sports, many of them having been devised in
England.
The English love of gardens and landscapes is associated with a tradition of
sightseeing visits to the numerous country houses, gardens and unspoilt rural
and coastal areas. There are seven national parks, two forest parks, some 32
designated ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’, about 150 country parks
approved by the Countryside Commission, 550 ‘outstanding conservation
areas’, 620 km (385 miles) of designated heritage coastline and 1,900 historic

buildings and gardens listed by the English Tourist Board. Newer developments
include the opening of safari and wildlife parks and of‘theme’ parks devoted, for
example, to maritime history, which offer a diversity of entertainments as well.
Many regions and towns have associations with the great English writers and
artists, such as William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, Arnold Bennett,
Charles Dickens, the Bronte sisters, Thomas Hardy, Thomas Gainsborough and
John Constable.
Wales is a country of hills and mountains with extensive tracts of high plateau
and shorter stretches of mountain ranges deeply dissected by river valleys. The
highest mountains are in Snowdonia in the north west; the highest peak is
Snowdon (1,085 m, 3,560 ft). The lower-lying ground is largely confined to the
relatively narrow coastal belt and the lower parts of the river valleys. The main
areas of settlement are in the southern valleys and coastal areas, where
two-thirds of the population live. The chief urban centres are Cardiff, Swansea,
Newport and Wrexham. Wales is a principality; Prince Charles, the heir to the
throne, was invested by the Queen with the title of Prince of Wales at Caernarfon
Castle in 1969 when he was 20.
The country has its own Welsh language, spoken (according to the 1981
census) by 19 per cent of the population, chiefly in the rural north and west. The
Welsh name of the country is Cymru. Measures adopted since the 1960s have
helped to revive the use of the language, which is of Celtic origin and closely
resembles Breton, spoken in Brittany in France. They include recognising the
equal validity of Welsh with English in law courts, the encouragement of
bilingual education in schools, and the extended use of Welsh for official
purposes and in broadcasting. Welsh-language television programmes are
transmitted in Wales by Sianel 4 Cymru (Channel 4 Wales).
There is no established church in Wales, the Anglican church having been
disestablished in 1920 following decades of pressure from adherents of the more
evangelical Methodist and Baptist persuasions. Methodism in particular had
spread rapidly in Wales in the eighteenth century, assuming the nature of a
popular movement among Welsh speakers and finding strong support later in
industrial communities.
The country returns 38 members of Parliament and there are special arrange¬
ments for the discussion of Welsh affairs. For the last 60 years the industrial
communities of Wales have tended to support the Labour Party in elections,
ensuring a Labour majority in Wales. In the 1983 election 20 Labour, 14
Conservative, 2 Plaid Cymru (Welsh Nationalist) and 2 Liberal members were
returned. Substantial administrative autonomy is centred on the Secretary of
State for Wales, who is a member of the Cabinet, and has wide-ranging
responsibilities relating to the economy, welfare services and the provision of
amenities. The headquarters of the administration is the Welsh Office in
Cardiff, which also has an office in London. In 1979 proposals for the
establishment of an elected Welsh assembly in Cardiff to take over policymaking
and executive powers from central government were rejected in a referendum
held in Wales. Local government is exercised through a system of elected
authorities similar to that in England, and the legal system is identical with the
English one.
The south Wales coalfield was developed during the latter part of the industrial
revolution in the second half of the nineteenth century, creating populous urban
centres which drew labour from the rural areas and from England and Ireland.
However, the economy was narrowly based, mainly on coal, iron, steel and

tinplate, and contracted sharply during the 1920s and 1930s, resulting in
severe employment problems and substantial emigration.
Notable features of the past three decades have been the continuing
contraction of coalmining and iron and steel production (although Wales still
accounts for about one-third of Britain’s steel production), the advent of a more
diverse range of manufacturing industries and the growth of service industries.
Wales is developing as an important centre for electronics in Britain and several
new high-technology businesses in electronics and related industries have been
established. Inward investment by overseas companies (especially Japanese and
United States high-technology concerns) has been considerable, and there are
over 200 overseas-owned or associated firms in Wales, employing about 50,000
people and accounting for around one in five jobs in the manufacturing sector.
South Wales remains the principal industrial area but new industries and firms
have also been introduced on the smaller coalfield in north-east Wales, around
Wrexham and Deeside, again to offset the decline in the older, basic industries
which previously dominated the area. Light industry has also been attracted to
the towns in the rural areas in mid- and north Wales and an important refinery
complex has developed around Milford Haven, which is one of Britain’s major oil
ports.
Agriculture occupies about 80 per cent of the land area, the main activities
being sheep and cattle rearing in the hill regions and dairy farming in the
lowlands. Wales accounts for about 11 per cent of forest area in Britain and over
20 per cent of Forestry Commission timber production.
Wales produces about 7 per cent of Britain's deep-mined coal and 14 per cent
of opencast production, including all of its anthracite. The biggest pumped-
storage power station in Europe is at Dinorwig, while there are nuclear power
stations at Wylfa and Trawsfynydd. Wales exports about a third of its water
supply to England.
Good communications exist in the south with motorway links across the
Severn Bridge to southern England and the midlands, and high-speed rail
services to a number of destinations in England, while the main road along the
north Wales coast is being upgraded.
There has been expansion in financial and business services, in the tourist
and catering trades and in some areas of public administration. With its coastal
resorts (which include Tenby, Saundersfoot, Rhyl, Llandudno, Colwyn Bay,
Porthcawl and Barry), and the attractions of three national parks (Snowdonia,
the Brecon Beacons and the Pembrokeshire Coast), as well as other areas of
picturesque hill, lake and mountain country, Wales attracts many tourists,
especially for outdoor holidays.
There is much literary, musical and dramatic activity in Wales and there is a
National Library and National Museum. Welsh literature is one of the oldest in
Europe. The country is well known for its choral singing and the Welsh National
Opera has an international reputation. The special festivals of Wales, known as
eisteddfodau, encourage Welsh literature and music. The largest is the Royal
National Eisteddfod of Wales, held annually, entirely in Welsh, and consisting of
competitions in music, singing, prose and poetry. The town of Llangollen has
extended its eisteddfod to include artists from all over the world in the annual
International Musical Eisteddfod. Famous modern Welsh artists have included
the opera singer Sir Geraint Evans, the poet Dylan Thomas and the actor
Richard Burton. The politicians David Lloyd George (former Prime Minister) and
Aneurin Bevan were noted orators in a strong Welsh tradition. An active local
press includes a number of Welsh language publications. Great interest is
aroused by the annual rugby football competition in which sides representing
Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland and France take part.

Government
Health services are provided mainly under the National Health Service,
administered by the Welsh Office, while personal social services, and education
(except at university level), are provided mainly through the local authorities.
Educational provision is similar to that in England except for the use of Welsh in
some schools, particularly in the Welsh-speaking, largely rural, areas. The
collegiate University of Wales, founded in 1893, comprises seven member
institutions.
Scotland may be divided broadly into three areas: the sparsely populated
highlands and islands in the north, accounting for just over half the total area of
the country: the central lowlands, containing three-quarters of the population
and most of the industrial centres and cultivated farmland: and the Southern
Uplands, containing a number of hill ranges, which border on England. The
highest mountains are the Grampians in the central highlands, with Ben Nevis
(1,342 m, 4,406 ft) the highest peak. The chief cities are the main administra¬
tive centre Edinburgh, the main industrial centre Glasgow, and the two regional
centres Aberdeen and Dundee.
The period from 1750 onwards has seen considerable and continuous
emigration of Scots to England and overseas. However, the rate slowed markedly
in the 1970s as the offshore oil and gas industries developed and there was
inward migration to the north east of Scotland, although the large outflow of
people from Strathclyde has continued, but at a lower level. In the mid¬
nineteenth century, as Scotland industrialised rapidly, there was large-scale
immigration from Ireland.
The period from 1750 until the beginning of the twentieth century was also
one of stability and economic progress and of achievements in many fields.
Among the famous men to emerge were David Hume, Robert Burns, Sir Walter
Scott, Adam Smith, Robert Adam, James Watt, John MacAdam, Lord Kelvin and
James Clerk Maxwell.
The Church of Scotland, which became the established church in 1690, has
complete freedom in all matters of doctrine, order and discipline. It is a
Protestant church which is Presbyterian in form, being governed by a hierarchy
of church courts, each of which includes laymen.
There are special arrangements for the conduct of Scottish affairs within the
British system of government and separate Acts of Parliament are passed for
Scotland where appropriate. In the 1983 general election the 72 Scottish seats
in the House of Commons were apportioned as follows: 41 Labour, 21
Conservative, 5 Liberal, 3 Social Democrat, and 2 Scottish National. Since 1959
Scotland, like Wales, has had a majority of Labour members of Parliament.
Administrative tasks relating to a wide range of economic and social functions
are the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, a member of the
Cabinet, working through the Scottish Office, with its administrative head¬
quarters in Edinburgh and an office in London. A proposal for an elected
assembly for Scotland, on which a referendum was held in 1979, failed to gain
the support of the required 40 per cent of the electorate, even though a majority
of those voting gave it their approval.
Local government generally operates on a two-tier basis broadly similar to that
in England and Wales but established by separate legislation.
The principles and procedures of the Scottish legal system (particularly in civil
law) differ in many respects from those of England and Wales, stemming, in
part, from the adoption of elements of other European legal systems, based on
Roman law, during the sixteenth century.
LAND AND PEOPLE
13
The Economy
Scotland has experienced the same pressure on its traditional industries as the
north of England and Wales. The regional policies of successive governments
and investment by overseas companies have both made significant contribu¬
tions to the growth of modern, technologically based industries, and Scotland's
economic structure is now broadly similar to that of Britain as a whole.
Engineering remains a major industry, accounting for about a quarter of the
manufacturing workforce, but there has been a significant trend towards lighter
engineering products and rapid expansion in electronics (including microelec¬
tronics). With about 250 companies and nearly 43,000 jobs, Scotland has one of
the biggest concentrations of the electronics industry in Western Europe.
Scotland accounts for about 80 per cent of Britain's output of integrated circuits
and for 50 per cent of that of computers, peripherals and related products.
Another significant economic development in recent years has been the
substantial expansion of offshore-related industries following the discovery of oil
and gas under the northern North Sea. Some 100,000 jobs have arisen directly
or indirectly as a result of North Sea activities. Many of these jobs reflect overseas
investment solely related to the development of North Sea resources, but oil and
gas developments have stimulated other industries including engineering and
chemicals, reinforcing Scotland's position in the chemicals industry, especially
petrochemicals; the first phase of a major new plant at Mossmorran (Fife) was
opened in 1984. Traditional industries, such as coal, steel and shipbuilding,
have experienced a long-term decline in employment, but are still major
contributors to the Scottish economy. Other traditional manufactures, such as
high-quality tweeds and other textiles, and food and drink products, remain
important. There are about 100 whisky distilleries in Scotland and the industry
is a major export earner.
Northern and north-east Scotland (particularly Aberdeen) have benefited most
from offshore developments. However, Strathclyde, by far the most populous
region, has experienced serious industrial decline and population loss, particu¬
larly in Glasgow. In the remainder of the central belt and in the five new towns
(East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Livingston, Irvine and Cumbernauld) trends have
been generally more favourable. In Lothian the large concentration of financial
and other service industries centred on Edinburgh has been a helpful influence.
Scotland has about one-third of Britain’s total agricultural land, but 70 per
cent of it consists of hill grazing for cattle and sheep. About 11 per cent of the
agricultural area is used for crops, and 67 per cent of this is under barley.
Scotland accounts for nearly half of Britain’s forest area and for 40 per cent of
public sector timber production; the bulk of new planting in Britain takes place
in Scotland, much of it in the upland and mountain areas. Fishing remains an
important activity; more than 65 per cent of total landings of fish in Britain are
made by vessels based in Scotland.
Despite the advent of cheaper natural gas, Scotland still depends heavily on
electricity; nuclear and hydro-electric generation supply a higher proportion of
energy than in any other part of Britain. Large supplies of unpolluted water form
a major resource.
Communications, both domestic and international, have improved in many
areas, particularly in the north and north east, owing to the stimulus of the
offshore oil industry and road- and bridge-building programmes. The offshore
oil industry has also encouraged expansion in financial and business services
which have been traditionally strong in Scotland.
Tourism, which makes a significant contribution to the economy and to
employment in Scotland, accounts for around 10 per cent of domestic tourism
in Britain. Tourist expenditure as a whole is estimated to generate, both directly
and indirectly, nearly 100,000 jobs. Scotland's cultural and historic associa¬
tions, its varied scenic beauty, and the opportunities for sport and recreation

are particular attractions. Golf originated in Scotland, and courses at St
Andrews, Gleneagles, Turnberry and Prestwick are internationally renowned.
Skiing is growing in importance, with centres at Aviemore, Glenshee, Glencoe
and the Lecht, and further developments are planned.
A vigorous cultural life in Scotland has as its highlight the annual Edinburgh
International Festival, one of the world’s leading cultural events. Notable
performing arts bodies are the Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Opera,
Scottish Ballet, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Scottish Baroque Ensemble and
the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Scotland possesses excellent collections
of the fine and applied arts, notably in the National Galleries of Scotland, the
Royal Scottish Museum and the National Museum of Antiquities in Edinburgh,
and the City of Glasgow Museum and Art Galleries (including the Burrell
collection, opened in 1983).
A language of ancient Celtic origin, Scots Gaelic is spoken by some 80,000
people mainly in the islands and north west of Scotland. It is the indigenous
language, with its own literary background. Scottish people in the lowlands have
for centuries spoken Scots (or Lallans), a derivative of the Northumbrian dialect
of Old English, which has its own recognised literary tradition and has seen a
revival in poetry in recent times.
An active press includes two daily newspapers based in Edinburgh and
Glasgow which also have a circulation outside Scotland. There are ten other
dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Articles in some papers are printed in
Gaelic. Television programmes are produced by BBC (Scotland) and by three
independent companies, covering the highland, lowland and border regions.
BBC Radio Scotland covers most of the population and there are five
community’ services in the highlands and islands, two of them mainly in Gaelic,
and two in the borders. Independent radio stations provide services for
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee/Perth, Aberdeen, Ayr and Inverness.
Local authorities are responsible for the provision of most education, except at
university level. Secondary education in Scotland is almost completely organised
on comprehensive lines. Independent bodies administer vocational further and
higher education institutions and colleges of education. There are eight
universities, of which four (St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh)
were established in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, while the other four
have been established since 1964. The educational tradition has been particu¬
larly strong in Scotland, helping many Scots to positions of eminence in the arts
and sciences.
Over 50 per cent of Scotland’s housing has been built since 1945, only
Northern Ireland having a larger percentage. Scotland has a high proportion of
housing rented from public authorities (over 50 per cent compared with a
national average of less than 30 per cent), although in recent years there has
been a noticeable growth in owner-occupied housing.
Northern Ireland is at its nearest point only 21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It
has a 488-km (303-mile) border in the south and west with the Irish Republic. At
its centre lies Lough Neagh, Britain's largest freshwater lake (381 sq km,
147 sq miles). Many of the principal towns lie in valleys leading from the Lough,
including the capital, Belfast, which stands at the mouth of the river Lagan The
Mourne Mountains, rising sharply in the south east, include Slieve Donard
Northern Ireland’s highest peak (852 m, 2,796 ft).
Just under two-thirds of Northern Ireland’s population are descendants of
Scots or English settlers who crossed to north-eastern Ireland mainly in the
seventeenth centuiy; most belong to the Protestant faith, and have a traditional
loyalty to the maintenance of the union with Great Britain. The remainder, over

a third, are Irish in origin and mainly Roman Catholic; many of them are
nationalist in political opinion, favouring union with the Irish Republic.
Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, but for 50 years from 1921 it
had its own devolved Parliament in which the mainly Protestant Unionists
consistently formed the majority and therefore constituted the Government after
successive elections. Nationalists, who are predominantly Roman Catholic,
resented this domination and their effective exclusion from political office.
Although substantial advances for the whole population were achieved in social
welfare and economic development, during the late 1960s an active and
articulate civil rights movement emerged. Reforms were made but sectarian
disturbances developed, which required the introduction of the Army in 1969 to
support the police in keeping the peace. Subsequently, sectarian divisions were
exploited by the actions of terrorists from both sides, but most notably by the
Provisional Irish Republican Army who claimed to be protecting the Roman
Catholic minority.
Despite the Northern Ireland Government’s substantial reform programme, the
inter-communal violence continued and the United Kingdom Government
concluded that the best hope of ending terrorism and achieving political
progress would be for the United Kingdom Parliament and Government to take
over responsibility for law and order in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland
Government felt unable to accept this and resigned, and in 1972 direct rule
began, with a United Kingdom Cabinet minister responsible for the functions
previously exercised by the Northern Ireland Government.
Several attempts have been made to secure a stable and effective devolved
government supported by both sides of the community. A new constitution
which devolved powers to an elected legislative assembly, and a power-sharing'
executive representing all sections of the community, encountered Protestant
‘loyalist’ opposition culminating in a general strike in 1974; in 1976 an elected
constitutional convention failed to agree on a system of government that would
command widespread acceptance; in 1978 a planned framework tor a lorm ol
devolution to consolidate common ground among the political parties was
rejected; and in 1980 there was a political conference and extensive discussions.
In 1981 the appointment of a Northern Ireland Council to advise the Secretary of
State was proposed but rejected by the political parties in Northern Ireland.
The Government's policy continues to be based on two fundamental principles.
First, that there will be no change in Northern Ireland's constitutional status as
part of the United Kingdom without the consent of a majority of people in
Northern Ireland. This is in accordance with internationally accepted principles
of democracy and is recognised by the Government of the Republic of Ireland. A
‘border poll' in 1973 showed that a clear majority wished Northern Ireland to
remain part of the United Kingdom, and in subsequent elections parties which
support that position have continued to receive the majority of votes. Secondly,
the Government will establish new structures of devolved government for
Northern Ireland only if they are acceptable to both parts of the community.
In October 1982 elections took place to a new 78-member Assembly, as a first
step in encouraging agreement on devolution. The Assembly may make
proposals for devolving powers on a basis which will command widespread
acceptance throughout the community. In the mean time, it performs scrutinis¬
ing and consultative functions: it has commented upon a large quantity of draft
legislation and initiated reports on such matters as industry and education.
However, some Assembly members have refused to take their seats.
The Government attaches considerable importance to co-operation with the
16

Human Rights
and Security
Policy
The Economy
Irish Republic. At a summit meeting in November 1984, the British Prime
Minister and the Taioseach (Irish Prime Minister) reaffirmed the determination
of both countries to work together against terrorism and to seek a solution to the
problems of Northern Ireland. An Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council meets
regularly at ministerial and official level to discuss matters of common interest.
Northern Ireland returns 17 members to the United Kingdom Parliament.
Since the present disturbances began, the Government has paid considerable
attention to protecting human rights in Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom
is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights and allows the
right ol individual petition. Legislation passed in 1973 outlaws discrimination
by public bodies, including the Government, on the grounds of religious belief or
political opinion. Discrimination in employment by both public and private
employers is also illegal and the Fair Employment Agency has been established
to investigate complaints and enforce fair practices. The independent Standing
Advisory Commission on Human Rights advises the Government on the
effectiveness of these measures and on other human rights issues.
While terrorism continues, certain emergency powers are in force. These
include special powers of arrest in respect of certain serious crimes; non-jury
courts to try those offences; and the proscription of organisations involved in
terrorism. There has been much concern, however, to reconcile these powers as
far as possible with respect for individual liberties: the measures are temporary,
need regular renewal by Parliament and have been subject to independent
review, most recently in 1984. Most traditional rights, including the freedom of
the media and the right to prosecute the security forces if they exceed their
authority, remain in force. There is also an independent police complaints
board. Northern Irelands legal system, and the safeguards it enshrines, is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales.
The use of violence as a means of overcoming political differences has been
condemned by the overwhelming majority of people living in Northern Ireland
and, although terrorism continues, the level of violence is much lower than some
years ago. The police take the primary role of maintaining order; the Army's task
is one of assisting the civil authorities, and the number of soldiers on service has
been considerably reduced. Security policy rests on the principle of fair and
effective enforcement of the law by bringing terrorists to justice through the
courts. They are tried for criminal offences and not for political beliefs. At the
heart of the policy is a determination to develop the effectiveness of the police to
the point where military involvement in the maintenance of law and order is no
longer needed.
The geography of Northern Ireland has played an important part in shaping its
economic development. A situation on the western edge of Europe, with few
indigenous mineral resources and only a small local market, has tended to
favour the concentration of industry and population on the eastern seaboard
close to trading links with the rest of the United Kingdom. Most of Northern
Ireland s trade is with, or through. Great Britain. With certain exceptions, the
parts of the region beyond the immediate influence of the industrialised area
around Belfast have stayed predominantly rural, with generally small and often
scattered communities relying mainly on farming.
Since the end of the second world war two dominant trends have been
apparent in the economy. First, employment in the traditionally important
industries (shipbuilding, linen and agriculture) has declined. Secondly, there
has been growth in the numbers seeking work, reflecting the relatively high rate
of natural increase of the population, which is only partly offset by migration. In
an effort to counterbalance these factors and to promote growth, programmes

within the broad framework of United Kingdom regional policy have been
carried out to develop infrastructure and attract investment from within the
country and from abroad. Despite the progress made many of Northern Ireland's
economic problems were intensified from around the mid-1970s. The impact of
the world-wide recession accelerated serious decline in existing industry and
adversely affected the flow of new inward investment.
Belfast has Britain’s largest shipyard, and other well-established industrial
activities include the manufacture of aircraft, textile machinery and a wide
range of engineering products, tobacco and clothing. There has also been
extensive development in vehicle components, oil-well equipment, electronic
instruments, telecommunications equipment, carpets and synthetic rubber. As
part of the Government’s industrial development policy, the promotion of small
firms is being encouraged to create new jobs in manufacturing, craft and service
businesses. The establishment of ‘enterprise zones' in Belfast and Londonderry
and the designation of Aldergrove airport as a freeport’ are expected to serve as
additional incentives to investment.
Agriculture (predominantly livestock and products) is still the most important
industry, accounting for almost a tenth of civil employment (including the
self-employed), over three times the proportion in Britain as a whole.
The world recession and the pace of technological change have led to rising
unemployment as in the rest of the country; the Northern Ireland unemploy¬
ment rate is persistently the highest of any of the standard regions. To meet this
special problem successive governments have offered more generous incentives
than are available in the rest of the country to encourage new investment both
from within Britain and from overseas, and assistance to mitigate high energy
costs. Northern Ireland’s productivity and industrial relations records compare
favourably with those in the country as a whole. Altogether more than 400
manufacturing projects which have been assisted are still in production,
including some 100 from outside Northern Ireland.
The modern diversification of the economy has helped to stimulate output,
productivity and incomes, and has assisted in narrowing the gap between living
standards in Northern Ireland and those in the rest of the United Kingdom.
Gross domestic product per person, which tends to be depressed in Northern
Ireland relative to the country as a whole as a result of higher unemployment,
lower activity rates and larger family sizes, has nonetheless risen from just
under two-thirds of the British average in 1963 to almost three-quarters.
Average earnings are more than nine-tenths of the national average.
The principle underlying Northern Ireland's financial relations with the rest of
the country is that it has parity, both of taxation and services, with England,
Scotland and Wales. To maintain social services at the level of those in Great
Britain, to meet the cost of security measures, and to compensate for the natural
disadvantages of geography and lack of resources, the United Kingdom
Government’s subvention to Northern Ireland in 1984—85 was nearly £1,400
million.
In day-to-day social life Northern Ireland is in many ways similar to the rest of
the United Kingdom. For thousands of visitors (940,000 in 1984), as well as for
local people. Northern Ireland’s landscape and natural features, its cultural
traditions and festivals continue to offer special attractions. For many North
Americans the land from which their forebears emigrated (a number of United
States presidents have been descended from Northern Ireland families) has a
unique interest. The story of this contribution to American life, the history of
Northern Ireland, and aspects of its culture—from the dialects and strong
literary tradition (poets like Louis MacNeice and Seamus Heaney have inter¬
national reputations) to the songs and dances and folk art—are recorded in the
18
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ulster-American Folk Park, the Ulster Museum and the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum.
The Arts Council of Northern Ireland is a major contributor to cultural life,
which encompasses classical and traditional music, literature and poetry,
drama, ballet and the visual arts. The annual Belfast Festival at Queen's
University is the second largest international festival in Britain. Among
musicians who have achieved international distinction are the flute-player
James Galway and the soprano Heather Harper.
The National Health Service provides both hospital and practitioner services,
and health and personal social services correspond fairly closely to those in the
rest of the United Kingdom, although the administrative framework is different.
While publicly maintained schools are open to children of all religions, in
practice, Protestants and Roman Catholics are for the most part educated in
separate schools. Efforts are made in the schools to promote greater under¬
standing and respect between Protestant and Roman Catholic children.
Contrary to developments in the rest of the United Kingdom, emphasis on the
comprehensive principle in secondary schools has been very small. Housing and
the improvement of the urban environment have presented significant problems
for the authorities but progress is being made, notably in Belfast where a
continuing rehabilitation programme is being carried out. Planning and
conservation arrangements are much like those in the rest of the country.
Distinctive local programmes are broadcast and there is a local press; national
radio and television networks are received, however, and the national press is
sold widely. Sport has an important role in the community, and many
world-class sportsmen and sportswomen have come from Northern Ireland.
Physical Features
Britain constitutes the greater part of the British Isles, a geographical term for a
group of islands lying off the north-west coast of mainland Europe. The largest
of the islands is Great Britain (the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland).
The next largest comprises Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south west are
the Isles of Scilly; off north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by
small islands and to the north east are the Orkneys and Shetlands. All these
have administrative ties with the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea
and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and France are largely
self-governing, and are not part of England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.
Britain s area is some 244,100 sq km (94,250 sq miles), of which nearly 99
per cent is land and the remainder inland water. This is about the same size as
the Federal Republic of Germany, New Zealand or Uganda, and half the size of
France. It is just under 1,000 km (some 600 miles) from the south coast to the
extreme north of Scotland and just under 500 km (some 300 miles) across in the
widest part. There are numerous bays and inlets and no place in Britain is as
much as 120 km (75 miles) from tidal water. The prime meridian of 0° passes
through the old observatory at Greenwich (London).
The seas surrounding the British Isles are shallow, usually less than 90 m (50
fathoms or 300 ft), because the islands lie on the continental shelf. To the north
west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly from 180 m (some
600 ft) to 900 m (about 3,000 ft). The shallow waters are important because
they provide breeding grounds for fish. The warming effect on the air of the
North Atlantic current is magnified as its water spreads across the shelf.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. The prevailing winds are
south-westerly and the weather from day to day is mainly influenced by
depressions moving eastwards across the Atlantic. The weather is subject to

frequent changes but to few extremes of temperature. It is rarely above 32°C
(90°F) or below -10°C (14°F). Near sea-level in the west the mean annual
temperature ranges from 8°C (46°F) in the Hebrides to 11°C (52°F) in the extreme
south west of England; latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the east. The
mean monthly temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetland), ranges
from 3°C (37°F) during the winter (December, January and February) to 11°C
(52°F) during the summer (June, July and August); the corresponding figures
for the Isle of Wight, in the extreme south, are 5°C (41°F) and 16°C (61°F). The
average annual rainfall is more than 1,600 mm (over 60 inches) in the
mountainous areas of the west and north but less than 800 mm (30 inches) over
central and eastern parts. Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the year,
but, on average, March to June are the driest months and September to January
the wettest. The distribution of sunshine shows a general decrease from south
to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with altitude. During
May, June and July (the months of longest daylight) the mean daily duration of
sunshine varies from five hours in northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of
Wight; during the months of shortest daylight (November, December and
January) sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of an hour a day in
northern Scotland and two hours a day on the south coast of England.
The Social Framework
The way of life of the people of Britain has been changing rapidly in the second
half of the twentieth century. As in many other countries underlying causes
include a lower birth rate, longer expectation of life, a higher divorce rate,
widening educational opportunities, technical progress and a higher standard
of living.
With 56-5 million people in 1984, Britain ranks about fifteenth in the world in
terms of population. This compares with 38-2 million in 1901, about 9 million at
the end of the seventeenth century and some 2 million at the end of the eleventh
century. Early figures are based on contemporary estimates, but from the
beginning of the nineteenth century relatively plentiful and reliable information
is available. Most of it comes from two main sources: the regular flow since 1837
of statistical information based on compulsory registration of births, marriages
and deaths, and the censuses taken regularly every ten years since 1801
(because of war there was no census in 1941). The most recent was in April
1981. After 1975 the population fell slightly for about three years, for the first
time (other than in war) since records began, reflecting a temporary decline in
the birth rate. Since then the upward trend has been resumed, except for a
slight decline in 1982. Projections for the future suggest that population growth
will take place at a low rate. Britain's total population is expected, on mid-1983
projections, to be 56-8 million in 1991, 57-7 million in 2001 and 58 million in
2011.
In 1984 there were 729,600 live births in Britain, 8,100 more than in 1983,
which outnumbered deaths (644,900) by 84,700. The total period fertility rate
(an indication of the average size of family) has, in general, been declining and in
1984 was 1 -77, which is below the level of 2-1 required for the replacement of the
population.
Several factors may have contributed to the relatively low birth rate.
Contraception has become more widespread and effective, making it easier to
plan families, and voluntary sterilisation of men and women has also become
more common. An appreciable proportion of pregnancies (in 1982 about 39 per
cent of those conceived outside marriage and 8 per cent of those conceived
within marriage) are ended by legal abortion.
20
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Mortality
Marriage and
Divorce
The postponement of conception within marriage coupled with a trend
towards later marriage has led to an increase, to 25, in the average age at which
women have their first child in marriage. Another feature is the current
preference for smaller families, especially two-children families, than in the past,
which has led to a signilicant decline in the proportion of families with four or
more children.
At birth the expectation of life for a man is about 70 years and for a woman 76
years compared with 49 years for men and 52 years for women in 1901. The
improving health of the population has mainly had the effect of increasing
young people’s chances of reaching the older age groups. Life expectancy in the
older age groups has increased relatively little.
The general death rate has remained about the same for the past 40 years, at
about 12 per 1,000 population. However, there has been a considerable decline
in mortality at most ages, particularly among children and young adults. The
infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under one year old per 1,000 live births)
was 10-2 in 1983; neonatal mortality (deaths of infants under four weeks old per
1,000 live births) was 5-9 in 1983: and maternal mortality is about 0-1 per 1,000
live births.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising
standards of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical
facilities, improved health measures, better working conditions, education in
personal hygiene, and the smaller size of families. Deaths resulting from
infectious diseases (notably tuberculosis) have virtually disappeared. Deaths
caused by circulatory diseases (including heart attacks and strokes) now
account for nearly half of all deaths, the next largest cause of death being cancer
(responsible for nearly one-quarter of deaths).
During the last 20 years there has been a marked change in the pattern of
marriage. In 1972 there were 480,300 marriages in Britain, but by 1982 the
number had declined to 387,000, with a subsequent increase to 395,800 in
1984. Of the population aged 16 or over in England and Wales in 1984, 61 per
cent were married, 25 per cent single, 9 per cent widowed and 5 per cent
divorced. The trend of the 1960s towards earlier marriage was reversed at the
beginning of the 1970s, since when there has been a slow increase in the
average age for first marriages, which in England and Wales is now nearly 26 for
men and nearly 24 for women. In 1984 remarriages (of one or both parties)
accounted for about 36 per cent of all marriages in England and Wales,
compared with about 20 per cent in 1971 and 15 per cent in 1961. Some 12 per
cent of all marriages in 1984 were remarriages where both partners had been
divorced.
The divorce rate has been increasing steadily and in 1984 about 12 decrees of
divorce were made absolute for every 1,000 married couples in England and
Wales, compared with two per 1,000 in 1961. The rates are lower in Scotland
and Northern Ireland. In 1984 about 144,500 divorces were granted in England
and Wales; the proportion granted to wives was about 71 per cent. The average
age of people at the time of divorce in England and Wales is now about 38 for
men and 36 for women.
Another feature, common to many other Western European countries, has
been a considerable increase in cohabitation. Nearly one-quarter of women in
Great Britain marrying during the period 1979-82 where the marriage was the
first for both parties had lived with their husbands before marriage (compared
with 8 per cent in the early 1970s) and about 12 per cent of non-married women
aged 18 to 49 were cohabiting during 1982-83. Cohabitation occurs more
irequently for separated or divorced women than for single women. There is

some evidence of a growing number of stable non-married relationships in that
half of illegitimate births (which now account for 17 per cent of live births in
Britain compared with 6 per cent in 1961) are registered by both parents.
Although the total population has remained relatively stable in the last decade,
there have been noticeable changes in the age and sex structure, including a
decline in the proportion of young people under 16 and an increase in the
proportion of elderly people, especially those aged 85 and over. The estimated
age distribution of the British population in mid-1984 was roughly as follows:
under 16 years, nearly 22 per cent; 16-64, 63 per cent; and 65 and over, 15 per
cent. Some 18 per cent of the population were over the normal retirement ages
(65 for men and 60 for women), compared with 15 per cent in 1961.
In mid-1984 there were an estimated 29 0 million females and 27.5 million
males in Britain, representing a ratio of over 105 females to every 100 males.
There are about 6 per cent more male than female births every year. Because of
the higher mortality of men at all ages, however, there is a turning point, at
about 51 years of age, at which the number of women exceeds the number of
men. This imbalance increases with age so that there is a preponderance of
women among the elderly.
The population density is about 231 per sq km, which is relatively high in
comparison with most other countries. England is the most densely populated
with 359 people per sq km (with Greater London having a density of 4,275
people per sq km), and Scotland the least densely populated with 65 people per
sq km, while Wales and Northern Ireland have 135 and 111 people per sq km
respectively.
Table 2 gives figures for some of Britain’s largest urban areas. About half of
the population lives in a belt across England, with south Lancashire and West
Yorkshire at one end, the London area at the other, and the industrialised
midlands at its centre. Other areas with large populations are: the central
lowlands of Scotland; north-east England from north of the river Tyne down to
the river Tees; south-east Wales: the Bristol area; and the English Channel coast
from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less densely populated areas are the eastern
fringes of England between the Wash and the Thames estuary, and the far south
west. The eight major metropolitan areas which have been denoted as
‘conurbations' in successive population censuses accommodate a third of Great
Britain’s people while comprising less than 3 per cent of the total land area. They
are: Greater London, Central Clydeside, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South
Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire. Most of the
mountainous parts, including much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
and the central Pennines, are very sparsely populated.
Since the nineteenth century there has been a general trend, especially in
London, for people to move away from the congested urban centres into the
suburbs. The 1981 census recorded that only in the remoter rural areas had the
rate of population growth been higher in the 1970s than in the 1960s. There has
also been a geographical redistribution of the population from Scotland and the
northern regions of England to East Anglia, the South West and the East
Midlands. Another feature has been an increase in the rate of retirement
migration, the main recipient areas (where in some towns the elderly can form
over one-third of the population) being the south coast of England and East
Anglia.
Migration
Traditionally, there is a net outflow of people from Britain to the rest ot the
world, but in 1984, when emigration was 11 per cent lower than in 1983, there

was a net inflow of 37,000.1 Between 1980 and 1984 some 1-07 million people
left Britain to live abroad and about 932.000 came from overseas to live in
Britain, so that net emigration reduced the population by about 138,000 Of the
164,000 departing residents in 1984, 18 per cent left for Australia, Canada or
New Zealand, 18 per cent for other Commonwealth countries, 17 per cent for the
United States, 16 per cent for other European Community countries and 12 per
cent for the Middle East. Of the 201,000 new residents, 14 per cent came from
Australia, Canada or New Zealand, 23 per cent from other Commonwealth
countries and 18 per cent from other European Community countries. A
significant number of those leaving or entering Britain were returning
migrants. ”
Nationality legislation is embodied in the British Nationality Act 1981 which
took effect from 1 January 1983. Under this Act, citizenship of the United
Kingdom and Colonies was replaced by three citizenships: British citizenship
for people closely connected with Britain, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of
Man: British Dependent Territories citizenship for people connected with the
dependencies: and British Overseas citizenship for those citizens of the United
Kingdom and Colonies who did not acquire either of the other citizenships With
one small exception, citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who had the
right of abode in Britain when the Act came into force acquired British
citizenship.
British citizenship is acquired automatically at birth by a child born in Britain
if his or her father or mother is a British citizen or is settled in Britain. A child
adopted in Britain by a British citizen is a British citizen. A child born abroad to
a British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or registered in Britain is a British
citizen by descent. The Act safeguards the citizenship of a child born abroad to a
British citizen in Crown service, certain related services, or in service under a
European Community institution. British citizenship may also be acquired by
registration by certain children born in Britain who do not automatically
acquire such citizenship at birth or born abroad to a parent who is a citizen by
descent: by British Dependent Territories citizens, British Overseas citizens.
International migration statistics exclude movements to and from the Irish Republic.

AND

PATTERN
British subjects under the Act (three very limited categories) and British
protected persons after five years’ residence in Britain (except for people from
Gibraltar, who may be registered without residence); and by naturalisation for
Commonwealth citizens, citizens of the Irish Republic, and foreign nationals.
The British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983 conferred British citizenship
(with effect from 1 January 1983) on those Falkland Islanders who did not
acquire it under the 1981 Act. For naturalisation, which is at the Home
Secretary’s discretion, five years’ residence, good character and sufficient
knowledge of English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic are required except for the
spouse of a British citizen, who needs only three years’ residence and no
language qualification. Most existing entitlements to registration (including
those for Commonwealth citizens and Irish citizens settled in Britain since
before 1973, and in certain circumstances that for women married to citizens of
the United Kingdom and Colonies before 1983) are preserved for five years from
1 January 1983. In 1984, 74,000 people acquired citizenship by naturalisation
and registration in Britain.
Immigration into the United Kingdom is controlled by the Immigration Act 1971
(as amended by the British Nationality Act 1981) and the Immigration Rules
made in accordance with the Act. British citizens and those Commonwealth
citizens who had the right of abode before 1 January 1983 (when the 1981 Act
came into force) have the right of abode and are exempt from immigration
control. Those who do not have this right require permission to enter and
remain in the United Kingdom, which is given in accordance with the rules.
These, which are approved by Parliament and which may be changed from time
to time, set out the requirements to be met by those seeking entry whether in a
temporary capacity, for example as students or visitors, or with the intention of
taking employment or setting up in business or for immediate settlement as the
dependants of a person already settled in the United Kingdom. A prior entry
clearance or visa obtained from the nearest British diplomatic post in a person's
home country is often required.
In accordance with the United Kingdom's obligations under the Treaty of
Rome, European Community nationals do not require entry clearances nor are
they subject to restrictions on their freedom to take or seek work. The United
Kingdom similarly respects its obligations under the United Nations Convention
and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.
In 1984, 51,000 people were accepted for settlement, some 2,500 fewer than in
1982. Over a third of these were from the South Asian sub-continent, although
in 1984 the level of immigration from countries in this region was the lowest
since control of Commonwealth citizens began in 1962. In the past ten years,
one-third of a million wives and children of men settled in the United Kingdom
have been accepted for settlement.
This section deals (to some extent in broad and informal terms) with social
developments affecting many sections of the population.
The majority of people (some 97 per cent) live in private households (in
families or on their own). The remainder include residents in hotels, and people
•in the armed services and in educational or other institutions. In 1983 about 78
per cent of people living in private households lived in a unit headed by a
married couple.
Among many changes in household and family structure is the continuing fall
in the average size of households in Great Britain from over four persons in 1911
to 3 09 in 1961 and 2-64 in 1983. The fall reflects a greater proportion of people
living on their own (8 per cent) or in one-parent families, the increasing number
of elderly people (more of whom are living alone), and the preferences of parents
24

Living
Standards
for smaller families. The trend towards smaller households (24 per cent of
households consist of one person) is expected to continue and the number of
one-person households is forecast to increase substantially in the next few
years.
A growing proportion of households, about 60 per cent, own or are buying their
own homes, owner-occupation being higher among married couples than for
single, divorced or widowed household heads. The number of owner-occupied
dwellings rose from over four million in 1951 to more than 13 million in 1983.
Four British households out of five live in houses rather than flats.
Nearly half of Britain's housing has been built since 1945. Recent housing
developments have been concentrated in suburban areas. Many families now
live in houses grouped in small terraces, or semi-detached or detached, usually
of two storeys with gardens, and providing two main ground-floor living rooms,
a kitchen, from two to four bedrooms, a bathroom, and one or two lavatories.
Originally, many houses were located in ‘ribbon development’ along main roads,
but in recent years housing estates have nearly always been sited away from
main roads. In inner urban areas slum clearance and redevelopment have been
major features of post-1945 public housing programmes. While high-rise flats
were popular in the 1960s and 1970s, the emphasis in new building is now on
low-rise, high-density designs, often incorporating gardens or patios.
Housing standards are continually improving; some 97 per cent of households
in Great Britain have exclusive use of a bath or shower, and a similar proportion
sole use of an inside lavatory (high percentages by international standards)
while 64 per cent have central heating.
An important influence on the planning of housing and services has been the
growth of car ownership; about 60 per cent of households have the use of at least
one car (or van), including 16 per cent with the use of two or more. Greater
access to motorised transport and the construction of a network of modern
trunk roads and motorways have resulted in a considerable increase in personal
mobility and changed leisure patterns, and have influenced the design of
housing estates and shopping areas. Most detached or semi-detached houses in
new suburban estates have garages, and out-of-town shopping centres, which
normally include large supermarkets, are usually planned for the motorist.
The growth in car ownership has brought very great benefits but also a
number of problems, notably, in many towns and cities, increased congestion,
noise and air pollution arising from motor vehicle emissions. Public transport,
too, has been affected, and many services have been reduced or withdrawn,
especially local bus and train services in rural areas. However, greater
competition in express coach services has resulted in more long-distance and
commuter coach services being provided.
There has been a steady reduction of the main atmospheric and freshwater
pollutants that have been of concern in the past, producing dramatic improve¬
ments in, for example, the quality of the air in cities and the condition of major
rivers, although various forms of pollution from traffic and industrial processes
remain a problem in some areas. There is a high degree of concern for the
environment, as shown by the growth in the number of organisations (especially
voluntary societies) concerned with conservation.
Marked improvements in the standard of living have taken place during the
twentieth century, but generally at a slower rate than in some other major
industrialised countries. Although gross domestic product (GDP) per head fell in
the early 1980s, Britain has experienced an economic recovery in the mid-
1980s, and GDP is now at a record level, having risen by 2-75 per cent in 1984.
Another feature of the economic improvement has been a substantial reduction
LAND AND PEOPLE
25
in inflation, which since January 1984 has ranged between about 4 and 7 per
cent a year, compared with an average annual increase of 13-6 per cent between
1973 and 1983.
Long-term trends in the pattern of expenditure show a substantial rise in
expenditure on housing, televisions, telephones, electrical and some other
durable goods, motor vehicles and entertainment, and in expenditure overseas.
As real incomes have risen, the share of expenditure on food has fallen. Unlike
many other countries, the share devoted to tobacco continues to decline; an
increasing number of people have stopped smoking for health reasons.
The general level of nutrition remains high. Over the last 20 years there have
been substantial rises in the consumption of poultry, instant coffee, pork,
margarine and processed (including frozen) vegetables, while home consump¬
tion per person of mutton and lamb, beef and veal, bread, potatoes, eggs, milk,
butter, sugar, tea and some other foods has fallen. However, another feature has
been an increase in the number of meals eaten away from home, either at work
or in restaurants, and a growth in the consumption of food from ‘take-away’ and
‘fast-food’ shops. In addition, in the 1960s and 1970s the proportion of
convenience foods eaten grew as women increasingly went out to work and had
less time to prepare meals, and as the variety of prepared foods rose in line with
the growth in ownership of refrigerators and freezers; there is some evidence of a
more recent return to fresh foods, as well as growth in the popularity of health
foods and slimming products.
Alcohol consumption has risen substantially since the 1950s and alcohol
abuse has become a growing problem although the level is well below that of
some other European Community countries. Beer remains much the most
popular alcoholic drink. A high proportion of beer is drunk in public houses
{‘pubs’), which are a traditional social centre for many people, and in clubs. A
notable development has been the increase in consumption of lager, now
estimated to account for about two-fifths of the beer consumed. Consumption of
light (table) wine has increased considerably in recent years, although there has
been little change in the consumption of higher strength wines such as sherry
and port. The pattern of spirits consumption has also been changing, with a
decline in the consumption of whisky and gin, and higher consumption of some
other spirits.
Ownership of many durable goods has been increasing and some goods, such
as televisions, vacuum cleaners and refrigerators, are available in more than 90
per cent of households. Of durable goods shown in the diagram on p 26,
ownership of telephones, freezers and central heating systems is growing most
rapidly; other durable goods which have grown in popularity include music
centres and other audio equipment, video recorders and home computers.
The pattern of employment has altered considerably in recent years, with a
substantial decline in employment in manufacturing industry being accom¬
panied by a long-term increase in the numbers employed in service industries. A
recent feature has been a rapid growth in the number of self-employed,
accounting in September 1984 for about 10 per cent of the workforce.
Unemployment, as in many other countries, has increased during the 1980s.
Earnings from employment are the main source of income for most people; in
1983 wages and salaries accounted for 62 per cent of household income. The
distribution of pre-tax income has remained relatively stable over a long period,
the lower 50 per cent of income earners accounting for some 22 to 24 per cent of
pre-tax income since 1949. However, the share of the top 1 per cent fell from 11
per cent in 1949 to 5-3 per cent in 1978—79, but increased to 6 per cent in
1981—82. Income before tax of the self-employed is less evenly distributed than
total income, mostly because of the very large incomes of a small number of
people, mainly professionals such as lawyers, accountants and doctors. The

(full or partial)
combined effect of the tax system and the receipt of benefits is to redistribute
incomes on a more equal basis.
Wealth is much less evenly distributed, with the top 1 per cent of the
population aged 18 or over owning about 21 per cent of marketable wealth, the
top 10 per cent having 56 per cent and the top 50 per cent having 96 per cent.
The inclusion of non-marketable' rights in occupational and state pension
schemes reduces these shares substantially to around 11, 34 and 80 per cent
respectively. Since the mid-1970s there has been little change in the distribu¬
tion of marketable wealth or in that of marketable wealth plus occupational and
state pension rights.
Considerable changes have occurred in the twentieth century in the economic
and domestic lives of women, due, in part, to the removal of almost all sex
discrimination in political and legal rights. At the heart of women’s changed role
has been the rise in the number of women, particularly married women, at work.
With later marriages and the availability of effective methods of family planning
there has been a decline in family size. Women as a result are involved in
child-bearing for a much shorter time and this, together with a variety of other
factors which have made housework less burdensome, has made it possible for
women with even young children to return to work.
Women comprise about two-fifths of the British labour force. Since the second
world war the proportion of married women who work has grown to 60 per cent
of those between the ages of 16 and 60, and they now make up some 27 per cent
of the labour force compared with 4 per cent in 1921. Many families have come
to rely on married women’s earnings as an essential part of their income. There
is still a significant difference between women’s and men’s earnings but the
equal pay legislation which came into force at the end of 1975 has narrowed the

gap. Women’s average hourly earnings, exclusive of overtime (for full-time
employees), increased from just under two-thirds of those of men in 1970, to
nearly three-quarters in 1984. Nevertheless, women's wages remain relatively
low because women tend to work in lowly paid sectors of the economy and they
work less overtime than men.
These changes have been significant, but, because tradition and prejudice can
still handicap women in their careers and personal lives, major legislation to
help to promote equality was passed in the 1970s.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970 as amended in 1984 (there is similar legislation
in Northern Ireland), women in Great Britain are entitled to equal pay with men
when doing work that is the same or broadly similar, or work which is of equal
value. The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 makes discrimination between men and
women unlawful in employment, education, training and the provision of
housing, goods, facilities and services. Discriminatory advertisements which
breach the Act are also unlawful. (Northern Ireland has similar legislation.) In
most cases complaints of discrimination may be taken before the county courts
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, or the sheriff courts in Scotland;
complaints concerning employment are dealt with by industrial tribunals. The
Equal Opportunities Commission was set up in 1975 (1976 in Northern Ireland
under separate legislation) to enforce the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equal
Pay Act. Its aims are to eliminate sex discrimination and promote equal
opportunities. The Commission advises people of their rights under both Acts
and may give financial or other assistance to help individuals to conduct a case
before a court or tribunal. It also has power to conduct investigations and to
issue notices requiring discriminatory practices to stop. In addition, it keeps
legislation under review and may submit proposals for amending it to the
ministers concerned. The Commission also seeks to make women more aware of
the opportunities available to them and in 1984 conducted a year-long
campaign. Women into Science and Engineering—WISE '84—designed to
encourage more women and girls to take up careers in these areas.
Britain has a long history of accommodating minority groups and in the last
three hundred years or so a variety of people have settled in the country, some to
avoid political or religious persecution, others seeking a better way of life or an
escape from poverty.
The Irish have long made homes in Britain, and comprise the largest single
minority group. Many Jewish refugees started a new life in the country towards
the end of the nineteenth century and in the 1930s, and after 1945 large-
numbers of other European refugees settled in Britain. The large communities
from the West Indies and South Asian sub-continent date from the 1950s and
early 1960s. There are also sizeable groups of Americans, Australians, Chinese
and various European communities such as Greek and Turkish Cypriots,
Italians and Spaniards. More recently Ugandan Asians and refugees from
Indo-China have settled in Britain.
In 1983, according to the results of a sample survey, the non-white population
of Great Britain was about 2-3 million (just over 4 per cent of the total
population) of whom over 40 per cent were born in Britain. Most of them share
aspirations that are broadly similar to those of the British community as a whole
and they enjoy full political and civic rights. Although the circumstances of
many members of the ethnic minority communities are less fortunate than
those of other groups (for example, they suffer disproportionately from
unemployment and often live in poor housing in the older urban areas) there
have been important advances over the last 20 years in employment and housing
conditions, and many individuals have achieved distinction in their careers and

in public life. The growth of Asian businesses has been a particularly noticeable
development and there are numerous examples of enterprise among minorities
to organise self-help.
The difficulties minorities face are being alleviated by continuous social
programmes, some of which benefit the whole community, while other projects,
for example, in education and health, are directed towards meeting the
minorities’ special needs. Although fewer children than formerly go to school
with no knowledge of English, there are still many who have an insufficient
grasp of the language. Language teaching is recognised to be of prime
importance and additional teachers are appointed to schools with ethnic
minorities. For adults, classes at or outside their place of work are run by local
authorities and voluntary organisations. Government grants are available to
authorities with substantial ethnic minority groups towards the salaries of extra
staff such as teachers, health visitors and interpreters.
The welfare of ethnic minorities and good relations between minorities and
the local community are promoted by community relations councils and other
voluntary bodies. In recognition of the tensions that can arise between the police
and ethnic minorities, consultation between the police and the community has
been made a statutory requirement and consultative committees have been set
up in many areas. Policies for promoting equality of opportunity in a multiracial
society in which all citizens receive equal respect are pursued against a
background of legislation against discrimination.
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes discrimination unlawful on grounds of
colour, race or ethnic or national origin in the provision of goods, facilities and
services, in employment, training and related matters, in education, in housing
and in advertising. It strengthened legislation passed in 1968 which, in turn,
widened the scope of the first race relations legislation enacted in 1965; it also
strengthened the criminal law on incitement to racial hatred.
The 1976 Act brought the law against racial discrimination into line with that
against sex discrimination (see p 27), and gave complainants direct access to
civil courts and, in the case of employment complaints, to industrial tribunals.
The Commission for Racial Equality was established by the Race Relations Act
1976 with statutory duties to work towards the elimination of discrimination
and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between people of
different racial groups. It has power to investigate unlawful discriminatory
practices and to issue non-discrimination notices, enforceable in the courts,
requiring that such practices should cease. It has an important educational role
and has issued a code of practice in employment. It is also the principal source of
advice for the general public about the Race Relations Act and has discretion to
assist individuals with their complaints.
The Commission supports the work of the 100 or so community relations
councils, which are independent, voluntary bodies set up in most areas with a
significant ethnic minority population to promote harmonious community
relations at the local level. It makes grants towards the salaries of the community
relations officers employed by the councils, most of whom also receive funds
from their local authorities, and gives grants to ethnic minority self-help groups
and to other projects run by or for the benefit of the minority communities.
Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend it
and higher real incomes than had previous generations. Agreed hours of
full-time work are usually from 35 to 40 hours a week, although many people
actually work somewhat longer because of voluntary overtime. A large majority of
employees work a five-day week.
LAND AND PEOPLE
29
The most common leisure activities are home based, or social, with visiting or
entertaining relatives or friends and watching television among the most
popular. Watching television is the main evening pastime for all except young
men. Nearly all households have a television set and in winter the population
aged five and over spend on average over 20 hours a week watching
programmes. Growing numbers are using video recorders to watch programmes
at times other than their transmission; 24 per cent of households had a video
recorder in 1983. Other popular pursuits include: listening to the radio, records
or cassettes; reading; do-it-yourself home improvements such as house painting
and decorating; going out for a meal or for a drink or to the cinema or to watch a
sporting event; gardening; outings (such as visits to the countryside, seaside or
to museums); photography; visits to social clubs and leisure centres; and social
and voluntary work. About half the households in Britain have a pet, the most
common being dogs (of which there are thought to be about 6 million in Britain)
and cats (over 5 million).
Sports and other pastimes have grown in popularity, reflected by increasing
membership of the main organisations concerned with outdoor activities,
although for some sports, such as football, the number of spectators has been
declining. Walking is the most popular sporting activity and is equally
undertaken by men and women. Billiards/snooker and darts are the next most
popular sports among men, followed by swimming and football, while swimming
is the second most popular sporting activity for women, although an increasing
number of women are participating in aerobics (keep-fit exercises) and yoga.
Holiday entitlements have increased for most full-time employees, and by the
end of 1983 some 95 per cent of manual workers had a basic holiday entitlement
of four weeks or more and 18 per cent five weeks or more. The number of
holidays (of four or more nights) taken by British residents was 49 million in
1984 compared with 47 million in 1974; 15 million of these were taken abroad,
well over half involving ‘package' arrangements. More than four-fifths of
overseas holidays were taken in other European countries, with Spain being the
most popular destination; it received almost one-third of all British holiday¬
makers abroad. The next most popular destinations were France, Greece, Italy,
the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria. The main holiday period is May to
September when over 80 per cent of holidays in Britain and 70 per cent of
holidays abroad are taken. An increasing number of people (20 per cent in 1984)
take more than one main holiday each year, but a significant proportion take no
holiday away from home.
2 Government
The United Kingdom constitution, unlike that of most other countries, is not
contained in any single document. Formed partly by statute, partly by common
law and partly by convention, it can be altered by Act of Parliament, or by general
agreement to create, vary or abolish a convention. The constitution thus adapts
readily to changing political conditions and ideas.
The organs of government are clearly distinguishable although their functions
often intermingle and overlap. The legislature, Parliament, is the supreme
authority. The executive consists of: (1) the Government—Cabinet and other
ministers who are responsible for initiating and directing national policy;
(2) government departments, which are responsible for national administration;
(3) local authorities, which administer and manage many local services; and
(4) public corporations responsible for operating particular nationalised indus¬
tries or, for example, a social or cultural service, subject to ministerial control in
varying degrees. The judiciary determines common law and interprets statutes,
and is independent of both legislature and executive.
The Monarchy
The British people look to the Queen not only as their head of State, but also as
the symbol of their nation's unity. The monarchy is the most ancient secular
institution in the United Kingdom. During the last thousand years its
continuity has only once been broken (by the establishment of a republic which
lasted from 1649 to 1660) and, despite interruptions in the direct line of
succession, the hereditary principle upon which it was founded has always been
preserved. The royal title in the United Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the
Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of
Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender
of the Faith'. The form of the royal title is varied for those other member states of
the Commonwealth of which the Queen is head of State,1 to suit the particular
circumstances of each. Other member states are republics or have their own
monarchies.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-Governor. In the
other member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is head of
State, her representative is the Governor-General appointed by her on the advice
of the ministers of the country concerned and completely independent of the
United Kingdom Government.
In the United Kingdom dependencies the Queen is usually represented by
governors, who are responsible to the British Government for the good
government of the countries concerned.
Succession, The title to the Crown derives partly from statute and partly from common law
Accession and rules of descent. Lineal Protestant descendants of a granddaughter of James I of
Coronation England and VI of Scotland (Princess Sophia, the Electress of Hanover) are alone
eligible to succeed, and although succession is not bound to continue in its

Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Fiji, Grenada, Jamaica, Mauritius, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.

present line, it can be altered only by common consent of the member nations of
the Commonwealth of which the Queen is Sovereign.
The sons of the Sovereign have precedence over the daughters in succeeding
to the throne. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant, and the
powers of the Crown are vested in her as though she were a king. While the
consort of a king takes her husband’s rank and style, the constitution does not
give any special rank or privileges to the husband of a Queen-Regnant although
in practice he fills an important role in the life of the nation, as does the Duke of
Edinburgh.
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as soon as his or her predecessor dies
and there is no interregnum. He or she is at once proclaimed at an Accession
Council to which all members of the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords
Spiritual and Temporal (see p 36), the Lord Mayor and Aldermen and other
leading citizens of the City of London are also invited.
The Sovereign s coronation follows the accession after a convenient interval. It
is a ceremony which has remained essentially the same for over a thousand
years, even if details have often been modified to conform to the customs of the
time. It takes place at Westminster Abbey in London in the presence of
representatives ol the Houses of Parliament and of all the great public interests
of the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other
Commonwealth nations, and of representatives of other countries.
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she is head of the executive, an integral
part of the legislature, head of the judiciary, the commander-in-chief of all armed
forces of the Crown and the ‘supreme governor' of the established Church of
England. As a result of a long process of evolution, during which the monarchy’s
absolute power has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the advice of
her ministers, which she cannot ignore. The United Kingdom is governed by Her
Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a trend during the past hundred years
towards assigning powers directly to ministers, there are still important acts of
government which require the participation of the Queen. These include
summoning, proroguing (discontinuing until the next session without disso¬
lution) and dissolving Parliament; giving royal assent to Bills passed by
Parliament; appointing many important office holders, including government
ministers, judges, officers in the armed forces, governors, diplomats and
bishops and some other senior clergy of the Church of England: conferring
peerages, knighthoods and other honours1; and remitting all or part of the
penalty imposed on a person convicted of a crime. An important function is
appointing the Prime Minister and by convention the Queen invites the leader of
the political party which commands a majority in the House of Commons to form
a government. In international affairs, the Queen as head of State has the power
to declare war and make peace, to recognise foreign states and governments, to
conclude treaties and to annexe or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (as when appointing the Prime Minister), those acts
involving the use of ‘royal prerogative' powers are nowadays performed by
government ministers who are responsible to Parliament and can be questioned
about a particular policy. It is not necessary to have Parliament s authority to
exercise these powers, although Parliament has the power to restrict or abolish a
prerogative right.
Ministerial responsibility in no way detracts from the importance of the
Queen s role in the smooth working of government. She holds meetings of the

are conferred on her personal selection—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the
Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.

Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and other officials at home and
overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs
innumerable state papers; she must be informed and consulted on every aspect
of national life; and she must show complete impartiality.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made for a regent to be appointed to perform them should the Queen be
totally incapacitated. The regent would be the Queen’s eldest son, the Prince of
Wales, then those in succession to the throne who are of age. In the event of the
Queen s partial incapacity or absence abroad, there is provision for appointing
Counsellors of State (the Duke of Edinburgh, the four adult persons next in line
of succession, and the Queen Mother) to whom the Queen may delegate certain
royal functions. However, Counsellors of State may not, for instance, dissolve
Parliament (except on the Queen’s express instructions), or create peers.
Ceremonial has always been associated with British kings and queens, and, in
spite of the change in the outlook of both the Sovereign and the people, many
traditional customs and ceremonies are retained. Royal marriages and royal
funerals are marked by public ceremony, and the Sovereign’s, birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the Colour on Horse Guards Parade.
State banquets take place when a foreign monarch or head of State visits
Britain; investitures are held at Buckingham Palace to bestow honours; and
royal processions add significance to such occasions as a State opening of
Parliament, when the Queen drives from Buckingham Palace to Westminster.
Each year the Queen and other members of the royal family visit many parts of
the United Kingdom. Their presence at scientific, artistic, industrial and
charitable events of national and local importance encourages nationwide
interest and publicity. The Queen pays state visits to foreign governments,
accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh. She also undertakes lengthy tours in
the other countries of the Commonwealth. Other members of the royal family
pay official visits overseas, occasionally representing the Queen, and often in
connection with an organisation or a cause with which they are associated.
About 85 per cent of all expenditure arising from the royal family's official duties
is met by public departments. This includes the costs of the royal yacht, the
Queen’s Flight, travel by train and the upkeep of the royal palaces. Apart from
this the Queen’s public expenditure on staff and expenses incurred in carrying
out official duties as head of State is financed from the Civil List, approved by
Parliament. (In 1985 this was £3-98 million.) Her private expenditure as
Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, which is supplied mainly from the
revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster1; and her personal expenditure as a private
individual from her own personal resources. There are annual allowances
approved by Parliament to other members of the royal family, though not to the
Prince of Wales, who as Duke of Cornwall is entitled to the net revenue of the
estate of the Duchy of Cornwall (he voluntarily surrenders a quarter of the
revenue to the Exchequer). The Queen pays into the Exchequer a sum
equivalent to that provided by Parliament in respect of certain members of the
royal family.
Parliament
Parliament is the supreme legislative authority. Its three elements, the Queen,
the House of Lords and the elected House of Commons, are outwardly separate.
The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed by the
reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and is separately
administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy.
GOVERNMENT
35
The Functions
of Parliament
The Meeting of
Parliament
are constituted on different principles, and meet together only on occasions of
symbolic significance such as the State opening of Parliament when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making
body, however, Parliament usually requires the concurrence of all its parts.
Parliament can legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole, for any of the
constituent parts of the country separately, or for any combination of them. It
can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which are Crown
dependencies and not part of the United Kingdom, having subordinate
legislatures which make laws on island affairs.1
Free from any legal restraints imposed by a written constitution. Parliament is
able to legislate as it pleases: generally to make, unmake, or alter any law: to
legalise past illegalities and make void and punishable what was lawful when
done and thus reverse the decisions of the ordinary courts; and to destroy
established conventions or turn a convention into binding law. It can prolong its
own life beyond the normal period without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however. Parliament does not assert its supremacy in this way. Its
members bear in mind the common law and have tended to act in accordance
with precedent and tradition. The validity of an Act of Parliament which has
been duly passed, promulgated and published cannot be disputed in the law
courts, but no Parliament would be likely to pass an Act which it knew would
receive no public support. The system of party government helps to ensure that
Parliament legislates with its responsibility to the electorate in mind.
As a member of the European Community, the United Kingdom recognises the
various types of Community legislation, and sends 81 elected members to the
European Parliament.
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws, (2) to provide, by voting
taxation, the means of carrying on the work of government, and (3) to scrutinise
government policy and administration, particularly proposals for expenditure.
In discharging these functions Parliament helps to bring the relevant facts and
issues before the electorate. By custom. Parliament is also consulted before the
ratification of all important international treaties and agreements, the making
of treaties being, in theory at least, a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of
the Government and not subject to parliamentary approval.
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five years, but is often dissolved and a
general election held before the end of this term. The maximum life has been
prolonged by legislation in such rare circumstances as the two world wars.
Dissolution and writs for a general election are ordered by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions. Each usually lasts for one
year—beginning and ending most often in October or November and inter¬
spersed with ‘adjournments' at night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the late (English) Spring Bank Holiday and during a long summer recess
starting in late July or early August. The average number of 'sitting' days in a
session is about 175 in the House of Commons and about 150 in the House of
Lords. At the start of each session the Queen’s speech to Parliament outlines the
Government’s broad policies and proposed legislative programme. Each session
is terminated by prorogation. Parliament then ‘stands prorogued' until the new
session opens (on occasions Parliament has been dissolved without proro-

affairs, to scrutinise each legislative measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.

gation). A short speech is made on behalf of the Queen summarising
Parliament s work during the past session. An adjournment does not affect
uncompleted business, but prorogation terminates nearly all parliamentary
business, so that all public Bills not completed lapse, and must be reintroduced
in the next session unless they are to be abandoned.
The House of
Lords
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The
Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of
London, Durham and Winchester, and the 21 senior diocesan bishops of the
Church of England. The Lords Temporal consist of (1) all hereditary peers and
peeresses of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who
have not disclaimed their peerages, (2) all life peers and peeresses, and (3) those
Lords of Appeal (‘law lords') created life peers to assist the House in its judicial
duties. Hereditary peerages carry a right to sit in the House (subject to certain
disqualifications), provided the holder is 21 years of age or over, but anyone
succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months of succession, disclaim that
peerage for his or her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their right to sit in the House
but gain the right to vote at parliamentary elections and to offer themselves for
election to the House of Commons.
Temporal peerages, both hereditary and life, are conferred on the advice of the
Prime Minister. They are usually granted either in recognition of service in
politics or other walks of life or because the Government of the day wishes to
have the recipient in the House of Lords. The House also provides a place in
Parliament for men and women whose advice is useful to the State, but who do
not wish to be involved in party politics.
In mid-1985 there were 1,162 members of the House of Lords, including the
two archbishops and 24 bishops. The Lords Temporal consisted of 762
hereditary peers who had succeeded to their titles, 31 hereditary peers who have
had their titles conferred on them (including the Prince of Wales), and 343 life
peers, of whom 20 were law lords . Of the total, 100 peers were not in receipt of a
writ of summons and 144 peers were on leave of absence from the House (see
below). Of the 117 Irish peers 47 were entitled to sit in the House of Lords
because they were holders of an English, Scottish or United Kingdom peerage.
Other Irish peerages which pre-date the union of Great Britain and Ireland in
1800 do not entitle their holders to membership of the House of Lords.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the House of Lords attend the sittings.1 Peers
who Irequently attend the House (the average daily attendance is about 320)
include elder statesmen and others who have spent their lives in public service.
They receive no salary for their parliamentary work, but can recover expenses
incurred in attending the House and certain travelling expenses (for which there
are maximum daily rates).
The House is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who takes his place on the
woolsack2 as ex-officio Speaker of the House. In his absence his place may be
taken by a deputy speaker, a deputy chairman or, if neither is present, by a
speaker chosen by the Lords present. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord
Chairman of Committees, who is appointed at the beginning of each session and
takes the chair in all committees, unless the House decides otherwise. The Lord
Chairman and the Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees are salaried
officers of the House.
1 Some hereditary peers do not establish their claim to succeed and so do not receive a writ of
summons entitling them to sit in the House. Lords may apply for leave of absence for the
duration, or for the remainder, of a Parliament.
2 The woolsack is a seat in the form of a large cushion stuffed with wool from several
Commonwealth countries: it is a relic from the medieval period when wool was the greatest source
of the country’s wealth.

The House of
Commons
Parliamentary
Electoral
System
The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments who is respon¬
sible for the records of proceedings, including judgments, and for the
promulgation of Acts of Parliament, and who is also the accounting officer for
money voted to the House; the other Clerks at the Table who, with the Clerk of
the Parliaments and the other officers and officials of the House, are collectively
known as the Parliament Office; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who is
also Serjeant at Arms in attendance upon the Lord Chancellor and is responsible
for security and for accommodation and services in the House of Lords’ part of
the Palace of Westminster; and the Yeoman Usher who is Deputy Serjeant at
Arms and assists Black Rod in his duties.
The House of Commons is elected by universal adult suffrage and consists of 650
members of Parliament (MPs). At present 25 are women. Of the 650 seats, 523
are for England, 38 for Wales, 72 for Scotland, and 17 for Northern Ireland.
General elections are held after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Queen. When an MP dies or resigns1 or is given a peerage, a
by-election takes place. Members are paid an annual salary of £17,702 (from
January 1986) and an allowance of £13,211 for secretarial and research
expenses. They also have a number of other allowances, including travel
allowances, a supplement for London members and, for provincial members,
subsistence allowances. (For ministers’ salaries, see p 49.)
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, elected by MPs to
preside over the House. Other officers are the Chairman of Ways and Means, and
two deputy chairmen who act as Deputy Speakers, elected by the House on the
nomination of the Government. They, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote
other than in their official capacity. The House is administered by a Commission
chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs) include the Clerk of the House of
Commons, who is the principal adviser to the Speaker of the House on its
privileges and procedures; his department has responsibilities relating to the
conduct of the business of the House and its many committees. The Clerk is also
accounting officer for the House. The Serjeant at Arms, who waits upon the
Speaker, carries out certain orders of the House, is the official housekeeper of
the Commons part of the building, and is responsible for its security. Other
officers serve the House in the Library, the Department of the Official Report
(Hansard), the Administration Department and the Refreshment Department.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies, each
of which returns one member to the House of Commons. To ensure equitable
representation four permanent Boundary Commissions, one each for England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, make periodic reviews of constituencies
and recommend any redistribution of seats that may seem necessary in the light
of population movements or other changes. Their last recommendations were
submitted to Parliament in 1982—83 and formed the basis for the constituencies
in the 1983 general election.
Elections are by secret ballot. British citizens and citizens of other Common¬
wealth countries, together with citizens of the Irish Republic, may vote provided
they are aged 18 or over, resident in the United Kingdom, registered in the
annual register of electors for the constituency and not subject to any
disqualification. People not entitled to vote include members of the House of
Lords, patients detained under mental health legislation, sentenced prisoners
1 An MP who wishes to resign from the House can do so only by using the technical device of
applying for an office under the Crown (Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds or Steward of the Manor
of Northstead), ancient offices which disqualify the holder from membership of the House but
which carry no salary and have no responsibilities.

and people convicted within the previous five years of corrupt or illegal election
practices. Service voters (members of the armed forces and their spouses. Crown
servants and staff of the British Council employed overseas, together with their
wives or husbands if accompanying them) may be registered for an address in a
constituency where they would live but for their service.
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in person at a polling station. Service
voters resident abroad and merchant seamen may vote by proxy or, if in the
United Kingdom at the time of the election, by post. Electors who are physically
incapacitated or unable to vote in person because of the nature of their work are
also entitled to vote by post.
Voting is not compulsory: nearly 73 per cent of a total electorate of some 42
million people voted in the general election of June 1983. The candidate who
polls the most votes in a constituency is elected.
British citizens and citizens of other Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand and be elected as MPs provided they are
aged 21 or over and are not subject to any disqualification. Those disqualified
include undischarged bankrupts, people sentenced to more than one year’s
imprisonment, clergy of the Church of England, Church of Scotland, Church of
Ireland and Roman Catholic Church, peers, and holders of certain offices listed
in the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975. The latter include holders
of judicial office, civil servants, some local government officers, members of the
regular armed forces, or the police service, some members of public corporations
and government commissions, and in addition British members of the
legislature of any country or territory outside the Commonwealth. A candidate’s
nomination for election must be signed by two electors as proposer and
seconder, and by eight other electors registered in the constituency. He or she
does not require any party backing. A candidate must also deposit £150, which
is forfeited if his or her votes do not exceed 12-5 per cent of those validly cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend on an election campaign is £2,700
plus 2-3 pence for each elector in a borough constituency or 3-1 pence for each
elector in a county constituency. A candidate may post an election address to
each elector in the constituency, free of charge. All election expenses, apart from
the candidate’s personal expenses, are subject to the statutory limit.
The Representation of the People Act 1985 will extend (from February 1987)
the franchise to many British citizens resident abroad and enable holiday¬
makers unable to vote in person to apply for a postal or proxy vote; it increased
(from October 1985) the deposit at parliamentary elections from £150 to £500
while lowering the threshold for forfeiting the deposit from 12.5 to 5 per cent of
the votes cast.
The party system, existing in one form or another since the eighteenth century,
is an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system relies heavily upon the existence of organised political
parties, each laying policies before the electorate for approval. The parties are
not registered or formally recognised in law, but in practice most candidates in
elections, and almost all winning candidates, belong to one of the main parties.
For the last 150 years a predominantly two-party system has operated, and
since 1945 either the Conservative Party, which can trace its origins to the
eighteenth century, or the Labour Party, which emerged in the last decade of the
nineteenth century, have held power. The Liberal Party, which last formed a
government on its own in 1906-16, can also trace its origins to the eighteenth
century, while the Social Democratic Party was formed in 1981 and made an
alliance with the Liberal Party in the same year. Other parties include two
nationalist parties. Plaid Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and the Scottish
National Party (founded in 1934). In Northern Ireland there are a number of
GOVERNMENT
39
parties; the largest of those represented in the House of Commons are the Ulster
Unionist Party, formed in the early part of this century, and the Democratic
Unionist Party, founded in 1971 by a group which broke away from the Ulster
Unionists.
The percentages of votes cast for the main political parties in the general
election of June 1983 and the resulting distribution of seats in the House of
Commons are given in Table 3.

The party which wins most seats (although not necessarily the most votes) at a
general election, or which has the support of a majority of members in the House
of Commons, usually forms the Government. By tradition, the leader of the
majority party is asked by the Sovereign to form a government; and about 100 of
its members in the House of Commons and the House of Lords receive
ministerial appointments (including appointment to the Cabinet—see p 49) on
the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the official
Opposition with its own leader and ‘shadow cabinet’.
Leaders of the Government and Opposition sit on the front benches of the
Commons with their supporters (the back-benchers) sitting behind them.
Similar arrangements for the parties also apply to the House of Lords; however.
Lords who do not wish to be associated with either the Government or the
Opposition may sit on the ‘cross-benches'. The effectiveness of the party system
in Parliament rests largely on the relationship between the Government and the
opposition parties. Depending on the relative voting strengths of the parties in
the House of Commons, the Opposition might seek to overthrow the Govern¬
ment by securing its defeat on a matter of confidence’. In general, however, its
40

aims are to contribute to the formulation of policy and legislation by
constructive criticism; to oppose government proposals that it considers
objectionable; to secure concessions on government Bills; and to increase public
support and enhance its chances of electoral success.
The detailed arrangements of government business are settled, under the
direction of the Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two Houses, by the Chief
Government Whips in consultation with the Chief Opposition Whips. The Chief
Whips together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often referred to when the
question of finding time for debating some particular issue is discussed. The
Leaders of the two Houses are primarily responsible for the direction of business
and for providing facilities for the Houses to debate matters about which they
are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the party’s
voting strength by ensuring that members attend important debates, and
conveying to the party leadership the opinions of back-bench members. The
importance a party attaches to a vote on a particular issue is indicated to the
MPs by the underlining (once, twice or three times) on the notice sent to them;
failure to comply with a ‘three-line whip’ is usually seen as rebellion against the
party’s policy. Party discipline tends to be less strong in the Lords than in the
Commons.
The Chief Government Whip in the Commons is Parliamentary Secretary to
the Treasury; of the other Government Whips, three (one of whom is Deputy
Chief Whip) are officers of the Royal Household, five hold titular posts as Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury and five are Assistant Whips. Salaries are also
paid to the Chief Opposition Whips in both Houses and to two of the Opposition
Assistant Whips in the Commons. The Government Whips in the Lords hold
offices in the Royal Household and act as government spokesmen.
Annual assistance from public funds helps opposition parties to carry out
their parliamentary work at Westminster. It is limited to parties which had at
least two members elected at the previous general election or one member elected
and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The amount is: £1,500 for every seat won
plus £3 for every 200 votes, up to a maximum of £450,000. Since 1945 there
have been six Conservative and six Labour Governments and the great majority
of members of the House of Commons have represented either the Conservative
or the Labour Party.
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom and precedent, partly formulated
in standing orders governing details of practice in each House. The system of
debate is much the same in the two Houses: the subject originates in the form of
a motion (a proposal made by a member in order to elicit a decision from the
House). When a motion has been moved, the Speaker proposes the question as
the subject of debate. At the end of each debate the question is decided by a vote
on a simple majority. The main difference between the two Houses is that in the
Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no authority to check or curtail debate,
such matters being decided by the general sense of the House, whereas in the
Commons the Speaker has full authority to give effect, promptly and decisively,
to the rules and orders of the House. The Speaker of the Commons must guard
against abuse of procedure or infringement of minority rights; has discretion to
allow or disallow a closure motion (to end discussion so that the matter may be
put to the vote); and has powers to check irrelevance and repetition in debate,
and to save time in other respects. In cases of grave disorder the House can be
adjourned or the sitting suspended by the Speaker. Voting in the Commons is

ASPECTS OF FAMINE RELIEF
British emergency aid to alleviate
the devastating famine in Ethiopia
and Sudan has totalled some £75
million since late 1984. Relief
operations include the use of
Hercules aircraft, which, by
August 1985, had ferried over
16,000 tonnes of supplies (of a
total of 92,000 tonnes of British
food aid), either to inland airstrips
or by air drop in remote areas.
Live Aid, a concert which took
place in London and
Philadelphia, was a focus of
public response to the disaster.
One of the largest rock concerts
ever staged, it was transmitted to
a world-wide audience of 1,500
million people, and raised an
estimated £50 million, including
some £20 million in Britain, for
the famine victims.

GOVERNMENT

Legislative
Proceedings
under the direction of the Speaker, whose duty it is to pronounce the final
result. In the event of a tied vote the Speaker gives the casting vote, but only in
accordance with established conventions which preclude an expression of
opinion on the merits of the question.
The voting procedure in the House of Lords is similar to that in the Commons,
except that the Speaker or chairman has an original, but no casting, vote. Bills
and subordinate legislation are in general allowed to proceed in the form before
the House unless a majority votes to reject or amend them; on other motions the
question is decided in the negative unless there is a majority in favour. When the
House is sitting judicially (the Lords is the final court of appeal for civil cases in
Britain and for criminal cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) the
judgment under appeal is not changed if the votes are equal.
The Commons has a public register of MPs’ financial interests. Members with
a relevant pecuniary interest in a matter before the House, direct or indirect,
must declare it when taking part in a debate, though to operate as a
disqualification from voting the interest must be direct, immediate and
personal. In any other proceedings of the House or in transactions with other
members or with ministers or civil servants, MPs must also disclose any relevant
financial interest or benefit.
Proceedings of both Houses are public, except on extremely rare occasions; the
minutes (in the Commons called Votes and Proceedings and in the Lords,
Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The Official Report of Parliamentary
Debates, Hansard) are published daily. The records of the Lords from 1497 and
of the Commons from 1547, together with the parliamentary and political
papers of certain past members of the Houses, are available to the public in the
House of Lords Record Office. Parliament is not normally televised, but
proceedings are recorded and sound transmissions of some are made on
television and radio, either live or recorded. A Parliamentary Sound Archive has
been established. Debates on televising proceedings have taken place on several
occasions and in January 1985 a six-month broadcasting experiment in the
Lords was introduced.
The law undergoes constant reform in the courts as established principles are
interpreted, clarified or reapplied to meet new circumstances, but substantial
changes are the responsibility of Parliament and the Government through the
normal legislative process.
A draft law takes the form of a parliamentary Bill. Most Bills are public Bills
involving measures relating to public policy, but there are also private Bills
which deal solely with matters of individual, corporate or local interest. Public
Bills can be introduced, in either House, by a government minister or by a
‘private’ member. Most public Bills that become law are in practice sponsored by
the Government.
Before a government Bill is finally drafted, there is normally considerable
consultation with professional bodies, voluntary organisations and other
agencies interested in the subject matter, such as major interest and pressure
groups which aim to promote a specific cause. Proposals for legislative changes
are sometimes set out in government ‘White Papers’ which may be debated in
Parliament before a Bill is introduced. From time to time consultative
documents, sometimes called ‘Green Papers’, set out for public discussion
government proposals which are still at a formative stage.
Bills must, in principle, be passed by each House. As a rule government Bills
likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons before the Lords,
while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature often pass through the
Lords first. (Consolidation Bills are always introduced in the House of Lords.) A
Bill with a mainly financial purpose is nearly always introduced in the
42
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Commons, and a Bill involving taxation must be based on resolutions agreed by
that House, often after debate, before it can be introduced. If the main object of a
Bill is to create a public charge, it can only be introduced by a minister or, if
brought from the Lords, be proceeded with in the Commons if taken up by a
minister, an arrangement which gives the Government considerable control
over legislation.
At the beginning of each session private members of the Commons ballot for
precedence in introducing a Bill on one of the Fridays specially allocated: the
first 20 are successful. After the ballot a private member may also present a Bill
after question time (see p 45), or seek to introduce a Bill under the ‘ten minute
rule which allows two speeches, one in favour of and one against the measure,
after which the House decides whether to allow the Bill to be brought in. Private
members' Bills do not often proceed very far, but a few become law each session.
If one secures a second reading, the Government usually introduces any
necessary money resolution. Private members’ Bills may be introduced in the
House of Lords at any time, but the time that can be given to them in the
Commons is strictly limited.
The process of passing a public Bill is similar in both Houses. The Bill receives
a formal first reading on introduction, is printed, and after a while (between one
day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) is given a second
reading after a debate on its general principles and merits. In the Commons a
non-controversial Bill may be referred to a second reading committee to decide
whether it should be read a second time. After a second reading in the
Commons, a Bill is usually referred for detailed examination to a standing
committee (see p 43). If the House so decides, the Bill may be referred to the
whole House sitting in committee. The committee stage is followed by the report
stage, during which further amendments may be considered. At the third
reading a Bill is reviewed in its final form. In the Commons this stage is taken
without a debate unless there is a motion in the name of six MPs that the
question be not put forthwith’—a procedure frequently used. The House may
vote to limit the time devoted to examining a Bill by passing a government
timetable motion, commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. After the third reading a
Commons Bill is sent to the Lords where it goes through broadly the same
stages. In the Lords, after the second reading, a Bill is considered by a committee
of the whole House unless the House takes the rare decision to refer it to a Public
Bill Committee. It is then considered on report and read a third time; at all these
stages amendments may be made. A Bill which starts in the Lords and is passed
by that House is then sent to the Commons for all the stages there. Amendments
made by the second House generally must be agreed by the first, or a
compromise reached, before a Bill can become law.
Most government Bills introduced and passed in the Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature. How¬
ever, if a non-governmental Lords Bill were unacceptable to the Commons it
would generally not become law because no debating time would be allotted to it.
The Lords, on the other hand, do not in general prevent a Bill insisted upon by
the Commons from finally becoming law. Normally they either accept the Bill
without changes, or amend and return it for consideration by the Commons,
who frequently agree to the amendments made. In practice, the Lords pass
without amendment Bills authorising taxation or national expenditure. A Bill
that deals only with taxation or expenditure must become law within one month
of being sent to the Lords, whether or not they agree to it, unless the Commons
directs otherwise. If no agreement is reached between the two Houses on a
non-financial Commons Bill (or an amendment to it) the Lords can in practice
delay the Bill (with certain exceptions) for about 13 months. At the end of this
time it may, in accordance with the Parliament Acts, be submitted to the Queen

for royal assent, provided it has again been passed by the Commons. A Bill to
lengthen the life of a Parliament would require the full assent of both Houses in
the normal way.
The limitations on the power of the Lords, contained in the Parliament Acts
1911 and 1949, are based on the belief that the principal legislative function of
the non-elected House nowadays is to act as a chamber of revision, com¬
plementing, not rivalling, the elected House.
When a Bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages, it is sent to the
Queen for royal assent, after which it is part of the law of the land and known as
an Act of Parliament. The royal assent has not been refused since 1707.
Private Bills, promoted by people or organisations outside Parliament (often
local authorities) to give them special powers not granted by the general law, go
through substantially the same procedure as public Bills, but most of the work
is done in committee, where procedures follow a semi-judicial pattern: the
promoter must prove the need for the powers or privileges sought and the
objections of opposing interests are heard. Both sides may be legally repre¬
sented.
Delegated legislation, used to relieve pressure on parliamentary time, gives
ministers and other authorities the power to regulate administrative details
after a law has been passed. To minimise the risk that powers thus conferred on
the executive might supersede or weaken parliamentary government, they are
normally delegated to authorities directly responsible to Parliament. Moreover,
the Acts of Parliament by which particular powers are delegated normally
provide for some measure of parliamentary control over legislation made in the
exercise of these powers, for instance, by reserving to Parliament the right to
affirm or annul the orders themselves. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation with organisations affected before rules and orders can be made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports on the technical propriety of these
‘statutory instruments’. In order to save time on the floor of the House, where
statutory instruments may be considered, the Commons also uses standing
committees to consider the merits of instruments, with any decisions reserved
to the House.
Either House may resolve itself into a committee (of the whole House) to consider
Bills in detail after their second reading. A committee of the whole House is
presided over by the Chairman of Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees
in the House of Lords) or a deputy chairman.
House of Commons standing committees include those which examine public
Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the second reading and
report stages; two Scottish standing committees; the Scottish Grand Com¬
mittee; the Welsh Grand Committee; and the Northern Ireland standing
committee. Ordinary standing committees have no distinctive names, being
referred to simply as Standing Committee A, B, C, and so on, and are each
appointed specially to consider a specific Bill. Each has between 16 and 50
members with a party balance reflecting as far as possible that in the House as a
whole. The Scottish Grand Committee, which comprises all 72 Scottish
members and 10 to 15 others (and may be convened in Edinburgh), considers
the principles of Scottish Bills referred to it at second reading stage, the Scottish
estimates and other matters concerning Scotland only. The Welsh Grand
Committee, with all 38 Welsh members and up to five others, considers Bills
referred to it at second reading stage, and matters concerning Wales only. The
Northern Ireland committee considers matters relating specifically to Northern
Ireland. A standing committee on regional affairs attended by any of the 523

members from the English constituencies is occasionally appointed to consider
matters relating to the English regions. The Lords’ equivalent to a standing
committee, a Public Bill Committee, is rarely used.
In 1979 a new House of Commons select committee structure was set up in an
attempt to provide closer examination of government departments and policies,
and of the way ministers discharge their responsibilities.
This was in response to a recognition that Parliament was probably less
effective a check on the executive than it had been for much of the nineteenth
century. With the growth of mass political parties, the individual independence
of many MPs has tended to become subordinated to party interests, and with the
great extension of the range and complexity of central government activities,
and the parallel growth of bureaucracy, MPs have a more difficult task in
checking the actions of ministers and their departments.
The 14 committees examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the
main government departments and related bodies. The Foreign Affairs Com¬
mittee, for example, shadows the work of the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, and there are select committees on Scottish and Welsh Affairs. The
committees are constituted on a party basis, in approximate proportions to
party strength in the House. Other regular committees include those on
European Legislation, Defence, Public Accounts, Members' Interests, the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, and Sound Broadcasting. The
Committee of Selection and the Standing Orders Committee have duties relating
to private Bills, and the Committee of Selection also chooses members to serve
on standing and select committees. A Liaison Committee to consider general
matters relating to select committees has been established. On rare occasions a
parliamentary Bill is examined by a select committee (a procedure additional to
the usual legislative process).
In their scrutiny of government policies, the committees question ministers,
senior civil servants and interested bodies and individuals. Through hearings
and published reports, they bring before Parliament and the public a body of fact
and informed opinion on many important issues, and build up considerable
expertise in their subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal and Appellate Committees in which
the bulk of the House’s judicial work is transacted, there are select committees
on the European Communities, Science and Technology, House of Lords’
Offices, Hybrid Instruments, Leave of Absence and Lords' Expenses, Personal
Bills, Private Bills, Standing Orders, Privileges, Procedure, Selection and Sound
Broadcasting.
The two Houses may agree to set up joint select committees, and joint
committees are also appointed in each session to deal with Consolidation Bills
and delegated legislation.
In addition to the official committees of the two Houses there are several
unofficial party organisations or committees. The Conservative and Unionist
Members’ Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of the back-bench mem¬
bership of the party in the House of Commons. When the Conservative Party is
in office, ministers attend its meetings by invitation and nor by right, but when
the party is in opposition, the whole membership of the party may attend
meetings and the leader appoints a consultative committee which acts as the
party’s shadow cabinet'. The Parliamentary Labour Party is a corporate body
comprising all members of the party in both Houses; when the Labour Party is in
office a liaison committee acts as a channel of communication between the
Government and its back-benchers in both Houses; when the party is in

Control
opposition the Parliamentary Labour Party is organised under the direction of
an elected Parliamentary Committee which acts as the ‘shadow cabinet'.
The effectiveness of parliamentary control of the Government is a subject of
continuing discussion, both inside and outside Parliament. Control is exercised
finally by the ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign
by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence" or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a matter of
confidence' or, ultimately, by refusing to vote the money required for the public
service. In addition to the system of close scrutiny by select committees, the
House of Commons offers a number of opportunities for a searching examin¬
ation of government policy by both the Opposition and the Government s own
back-benchers.
These include:
1. Question time when for an hour on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs' questions. The Prime Minister's question
time takes place on Tuesday and Thursday. Parliamentary questions are one
means of eliciting information about the Government’s intentions, as well as a
way of airing, and possibly securing redress of, grievances brought to MPs'
notice by constituents. MPs may also put questions to ministers for written
answers, which are published in Hansard, the official report. (At question
time in the House of Lords questions are addressed to the Government rather
than to a particular minister.)
2. The right of MPs to use motions for the adjournment of the House to open
discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern. There is a
half-hour adjournment period at the end of the business of the day; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
spring and summer), a full day is spent discussing matters raised by private
members. Moreover, an MP wishing to discuss a ‘specific and important
matter that should have urgent consideration' may, at the end of question
time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House. If the Speaker accepts
the terms of the motion, the MP asks the House for leave for the motion to be
put forward. Leave can be given unanimously, or it can be given if 40 or more
MPs support the motion or if fewer than 40 but more than ten support it and
the House (on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has been given, the matter is
debated for three hours, usually on the next day.
3. The 19 Opposition days each session when the Opposition can choose
subjects for debate.
4. Debates on the occasion of the passage, three times a year, of Consolidated
Fund or Appropriation Bills, when members can exercise their traditional
right of‘raising grievances', on matters for which any minister is responsible,
when voting the necessary supplies (money) for the Crown.
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during the
debate on the Queen’s speech at the beginning of a session, during debates or
motions of censure for which the Government gives up part of its own time, and
during debates on the Government’s legislative proposals.
Opportunities for criticism are provided in the House of Lords at daily
question time, during debates on specific motions and in questions (which can
be debated) at the end of the day’s business.
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and more particularly of the House of
Commons, in the management of the revenue of the State and payments for the
public service are to authorise the taxes and duties to be levied and the various
Parliamen tary

objects of expenditure and the sum to be spent on each. It also has to satisfy
itself that the sums granted are spent only for the purposes which Parliament
intended. No payment out of the central Government’s public funds can be made
and no taxation, charges or loans authorised, except by Act of Parliament,
although interim payments can be made, within limits, from the Contingencies
Fund. Scrutiny of public expenditure is carried out by House of Commons Select
Committees (see p 44).
To keep the two Houses informed of European Community developments, and
to enable them to scrutinise and debate Community policies and proposals,
there are two select committees (see p 44), and ministers make regular
statements about Community business.
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman ) investigates, independently, complaints of maladministration
when asked to do so by MPs on behalf of members of the public. Powers of
investigation extend to administrative actions by central government depart¬
ments but not to policy decisions (which can be questioned in Parliament) nor to
matters affecting relations with other countries. Complaints by British citizens
arising horn dealings with British posts overseas are open to investigation in
some circumstances. The Commissioner has access to departmental papers and
reports the findings to the MP who presented the complaint. The Commissioner
is required to report annually to Parliament. In addition he or she publishes
details of selected investigations at quarterly intervals and may submit other
reports where necessary. A Commons select committee has responsibility for
overseeing the Commissioner's work.
Each House of Parliament has certain rights and immunities to protect it from
unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. The rights apply collectively
to each House and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally claims ‘their ancient and undoubted
rights and privileges' at the beginning of each Parliament. These include
freedom of speech; freedom from arrest in civil actions; exemption from serving
on juries, attending as witnesses or serving as sheriffs: and the right of access to
the Crown, a collective privilege of the House. Further privileges include the
rights of the House to control its own proceedings (so that it is able, for instance,
to exclude ‘strangers' if it wishes), to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for
membership and to declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and to penalise for
breach of its privileges and for contempt.
The privileges of the House of Lords closely resemble those of the House of
Commons.
Between 1921 and 1972 Northern Ireland had its own Parliament and
Government, subordinate to the Parliament at Westminster, but in 1972,
following the resignation of the Northern Ireland Government, the British
Government assumed direct responsibility with a United Kingdom Cabinet
minister responsible for functions previously exercised by the Northern Ireland
Government. Attempts have been made by successive governments to find a
means of restoring devolved government to Northern Ireland on a basis that
would command widespread acceptance throughout the community. In 1982
elections were held for membership of a Northern Ireland Assembly, intended to
give the people of Northern Ireland the opportunity to evolve for themselves an
acceptable form of government and, in the mean time, to provide a means for
greater participation by the people of Northern Ireland in the day-to-day
government of the region. The Assembly is composed of 78 members elected
under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation.
GOVERNMENT
47
Committees of
the Privy
Council
The principal task of the Assembly is to make proposals for the resumption of
devolved government that would command widespread acceptance. The essen¬
tial criterion is that the Government will not recommend any arrangements to
Parliament for implementation unless it believes them to be acceptable to both
parts of the Northern Ireland community.
Prior to devolution, the Assembly has important scrutinising, deliberative and
consultative functions, including the scrutiny of proposals for draft legislation.
It considers consultative papers , and has initiated reports on a variety of
subjects. The Assembly monitors the work of the six Northern Ireland
departments by means of committees corresponding to each of the departments.
The composition of the committees and the allocation of chairmanships and
deputy chairmanships reflects, as far as possible, the balance of parties in the
Assembly.
Elections to the Assembly will normally be held every four years. The
distribution of seats at the end of July 1985 was as follows: Ulster Unionists 26,
Democratic Unionists 20, Social Democratic and Labour 13, Alliance 10, Sinn
Fein 5, other Unionists 3, vacant 1. The Social Democratic and Labour members
have so far declined to take their seats and those of Sinn Fein have said that they
will not take part in Assembly proceedings.
The Privy Council
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was the
chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent. Many
powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner committee of the Council,
and much of its work was handed over to newly created government depart¬
ments, some of which were originally committees of the Privy Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy Council is to advise the Queen to
approve Orders in Council (those made under prerogative powers, such as
Orders approving the grant of royal charters of incorporation: and those made
under statutory powers). Members of the Privy Council attending meetings at
which Orders are made do not thereby become personally responsible for the
policy upon which the Orders are based; this rests with the minister responsible
for the subject matter of the Order in question, whether or not he or she was
present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclamations,
some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament). The Council’s own statutory responsi¬
bilities, which are independent of the powers of the Sovereign in Council,
include powers of supervision over the registering bodies for the medical and
allied professions.
Apart from Cabinet ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are sworn
in on first assuming office, membership of the Council (retained for life) is
accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Prime Minister to
eminent people in independent monarchical countries of the Commonwealth.
There are about 380 Privy Counsellors. A full Council is summoned only on the
death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his or her intention to
marry.
There are a number of advisory Privy Council committees whose meetings differ
from those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot consti¬
tutionally be present. These may be prerogative committees, such as those
dealing with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man and with applications for charters of incorporation:

or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford
and Cambridge and the Scottish universities.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal from
the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies, courts of independent
members of the Commonwealth which have not discontinued the appeal, courts
of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and certain other courts, some
professional and disciplinary committees and ecclesiastical sources.
Administrative work is carried out in the Privy Council Office under the Lord
President of the Council, a Cabinet minister.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty s Government is the body of ministers responsible for the
administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the Commons, although the
Government is also fully represented by ministers in the Lords. The Lord
Chancellor is always a member of the House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary both in the number of ministers and
in the titles of some offices. New ministerial offices may be created, others may
be abolished, and functions may be transferred from one minister to another.
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition. First Lord of the Treasury and Minister
for the Civil Service. The head of the Government became known as the Prime
Minister during the eighteenth century. The Prime Minister’s unique position of
authority derives from majority support in Parliament and from the power to
choose ministers and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. By
modern convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
The Prime Minister informs the Queen of the general business of the
Government, presides over the Cabinet, and is responsible for the allocation of
functions among ministers.
The Prime Minister s other responsibilities include recommending to the
Queen a number of appointments. These include: Church of England
archbishops, bishops and deans and some 200 other clergy in Crown livings':
high judicial offices, such as the Lord Chief Justice, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
and the Lords Justices of Appeal: Privy Counsellors, Lords-Lieutenant and
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner to the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and
some university posts; and appointments to various public boards and
institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, as well as various
royal and statutory commissions. Recommendations are likewise made for the
award of many civil honours and distinctions and of Civil List pensions (to
people who have achieved eminence in science and the arts and are in some
financial need). The Prime Minister also selects the trustees of certain national
museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister s Office at 10 Downing Street (the official residence in
central London) has a staff of civil servants who attend to the day-to-day
discharge of the Prime Minister’s numerous responsibilities. The Prime Minister
may also appoint special advisers to the Office from time to time to assist in the
formation of policies.
Ministers in charge of government departments, who are usually in the Cabinet,
are known as Secretary of State’ or Minister', or may have a special title, as in
the case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

The holders of various traditional offices, namely the Lord President of the
Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Lord Privy Seal, the
Paymaster General and, from time to time. Ministers without Portfolio, may
have few or no departmental duties and are thus available to perform any special
duties the Prime Minister may wish to give them. The Lord President of the
Council, for example, co-ordinates the presentation of information on govern¬
ment policies.
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, being a minister with departmen¬
tal functions and also head of the judiciary. The four Law Officers of the Crown
are: for England and Wales, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General: for
Scotland, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State usually work with ministers in charge of departments with
responsibility for specific functions, and are sometimes given titles which reflect
these particular functions. More than one may work in a department. A Minister
of State can be given a seat in the Cabinet and paid accordingly.
Junior ministers (generally Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State or, where
the senior minister is not a Secretary of State, simply Parliamentary Secretaries)
share in parliamentary and departmental duties. They may also be given
responsibility, directly under the departmental minister, for specific aspects of
the department's work. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and other
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are in a different category as Government
Whips (see p 40).
The salaries of ministers in the House of Commons range from £29,400 a year
(from January 1986) for junior ministers to £45,000 for Cabinet ministers. The
Prime Minister receives £56,120 and the Lord Chancellor from March 1986
£77,000.*
Ministers in the Commons, including the Prime Minister, receive a parliamen¬
tary salary of £12,792 a year (which is included in the above figures) in
recognition of their constituency responsibilities and are entitled to claim the
other allowances which are paid to all MPs.2
The Cabinet is composed of about 20 ministers chosen by the Prime Minister
and may include departmental and non-departmental ministers. Its origins can
be traced back to the informal conferences which the Sovereign held with
leading ministers, independently of the Privy Council, during the seventeenth
century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an active role in politics in the
eighteenth century, and the development of organised political parties stimu¬
lated by successive extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet
assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of policies, the
supreme control of government and the co-ordination of government depart¬
ments. The exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the
Cabinet is a group of party representatives, depending upon majority support in
the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are confidential. Its members
are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose information about

and the Lord Chancellor of the present Government have decided to draw no more than the salary

its proceedings; although after Cabinet papers have been in existence for 30
years they may be made available for inspection in the Public Record Office.
Diaries published by several former ministers have given the public an insight
into Cabinet procedures in recent times.
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week during
parliamentary sittings, and rather less often when Parliament is not sitting. To
keep the amount of work coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a
great deal of work is carried on through the committee system, which involves
the reference of issues either to a standing Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc
committee composed of the ministers primarily concerned. The committee then
considers the matter in detail and either disposes of it or reports upon it to the
Cabinet with recommendations for action. The present Cabinet has four
standing committees; a defence and overseas policy committee and an economic
strategy committee both under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister; and a
home and social affairs committee and a legislation committee, both under the
chairmanship of the Lord President of the Council. Sub-committees of the
standing committees may be established. Membership and terms of reference of
all Cabinet committees are confidential.
Non-Cabinet ministers may be invited to attend meetings on matters affecting
their departments, and may be members of Cabinet committees. The Secretary
of the Cabinet and other senior officials of the Cabinet Office also attend
meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate.
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary of the Cabinet, under the direction
of the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet Secretariat, the Central Statistical
Office, the Management and Personnel Office and the Historical Section.
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers collectively in the conduct of Cabinet
business and operates as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy at the
highest level.
The Central Statistical Office is concerned with the preparation and interpre¬
tation of the statistics necessary to support economic and social policies and
management, and co-ordinates the statistical work of other departments.
The Management and Personnel Office is responsible for the management and
organisation of the Civil Service and recruitment into it, training, efficiency,
personnel management and senior appointments.
The Historical Section of the Cabinet Office is in the process of completing the
official histories of the second world war, and is responsible for the preparation
of official histories of certain peacetime events.
Ministerial responsibility' refers both to the collective responsibility which
ministers share for government policy and actions and to ministers' individual
responsibility to Parliament for their departments' work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility means that the Cabinet acts unani¬
mously even when Cabinet ministers do not all agree on a subject. The policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government as
a whole. Once the Government's policy on a matter has been decided, each
minister is expected to support it or resign. On rare occasions, ministers have
been allowed free votes in Parliament on government policies involving
important issues of principle.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his or her
department means that, as political head of that department, he or she is
answerable for all its acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any
defect of administration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy
which may be criticised in Parliament, whether personally responsible or not.
Since most ministers are members of the House of Commons, they must answer
GOVERNMENT
51
Non-
Departmental
Public Bodies
questions and defend themselves against criticism in person. Departmental
ministers in the House of Lords are represented in the Commons by someone
qualified to speak on their behalf, usually a junior minister.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they usually consult their
colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee. A decision
by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
keeping government under public control, for the knowledge that any depart¬
mental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament discourages the
taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
On assuming office ministers must resign directorships in private and public
companies, and must order their affairs so that there is no conflict between
public duties and private interests.
Government Departments
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to
government policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation, and
for advising ministers. They may, and frequently do, work with and through
local authorities, statutory boards, and government-sponsored organisations
operating under various degrees of government control.
A change of government does not necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments, although a radical change in policy may
be accompanied by some organisational change.
The work of some departments (for instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers
the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments (like the Department of
Employment) cover England, Wales and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland.
Others, such as the Department of the Environment, are mainly concerned with
affairs in England.
Some departments, such as the Department of Trade and Industry, maintain
a regional organisation, and some which have direct contact with the public
throughout the country (for example, the Department of Employment) also have
local offices.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in which
questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent official, and
a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament. For instance,
ministers in the Treasury are responsible for the Central Office of Information,
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, HM Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue,
the Paymaster General’s Office and a number of small departments including
the Treasury Solicitor's Department, the Royal Mint, and the National Debt
Office. Departments generally receive their funds directly out of money provided
by Parliament and are staffed by the Civil Service.
A number of bodies with a role in the process of government are neither
government departments nor part of a department (in April 1985 the figure was
1,681). Known as non-departmental public bodies, but often popularly
described as ‘quangos’ (‘quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations’,
although there is no precise definition of the term), they are of three kinds:
executive bodies, advisory bodies and tribunals. Executive bodies normally
employ staff and have their own budget; they consist of public bodies which
carry out, among other duties, administrative, executive, regulatory and
commercial functions. They operate typically within broad policy guidelines set
by departmental ministers but are in varying degrees independent of govern¬
ment in carrying out their day-to-day responsibilities. Examples include the Arts
52
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Counci] of Great Britain, the British Council, the Commonwealth Development
Corporation and the Commission for Racial Equality. Tribunals are a special¬
ised group of judicial bodies which are akin to courts of law. They are normally
set up under statutory powers which also govern their constitution, functions
and procedure. Tribunals often consist of laymen, but generally have a legally
qualified chairman. They tend to be less expensive, and less formal, than courts
of law. Independently of the executive, tribunals decide the rights and
obligations ol private citizens towards one another or towards a government
department or other public authority. Important examples are industrial
tribunals, rent tribunals and social security tribunals. Tribunals usually consist
of an uneven number of people so that a majority decision can be reached.
Members are normally appointed by the minister concerned with the subject.
Tribunals and advisory bodies do not normally employ staff or spend money
themselves, but their expenses are paid by government departments concerned;
a note on advisory bodies is set out below.
As a result of reviews of non-departmental public bodies undertaken in 1979
and subsequently, nearly 700 have been abolished or otherwise rationalised
with an overall saving of £117 million a year. Scrutiny of these bodies continues
with a new programme to improve performance and value for money announced
at the end of 1984.
Advisory Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or committees
Bodies which undertake research and collect information, mainly to give ministers
access to informed opinion before coming to a decision involving a legislative or
executive act. In some cases a minister must consult a standing committee, but
usually advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according to
the nature of the work involved, and may include civil servants and representa¬
tives of varying interests and professions.
In addition to the standing advisory bodies, there are committees set up by the
Government to examine and make recommendations on specific matters. For
certain important inquiries Royal Commissions, whose members are chosen for
their wide experience and diverse knowledge, may be appointed. Royal
Commissions examine written and oral evidence from government departments,
interested organisations and individuals, and submit recommendations. The
Government may accept the recommendations in whole or in part, or may decide
to take no further action or to delay action. Inquiries may also be undertaken by
departmental committees.

Scottish and Northern Ireland departments which are grouped at the end of the

SCOTLAND Scotland has its own system of law and wide administrative autonomy. The
Secretary of State for Scotland, a Cabinet minister, has responsibility in
Scotland (with some exceptions) for both formulating and carrying out policy
relating to agriculture and fisheries, education, law and order, local government
and environmental services, social work, health, housing, roads and certain
aspects of shipping and road transport services.
The Secretary of State also has a major role in the planning and development
of the Scottish economy, and important functions relating to industrial
development, with responsibility for financial assistance to industry, for the
Scottish Development Agency, and the Highlands and Islands Development
Board and for the work of the Manpower Services Commission and the careers
service. The Secretary of State plays a full part in determining energy policy,
particularly in relation to responsibility for the electricity supply industry in
Scotland. He is also responsible for the government interest in a range of other
functions from fire services to sport.

The Civil Service
The Civil Service is concerned with the conduct of the whole range of
government activities as they affect the community, ranging from policy
formulation to carrying out the day-to-day duties that public administration
demands.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown. They are responsible to the minister
in whose department they work for carrying out his or her policies. Ministers
alone are answerable to Parliament for their policies and the actions of their staff
(though civil servants may give evidence to parliamentary select committees on
their minister's behalf). In the determination of policy the civil servant has no
constitutional responsibility or role distinct from that of the minister. A change
58
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Central
Management
and
Structure
of minister, for whatever reason, does not involve a change of staff. (Ministers
sometimes appoint special policy advisers from outside the Civil Service; the
advisers are paid from public funds, but their appointments come to an end
when the Government's term of office finishes.)
Including part-time staff (two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent
to one full-time), in April 1985 there were almost 619,600 civil servants (nearly
half of them women), roughly half of whom were engaged in the provision of
public services, such as paying sickness benefits and pensions, collecting taxes
and contributions, running employment services, staffing prisons, and provid¬
ing services to industry and agriculture. Just over a quarter were employed in
the Ministry of Defence. The rest were divided between: central administrative
and policy duties; service-wide support services, such as accommodation,
printing and information; and largely financially self-supporting services, for
instance, those provided by the Department for National Savings and the Royal
Mint.
The total number includes about 116,300 ‘industrial’ civil servants, mainly
manual workers in government industrial establishments.
Over three-quarters of civil servants work outside London. As part of its policy
of controlling the cost and size of the Civil Service and to improve its efficiency,
the Government set a target in 1980 of reducing the number of civil servants by
14 per cent to 630,000 by April 1984. This was achieved and the present total is
smaller than at any time since the end of the second world war. It is planned to
reduce the number by a further 6 per cent to 593,000 by 1988.
Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service and Civil Service Commission,
modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain. Interchange of staff between the
two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only.
Responsibility for central co-ordination and management of the Civil Service is
divided between the Treasury and the Cabinet Office (Management and
Personnel Office). In addition to its other functions, the Treasury is responsible
for controlling Civil Service manpower, pay, pensions and allowances, while the
Management and Personnel Office, which is part of the Cabinet Office and under
the control of the Prime Minister, as Minister for the Civil Service, is responsible
for the organisation, structure, management and overall efficiency of the
Service. The function of official Head of the Home Civil Service is combined with
that of Secretary to the Cabinet. At the senior levels of the Home Civil Service
there is an open and unified structure which, with few exceptions, covers all
posts whatever the nature of their duties. It comprises six grades (numbered 1 to
6). Grades 1, 2 and 3 replace the former grade titles of Permanent Secretary,
Deputy Secretary and Under-Secretary. Grades 4, 5 and 6 represent a unified
grading structure covering the senior levels of most of the occupational groups
and classes down to Senior Principal, Senior Principal Scientific Officer and
Professional and Technology Superintending level. There are proposals to
extend the unified grading structure to a new Grade 7 at Principal level.
At other levels the structure of the non-industrial Civil Service is based on a
system of categories and occupational groups, which are the basic groupings of
staff for the purposes of recruitment, pay and personnel management. These
include the General Category (covering the Administration, Economist, Statis¬
tician, Information Officer and Librarian groups), the Science Category, the
Professional and Technology Category (including architects, surveyors, electri¬
cal and mechanical engineers, graphics officers and marine services staff), and
the Training, Legal, Police, Secretarial, Data Processing, Research Officer,
Social Security, Security and Museum Categories. These 12 categories account
for some 75 per cent of non-industrial staff. Work requiring specialist skill is
always done by appropriately qualified individuals.

Recruitment
and Training
Promotion and
Conditions of
Service
Personnel management policies encourage the flexible deployment of staff so
that talent can be used to the best advantage, and, with higher posts open to
people of outstanding ability (whatever their specialist background or original
method of entry into the Service), ensure that people with the necessary
qualities gain suitably wide experience to fit them for posts at the highest levels.
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of some 4,650 or so people, provides
the staff for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom
diplomatic missions and consular posts abroad. Its functions include advising
on policy, negotiating with overseas governments and conducting business in
international organisations; promoting British exports and trade generally,
administering aid, presenting ideas, policies and objectives to the people of
overseas countries; and protecting British interests abroad.
The Service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with that
of the Home Civil Service, and conditions of work are in many ways comparable
while taking into account the special demands of the Service, particularly of
postings overseas. Members of the Home Civil Service and the armed forces, and
individuals from the private sector, may serve in the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office and at overseas posts on loan or attachment.
Recruitment of staff to the middle and higher levels of the Home Civil Service
and the Diplomatic Service is the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission
which, in conjunction with departments, ensures that staff are selected solely on
merit through fair and open competition. The selection of junior staff, such as
those engaged in clerical and manual work, is undertaken by the departments.
For the Administration Group, the central part of the Home Civil Service,
entry is at three levels relating broadly to the academic achievements of: a
second class honours degree, or better; GCE Advanced level; and GCE Ordinary
level. The selection procedure for the highest of these levels (the Administration
Trainee entry) comprises qualifying tests, followed by tests and interviews at the
Civil Service Selection Board and an interview by the Final Selection Board. For
the next level (the Executive Officer entry) selection involves qualifying tests
followed by an interview. For the lower level (the clerical entry) selection is
normally by interview of those holding the prescribed educational qualifications.
Entry to the professional and technical grades usually requires appropriate
qualifications, and selection is on the basis of past record and by interview.
Most government departments employ full-time training officers and tutors to
help to identify staff training needs and to organise training by the most
appropriate methods (for example, formal courses or self-instruction). The Civil
Service College provides training most efficiently undertaken centrally. Con¬
siderable use is also made of external institutions.
Civil servants under the age of 18 may continue their education by attending
appropriate courses usually for one day a week ( day release’ schemes). Adult
staff may be entitled to financial assistance to undertake, mainly in their own
time, private studies leading to recognised educational or professional qualifi¬
cations in approved subjects. There are also opportunities for civil servants in
mid-career to obtain fellowships or to go on sabbatical leave to undertake
research in areas of interest to themselves and their departments.
Promotions are made partly through centrally conducted competitions and
partly by the departments themselves. Normally promotion is from grade to
grade, but there can be accelerated promotion for staff who show exceptional
promise. An experimental performance-related pay scheme for staff at Grade 3
level down to Principal was introduced in 1985. Promotion or appointment to
Grades 1 and 2 and all transfers between departments at these levels are

approved by the Prime Minister, who is advised by the official head of the Home
Civil Service.
Conditions of service for civil servants are generally governed by agreements
between senior officials (the Official Side of the National Whitley Council) and
representatives of the employees (the Trade Union Side of the National Whitley
Council). For industrial civil servants, the negotiating body is the Joint
Co-ordinating Committee of government industrial establishments.
An independent inquiry (the Megaw Inquiry) into future arrangements for the
determination of non-industrial Civil Service pay reported in mid-1982.
Following its recommendations, discussions with the Civil Service unions are
taking place.
Civil servants are required to discharge loyally the duties assigned to them by
the Government of the day of whatever political persuasion. For the Civil Service
to serve successive governments of different political complexions it is essential
that ministers and the public should have confidence that civil servants'
personal views do not cut across the discharge of their official duties. The
purpose of the rules which govern political activities by civil servants is to allow
them the greatest possible freedom to participate in public affairs without
infringing these fundamental principles. The rules are concerned with political
activities liable to give public expression to political views, rather than with
privately held beliefs and opinions.
The Civil Service is divided into three groups for the purposes of deciding the
extent to which individuals may take part in political activities. The ‘politically
free group, consisting of industrial staff and non-office grades, are free to
engage in any political activity including adoption as a candidate for the United
Kingdom or the European Parliament (although they would have to resign from
the Service if elected). The politically restricted" group, which comprises
Principal and equivalent grades and above, as well as Administration Trainees
and Higher Executive Officers, are debarred from national political activities but
may apply for permission to take part in local political activities. The
‘intermediate’ group, which comprises all civil servants not in either of the other
two groups, may apply for permission to take part in national or local political
activity, apart from candidature for the United Kingdom or the European
Parliament.
Where required, permission is granted to the maximum extent consistent
with the reputation of the Civil Service for political impartiality and the
avoidance of any conflict with official duties. It is granted subject to a code of
discretion requiring moderation and the avoidance of embarrassment to
ministers.
Generally, there are no restrictions on the private activities of civil servants,
provided that these do not bring discredit on the Civil Service, and that there is
no possibility of conflict with official duties. For instance, a civil servant is
required to seek permission before taking part in any outside activity which
involves the use of official experience, or before accepting a directorship in any
company holding a contract with his or her department.
As a general rule the political views of civil servants are not a matter of official
concern. However, no one whose loyalty is in doubt may be employed on work
vital to the security of the State. For this reason certain posts are not open to
those who are known to be members of communist or fascist organisations or of
subversive groups, or associated with them in such a way as to raise legitimate
doubts about their reliability, or to anyone whose reliability may be in doubt for
any other reason.
GOVERNMENT
61
Principal Types
of Local
Authority
Each department is responsible for its own internal security, advised as
necessary by the Security Service. The Security Commission, if requested to do
so by the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition,
may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public service and
advise on changes in security procedure.
Local Government
A wide range of public services is provided by democratically elected local
authorities throughout the United Kingdom. The gradual expansion of local
services, particularly in the period between the late 1940s and mid-1970s, has
inevitably led to a steady rise in local government expenditure and in its support
from central funds. In recent years central government has sought to check this
growth as part of a general policy of reducing public expenditure. Measures
introduced to promote greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness include the
holding back of central government grant from authorities spending above
government targets, the prescription of maximum levels of spending and rates
for selected high-spending authorities in England and Wales, the establishment
in England and Wales of the independent Audit Commission to audit accounts
and ensure economical use of resources, and the encouragement given to local
authorities to examine the scope for seeking competitive tenders for the
provision of many of the services carried out by their own staff. In Scotland there
is an independent Commission for Local Authority Accounts and similar action
has been taken to control local authority expenditure. Moreover, since staff costs
form such a significant part of public expenditure, local authorities have been
urged to reduce staff levels. Local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland are
now required to publish quarterly staffing levels for particular services.
The specific powers and duties of local authorities are conferred on them by
Parliament, or by measures made under its authority. The actual adminis¬
tration, and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits, are the responsi¬
bility of the local authority. In the case of certain services, however, ministers
have powers to secure a measure of national uniformity in the standard of a
service provided, to safeguard public health, or to protect the rights of individual
citizens. For some services the minister concerned has wide powers of
supervision; for others there are strictly limited powers.
The main links between local authorities and the central government are: in
England, the Department of the Environment, although other departments are
concerned with various local government functions; in Scotland, the Scottish
Office; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ireland, the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland.
England and Wales (outside Greater London) are divided into 53 large county
authorities, within which there are 369 smaller district authorities. Both types
of authority have independent, locally elected councils, and have separate
functions to perform. County authorities normally provide the large-scale local
government services, while the districts are responsible for the more local ones
(see p 63). However, in six of the English counties, which are heavily populated
and known as ‘metropolitan’ counties, responsibility for some large-scale
services rests with the district authorities. English parish councils or meetings
are focuses for local opinion as bodies with limited powers of local interest. In
Wales community councils have similar functions.
Greater London (an administrative area of about 1,580 sq km (610 sq miles)
and a population of some 7 million) is administered by the Greater London
Council, the councils of 32 London boroughs and the Corporation of the City of
London.
62
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Election of
Councils
The Local Government Act 1985 aims to create a more effective and
economical system of local government in Greater London and the six
metropolitan counties. Under this, the Greater London Council and the six
metropolitan county councils will be abolished, and the borough and district
councils will become the principal tier of directly elected local government in
metropolitan areas. A small number of services (namely, the police and fire
services and public transport in the metropolitan counties, and the fire service
in London) will require a statutory authority over areas wider than the boroughs
and districts; these services will be run by joint boards composed of elected
councillors nominated by the borough or district councils. Education in inner
London will become the responsibility of a new directly elected authority.
Transfer of functions will take place in April 1986.
On the mainland of Scotland local government is on a two-tier basis: nine
regions are divided into 53 districts, each area having its own elected council.
There are three virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles. Provision is also made for local community councils, although
these have no statutory functions and are not local authorities.
The areas and electoral arrangements of local authorities are kept under
review by the Local Government Boundary Commissions for England, Wales and
Scotland.
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils are responsible for local environmen¬
tal and certain other services. Statutory bodies, such as the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive and area boards, are responsible to central government
departments for the administration of major services such as housing,
education and libraries, and health and personal social services. Regional
services such as roads, water and sewerage, and planning, are the responsibility
of central government, through the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
Local authority councils consist of a number of elected unpaid councillors
presided over by a chairman. Councillors can claim a flat-rate attendance
allowance or a financial loss allowance for performing council business; they are
also entitled to travelling and subsistence allowances. Parish and community
councillors cannot claim expenses for duties within their own areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland each council annually elects a
chairman and vice-chairman. Some districts have the ceremonial title of
borough, or city, both granted by royal authority (in Northern Ireland by the
Secretary of State). In boroughs and cities the chairman is normally known as
the Mayor (in the City of London and certain other large cities, he or she is
known as the Lord Mayor). In Scotland the chairman of the district council of
each of the four cities is called the Lord Provost. No specific title is laid down for
the chairmen of other councils, but some are known as conveners, while others
continue to use the old title of ‘provost'.
Elections for any form of local government normally take place every four
years. Metropolitan district elections are held for a third of the seats in each year
when there is no county council election. Non-metropolitan district councils
may adopt the same procedure or opt for whole council elections every four
years.
Anyone is entitled to vote at a local government election in Great Britain
provided he or she is aged 18 years or over, is a British citizen, other
Commonwealth citizen, or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is not subject to any
legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector for the area for
which the election is held. To qualify for registration a person must be resident
in the council area on the qualifying date. In Northern Ireland there are slightly
different requirements.
GOVERNMENT
63
Functions and
Services
A candidate for election as councillor normally stands as a representative of
one of the national political parties, or of some local interest, or as an
independent. Candidates must be British citizens, other Commonwealth
citizens or citizens of the Irish Republic and aged 21 or over. In addition, they
must be registered as local electors in the area of the local authority to which
they seek election; or have resided or occupied (as owner or tenant) land or other
premises in that area during the whole of the 12 months preceding the day on
which they are nominated as candidates or, in that 12 months, have had their
principal or only place of work there. No one may stand for election to a council of
which he or she is an employee, and there are a number of other disqualifi¬
cations.
Local authority areas are generally divided into electoral areas for local council
elections. Administrative counties in England and Wales are divided into
electoral divisions. Districts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are divided
into electoral ‘wards', returning one councillor or more. In Scotland the electoral
areas in the regions and islands areas are called electoral divisions, each
returning a single member; the districts are divided into wards, similarly
returning a single member. For parish or community council elections in
England and Wales, each parish or community, or ward of a parish or
community, forms an electoral area which returns one member or more. For
elections to the Greater London Council, Greater London is divided into electoral
divisions, each returning one councillor.
The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar to that
for parliamentary elections, although postal voting is more restricted. There is
no postal voting for parish or community council elections. In Northern Ireland
local government elections are held on the basis of proportional representation
and electoral wards are grouped into district electoral areas.
Local authorities' functions are far-reaching. Some are primarily duties, others
purely permissive.
Broadly speaking, functions in England and Wales are divided between county
and district councils on the basis that county councils are responsible for
matters requiring planning and administration over wide areas or requiring the
support of substantial resources. Within the metropolitan areas district
councils are responsible for functions needing substantial resources because
they have populations large enough to give such support. District councils as a
whole administer functions of more local significance. In London the division of
functions is slightly different.
English county councils are generally responsible for strategic planning,
transport planning, highways, traffic regulation, consumer protection, refuse
disposal, police and the fire service. Education, libraries and the personal social
services are functions of county councils in non-metropolitan areas and of
district councils in metropolitan areas. All district councils are responsible, for
instance, for environmental health, housing, decisions on most planning
applications, and refuse collection. They may also provide off-street car parks
subject to the consent of the county council. Powers to carry out some
functions—such as the provision of museums, art galleries and parks—are
available at both levels; arrangements depend on local agreement.
In Greater London the boroughs and the City Corporation are responsible for
the same range of functions as district councils in metropolitan areas (with the
addition of consumer protection). The Greater London Council (GLC) deals at
present with services which were seen as requiring unified administration and
control over the whole area. In inner London education is administered by the
Inner London Education Authority, an autonomous committee of the GLC.
Responsibility for highways in London is divided according to the type of road;

Access

Employees
the main strategic road network is a matter for the GLC, while the boroughs look
after other roads. The boroughs have prime responsibility for the provision of
housing. The GLC has transferred most of its housing stock to the boroughs and
surrounding districts. London's police force is directly responsible to the Home
Secretary.
In Wales the division of functions between county and district councils is
much the same as that between county and district councils in non¬
metropolitan areas of England.
Local authorities in England and Wales may arrange for any of their functions
to be carried out on their behalf by another local authority, other than functions
relating to education, police, the personal social services and national parks.
In Scotland the regional and district authorities discharge local government
functions in a way broadly similar to that of authorities in England and Wales.
Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, because of their isolation from the
mainland, have single, virtually all-purpose authorities.
In Northern Ireland, local environmental and certain other services, such as
leisure and the arts, are administered by the district councils. Responsibility for
planning, roads, water supply and sewerage services is exercised in each district
through a divisional office of the Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland. Area boards, responsible to central departments, administer locally
education, public libraries and the health and personal social services. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive, responsible to the Department of the
Environment, administers housing.
Local authorities can eo-operate or share among themselves the discharge of
their functions. They have considerable freedom to make internal arrangements
for carrying out their duties. Most use the committee system, whereby policy
and principle are decided in full council, and committees administer the various
services. Parish and community councils in England and Wales are often able to
do their work efficiently in full session although they appoint committees from
time to time as necessary. Some councils have policy advisory or co-ordinating
committees with powers to originate policy, subject to the approval of the full
council. The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be
advisory or executive) are usually laid down in the council's standing orders.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees, except those in
connection with raising loans, levying rates (see p 66), or making financial
demands on other authorities liable to contribute; these are legally reserved to
the council as a whole. The conduct of business in local authorities in Great
Britain is the subject of an independent inquiry established in early 1985.
The public (including the press) are admitted to all full council (but not
necessarily committee and sub-committee) meetings. They may, however, be
excluded while a particular item is considered if the full council decides that
publicity would not be in the public interest.
Legislation passed in 1985 has extended the right of public access to
committees and sub-eommittees and given the public greater access to
information discussed at full council, committee and sub-committee meetings.
Over 2-2 million people are employed by local authorities in Great Britain. These
include administrative, professional and technical staff, teachers, firemen,
those engaged on law and order services, and manual workers. Nearly half of all
local government workers are employed in the education service.
Although a few appointments must be made by all the authorities responsible
tor the lunctions concerned, councils are individually responsible within

national policy requirements for determining the size, composition and
deployment of their workforces. In Northern Ireland, each council must by law
appoint a clerk of the council as its chief officer.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or chief
officers; administrative, professional, clerical and technical staff: and manual
workers. Senior staff appointments are usually made on the recommendation of
the committee or committees particularly concerned: most junior appointments
are made by heads of departments, who are also responsible for engaging
manual workers. Appointments and engagements always conform to the
council s set establishment, and committees are informed of appointments
which they have not made themselves.
Pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are generally a matter for
each council, although there are scales recommended by national negotiating
machinery set up by the local authorities themselves.
Authorities differ in the degree to which they employ staff to carry out certain
functions (for example, building work, street cleaning or refuse collection) or use
private firms under contract. The Government’s policy of promoting value for
money is encouraging the use of private firms where there are resultant
economies, and legislation is to be introduced to require authorities to open up
further services to competition from the private sector. In the specific case of
building and maintenance work, the Local Government, Planning and Land Act
1980 obliges authorities' direct labour organisations to bid for such work in
open competition if they wish to undertake it.
In 1984—85 expenditure by local government in the United Kingdom was about
£34,100 million, some 26 per cent of total public expenditure. Current
expenditure amounted to some £29,100 million, and capital expenditure to over
£5,000 million. One-third of local government expenditure is for education.
Housing, transport, police and fire and social and environmental services also
represent significant proportions. In a few cases several authorities may decide
to provide a joint service if this is more economical.
Local government current expenditure in England and Wales is financed by a
combination of central government grants and local rates (a tax based on
property values). A few services such as the police, housing and transport and
the urban programme for inner city areas receive specific central government
grants towards their cost. However, most central government support for
current spending is provided through the rate support grant. This is a general
grant which is designed to compensate for variations in the needs which local
authorities have to provide for and for differences in the resources they may be
able to raise in local rates. Each local authority’s grant is, therefore, calculated to
be sufficient for it to provide a similar level of service to that of other authorities
while at the same time charging the same rate level. This system requires an
assessment of each authority’s need to provide services which takes account of
over 60 different factors and characteristics of an authority's area and
population.
Within this system, local authorities are free to decide on their overall level of
spending and on their priorities between particular services. However, because
of the need to control the increase in total public expenditure the Government
has found it necessary to issue spending targets to individual authorities; if
authorities exceed these, they lose rate support grant. The Government has
power to fix upper limits on the rates of selected authorities whose spending it
considers to be excessive and for the first time, in 1985—86, 18 English
authorities had an upper limit set on their rate levies.
66
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Capital
Expenditure
Rates
In Scotland, the grant is distributed in three parts: the ‘needs’ element,
designed to give most help to authorities whose spending needs are greatest; the
‘resources' element, used to supplement the rate income of authorities whose
rateable value per head of population falls below a standard figure, prescribed for
each year; and the ‘domestic’ element, which compensates authorities for loss of
rate income from reductions in rate poundage which they are required to give to
householders. Excessive and unreasonable expenditure levels by local auth¬
orities, however, are discouraged by central government which can make
selective grant and rate reductions in the case of individual authorities. Current
expenditure guidelines are issued and the grant payable to authorities may be
reduced where the level of expenditure planned by authorities is in excess of the
guidelines. The Government has power to set a general limitation on rates.
In Northern Ireland district councils receive central government grants
comprising specific grants which assist with the financing of certain functions
(for example, the acquisition of open space, and the provision of clean air) and
certain capital projects (for example, leisure centres), and a general grant, which
is paid by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. The general
grant compensates councils for loss of rate income arising from statutory
derating of premises; it also contains a resources element which brings the
rating resources of poorer councils up to a standard level determined by the
Department.
Local government capital expenditure is financed mainly by borrowing with the
remainder coming from grants and other income. The largest share—a quarter
in England and Wales, a third in Scotland—goes to housing. Each local
authority receives from the Government a capital expenditure allocation for the
functions for which it is responsible. The allocation may be supplemented to
some extent from capital receipts achieved by the authority. With other minor
additions, these amounts constitute a ceiling on the authority’s permitted
capital expenditure for the year. They may normally be used for whatever
services the authority wishes within its legal powers.
Rates are local taxes paid by the occupiers of land and property (with certain
exceptions, see below) to meet part of the cost of local services. Each occupier’s
payment is calculated annually by the rating authority by multiplying the
rateable value of a property (broadly equivalent to its annual rental value) by the
rate poundage—an amount per £ of rateable value fixed by the authority
according to its projected financial needs. Rateable values are assessed
periodically, and there is a system of appeals for disputed assessments. Crown
(government) property is not rateable but payments are made, based on values
assessed by the Treasury Valuer, in place of rates.
Government grants reduce domestic rates below the levels paid by commercial
concerns. Rating relief is available in certain circumstances on premises
adapted for the use of the disabled. Agricultural land and buildings (apart from
living accommodation) and places of religious worship are exempted from rates.
Charities pay half the full rate on premises occupied for charitable purposes and
may be given further relief by rating authorities, who can also reduce or remit
the rates for a wide range of non-profit-making bodies. In England and Wales a
maximum of 50 per cent of the full rate may be levied on empty non-domestic
properties, with complete exemption for empty industrial property. In enterprise
zones, which have been set up in certain areas to foster industrial and
commercial regeneration, commercial and industrial properties are exempted
from paying rates for ten years.
In Scotland industrial (including freight transport) premises are rated at 60
per cent of net annual value. Most empty properties pay no rates.
GOVERNMENT
67
In Northern Ireland all industrial premises are fully derated as are commercial
premises in enterprise zones. Certain other properties, such as freight transport
and recreational premises, are partially derated.
Each year, local authorities receive a borrowing approval which enables them to
raise loans under their general powers to finance capital expenditure up to the
limit given in the approval. The GLC applies annually for parliamentary sanction
to raise the money needed for capital expenditure. In Northern Ireland long-term
borrowing by district councils is subject to central approval; in Scotland central
approval is given to capital expenditure, not to loans.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by means of private mortgages,
issuing stock upon The Stock Exchange and bonds which may or may not be
quoted on The Stock Exchange. Local authorities also have right of access to the
Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exchequer, or, in Northern Ireland, to
the Consolidated Fund, for long-term borrowing to finance a proportion of their
reckonable capital payments, and may borrow temporarily for a limited
proportion of their current outstanding loan debt.
Local councils normally have a finance committee to keep their financial policy
under constant review. They must have their accounts audited annually by
independent auditors appointed by the Audit Commission in England and
Wales, or by the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland. In
Northern Ireland this role is exercised by a local government audit section
appointed by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
A complaints system for local government in England and Wales involves
independent statutory Commissions for Local Administration comprising local
commissioners (local government Ombudsmen). The English Commission
consists of three local commissioners and the Welsh of one. In Scotland the
statute provides for a single commissioner. All commissioners are responsible in
their particular area for investigating citizens’ allegations of injustice resulting
from maladministration by local authorities. In normal circumstances, the
Commissioners can only initiate an investigation at the request of a local
councillor.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for Complaints deals with complaints
alleging injustices suffered as a result of maladministration by district councils
and certain other public bodies.
Fire Services
Every part of Britain is covered by a local authority fire service, which is subject
to some general oversight by central government. Other than in Northern
Ireland, where the fire service is financed wholly from central government funds,
the cost is shared between local authorities by central government, the latter
contribution through the rate support grant.
Each of the 64 fire authorities must by law make provision for fire-fighting,
and maintain a brigade of sufficient strength to meet all normal requirements
(in some parts of Scotland combined authorities provide fire cover). Other
authorities also maintain fire brigades, for instance, the Army and Royal Air
Force Departments of the Ministry of Defence; the Civil Aviation Authority at
airports; and some large industrial and commercial concerns. These work in
co-operation with the local authority fire services.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have central
responsibility in England and Wales and in Scotland respectively. Central
government is concerned mainly with ensuring the operational efficiency of
68

Services
brigades. Ministers have statutory powers to prescribe standards and general
requirements on administrative and operational matters of service-wide signifi¬
cance. These include appointments and promotions, the provision of a central
training institution, pensions and disciplinary matters. Their approval is also
required for reductions in the fire-fighting establishments of fire brigades. Each
minister is advised by a Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, comprising the
respective home departments, local authorities, fire service representative
organisations and certain specialist advisers. In the home departments,
inspectorates of fire services advise on operational and technical matters. Most
fire brigades include part-time personnel who provide fire cover in less-densely
populated areas in return for a retaining fee and call-out and attendance fee. Fire
authorities also employ people for duties in controls, communications and
mobilising and staff duties. There are about 36,000 full-time and 16,000
part-time operational members of fire brigades in Britain.
The standardisation of some equipment is encouraged, in order to assist
compatibility when a fire is attended by more than one brigade. The principal
types of fire-fighting appliances bought by fire authorities are based upon
specifications approved by the Secretaries of State and issued in the form of
advice by the Cent ral Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. The specifications aim to
describe the minimum standards required while allowing some freedom of
design.
Each fire authority must appoint a Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in Scotland)
who exercises day-to-day control from brigade headquarters. Divisional officers
in charge of the geographical areas into which most brigade regions are divided
are responsible for mobilising forces. Constant communication is maintained
between divisional and brigade headquarters and if additional resources are
required to deal with an incident, neighbouring divisions, or a neighbouring fire
brigade, are asked to provide assistance.
Fire authorities are concerned in some way with fire precautions in most
buildings used by the public and have major responsibility for enforcing
legislation concerning fire precautions. They must also make efficient arrange¬
ments for giving advice on fire prevention, restricting the spread of fires, and
means of escape. Courses in fire prevention are held at the Fire Service College
for fire brigade officers. In addition to their enforcement and advisorv duties,
brigades are also involved in education and publicity to promote fire safety,
particularly in the home; the Home Office also promotes fire safety in the home.
Central government is advised on prevention by the Joint Fire Prevention
Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils, representing the fire
service and central and local authorities.
Research into health hazards to fire-fighters, fire prevention, fire-brigade
organisation and fire-fighting equipment is conducted by the Home Office with
the help of the fire services under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Fire
Research of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. Individual research
projects are undertaken by the Home Office Scientific Research and Develop¬
ment Branch or, under contract to the Home Office, by other government
agencies, notably the Fire Research Station, which is part of the Building
Research Establishment of the Department of the Environment, or by private
consultants. The Fire Research Station is the principal organisation studying
and investigating technical aspects of fire.
Fire authorities have discretion to use their brigades and equipment in a variety
of non-fire emergencies. These are known as ‘special services' and include rail,
road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings, flooding of premises, leakage

69
of harmful gas or liquids and the rescue of people or animals from dangerous
situations. Fire authorities are entitled to levy a charge for such services.
The direct cost of damage to buildings and goods destroyed by fires in Great
Britain in 1984 amounted to an estimated £553-6 million (consequential losses
from the interruption of business are not included in this total). Most fires
involving heavy losses occur when the premises are unattended; and fires are
more likely to start in storage areas than in production departments. Industries
which suffer most severely include engineering and electrical firms, textiles;
food, drink and tobacco warehousing; chemical and allied industries; paper,
printing and publishing firms; and retailing.
About 750 people, particularly the elderly and young children, die in fires every
year (most of them at home) and about a further 10,000 suffer injury. Among the
chief causes of fatal fires are ignition of upholstery, bedding and clothing by
smokers’ materials and heaters.
3 Overseas
Relations
Administration
Britain’s overseas relations reflect both its traditional position as a major
trading and maritime power whose people have settled throughout the world,
and its concern to help to maintain peace and to secure world-wide economic
and social progress through international co-operation. It has diplomatic
relations with over 160 countries, and with about 20 of these has common
security arrangements, principally through the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa¬
tion. Commercial activities have helped Britain to maintain its position as a
world financial centre. It has considerable overseas investments, imports over a
third of its food and more than half of its raw material requirements, and
exports account for over a quarter of its gross national product. Britain provides
development assistance to over 120 independent countries as well as to its
remaining dependencies.
In the belief that its overseas objectives can best be attained through
co-operation with other nations on a regional or global basis, Britain is a
member of some 120 international organisations ranging from the world-wide
United Nations concerned with problems of world peace, international economic
co-operation and social issues to regionally based and technically orientated
bodies. In particular, it is a member of the European Community and is
increasingly co-ordinating its overseas policies through the Community’s
political co-operation mechanism. As a member of the Commonwealth, Britain
is a part of a representative cross-section of the international community, which
has evolved from the British Empire (since 1945 Britain has progressively, and
largely peacefully, dismantled its Empire and prepared nearly 50 countries for
independence) and whose 49 members share a common language, common
technical standards, similar systems of law and close professional, academic
and commercial links.
Britain also has strong ties with the United States, including a common
language and similar political and cultural traditions.
A long involvement in world affairs has given Britain both a vital interest and a
firm belief in the maintenance of international order governed by respect for a
generally accepted system of law. As a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council it makes support for the United Nations a central feature of its
foreign policy.
The general conduct of overseas relations is the responsibility of the Secretary of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs acting through the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office and over 200 British diplomatic posts overseas. The latter
comprise embassies and high commissions in about 130 countries,1 together
with subordinate consulates general and consulates, and missions at ten
multilateral organisations. These posts, like the Foreign and Commonwealth
1 A few embassies are accredited to more than one country; for example, the embassy at Dakar in
Senegal is also accredited to Mauretania, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Cape Verde.

BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The British
Council
Office, are staffed by members of the Diplomatic Service and locally engaged
people. Excluding supporting administrative and communications services, the
staff are employed on political and economic work, export promotion and other
commercial matters, consular and immigration work, aid administration,
information and cultural work. Other departments which have a primary
concern with overseas relations include the Ministry of Defence, the Department
of Trade and Industry, the Treasury and the Overseas Development Administra¬
tion (which is part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office); but the
involvement of most has increased in recent years with the growing dependence
of domestic economic policy on international decisions and with Britain's
membership of the European Community.
Where questions of overseas policy involve matters within the responsibility of
other departments, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office formulates policy in
consultation with the departments concerned. The balance of responsibilities is
a matter of constant adjustment, and the department with the predominant
functional interest, even though it may be primarily domestic, takes the lead.
This is particularly so in policy concerning the European Community and
international monetary matters. In the case of policy towards the Community,
the foreign and Commonwealth Office exercises its co-ordinating role at official
level through the machinery of the Cabinet Office.
Other bodies whose work has an overseas dimension include the British
Overseas Trade Board and the Export Credits Guarantee Department, which
provide export services for industry; the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments
and Administrations,1 which helps to arrange purchases from British aid funds
and appointments under technical co-operation programmes; and the British
Council.
The British Council, established in 1934, aims to promote overseas an enduring
understanding and appreciation of Britain through cultural, educational and
technical co-operation. The activities of the Council, which has staff in over 80
countries, include the teaching of English and the recruitment of British
teachers tor posts overseas; administering the Government’s educational assis¬
tance and technical co-operation training programmes; fostering personal
contacts between British and overseas people, especially in the educational,
professional and scientific areas; running, or helping to maintain, libraries of
British books and periodicals overseas and providing information through
touring exhibitions and bibliographical services; and presenting overseas the
best of British arts and culture. In Britain, the Council is concerned mainly with
arranging programmes for professional visitors and with the placing, adminis¬
tration and welfare of overseas students. A basic principle is that the Council's
work should be of benefit both to Britain and to the receiving country.
In 1984—85 the Council assisted 23,390 overseas students, trainees and
visitors to come to Britain, and an average of 51,330 students at any one time
were learning English in the Council and associated teaching centres overseas.
Book issues made by the Council's libraries, located in 68 countries, totalled 6-3
million from a library stock of 2-1 million, while 206 book exhibitions were held
in 74 countries. Some 1 million low-priced textbooks were sold in 83 developing
countries. The Council's libraries also hold some 37,000 films and videos.
About 80 per cent of funds tor the Council's total programme, which
amounted to an estimated £201 million in 1985-86, is provided by the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office (including the Overseas Development Administra¬
tion) and on its behalf the Council is responsible for the implementation of more

than 30 cultural agreements with other countries. Overseas it acts as education
adviser to Britain's diplomatic missions and is responsible for educational
assistance in developing countries in which it is represented and for links and
exchanges in higher education which require official support. Increasingly, the
Council is undertaking education projects paid for by overseas clients and is
providing English classes abroad; it is estimated that these and other activities
will produce an income of nearly £44 million in 1985—86.
Membership of the European Community
Britain joined the European Community on 1 January 1973 and its mem¬
bership was endorsed in a national referendum in 1975. The other members are
Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, the Irish
Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Britain has welcomed the
successful conclusion of negotiations over the entry of Spain and Portugal, who
signed treaties of accession in June 1985 and will join the Community in
January 1986.
The European Community consists of three communities set up by separate
treaties: the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European
Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community
(Euratom). The Community is the world's largest trading bloc, accounting for
about a third of world trade. Designed to lay the foundations for a closer union
between the peoples of Europe and to promote economic expansion by means of
a common market and the gradual approximation of member states’ economic
policies, the Community has moved towards these objectives by abolishing
internal tariffs and certain other trade barriers, establishing a common customs
tariff, and making provision for the freer movement of labour, capital and

services. An increasing proportion of British trade is with the other nine
member states: the Community took almost 45 per cent of Britain’s visible
exports in 1984 compared with only 30 per cent in 1970. There are also common
policies for agriculture and fisheries. Overseas countries having special links
with Community member states are accorded preferential treatment in aid and
the development of trade.
A common market for coal and steel is designed to ensure an orderly supply of
these commodities to member states. The Coal and Steel Community’s funds are
raised by a levy on production, and investment grants are given to encourage the
modernisation of the industries, for research, and for social measures to help to
re-deploy coal and steel workers. Loans are also raised which promote workers’
housing and aid capital investment.
One of the Community’s aims is to co-ordinate member states’ nuclear energy
industries and their other peaceful nuclear activities. Since 1959 there has
been a common market for all nuclear materials, and a common control
system prevents their diversion to purposes other than those declared. There
is also a co-ordinated research programme in the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy.
The separate institutions established by the treaties for each of the three
communities were merged in 1967. Each state has one representative on the
Council of Ministers; in the other institutions Britain's representation is in line
with that of the other large member states—France, the Federal Republic of
Germany and Italy. [The total number of representatives in each institution will
increase when Spain and Portugal join the Community in January 1986.)
English is one of the Community’s official languages.
The Council of Ministers is the principal decision-making body for all major
Community questions, member states being represented on it by foreign or
other ministers as appropriate to the subject under discussion. The Presidency
of the Council changes at six-monthly intervals. Most Council decisions are
taken on the basis of a proposal by the Commission. Some issues may be
decided by majority, or qualified majority, with votes weighted according to
provisions in the Community treaties. Where very important interests of
member states are involved, however, the Council’s practice is to proceed on the
basis of unanimity. Britain has proposed improvements in decision-taking
through greater use of majority voting while maintaining the ability to uphold a
vital national interest by insisting on unanimity.
The Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER), composed of
member states' ambassadors to the Community, assists the Council by
preparing its meetings and co-ordinating the work of other subordinate bodies.
The Commission formulates policy proposals for submission to the Council of
Ministers, promotes Community interests, attempts to reconcile national
viewpoints and implements the provisions of the treaties and Community
measures. Certain executive powers of decision are delegated to it, for example,
in the areas of agricultural, trade and competition policy. It is composed of 14
commissioners (two from Britain) nominated by member governments. Each
commissioner is responsible for one or more of the main Community activities.
The Commission is pledged to act independently of national or sectional
interests and to formulate its proposals and administer policy in the interests of
the Community as a whole. Its proposals are made only after extensive
consultation with officials of the national governments and with producers,
trade unions, employers' associations and many others.
The Court of Justice interprets and adjudicates on the meaning of the treaties
and of any measures taken by the Council of Ministers and Commission under

them, hears complaints and appeals brought by or against Community
institutions, member states or individuals and gives preliminary rulings on
questions referred to it by courts in the member states. As a court of final appeal,
its procedure in such cases is broadly similar to that of the highest courts in
member states; its rulings are binding on member countries, Community
institutions and individuals. The Court consists of 11 judges assisted by five
advocates-general who make reasoned submissions concerning cases brought
before the Court to help it in its interpretation of Community law.
The European Parliament is composed of 434 directly elected members, 81
from Britain, who sit according to party affiliation and not nationality. Elections
to the Parliament are held every five years, the most recent in June 1984. The
Parliament is consulted on and debates all major policy issues of the
Community. Members may question the Council of Ministers and Commission,
and have the power by a two-thirds majority to dismiss the Commission. The
Parliament can also reject in its entirety the draft annual budget as presented by
the Commission and approved by the Council. A formal conciliation procedure
has been adopted for use in the event of disagreement between the Parliament
and the Council of Ministers on matters with major budgetary or financial
implications.
The European Court of Auditors examines all Community revenue and
expenditure to see that it has been legally received and spent, and to ensure
sound financial management. It draws up an annual report, and may
submit observations on specific questions as the Community institutions
request.
The Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body representing
employers’ organisations, trade unions and other interests, and is consulted by
the Council of Ministers and the Commission during the formulation of policy.
Britain is entitled to send 24 members out of a total of 156.
In addition to, and separately from, the institutions operating within the
Community framework established by treaty, the member states have set up
machinery under which they consult each other before taking up final positions
on important questions of foreign policy. Known as political co-operation, these
consultations include regular meetings of foreign ministers, monthly meetings
of senior officials, and contacts at working level among those concerned with
particular questions. In addition, the ten foreign ministries are linked by a
secure communications system. Representatives of member states serving in
other countries and international organisations maintain regular contact.
Britain is proposing that political co-operation should be formalised, including
the establishment of a very small secretariat to ensure continuity and
co-ordination.
The Community’s heads of State or of Government meet three times a year as
the European Council, which operates outside the treaty framework and
considers both Community matters and those arising in the context of political
co-operation. It discusses general Community problems and lays down guide¬
lines and political direction for future work. When necessary, the Council
addresses issues unresolved in the Council of Ministers, but Britain hopes that
this will occur less frequently in future.
Community policies are implemented by regulations, which are legally
binding and directly applicable in all member countries; directives, which are
binding, as to the result to be achieved, on member states to which they are
addressed but allow national authorities to decide on means of implementation;
decisions, which are binding on those to whom they are addressed (for example,
member states, firms or individuals); and recommendations and opinions,
which have no binding force. The Council can also indicate a general policy
direction through resolutions.

Community
Policies
External
Relations
The ten member states discuss a wide range of foreign policy issues and, where
possible, reach common positions. At the United Nations their actions are
closely co-ordinated and they vote together on most major issues. Their cohesion
has played a key role in the process initiated at the 1975 Helsinki Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (see p 83), and especially in the setting up
of the Conference on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures and Disarma¬
ment in Europe, which opened in Stockholm in January 1984. In 1981 they
condemned the imposition of martial law in Poland and the suppression of the
independent trade union, Solidarity', as a violation of the principles agreed
upon at Helsinki.
The ten member states are pledged to continue seeking constructive,
comprehensive and realistic dialogue with the Soviet Union and the countries of
Eastern Europe, and they attach the highest importance to achieving effective
arms control and disarmament agreements.
In July 1980, the European Council s Venice Declaration stated that a lasting
solution to the problem of the Middle East required the mutual acceptance of
two basic principles—the right of all countries in the area, including Israel, to
secure existence within guaranteed borders and the right of the Palestinian
people to self-determination. After Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Britain,
France and Italy contributed to the multinational force deployed there from the
end of that year until early 1984. Member states have welcomed Israel’s
withdrawal from Lebanon and have consistently emphasised the importance to
any future settlement of the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon
except those whose presence is requested by the Lebanese Government. In May
1984, following attacks on shipping as a result of the conflict between Iraq and
Iran, member states emphasised the need to preserve freedom of navigation in
the Gulf.
The problems of Central America are also frequently discussed, member states
having made clear their willingness to contribute to finding a peaceful solution.
At a meeting with Central American and other states in Costa Rica in September
1984, member states agreed that the region's problems could only be solved
through political solutions springing from the area itself. The Community
member states reaffirmed their support for bilateral and other development
assistance to the region.
Member states have deplored strongly the Soviet Union’s invasion and
occupation of Afghanistan and continue to call for the immediate withdrawal of
the occupying forces in order that a permanent settlement can be reached
restoring the right of the Afghan people to self-determination.
The system of apartheid in South Africa has been condemned by member
states, who have urged the South African Government to ensure that political
and civil rights are granted to the black population.
On most international trade matters the Council of Ministers agrees a
common position, with the Commission speaking, and, where necessary,
negotiating on behalf of the Community (for example, in the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade and under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement). Association or
co-operation agreements giving preferential access to Community markets have
been concluded with most countries in the Mediterranean basin. Non-
preferential co-operation agreements have been concluded with individual
countries in South Asia and Latin America and also with two regional
organisations—the Association of South East Asian Nations and the
Andean Pact. Regular discussions covering trade and other matters are
held with regional groupings of Latin American. Arab and South-East Asian
countries.

The Community has also improved progressively its generalised scheme of
preferences, which gives duty-free access for almost all manufactures and
semi-manufactures exported by developing countries and preferential access for
agricultural products, with the aim in particular of benefiting the poorest of
them. The latest scheme started in 1981 and runs for ten years.
The third Lome Convention, which governs aid, trade and co-operation
between the Community and 66 developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean
and the Pacific (ACP) was signed in 1984; over half the ACP countries are
members of the Commonwealth. The Convention, which covers the period
1985—89, provides for aid and European Investment Bank lending of about
£5,350 million, industrial and agricultural co-operation, a scheme designed to
stabilise the commodity export earnings of the ACP countries, assistance for
ACP mineral producers whose production and income suffer from temporary
disruptions beyond their control, and duty-free access to the Community for
ACP exports of all industrial and most agricultural goods, including privileged
access for sugar, bananas, rum and beef. Emphasis is being placed on food
production and on measures to prevent desertification. All British dependent
territories (with the exception of Bermuda, Gibraltar and Hong Kong), together
with the overseas territories of other Community members, are formally
associated with the Community under conditions parallel to those in the Lome
Convention and have similar aid and trade benefits.
Britain played a leading part in urging the Community to adopt an aid
programme encompassing those developing countries (many of which are
among the world's poorest) not covered by the Lome Convention or having any
other special relationship with the Community. The programme for these
non-associated states has grown steadily since 1976 and was worth some £137
million in 1984. Priority is given to rural development and agricultural
production in the poorest countries. In 1984 the Community spent some £420
million on food aid to about 50 developing countries, of which Britain's share
was about £91 million. Within this, the Community allocated over 600,000
tonnes of food grains as well as other products to Africa alone at a cost of
about £136 million, Britain's share being about £30 million. The British Gov¬
ernment has secured agreement within the Community that such aid should
increasingly be used to assist the development of the recipient countries' own
agricultural production rather than to provide an outlet for the Community’s
food surpluses.
The Community is financed by a system of levies on agricultural imports,
customs duties and the product of a notional rate of value added tax (VAT) levied
on a Community harmonised basis at a rate at present not exceeding 1 per cent.
These are known as ‘own resources'.
Without some form of adjustment Britain's contributions under the system
would be much higher than its receipts from Community policies, because the
Common Agricultural Policy absorbs about two-thirds of Community spending
and Britain's agricultural sector is relatively small. This problem was foreseen
during the accession negotiations, and Britain was given an assurance that, if
unacceptable situations arose, the very survival of the Community would
demand that its institutions found equitable solutions.
In 1980 the Community recognised that there was a problem for Britain and
refunds were made for each year in the period from 1980 to 1983. In June 1984
the European Council (meeting in Fontainebleau) reached agreement on a fairer
and more soundly based system for Britain's contributions, under which Britain
will obtain a rebate of 66 per cent of the gap between Britain’s share of VAT
payments and its share of Community expenditure. In addition, agreement has
been reached on measures covering budgetary' discipline and limitations on
78
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
increases in agricultural spending. Once national parliaments have given their
consent, the VAT ceiling of 1 per cent will be increased to 1 -4 per cent for the
Community as a whole, partly to meet the extra costs of enlargement.
In addition to agriculture, the Community budget includes spending on
regional and social policies, projects concerned with research, energy, industry
and transport, and aid to developing countries.
Internal Policies The Common Agricultural Policy, the main Community policy, is designed to
ensure food supplies at reasonable prices for consumers and a fair standard of
living for farmers. Producers' returns are supported by a combination of charges
on imports and internal support prices maintained by intervention buying
where necessary. The Common Fisheries Policy, revised in 1983, governs access
to coastal waters, conservation of stocks, the allocation of quotas among
member states, and enforcement of these measures.
The European Social Fund assists areas of high unemployment by providing
grants towards schemes of training, job creation and geographical mobility of
workers. The European Regional Development Fund provides grants for
industrial and infrastructure projects in the less-developed or industrially
declining regions of the Community with the aim of reducing existing
imbalances or preventing the creation of new ones. In 1984, Britain received
£371 million (27 per cent of the resources) from the regional fund and £352
million (32 per cent) from the social fund.
Britain also receives about a fifth of the lending of the European Investment
Bank, which was set up in 1958 to provide finance on a non-profit-making basis
for investment to develop the Community's less-favoured regions, to modernise
industry and to help projects of common interest to two or more member states.
Community industrial policy includes measures designed to deal with the
problems of the steel industry during its restructuring; temporary mandatory
production quotas have been in force for several years in order to cut back
production to the level of demand, thereby allowing economic price levels to be
obtained. The Community is also involved in helping to create the right climate
for high technology industries to flourish. The ESPRIT programme is bringing
together many of the European computer companies in a common programme
of research and development in information technology, while the nuclear
fusion research project at Culham in Oxfordshire is designed to develop new
energy sources. The Community has also accepted the French EUREKA proposal
designed to promote new technologies.
The European Monetary System was established in 1979 to promote monetary
stability in Europe. It consists of an exchange-rate mechanism, a monetary unit
known as the European Currency Unit (ECU—based on a ‘basket’ of national
currencies including sterling, the value of which is recalculated daily) which is
used within the Community for budgetary and other purposes, and enlarged
Community short- and medium-term credit facilities. The member states are
also committed to the establishment of a European Monetary Fund. Britain has
participated in the system from the outset, although not in the exchange-rate
arrangements, and has deposited 20 per cent of its gold and dollar currency
reserves with the European Monetary Co-operation Fund in exchange for ECUs.
The Government intends that Britain should join the exchange-rate mechanism
when conditions permit.
Britain has put forward a number of proposals for the Community's future
development which are designed to create conditions for business and industry
to flourish and to secure non-inflationary economic growth. They aim to remove
non-tariff barriers to Community trade and to promote the free movement of
goods and people within the Community and greater competition in the services
sector, especially insurance.

Consultation
The Commonwealth
The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 49 independent states with a
combined population of over 1,000 million, about a quarter of the world total.
Britain participates fully in all its activities and values it as a means of
consulting and co-operating with peoples of widely differing cultures, thereby
contributing to the promotion of international understanding and peace.
Commonwealth members are a representative cross-section of mankind in all
stages of social and economic development. Their peoples are drawn from
practically all the world's main races and from all continents. As some of its
members are very rich and others very poor, the Commonwealth acts as a bridge
between rich and poor nations.
The members are Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh,
Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Britain, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Dominica, Fiji,
The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati,
Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Nauru, New Zealand,
Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon
Islands, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu,
Uganda, Vanuatu, Western Samoa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Nauru and Tuvalu
are special members, entitled to take part in all functional Commonwealth
meetings and activities but not the two-yearly Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meetings. The Queen is recognised as head of the Commonwealth;
she is also head of State in 18 countries.
The origin of the Commonwealth lies in the gradual granting of self-
government to the older-established British colonies (later known as the
Dominions) in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa1 where
European settlement had occurred on a large scale. Their fully independent
status in relation to Britain was legally formulated in the Statute of Westminster
of 1931. The main expansion in Commonwealth membership, however, took
place after the second world war, following Britain’s decision to guide its other
dependent territories towards self-government and independence. This process
began in 1947 with the independence of India and Pakistan,2 and in 1957
Ghana became the first African dependency to become independent. By the end
of the 1960s nearly all the British dependencies in Africa had gained their
independence as had many in the Caribbean and in Asia.
As a member of the Commonwealth, Britain participates in a system of
considerable mutual consultation and co-operation which benefits member
countries and contributes to international understanding. It led, for instance, to
the Commonwealth playing a significant role in the events leading to Zim¬
babwe’s independence in April 1980, and to Commonwealth involvement in
Uganda when a team observed the 1980 elections.
Consultation takes place through diplomatic representatives known as High
Commissioners, meetings of heads of Government, specialised conferences of
other ministers and officials, expert groups, and discussions at international
conferences and the United Nations. Trade and cultural exhibitions and
conferences of professional and unofficial medical, cultural, educational and
economic organisations are other ways in which frequent contacts are made.
Heads of Government usually meet every two years, most recently in New Delhi
in 1983; they will next meet in Bahamas in October 1985. Proceedings are
normally in private, which facilitates a frank and informal exchange of views. No

votes are taken, decisions being reached by consensus. These meetings allow
Prime Ministers and Presidents to discuss international issues and decide on
collective initiatives. Common views on matters of major international concern
are formulated and reflected in the communiques issued at the end of the
meetings. Occasionally, separate declarations are made on particular issues, for
instance, the 1971 declaration of Commonwealth principles, the 1977
Gleneagles statement which commits member governments to take every
practical step to discourage sporting contacts with South Africa, the 1979
declaration on racism and racial prejudice, the 1981 declaration on the
economic and other problems facing developing countries and the 1983
declarations on international security and international economic action.
With many small states among its members the Commonwealth has expressed
concern about their security and development and has set up a study group to
examine the problems they face. British policy is to co-operate with other
member states in order to increase the security of small nations by encouraging
regional co-operation and by providing economic aid and technical assistance.
Finance ministers meet annually to discuss world economic problems, and in
recent years have paid particular attention to the problems of development and
the establishment of a fairer international economic order. Other meetings
include those of agriculture, education, health and law ministers which take
place every two or three years. Ministers of industry, labour and employment,
and women's affairs also meet.
The Commonwealth Secretariat, established in London in 1965 and financed by
member states, is the main agency for multilateral communication between
them. It is headed by a Secretary-General appointed by heads of Government
and responsible to member states collectively.
The Secretariat promotes consultation, disseminates information on matters
of common concern, and organises meetings and conferences, including those
of heads of Government and of ministers. It co-ordinates many Commonwealth
activities related to international economic, social and political affairs, includ¬
ing food production and rural development, the role of women in development,
youth programmes, management development, science and technology, law and
health. The Secretariat also administers the Commonwealth Fund for Technical
Co-operation.
Because of its neutral position the Secretariat has been able to make its good
offices available in cases of dispute, and has carried out, on request, special
assignments requiring demonstrable impartiality.
Britain plays an active part in the work of the Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Co-operation, established within the Secretariat to provide technical
assistance for economic and social development in Commonwealth developing
countries. It is financed by contributions from developed and developing states,
Britain contributing about a third of its income. The Fund provides experts to
undertake advisory assignments or fill specific posts and uses consultancy firms
to make studies for governments. Its education and training programme is of
particular help in raising levels of technical and managerial skill, and makes
wide use of training facilities within developing member countries for the
benefit of other developing countries. It has a special programme to help
countries develop their exports, another on food production and rural develop¬
ment and a small technical assistance group to give advice in key areas. An
industrial development unit, the main executive agency of the Commonwealth
Action Programme of Industrial Co-operation, established in 1979, investigates
the feasibility of establishing new industries in developing countries and helps
to prepare and initiate agreed projects.

DEPENDENCIES
In 1983 a Human Resource Development Group was established in the
Secretariat to promote an integrated and multidisciplinary approach to training
needs.
Expenditure by Britain on bilateral technical co-operation with Common¬
wealth developing countries in 1984 was nearly £114 million, the greater part
being spent on financing staff for service with Commonwealth governments and
in financing training places in Britain for people from Commonwealth
countries. In particular. Britain is a major contributor to the Commonwealth
Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, a system of awards for people of high
intellectual promise to study in Commonwealth countries other than their own.
It was agreed in 1984 that the number of awards would be increased to about
1.700 of which Britain would provide some 800. Other assistance includes
sending volunteers to serve overseas, consultancy services, the supply of
training and research equipment and the provision of advice by British
scientific and technical institutions. (Financial aid to Commonwealth develop¬
ing countries totalled £365 million in 1984 and most received investment
finance from the Commonwealth Development Corporation.) From 1986—87, an
additional scheme, jointly funded by the Government, universities and
polytechnics, will be introduced to finance up to 450 scholarships over a period
of five years, the awards being open to students from developing Commonwealth
countries.
The Commonwealth Foundation wras established in 1966 and reconstituted as
an international organisation in 1983. The Foundation is financed by member
governments and administers a fund for promoting closer co-operation among
professional and other non-governmental organisations within the Common¬
wealth. It has assisted in the creation of 22 Commonwealth professional
associations and in the creation and growth of many national ones; it has also
supported 16 multi-disciplinary professional centres.
The Commonwealth Institute, financed largely by the British Government,
promotes knowledge about the Commonwealth through films, library services,
lecture tours by members of the staff and study conferences for students; its
headquarters in London has a permanent publicity exhibition depicting the life
of member states, each country financing its own stand. The Royal Common¬
wealth Society, which is over 100 years old, is a centre for study and discussion,
its library in London having one of the largest collections on the Commonwealth.
The Society has branches in many countries.
In keeping with the fact that the Commonwealth is an association of peoples
as well as governments, many unofficial organisations, professional bodies and
voluntary societies provide machinery for co-operation. Professional bodies
include associations of architects, doctors, engineers, lawyers, librarians,
magistrates, museum curators, nurses, pharmacists, planners, surveyors and
veterinary surgeons. Other organisations include the Commonwealth Par¬
liamentary Association, which organises an annual conference of parliamen¬
tarians, the Commonwealth Press Union, the Commonwealth Broadcasting
Association, the Commonwealth Youth Exchange Council, the Commonwealth
Games Federation and the Commonwealth Arts Association.
There are 15 remaining British dependent territories: Anguilla; Bermuda;
British Antarctic Territory; British Indian Ocean Territory: British Virgin
Islands; Cayman Islands; Falkland Islands; Gibraltar; Hong Kong; Montserrat;
Pitcairn, Ducie, Henderson and Oeno; St Helena; St Helena Dependencies
(Ascension, Tristan da Cunha); South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands;
and the Turks and Caicos Islands. They have a combined population of 5-5
million, of which 5-3 million live in Hong Kong. Few are rich in natural

resources, and some are scattered groups of islands. There are no permanent
inhabitants in the British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory or
South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Most dependencies have
considerable self-government with their own legislature and civil service. Britain
is generally responsible, through a Governor, for defence, internal security and
foreign affairs.
It is Britain's policy to give independence to those dependencies that want it,
and not to force it on those which do not. In the case of the Falkland Islands,
which is the subject of a territorial claim by Argentina, the inhabitants wish to
retain the link with Britain. The Government is committed to the defence of the
Islanders' right to live under a government of their own choosing. The Islanders'
right of self-determination is reflected in the new Falkland Islands Constitution,
which came into effect in 1985.
Argentina and Chile have claims to territory which overlaps part of the British
Antarctic Territory. Claims to territorial sovereignty in the Antarctic, however,
are suspended by the provisions of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty.
Gibraltar is the subject of a territorial claim by Spain, which imposed border
restrictions in the 1960s. Since the return of democracy to Spain, Britain and
Spain have reached agreement on the method for handling their differences over
Gibraltar, Spanish restrictions being lifted in February 1985. Britain wishes to
see the development of practical co-operation between Gibraltar and Spain to the
benefit of both peoples and remains committed to honour the wishes of the
people of Gibraltar as to their future.
In 1984 an agreement was signed between Britain and the People’s Republic of
China on the future of Hong Kong. Under the agreement , Britain will continue to
be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong until 1997, when the
territory will be restored to China. The Chinese Government will establish a
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which will enjoy a high degree of
autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs. It will be vested with executive,
legislative and independent judicial powers and its government will be composed
of local inhabitants. The laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain
basically unchanged, as will its present social and economic systems and its way
of life. Private property rights and other rights and freedoms will be protected by
law. These arrangements will remain unchanged for 50 years after 1997.
International Peace and Security
Britain is concerned to protect its territorial integrity and political indepen¬
dence, as well as the interests of its dependencies and of its allies, and pursues
these objectives through a national security policy in which deterrence and
defence are coupled with efforts towards removing or alleviating the causes of
international tension and achieving balanced and verifiable international arms
control and disarmament.
British defence policy is based on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO)1 which member countries regard as their guarantor of security, freedom
and well-being, and as an important contribution to international peace and
stability. The purpose of NATO is to enable its member countries to maintain
peace with freedom. It pursues a strategy of deterrence, designed to convince
any potential aggressor that the use of force, or the threat of it, carries risks far
outweighing any likely advantage. At the same time NATO countries seek

Republic of Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Turkey and the United States. France does not participate in NATO's integrated military
structure. Negotiations on the inclusion of Spain in NATO's integrated military structure have
been frozen pending a referendum in Spain.

Relations
through international negotiations significant reductions in the level of nuclear
and conventional forces.
Although Britain's defence resources are concentrated on key NATO tasks, its
defence policy is also designed to help, whenever possible, its own and more
general Western interests outside the NATO area. Britain also supports United
Nations and other peacekeeping efforts. In addition it provides military
assistance and training to a number of friendly countries and carries out
peacetime exercises and deployments in many different parts of the world.
Britain favours genuine improvements in East—West relations based on a
broader understanding and on the recognition that East and West have a
common interest in peace and security at a lower level of weapons. The
Government believes that both sides should avoid policies which risk provoking
confrontation and should aim instead for mutual accommodation and co¬
operation while exercising restraint in the conduct of international relations
both in Europe and in the rest of the world. This is explicitly recognised in the
Final Act of the 1975 Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe, which states that European security has to be considered in the broader
context of world security. Britain is committed to doing everything possible to
reduce the risks of war and to avoid misunderstanding. The Government is
following a policy of increased contacts at all levels with the Soviet Union and its
allies with a view to creating greater confidence and trust, without which real
and lasting progress in East—West relations will not be possible. The Soviet
Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 and its continued occupa¬
tion of that country remain, however, an obstacle to improved relations.
Britain attaches great importance to the full and balanced implementation by
all participants of the provisions of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act for increased
stability in Europe and improved co-operation between the 35 European and
North American signatory states. While not a legally binding document, the
Final Act is a charter and code of behaviour for what the participants hope will in
time become a more normal and open relationship between both governments
and peoples in East and West. To this end it contains undertakings about
security, respect for human rights, and co-operation in economic, humani¬
tarian and other matters. Follow-up meetings took place in Belgrade (1977—78)
and Madrid (1980—83), and a further follow-up meeting will be convened in
Vienna in November 1986. At the Madrid meeting the participants decided that
renewed efforts should be made to give full effect to the Final Act. To underline
the importance of its humanitarian aspects, a meeting of experts to discuss
human rights matters met in Ottawa from May to June 1985. This will be
followed in October 1985 by a Cultural Forum in Budapest, and a meeting on
human contacts in Berne in April 1986.
It was also agreed that a Conference on Confidence- and Security-Building
Measures and Disarmament in Europe should be convened in Stockholm in
January 1984. At the Stockholm conference Britain and its allies have proposed
a set of measures to build confidence and security in Europe by creating greater
openness about normal military practices (for example, exercises) and thereby
reducing the likelihood of an outbreak of hostilities by accident, misunderstand¬
ing or design.
Together with France, the United States and the Soviet Union, Britain is a
signatory to the 1972 Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, which reaffirms the
four countries' rights and responsibilities there, and provides for greatly
improved travel and communications facilities between West Berlin and the
Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and East Berlin,
and for the maintenance and development of the ties between West Berlin and
the Federal Republic.

BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Arms Control
and
Disarmament
Britain is committed to the search for balanced and verifiable measures of arms
control and disarmament, and has played a prominent part in multilateral
disarmament negotiations. Britain is a participating state in the Conference on
Disarmament at Geneva, in the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions
negotiations at Vienna, and in the Conference on Confidence- and Security-
Building Measures and Disarmament at Stockholm (see p 83); it also takes an
active part in disarmament deliberations under the auspices of the United
Nations.
Britain has warmly welcomed the new negotiations between the United States
and the Soviet Union on nuclear and space arms, which commenced in Geneva
in March 1985. It fully shares the agreed objective of working out effective
agreements aimed at preventing an arms race in space and terminating
it on earth, at limiting and reducing nuclear arms and at strengthening
strategic stability. Britain will continue to support the United States in the
negotiations and looks forward to maintaining the closest contacts during
them.
Believing that it is possible to improve international access to the benefits of
peaceful uses of nuclear energy while minimising the risk of the spread of
nuclear-weapons technology, Britain has played a leading part in strengthening
the regime of non-proliferation through the International Atomic Energy Agency
and other organisations. Britain is a party to the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty,
which is designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and provides an
assurance, through international safeguards, that nuclear facilities of non¬
nuclear-weapon states will not be used for making such weapons. Britain
reaffirmed its full support for the Treaty at a review conference in 1985, and has
been active in strengthening it by seeking the widest possible adherence. It has
also undertaken not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states
which have internationally binding commitments not to manufacture or acquire
nuclear explosive devices (except in the case of an attack on British interests by
such a state in association with a nuclear-weapon state). Britain believes that
limiting the security assurances to these states provides further support for
nuclear non-proliferation. Britain also supports the idea of a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty, subject to safeguards on adequate verification.
The British Government thinks that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free
zones in different parts of the world could contribute to regional security, to
non-proliferation and to disarmament in general, provided that nuclear
weapons do not already feature in the security of the region involved and all
states concerned are prepared to participate on the basis of agreements freely
entered into and in keeping with internationally recognised principles. The zone
created by the 1967 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin
America (the Treaty of Tlatelolco) is a good example.
As a result of a British initiative, another category of weapons of mass
destruction, biological weapons, is the subject of the 1972 Convention on
Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological
(Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction. Britain is also firmly
committed to achieving a comprehensive, world-wide and verifiable ban on
chemical weapons, having given up its own in the late 1950s. In 1976 it put
forward at the Conference on Disarmament a draft convention on the
prohibition of their development, production and stockpiling which served as a
focus of discussion. Since 1982 Britain has taken a leading role in the
negotiations on a chemical weapons ban and has tabled a number of working
papers on the verification of a chemical weapons ban, the main subject of
contention, including papers on the inspection of civil chemical plants to
prevent the diversion of certain industrial chemicals to illicit military use and on
challenge inspection in cases of suspected non-compliance.
OVERSEAS RELATIONS

Keeping the
Peace
Human Rights
Conventional weapons are by far the largest component of national armouries
and Britain has welcomed the completion of a United Nations study which
emphasised the responsibility of all states to seek reductions in conventional
forces. In particular, Britain believes in the value of regional agreements as a
means of facilitating such reductions. In the Vienna talks on Mutual and
Balanced Force Reductions, Britain, together with its NATO allies, is working for
an agreement with the Warsaw Pact participants which would contribute to a
more stable relationship and strengthen peace and security in Europe. This
requires an approximate parity between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in central
Europe where the Warsaw Pact troops currently outnumber those of NATO by
about 180,000. The Western position, contained in a proposal of April 1984, is
designed to resolve the long-standing disagreement over the size of the Eastern
forces in the reduction area: it offers flexibility on the initial data required in
return for improved measures of verification.
Concerned about the rising scale of military expenditure in the world, Britain
has supported proposals at the United Nations for the balanced and verifiable
reduction of military budgets. Britain and its allies and partners have
participated actively in developing a standardised system for reporting annual
military expenditure to establish a basis for future comparison. Britain
welcomes efforts to promote increased openness in the reporting of military
expenditure and to this end has submitted figures on its military budget.
British experts have taken part in a number of United Nations studies on
aspects of arms control and disarmament.
Britain and the United Nations
Support for the United Nations and the purposes and principles of its Charter
has been a cornerstone of British policy since 1945. for Britain sees a strong and
effective United Nations as a vital framework for pursuing and achieving many of
its foreign policy objectives such as the peaceful resolution of disputes,
disarmament and arms control, the protection of human rights and the
promotion of the rule of law.
The United Nations and its various agencies also provide an important
framework for discussing such issues as disaster relief, the use of the sea-bed,
terrorism, the world environment, energy development and world resources.
The maintenance of international peace and security was the primary purpose
envisaged for the United Nations at the time of its establishment. Britain
believes that it is appropriate for the United Nations, as the only forum in which
almost the whole international community is represented, to seek to resolve
disputes which threaten peace and stability whether on a regional or world
scale. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Britain plays an active
role in the Council's work and has sought to develop and improve its role in the
peaceful settlement of disputes.
Another British concern is that the United Nations should have an effective
peacekeeping capacity. It contributes to the UN force in Cyprus and provides
logistic support for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon.
Britain has supported the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights since its
adoption by the General Assembly in 1948. While not legally binding, the
Declaration has inspired many other international instruments designed to
secure the observance of its provisions. These include the two international
covenants adopted by the General Assembly in 1966, which impose legal
obligations on those who ratify them: the Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Both came into
86

Social Affairs
force, and were ratified by Britain, in 1976. Under the latter Britain also
recognises the competence of the UN Human Rights Committee (set up by the
Covenant to monitor the implementation of the human rights protected by it) to
receive and consider state-to-state complaints.
Britain is also a party to conventions aimed at implementing particular rights
contained in the Universal Declaration, including those on the elimination of
racial discrimination, on the status of refugees and stateless persons and on
slavery. The Government has decided to ratify a United Nations Convention on
the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.
The adoption of conventions and covenants in itself is insufficient to secure
the protection of human rights, and Britain believes it is necessary to develop
effective procedures to ensure the implementation of such agreements. It also
believes that the practice of the United Nations has established human rights as
a legitimate matter for international concern and that the UN Charter imposes
on member governments an obligation to pursue policies which observe human
rights and to co-operate with the United Nations to that end.
The Economic and Social Council has general responsibility within the United
Nations for human rights activities. The bodies directly concerned are the
Commission on Human Rights, its Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discri¬
mination and Protection of Minorities, and the Commission on the Status of
Women. Britain is represented on all these bodies and is active in their work.
The UN Charter states that ‘the promotion of the economic and social
advancement of all peoples' is one of the principal aims of the United Nations,
and an estimated 90 per cent of the organisation's efforts, in terms of resources
and personnel, is now employed to this end. With the growing concern for
the problems of development, the main emphasis has become increasingly the
provision of direct assistance for member states. The UN system is now the
largest single source of technical assistance for developing countries, as well as
providing considerable emergency and relief aid and assistance for refugees.
(The provision of capital assistance has been generally confined to the World
Bank group and regional development banks whose operations are usually
considered separately from those of the rest of the UN system.)
Successive British governments have affirmed their support for the functional
and developmental work of the United Nations. Britain is the sixth largest
contributor to the UN’s regular budget, providing some £21-7 million, 4-67 per
cent of the total, in 1984. In addition, it contributed some £7-5 million to the
World Health Organisation, £4 million to the International Labour Organisa¬
tion, £8 million to the Food and Agriculture Organisation and £6-8 million to
the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.1 Britain provides
considerable contributions to the UN's voluntary funds, donating £20 million in
1984 for the UN Development Programme, £3-4 million for the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, £5 million for the UN Relief and Works Agency for
Palestinian Refugees, £6 million for the UN Children's Fund, £3 million for the
UN Fund for Population Activities, and about £0-5 million for the World Food
Programme.
In the deliberations of the governing bodies of the various agencies and
programmes, Britain encourages the deployment of the resources towards the
poorest countries and the poorest communities in the developing world. It also
1 Following a government review of UNESCO in 1984, Britain has given notice that it will
withdraw from the organisation at the end of 1985, unless a number of reforms are implemented,
notably a budgetary standstill; better value for money and an improved performance in assisting
the developing countries to find practical solutions to their problems in education, science and
culture; improved management; better control by the governing bodies: and proper attention to
evaluation.

seeks to promote the most efficient use of UN development resources and
improvements in the co-ordination, control and effectiveness of the system, in
order to avoid unnecessary duplication by the various agencies.
Other International Organisations
Britain is a member of many other international organisations, including those
concerned with the management of the world economy. It is a founder member
of the International Monetary Fund, established in 1945 (along with the World
Bank) to regulate the international financial system and to provide a source of
credit for member countries facing balance of payments problems, and has
welcomed the creation by the Fund of facilities to provide special assistance to
developing countries experiencing financial or trading difficulties. It is a strong
supporter of efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to
liberalise further, and promote the growth of, world trade, and to improve the
developing countries' participation in it.
Britain is also a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). An instrument for intergovernmental co-operation among
24 industrialised countries, the OECD's aims are to promote policies designed
to achieve the highest sustainable economic growth and employment, and a
rising standard of living in member countries while maintaining financial
stability, and thus to contribute to the development of the world economy; to
assist developing countries; and to contribute to the expansion of world trade on
a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis in accordance with international
obligations.
Other organisations to which Britain belongs or extends support are more
restricted in their operations and include the regional development banks in
Africa, the Americas and Asia and specialist technical, agricultural and medical
institutions.
With 20 other nations Britain is a member of the Council of Europe, which
aims to provide the widest possible European forum for the discussion of
political, economic, social, cultural and scientific issues with a view to achieving
greater unity between its members. Membership is open to any European
parliamentary democracy which accepts the principles of the rule of law and the
protection of human rights. The Council was responsible for the adoption in
1950 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Britain is a party.
In March 1985, with Britain’s support, the Council adopted a declaration
reaffirming its commitment to respect for human rights and calling upon all
countries to comply fully with their international obligations in this area.
Development Co-operation
The basic objective of Britain’s aid programme is to help developing countries’
efforts to raise their living standards, especially in the poorest countries. It is
these countries which find it most difficult to generate investment funds
domestically or attract external private flows. Britain’s ability to support
development overseas is dependent on the state of its own economy, and
alongside development objectives, due weight is given to political, commercial
and industrial considerations in the deployment of aid resources.
Official aid is only one aspect of Britain’s support for overseas development.
Private investment is also important and has benefited from the abolition of
exchange controls in 1979. Britain is one of the world’s largest overseas
investors; in 1983 net outward direct investment by British companies in
developing countries amounted to £705 million out of a total of £3,535 million.
Such investment is important not only because of the money provided but
88
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Official and
Other Flows
Bilateral Aid
Financial Aid
because of the transfer of skills, management expertise and the development of
indigenous resources which accompany it. Trade, too, is vital, developing
countries providing nearly a fifth of British imports in recent years.
Aid is also provided by voluntary societies which concentrate their activities in
the poorest countries. Some of these societies’ activities receive substantial
support from the official aid programme.
In 1984 total official flows1 of aid amounted to some £1,419 million net, of which
£1,061 million represented official development assistance and £358 million
other official flows. Of the former, bilateral aid accounted for £578 million
including technical co-operation funds of £240 million; some £483 million was
provided through multilateral agencies. Repayments of capital and payments of
interest on loans came to £95-7 million and £65-2 million respectively; another
£24 million of capital repayments and £2 million of interest were cancelled.
Aid performance is commonly measured as a proportion of gross national
product (GNP), particularly with reference to the two United Nations targets for
resource transfers to developing countries: that net official development
assistance should equal 0-7 per cent ot GNP and that combined private and
official flows should equal 1 per cent of GNP. Britain accepts in principle the first
of these but is not committed to a timetable for reaching it. Successive
governments have made it clear that progress must depend on Britain's
economic condition and upon other calls on its resources. In 1984 net official
development assistance amounted to £1,061 million, 0-33 per cent of GNP, close
to the average of 0-36 per cent for donor countries belonging to the Development
Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. Total net financial flows from Britain to developing countries
amounted to £2,839 million, 0-89 per cent of GNP.
Britain's aid programme began as part of the discharge of its responsibilities
towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis remains on the
Commonwealth, which includes among its members some of the world's poorest
countries. In 1984, £780 million of gross public expenditure on overseas aid1
was disbursed bilaterally. Some £480 million (73 per cent of that directly
allocated to countries) went to the Commonwealth, including £29 million to
Britain's remaining dependencies, which are a first charge on the aid
programme. Aid was disbursed regionally as follows: Africa £266 million; Asia
£304 million; the Americas and the Caribbean £58 million; Oceania £27
million; and Europe £10 million. (A further £114 million was not allocable by
region.)
The country receiving the largest amount (£147 million) was India. Other
major recipients included Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,
Indonesia and Zambia. In line with the policy of concentrating aid on the
poorest countries. £419 million of gross bilateral aid went to the poorest 50
developing countries (excluding states with a population under 100,000 and
dependencies).
Gross bilateral financial aid in 1984 totalled £505 million. Aid for individual
projects totalled £399 million, the principal sectors supported being agriculture,
fisheries and forestry (£58 million), manufacturing (£20 million), energy (£162
1 ‘Total official flows' is an international reporting concept. Its main component—official
development assistance—is defined as official flows for development purposes with a grant
(concessional) element of 25 per cent or more. The main British reporting concept is ‘public
expenditure on overseas aid' which differs from total official flows by excluding certain British
flows which benefit developing countries but are not considered developmental, and by recording
some contributions to multilateral agencies at a different time. All concepts can be measured
before (gross) or after (net) deducting capital repayments.

million), transport and communications (£44 million) and social and commu¬
nity services (£45 million). Non-project aid totalled £106 million, of which nearly
£37 million was for import financing, £15 million for food aid including £9
million in response to the famine in sub-Saharan Africa, £34 million for debt
relief, £12 million for budgetary support and £9 million for emergency relief
(some of these funds are channelled through the Overseas Development
Administration's Disaster Unit which provides immediate assistance in disaster
relief operations). About 74 per cent of financial aid was provided in grants and
the rest in concessionary loans. Since 1975, development aid to the poorest
countries (which include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and many countries in
Africa) has been on grant terms. In October 1984 these terms were extended to
the majority of recipients of British financial aid, and simplified loan terms were
introduced for those countries still not qualifying for grants. In 1984 loan
commitments, excluding investments by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation, totalled £42 million. Where loans bear interest it is now at a fixed
concessionary rate of 4 per cent, and all loans carry four- or five-year grace
periods for repayment of capital. The normal maturity of loans is 12 or 15 years.
Britain has more than fulfilled the 1978 resolution of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development on easing the terms of financial aid.
Britain has concluded agreements to remove the burden of past aid loans worth
over £987 million from 21 of the poorest countries, including India.
Financial aid is normally tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and
services from Britain (47 per cent in 1984), although there may be a substantial
element for local costs and foreign content in contracts financed from tied aid in
appropriate cases. New loan but not grant commitments can be untied, if the
recipient agrees, to the extent that goods can be purchased either from the
poorest developing countries or from Britain.
Some £51 million was provided under the Aid and Trade Provision, which is
designed to match the mixed credit practices of other donors by providing aid in
combination with export credits to support sound development projects which
offer commercial opportunities to British exporters. At the same time, the
Government favours the conclusion of an international agreement to phase out
such practices.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation is empowered to invest in
Commonwealth countries which have achieved independence since 1948, the
remaining British dependencies and certain non-Commonwealth countries. Its
aim is to assist in the development of these countries’ economies. By the end of
1984, the Corporation had invested some £591 million out of a total
commitment of £838 million. Of this total, £408 million was in Africa, £224
million in Asia, £128 million in the Caribbean and Latin America and
£74 million in the Pacific Islands. Commitments approved in 1984 totalled over
£101 million, of which 74 per cent went to projects in poorer developing
countries. Some 57 per cent was allocated to agriculture, fisheries and forestry.
Technical co-operation, the transfer of specialised knowledge and skills from
country to country, complements financial aid, expertise often being essential to
the success of a programme of financial aid or investment. Expenditure on it has
increased in recent years and was £240 million, 31 per cent of gross bilateral
aid, in 1984. This included £66 million for the provision of expert personnel,
including volunteers, £47 million for students and trainees in Britain and
overseas, £17 million for research services and projects, £31 million for
consultancy services, and £9 million for the provision of equipment and
supplies.
At the end of 1984 there were 2,335 people financed by Britain (other than
volunteers) working in developing countries, of whom some 834 were engaged in
90

the field of education, 407 in agriculture and allied fields, and 174 in health
services. In addition, under the British Volunteer Programme there were 1,080
volunteers, mainly graduates or otherwise qualified, working in developing
countries, the majority of them teaching. Recruitment, training and placing
overseas is undertaken by four voluntary bodies (Catholic Institute for Interna¬
tional Relations, International Voluntary Service, United Nations Association
International Service and Voluntary Service Overseas), 90 per cent of their costs
being met by the British Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Some 12,840 were financed in Britain in 1984 under regional
programmes of technical co-operation, by awards under the Commonwealth
Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, and under British Council schemes. Britain
also financed another 674 students attending courses outside Britain. In early
1983 the Government decided to make an additional £46 million available (some
outside the aid programme) over the next three years for the support of overseas
students. A new scheme for students from Commonwealth developing countries
was announced in 1985 (see p 81).
To support development overseas, the Government maintains specialist
scientific organisations (the Land Resources Development Centre, and the
Tropical Development and Research Institute) and provides support for many
others, including overseas units/divisions of the government-financed Trans¬
port and Road Research Laboratory, the Building Research Establishment, the
British Geological Survey, the Overseas Surveys Directorate of the Ordnance
Survey, and of Hydraulics Research Ltd. These organisations provide specialist
information, advice and experts for service overseas, and undertake field and
laboratory research investigations.
To ensure the most effective use of aid resources, the objectives and content of
country aid programmes are determined through a systematic programming
exercise which takes account of the circumstances of the recipient country, its
development priorities, the activities of other donors, and what Britain can offer
by way of expertise, goods and services. In addition, individual projects are
carefully appraised before approval, monitored during progress against quantifi¬
able targets and assessed in a project completion report, while a programme of
special evaluation examines in more detail the achievements of particular
projects and of special issues. The Overseas Development Administration also
supports international studies of aid effectiveness.
Britain is a major subscriber to the World Bank group of institutions—the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International
Development Association (IDA) and the International Finance Corporation. The
resources of the IDA, which provides interest-free loans to developing countries
unable to service loans on conventional terms, are replenished at roughly
three-year intervals. The British commitment to its Seventh Replenishment
(July 1984 to June 1987) is £401-5 million towards a total of $9,000 million,
and Britain was willing to participate in supplementary financing of up to
$3,000 million on the same burden-sharing arrangements among donors;
however, this was not agreed by all donors and was not pursued. Britain
contributes to the resources of the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the African Develop¬
ment Bank. Its contribution to the United Nations Development Programme for
1984 was £20 million, and it is the largest source of expertise and fellowships
provided under the Programme. There is also a major British contribution to
other UN agencies and programmes, and an increasing proportion of British aid
is now channelled through the European Community’s aid programme.

Voluntary

THE
INTERNATIONAL
ECONOMY
Britain's contribution to the sixth European Development Fund established by
the third Lome Convention, covering the period from 1985 to 1989, will be about
£740 million.
Voluntary agencies provided an estimated £105 million for work in developing
countries in 1984, mainly on agriculture, health and nutrition, and education
projects, and on emergency relief operations.
There are about 200 agencies in all, including church and missionary
societies; among the best known are Oxfam, Christian Aid, War on Want, the
Save the Children Fund, the British Red Cross Society and the Catholic Fund for
Overseas Development. The funds are raised largely through appeals in the
media, both on a regular basis and in response to specific emergencies; the
latter, in particular, meet with a good response. In the year to August 1985, for
instance, an estimated £90 million was raised in Britain for relief operations in
Ethiopia and other African countries, including nearly £20 million by the Live
Aid’ concert organised by the Band Aid Trust. The Government co-operates with
the agencies in various ways, especially in immediate post-disaster relief and
rehabilitation operations and through its Joint Funding Scheme. Under this it
meets half the cost of selected development projects undertaken by the agencies
and aimed at helping the poorest. Such projects include community health,
non-formal education, the improvement of food supplies, agricultural training,
water supply and irrigation. Expenditure on the Scheme in 1984 was some £3-3
million.
Voluntary agencies' work on behalf of refugees overseas also receives official
support.
Britain favours the continuing evolution of the existing world economic system
with its free flow of trade and capital, and has defended the independence of
efficient international institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. As constituted
these institutions serve the vital interests of all nations and their work reflects
the growing interdependence of developed and developing countries.
Britain also supports the important role of the International Monetary Fund in
providing financial assistance, the level of which has recently been substantially
increased, to help developing countries to carry out adjustment measures to
overcome balance of payments difficulties.
The British Government recognises that the interests of developing and
industrialised countries are mutual and that all will benefit if the problems of
the world economy can be effectively tackled. Despite the recession Britain seeks
to defend the open trading system. Although domestic priorities have obliged
the Government to adopt restrictive measures in certain highly sensitive areas,
it is conscious of their exceptional character. Moreover, as a member of the
European Community, Britain has played a significant role in determining the
nature of its trade arrangements, which are among the most liberal applied by
industrial nations. It took a major part in the negotiations on successive Lome
Conventions, both to safeguard the trading interests of Commonwealth
developing countries and to ensure that reciprocal preferences would not be
demanded from the developing countries. In addition, Britain has supported
improvements to the Community’s Generalised System of Preferences scheme,
especially with regard to more liberal access into the Community for imports of
manufactured and processed agricultural products and in its application to the
poorest developed countries, particularly those in south Asia. Before entering
the Community, Britain secured a commitment to expand and reinforce
Community trade relations with the Commonwealth countries of Asia, and this
92
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
has led to the conclusion of commercial co-operation agreements with India, Sri
Lanka and Bangladesh. Britain remains committed to the objectives of the 1973
Tokyo Declaration, namely the further liberalisation of world trade through the
progressive dismantling of tariff and non-tariff barriers, and within this, the
provision of special and more favourable treatment for the developing countries
where possible.
Britain has long recognised the importance of commodities to the economies
of many developing countries and played a full part, in company with other
European Community member states, in negotiating the commodities agree¬
ments called for by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in
its 1976 resolution establishing the Integrated Programme for Commodities
(IPC). It is a member of agreements covering tin, rubber, cocoa and coffee, the
purpose of which is to stabilise prices and supplies at levels fair and
remunerative both to producers and consumers. It is also a member of an
agreement for jute, largely concerned with research and development, and a
similar agreement for tropical timber. Neither contains any economic provi¬
sions. As a member of the Community, Britain belongs to agreements covering
wheat and olive oil designed to improve market conditions by consultations
between producers and consumers, and the Community is a member of a purely
administrative agreement for sugar. Britain ratified the Common Fund for
Commodities, another element of the IPC, in 1981, and has agreed to contribute
to the voluntary as well as to the obligatory part of its work. A substantial British
contribution is made to the STABEX scheme operated by the Community which
compensates commodity-producing Lome Convention countries for shortfalls in
commodity revenue.
4 Defence
Organisation
and
Management
The primary objectives of Britain's defence policy are to ensure the country’s
security, to preserve peace with freedom, and to enable it to pursue, by just and
peaceful means, its legitimate interests both at home and abroad. Britain's
policy is based on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), a defensive
alliance whose collective strength provides each of its members with far greater
security than any could achieve alone. Britain is fully committed to NATO and its
strategy of deterrence and, in assigning directly or indirectly to NATO the vast
majority of its forces and 95 per cent of its defence budget, makes a major
contribution to the full range of the Alliance’s deterrent capabilities, the only
European nation to do so.1 It also plays a full part in the Alliance’s efforts,
complementary to its defence preparations, to negotiate balanced and verifiable
arms control agreements and to reduce tension so as to achieve a more just and
lasting peace in Europe.
The defence budget for 1985—86 is just over £18,000 million: a real increase of
some 3 per cent over the previous year. In 1981, the Government committed
itself to implement in full the 1977 NATO target of real annual increases in
defence expenditure in the region of 3 per cent up to 1985—86. This has been
achieved, and the budget for 1985—86 is about one-fifth larger in real terms than
in 1978—79. Britain's defence expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic
product was 5 3 per cent in 1984, the highest in NATO after the United States
and Greece, and in both absolute and per capita terms it was larger than that of
any other European NATO nation. In addition, Britain spends a higher
proportion of its defence budget on equipment (46 per cent) than any other
NATO country.
Britain’s defence programme is designed to ensure the most effective use of
these resources in pursuit of its commitment to Western security, the main
threat to which is posed by the nuclear and conventional forces of the Warsaw
Pact. As outlined in the 1981 defence review,2 the structure and balance of the
defence forces have been improved to increase the combat effectiveness of
front-line forces and so enhance Britain's contribution to NATO. As a result of
these improvements Britain also has the flexibility, as shown in the 1982
Falklands crisis, to respond quickly and effectively to challenges to its interests
outside the NATO area.
The Ministry of Defence has been reorganised to improve policy formulation and
to tighten control over the defence budget, while devolving responsi¬
bility for day-to-day management to the Services and the Procurement Execu¬
tive.
The new structure contains a unified military/civilian Defence Staff respon¬
sible for defence policy and strategy, operational requirements and commit¬
ments; it reports to the Chief of Defence Staff and the Permanent Under-
Seeretary through a new Vice-Chief of Defence Staff. An Office of Management
and Budget reporting to the Permanent Under-Secretary is concerned with
budgetary control and resource management. Each Service Chief of Staff reports
' France, which also has nuclear forces, does not participate in NATO's integrated military
structure.

through the Chief of Defence Staff to the Secretary of State on matters related to
the fighting effectiveness, management, overall efficiency and morale of his
Service. The management of the three Services is exercised through executive
committees of the Service Boards, which are chaired by their respective Chiefs of
Staff, and act in accordance with centrally determined policy objectives and
budgets. The Procurement Executive is headed by the Chief of Defence
Procurement and a new post of Chief of Defence Equipment Collaboration has
been established to promote collaborative procurement with allies and friendly
nations.
The Government attaches high priority to making the most effective use of
available defence resources through greater efficiency and value for money. A
management information system enables ministers and senior management to
scrutinise the activities, costs and efficiency of all areas of the Ministry.
Increased awareness of the need to manage resources cost-effectively is being
promoted, with managers becoming more accountable for the resources
allocated.
NATO's deterrent strategy is based on the principle that peace and stability can
be maintained only if a potential aggressor is convinced that it would lose far
more than it could ever hope to gain by the use of force. NATO neither needs nor
intends to match the Warsaw Pact man for man or weapon for weapon, but seeks
to deter aggression by having enough forces to respond effectively to an attack at
any level and, if necessary, to raise the level of conflict to make clear the
Alliance’s ability and determination to go on resisting. For this it needs a wide
range of conventional and nuclear forces. This concept of flexible response is
complemented by that of forward defence, the stationing of members' forces well
forward in Europe to emphasise the allies’ collective determination and
commitment to defend the whole of NATO territory.
In order to maintain the Alliance's defence and deterrent capacity, NATO
members have agreed, among other things, to improve their conventional
defences, including a doubling of funds for infrastructure projects such as
airfield and port facilities and communications systems, an increase in
ammunition stocks and the continued exploitation of new technology (including
the co-ordination of research and procurement). NATO’s intermediate-range
nuclear forces are also being modernised. Britain is actively involved in these
measures, and is also updating its own strategic nuclear capability.
The NATO allies have acknowledged the continuing Soviet threat to Western
interests outside the NATO area and recognised the need, in the last resort, for
those members with the means to do so to take action in consultation with their
allies. At the same time, the NATO allies recognise the right of regional countries
to self-determination and, as far as possible, to defend themselves. In the
Government's view, these principles can best be satisfied through the provision
of military assistance, including training courses in Britain, the loan of British
Service personnel and the sale of defence equipment. Britain's commitment to
these principles is also demonstrated by the periodic deployment of forces to
strategically important areas and by the maintenance of a capability to intervene
militarily in the last resort.
Britain s contribution to NATO is concentrated in areas where it can best help to
maintain Alliance security, principally NATO's strategic nuclear deterrent and
the defence of the Central Region of Europe, the Eastern Atlantic and English
Channel, and the British home- base and its immediate approaches.
Britain’s Polaris strategic force with its improved Chevaline missile (to be
replaced by a Trident force in the 1990s) represents a unique European
contribution to NATO’s nuclear deterrent, providing a second and independent

centre of decision-making within the Alliance. This provides an important
insurance against any Warsaw Pact misconception that the United States would
not be prepared to use its nuclear forces in Europe’s defence. Britain has also
committed its other nuclear systems to NATO, and is providing bases for 160 of
the 464 ground-launched cruise missiles which, with 108 Pershing II missiles,
the United States began deploying in Europe from December 1983 in order to
modernise NATO's intermediate-range nuclear forces.
Britain’s decision to update its strategic deterrent has led to increased calls
from some groups within the country for unilateral nuclear disarmament, both
on the grounds of cost and as an example to others. While the Government
understands the widespread concern regarding nuclear war, it believes such
apprehensions to be misplaced so long as the policy of deterrence and efforts to
relax East-West tensions, including the pursuit of arms control, which have
helped to maintain peace in Europe for 40 years, are continued. It also believes
that unilateral nuclear disarmament by Britain would not significantly alter the
views on arms control of other states which possess, or may think of acquiring,
nuclear weapons, and that such action would weaken NATO’s ability to deter
aggression in the face of the continuing Soviet nuclear and conventional threat.
Virtually all of the Royal Navy, the largest NATO navy in Western Europe, is
earmarked for assignment to the Alliance and permanent contributions are
made to NATO’s two standing naval forces, in the Atlantic and the Channel, and
to its Mediterranean force when activated. The British Army of the Rhine
(BAOR) and Royal Air Force (RAF) Germany are stationed in the Federal Republic
of Germany. BAOR’s combat element consists of three strong divisions, with
supporting artillery; two divisions comprise three armoured brigades each and a
third is made up of an armoured brigade, an air-mobile brigade and an infantry
brigade (the latter being located in Britain in peacetime). A reinforcing division,
comprising one regular and two Territorial Army brigades, is also located in
Britain. On mobilisation, BAOR’s peacetime strength of around 55,000 would
be almost trebled by rapid reinforcement from Britain. Nearly all the RAF’s
combat and support aircraft are assigned to NATO. RAF Germany’s 14
squadrons (two of helicopters) are equipped for strike/attack, reconnaissance,
close support, air defence and air transport roles, while RAF Strike Command,
which is based in Britain, provides forces for these and for the maritime patrol
and anti-submarine warfare roles.
Britain also provides important elements to NATO’s specialist reinforcement
forces, including ground and air units for the United Kingdom Mobile Force and
for its contribution to the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force, several
squadrons for NATO’s Strategic Air Reserve, and naval, marine and some Army
units for a British-Netherlands amphibious force.
Forces from all three Services are stationed at Gibraltar, which, positioned at
the western entry to the Mediterranean, is an important base for NATO.
Britain’s contribution to NATO is part of the wider effort which the European
allies make to the defence of the West, including the protection of their common
interests outside the NATO area. Since the security of each NATO member is
inextricably linked to that of the others, European forces are essential to the
defence of the North American continent. There is no substitute for the United
States’ nuclear guarantee nor for North American forces stationed in Europe in
peacetime; but, of NATO's ready forces in Europe, the European allies provide
about 90 per cent of the manpower, 80 per cent of combat aircraft, 85 per cent of
tanks and 95 per cent of armoured divisions, as well as 70 per cent of the
fighting ships in European and Eastern Atlantic waters. They also provide some
7 million men and women on active and reserve duties and are able to supply
around 900 military facilities for United States forces and essential support

requirements such as communications and transport. European members of
the Alliance have on average increased their defence expenditure by 27 per cent
in real terms since 1970.
Britain and its European allies recognise the value of co-operation and
collaboration by playing a full part in the Independent European Programme
Group, a body committed to promoting intra-European arms collaboration and
to facilitating a more balanced trade in armaments between Western Europe and
North America, and in the Conference of National Armament Directors, the
forum for defence equipment collaboration across the Atlantic. They also work
together in the Eurogroup, formed following a British initiative in 1968, to
improve the effectiveness of their contributions to the Alliance and to achieve
better use of available resources through closer co-ordination. In order to
provide further impetus towards European security and co-operation, Britain
and the six other members of the Western European Union have agreed to
reactivate the organisation, which was created by the modified Brussels Treaty
of 1954 and which discusses European defence and security matters. The
Treaty, which was signed by Belgium, Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany,
France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, also enshrines Britain’s
commitment to the stationing of British ground and air forces in the Federal
Republic of Germany.
In support of other defence commitments, and with a view to playing a part in
collective responses by the West to threats to its world-wide interests, Britain is
maintaining and improving its ability to operate outside the NATO area without
diminishing its central commitment to the Alliance. It has an airborne brigade
which can move large numbers of men and their equipment to trouble spots
should the need arise. British garrisons are maintained in Belize, Brunei,
Cyprus, the Falkland Islands and Hong Kong. Britain also makes a contribution
to the United Nations Force in Cyprus and provides support for the United
Nations Force in Lebanon. In addition it contributes to the Multinational Force
and Observers in Sinai. Considerable effort is devoted to the provision of
military assistance and training to a large number of friendly countries outside
the NATO area, and Britain deploys its forces on visits and exercises in
important areas.
Army units continue to provide support to the Royal Ulster Constabulary in its
fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland. It has, however, been possible to
reduce their numbers in recent years as the police have enhanced their
capability for maintaining law and order in the face of the threat. Much of the
Army's support to the police is provided by the Ulster Defence Regiment,
comprising both full- and part-time members who are recruited locally.
The total strength of the armed forces, all volunteers, was 326,900 on 1 January
1985—70,600 in the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines, 163,000 in the Army
and 93,200 in the Royal Air Force. The Ministry of Defence employs about
174,700 civilians (based in the United Kingdom).
The three women's Services, with a combined strength of 16,400, are integral
parts of the armed forces, and servicewomen serve alongside servicemen in
Britain and overseas, mainly in support roles.
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks range from 3 to 22 years, with a
wide freedom of choice on the length and terms of service. Subject to a minimum
period of service (varying from three to nine years, excluding training), entrants
may leave at any time, at 18 months' notice. Discharge may also be granted on
compassionate grounds, by purchase, or on grounds of conscience. Commis¬

educational and other qualifications, are granted for short, medium and long
terms. All three Services have schemes for school, university and college
sponsorships.
Non-commissioned personnel receive basic training supplemented by further
and specialist training throughout their careers. Study for educational quali¬
fications is encouraged and Service trade and technical training, highly valued
by industry, leads to nationally recognised qualifications for large numbers of
Service personnel.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training at the Britannia Royal Naval
College, Dartmouth; the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst; or the Royal Air
Force College, Cranwell. This is followed by specialist training, often including
degree courses at university or Service establishments. Higher training for
officers is provided by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, the Army Staff College
at Camberley, and the Royal Air Force Staff College at Bracknell. Selected senior
officers and civilian officials from Britain and other countries attend the Joint
Services Defence College, Greenwich, and the Royal College of Defence Studies,
London, which provides the wider background necessary for those destined to
fill higher appointments.
Operational training includes joint-Service and inter-allied exercises. Train¬
ing is provided for the armed forces of allied. Commonwealth and other
countries.
Reserve and auxiliary forces are an integral part of the armed forces. In addition
to supplementing the regular forces on mobilisation with trained personnel able
immediately to take their places either as formed units or as individual
reinforcements, they form an important link between the Services and the civil
community. Some members of these forces have a reserve liability following a
period of regular service (regular reserve); others are volunteers who train in
their spare time. Volunteer reserve forces include the Territorial Army, whose
role is to reinforce the ground forces committed to NATO and help to maintain a
secure home base in the United Kingdom; its strength is being increased to
86,000 over the remainder of the decade. From 1985, a Home Service Force,
linked to the Territorial Army and with an initial strength of 5,000, is being
established to assist in guarding important civilian and military installations on
mobilisation. Other volunteer forces include the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal
Marines Reserve, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the Royal Air Force Volunteer
Reserve. All have been expanded substantially in recent years or are planned to
increase in strength in the near future. The Ulster Defence Regiment, with
locally recruited and mostly part-time members, supports the police and the
Army in Northern Ireland. On 1 January 1985 regular reserves totalled 203,300,
and volunteer reserves and auxiliary forces 86,300. Cadet forces, which make a
significant contribution to recruitment to the regular forces, totalled 139,100.
The Royal Navy's Polaris force com prises four nuclear submarines, each of which
can remain on underwater patrol for long periods and is capable of carrying 16
nuclear-armed Polaris missiles. The missile system, improved by the Chevaline
programme, will maintain the force’s effectiveness until it is replaced in the
mid-1990s by a Trident nuclear submarine force. The Trident programme,
which will cost an estimated £9,285 million (at 1984-85 prices), is expected to
account on average for about 3 per cent of the planned defence budget over the
period of its procurement, and for about 6 per cent of the equipment budget.
Britain's naval forces, while capable of operating throughout the world when
required, are concentrated in the Eastern Atlantic and English Channel where
they constitute the majority of forces immediately available to NATO. They
include three new Invincible class anti-submarine warfare carriers, carrying Sea
98
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Army Combat
Forces
King anti-submarine and airborne early warning helicopters. Sea Harrier
aircraft, and Sea Dart defence missile systems; 14 nuclear-powered attack
submarines (with another four on order) equipped with torpedoes and the
Sub-Harpoon anti-ship missile, and 15 diesel-powered submarines; and 53
destroyers and frigates for air defence, anti-submarine and general purpose
duties. Most of these have weapon-carrying helicopters (the Lynx, Wasp or
Wessex), and armaments installed include the Exocet surface-to-surface, Sea
Wolf point air defence. Sea Dart area air defence and Sea Skua anti-ship missile
systems, and the Ikara anti-submarine guided weapons system. There is also an
amphibious capability comprising two assault ships, Fearless and Intrepid,
supporting vessels and the Royal Marines. Other ships include 40 mine
counter-measures vessels, including ten of the new Hunt and 11 of the River
classes, and offshore patrol vessels for protecting fishing interests and oil and
gas installations.
In coming years Britain’s contribution to NATO's maritime defence will be
based increasingly on an enhanced anti-submarine warfare element made up
principally of nuclear-powered attack submarines, a newly designed general
purpose frigate with a strong anti-submarine warfare capability (the Type 23)
and Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft equipped with Search water radar. These
apart, the surface fleet is being renewed through a major construction
programme involving seven Type 22 frigates (increasing the number to 14). The
destroyer/frigate element committed to NATO will be reduced to about 50 ships
by the late 1980s as older and more manpower-intensive ships are disposed of.
New weapon programmes include the Harpoon surface-to-surface guided missile
system for the Type 23 and later Type 22 frigates, the Spearfish heavyweight
torpedo for submarines, the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile and the development of
vertically launched Sea Wolf point-defence missiles.
Most of the Army’s combat forces, consisting of BAOR and the forces stationed
in Britain, have primary roles in support of NATO. Others are stationed overseas
in support of treaty commitments.
All armoured regiments in BAOR are equipped with the Challenger or
Chieftain main battle tanks. Challenger, fitted with Chobham armour to provide
greatly improved protection, has been entering service since 1984 and enough
have been ordered to equip six regiments. Chieftains replaced by Challenger will
be placed in the war maintenance reserve. An improvements programme is
planned for both tanks, which will be fitted with thermal imaging sights and a
new 120-mm high-pressure gun. Tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles
include Scorpion, a light tank with a 76-mm gun; Scimitar, a reconnaissance
vehicle with a 30-mm cannon; and Striker, which mounts the Swingfire
long-range anti-tank missile. The primary tracked armoured personnel carrier
for mechanised infantry units is the FV432. The mobility of infantry is being
improved with the introduction of the Saxon (a four-wheeled armoured
personnel carrier) and, later in the decade, the mechanised combat vehicle,
MCV80. The crew-portable Milan anti-tank missile system is widely deployed
with BAOR infantry units and will be joined in a few years by the man-portable
light anti-tank weapon, LAW80. Lynx helicopters are fitted with the TOW
long-range anti-tank weapon. Artillery units have been strengthened by the
introduction of the towed howitzer, FH70, and the purchase of additional M109
self-propelled guns, both of which fire 155-mm ammunition. Another 155-mm
gun, the SP70, will enter service later in the decade, as will the Multiple Launch
Rocket System. Tactical nuclear support is provided by the Lance missile and
dual capable artillery. Integral air defence is based on the Rapier missile system,
improved tracked versions of which are being introduced, and the Blowpipe and
Javelin man-portable missiles.

Aircraft of the Royal Air Force fulfil various operational roles.
Phantom and Lightning aircraft, together with Rapier and Bloodhound
surface-to-air missiles, provide Britain’s air defence, assisted by Shackleton
airborne early warning aircraft and the ground radars of the United Kingdom Air
Defence Ground Environment system. The Tornado GR1 is replacing Buc¬
caneers and Jaguars in the strike/attack role and will, in due course, replace
some Jaguars in the reconnaissance role. Harrier GR3s and some Jaguars
provide close air support to ground troops. Nimrod aircraft form part of Britain's
anti-submarine warfare capability, their duties also involving long-range
maritime patrol against surface ships, offshore surveillance and fishery
protection. Buccaneers are now employed in an anti-ship role and are equipped
with the Sea Eagle missile. Victor tankers, together with some converted
Hercules aircraft, are used for in-flight refuelling. Tactical transport is provided
by VC10 and Hercules aircraft, medium and light support being given by
Chinook, Puma and Wessex helicopters. Sea King and Wessex helicopters
perform search and rescue duties around the British Isles. Weapons in service
include Skyflash, Sparrow, Sidewinder, Martel and Sea Eagle missiles, and
guided and cluster bombs.
The Royal Air Force is undergoing a comprehensive re-equipment programme.
Improvements to Britain’s air defences include the replacement of the Lightning
and some of the Phantom squadrons with the air defence version of the Tornado
(of which 165 aircraft have been ordered); the development of the Nimrod
airborne early warning aircraft which will replace the Shackleton as Britain’s
contribution to NATO’s integrated airborne early warning force; and modernisa¬
tion of the radars and command, control and communications systems for the
United Kingdom Air Defence Ground Environment. In addition, 72 Hawk
trainer aircraft are being equipped with air-to-air missiles and cannon for local
air defence. An increased air-to-air refuelling capability will be achieved with the
introduction into service of converted VC 10s and TriStars in the tanker role.
The offensive power of the Royal Air Force has been substantially enhanced by
the introduction into service of the Tornado GR1 (of which 220 have been
ordered), and the procurement of 60 Harrier GR5s, an Anglo-American improved
version of the existing aircraft, which will be delivered in the late 1980s. All
strike/attack and offensive support aircraft will be installed with advanced
electronic warfare equipment to increase their ability to survive, and the
Tornado GR1 will carry the British JP233 airfield attack weapon, ALARM (an
all-British anti-radiation missile), and a Sky Shadow pod carrying counter¬
measures equipment.
Defence Procurement
Responsibility for the planning of research, development and production of
defence equipment, which takes nearly half of the defence budget, lies with the
Ministry of Defence’s Procurement Executive. The Executive works with the
Service users and industry to achieve cost-effectiveness in equipment procure¬
ment.
Research is undertaken by the Ministry’s research establishments, which have a
very wide technological capability. The Ministry also sponsors a substantial
amount of research by industry and the universities. More than £380 million is
expected to be spent on defence research in 1985—86. Nearly all subsequent
design and development of defence equipment is carried out in industry. The
Ministry is also increasingly seeking to involve industry in the planning of the
research programme, in the promotion of civil applications and in the transfer
to the civil sector of technologies generated in the research establishments. As
100

Defence Sales
part of the Government’s policy of improving the strength of Britain’s science
base, ways of promoting closer collaboration with academic institutions in areas
of strategic research are being explored.
The need for a more efficient use of resources is well recognised by NATO
members, and Britain plays a full part in the Conference of National Armaments
Directors and in the Independent European Programme Group, both of which
have as a principal aim the encouragement of greater armaments co-operation
within the Alliance. Nevertheless, the importance of maintaining a sound
national industrial base for defence procurement is recognised, and there is
close consultation between government and industry in the National Defence
Industries Council and other specialised bodies.
Successful European collaborative projects have included the Jaguar and
Tornado aircraft, a number of helicopters, and the Martel missile. At present
Britain is working with the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy on a
self-propelled gun (SP70), with Italy on the EH101 helicopter, and with France
and the Federal Republic of Germany on a new generation of anti-tank guided
weapons. In addition, Britain is to participate with the Federal Republic of
Germany and Italy in the design, development and production of a supersonic
fighter aircraft: Britain and the Federal Republic of Germany will each have a 38
per cent share of the work, Italy providing the remainder.
Britain also favours increased transatlantic co-operation and, together with
other European countries, is working with the United States on the Multiple
Launch Rocket System and the development of advanced air-to-air missiles.
Equipment is manufactured in private firms and publicly owned industries. In
January 1985 the Royal Ordnance Factories, formerly part of the Ministry of
Defence, became an independent commercial organisation, Royal Ordnance pic.
Although it is still wholly government owned, the Government intends to
introduce private capital into the company in the next few years. The purpose of
the change is to promote more extensive and effective competition in the supply
of defence equipment in order to obtain greater value for money, more efficient
use of resources and better innovation. Servicing and repairs are carried out by
private industry as well as in Ministry-owned facilities such as the Royal
Dockyards.
Sales of British defence equipment enable allies and friendly governments to
take advantage of Britain’s extensive research and development programmes to
improve their own defence. The Defence Export Services Organisation of the
Ministry of Defence provides a wide range of assistance to industry in promoting
equipment and negotiating contracts with overseas customers. This includes
collecting market information, demonstrating equipment, providing expert
military advice, training and support, staging exhibitions and negotiating with
overseas governments. Government and private companies employ Internation¬
al Military' Services Ltd to obtain and carry out export contracts for British
defence equipment and associated services. It is estimated that receipts from
defence sales in 1985—86 will amount to £2,500 million. This is a significant
contribution to Britain’s total exports and sustains some 130,000 jobs.
Civil Defence
Civil defence arrangements are based on the extended and adapted use of the
peacetime resources of government departments, local authorities, emergency
services and nationalised industries, supplemented by the efforts of voluntary
organisations and individual volunteers. Civil defence regulations introduced in
1983 require local authorities to make and keep up to date plans fdr a range of
DEFENCE

essential functions in the event of war; to arrange training and exercises for civil
defence staff and volunteers; and to provide suitable emergency centres for
direction of civil defence in wartime.
Following a review of existing arrangements by the Home Office in 1980,
expenditure on civil defence has been growing steadily and reached £80 million
in 1985—86. This is being used to improve the quality and readiness of central
and local government planning; increase training opportunities arranged by the
Home Office on staff college lines at the Civil Defence College, Easingwold; help
local authorities to plan for better community involvement in civil defence; and
improve the emergency system for decentralised government control and
communications. Improvements are also being made in the communications,
equipment and administrative facilities of the United Kingdom Warning and
Monitoring Organisation. This includes the civilian Royal Observer Corps,
which is organised to provide public warning of an attack, of the location and
strength of nuclear explosions, and of the distribution and level of radioactive
fall-out.
5 Justice and the
Law
The Criminal
Law
The Law
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary state, England and Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland all have their own legal systems and law courts. There is
substantial similarity on many points, but considerable differences remain in
law, organisation and practice. In Northern Ireland procedure closely resembles
that of England and Wales but there are often differences in enacted law.
However, a large volume of modern legislation applies throughout the United
Kingdom and there is a common distinction between criminal law, concerned
with wrongful acts harmful to the community, and civil law, concerned with
individuals’ rights, duties and obligations towards one another.
The main sources of law are legislation, common law and European
Community law. Legislation consists of Acts of Parliament, Orders (rules and
regulations made by ministers under the authority of an Act of Parliament) and
by-laws made by local government or other authorities exercising powers
conferred by Parliament. Common law, the ancient law of the land deduced from
custom and interpreted in court cases by the judges, has never been precisely
defined or codified but forms the basis of the law except when superseded by
legislation. European Community law is confined mainly to economic and social
matters; in certain circumstances it takes precedence over domestic law. It is
normally applied by the domestic courts, but the most authoritative rulings are
given by the European Court of Justice.
Criminal Justice
There are four distinct stages in British criminal justice: making laws which
define prohibited acts and provide for the treatment of offenders; preventing
crime and enforcing the law—largely matters for the police; determining in the
courts the guilt or innocence of people accused of crimes, and sentencing the
guilty; and dealing with convicted offenders.
Action being taken by the Government in pursuit of its general strategy for the
criminal justice system is aimed at maintaining and encouraging public
confidence in the system, achieving greater efficiency in the police service and in
courts’ procedures, and retaining the proper balance between the rights of the
citizen and the needs of the community as a whole.
With continuing concern in Britain, as in many other countries, over rising
crime rates, public expenditure on the law and order programme reflects the
special priority given by the Government to these services. Recent increases have
been made to cover, in particular, greater police manpower, the probation
service and extra spending on prison building. More than two-thirds of total
expenditure is initially incurred by local authorities (with the help of central
government grants), mainly on the police service.
The criminal law, like the law generally, is interpreted by the courts but changes
in the law are matters for Parliament. In practice most legislation affecting
104
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Crime Statistics
Criminological
Research
criminal law is government-sponsored, but there is usually consultation
between government departments and the legal profession, the police, the
probation service (in Scotland, the social work agencies), and voluntary bodies.
Chief constables in England and Wales must supply statistics relating to
offences, offenders, criminal proceedings and the state of crime in their areas.
Crime statistics are published annually by the Home Office and further
information about crime trends (as well as about police matters) appears in the
annual reports of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary and (for London)
the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Similar arrangements operate in
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Differences in the legal systems, police recording practices and statistical
classifications in the countries of the United Kingdom make it impracticable to
analyse in detail trends in crime for the country as a whole. Nevertheless, it is
clear that, as in Western Europe generally, there has been a substantial increase
in crime since the early 1950s. However, official statistics cover only crime
recorded by the police and may thus be affected by changes in the proportion of
crimes which are undiscovered or unreported. The level of police manning and
deployment of the force may also affect recording.
Table 4 shows the rate of notifiable offences recorded by the police in 1984 in
England and Wales. While The British Crime Survey (published in 1983-84 by
the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department) found that the
incidence of crime was higher than the official statistics suggested, it also
showed that the risks which people in Britain faced of being victims of serious
crime were remarkably small.

a Including offences of trafficking in controlled drugs.
The number of notifiable offences recorded by the police in England and Wales
in 1984 was 3-5 million; 35 per cent were cleared up. The Scottish police
recorded 474,900 crimes, of which 31 per cent were cleared up.
A wide range of research into criminal and social policies is carried out by the
Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department. Research is also
carried out in university departments, much of it financed by the Government.
The principal university criminological research establishment is the Institute
of Criminology at Cambridge.

THE POLICE
SERVICE
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme provides compensation to victims
of violent crimes (including violence within the family), to people hurt while
trying to arrest offenders and prevent offences and to those bereaved as a result
of violence. Compensation is assessed on the basis of common law damages and
usually takes the form of a lump-sum payment. In 1983—84, 21,133 awards were
made and the total compensation was nearly £33 million.
In Northern Ireland there is separate, statutory provision in certain circum¬
stances for compensation from public funds for criminal injuries, and for
malicious damage to property including the resulting losses of profits.
There has been a recent growth in the number of locally run victim support
schemes in which voluntary workers visit and offer practical help to the victims
of crime.
Legislation to protect the public against terrorism has given the authorities
certain exceptional powers for dealing with and preventing terrorist activities. It
is embodied in two Acts of Parliament which take account of the need to achieve
a proper balance between the safety of the public and the rights of the
individual. While acknowledging that the special powers make inroads into civil
liberties the Government believes that they should continue in force as long as a
substantial terrorist threat remains. Both Acts must be renewed regularly by
Parliament and both have been subject to independent scrutiny. Nobody can be
imprisoned for political beliefs; all prisoners, except those awaiting trial, have
been found guilty in court of criminal offences.
The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 (first introduced in
1973), which is in force in Northern Ireland, provides the security forces with
special powers to search, question and arrest suspected terrorists; allows the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to proscribe terrorist organisations and
provides for certain serious offences to be tried by a judge sitting alone without a
jury, to obviate the dangers of intimidation of jurors. The Prevention of
Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984 (first introduced in 1974), which is
applicable throughout the United Kingdom, provides for the exclusion from
Great Britain, Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom of people connected with
terrorism related to Northern Ireland affairs. It also gives the police powers to
arrest people suspected of being involved in terrorism (whether international or
in Northern Ireland) without warrant and hold them for 48 hours and, with the
approval of the Secretary of State, for up to a further five days. The Act has a total
life of five years.
The security forces in Northern Ireland are subject to the law and can be
prosecuted for criminal offences. Procedures for handling complaints against
the police involve two independent elements: the Director of Public Prosecutions
if allegations of criminal conduct are made; and the Police Complaints Board for
Northern Ireland when complaints relate only to disciplinary offences.
The Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 makes it possible to try in Northern
Ireland a person accused of certain offences committed in the Irish Republic. It
also enables evidence to be obtained in Northern Ireland for the trial of offences
in the Irish Republic. Reciprocal legislation is in force in the Irish Republic.
British police action in enforcing the law rests mainly upon common consent,
for there is only a small number of officers in relation to the population (roughly
one officer to every 400 or so people). Officers do not normally carry firearms
(their only weapon is a truncheon) and there are strict limitations on police
powers.
The powers of the police in England and Wales have been modernised and
clarified by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which at the same time
has enhanced safeguards for the citizen. The majority of its provisions, which
106

Police
Authorities and

Constables

Authorities
permeate every aspect of police work, will be in force by early 1986. The Act does
not generally extend to Scotland, where separate legislation applies.
The involvement of the police with regard to the interception of communica¬
tions is outlined in the Interception of Communications Act 1985, which
establishes a statutory framework for the interception of telecommunications
and postal services and sets out the grounds on which certain Secretaries of
State are empowered to authorise interception. So far as the police are
concerned, these are the prevention and detection of serious crime, but threats
to national security and to the United Kingdom's economic well-being also
constitute grounds for interception.
Each of Britain's 52 police forces is responsible for law enforcement in its area,
but there is constant co-operation among them. In order to improve their
effectiveness, forces pay particular attention to ensuring that manpower and
other resources are used as efficiently as possible.
Outside London most counties (regions in Scotland) have their own police
forces, though in the interests of efficiency several have combined forces. The
policing of London is in the hands of the Metropolitan Police Force, with
headquarters at New Scotland Yard, and the City of London force. The strength
of the regular police force in Great Britain at the end of 1984 was over 132,100
(including over 11,700 policewomen); in Northern Ireland the strength of the
regular Royal Ulster Constabulary was almost 11,000, including over 2,600
full-time members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve. The strength of the
Metropolitan Police Force, 26,800, is at its highest ever. It is recognised that the
composition of the police force should reflect the make-up of a multiracial
society and efforts are being made to encourage more members of the ethnic
minorities to join the forces.
Each regular police force is maintained by a police authority. In England and
Wales, these are committees of local councillors and magistrates, and in
Scotland, they are the regional and islands councils. The police authority for the
Metropolitan Police Force is the Home Secretary. In Northern Ireland the police
authority is appointed by the Secretary of State.
The police authority's primary duty is to provide an efficient police force for its
area. Its functions, some subject to ministerial approval, include appointing the
chief constable, deputy chief constable and assistant chief constables; fixing the
maximum permitted strength of the force; and providing buildings and
equipment. In the Metropolitan Police area the commissioner of police and his
immediate subordinates are appointed on the recommendation of the Home
Secretary. The police authorities are financed by central and local government.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police forces
and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below assistant
chief constable. They are generally answerable to the police authorities on
matters of efficiency, and must submit a report every year.
The Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland are concerned with the organisation, administration and operation of
the police service. They approve the appointment of chief, deputy and assistant
chief constables, and may require a police authority to retire a chief constable in
the interests of efficiency, call for a report from a chief constable on matters
relating to local policing or institute a local inquiry. They can make regulations
covering such matters as police ranks; qualifications for appointment, promo- j
tion and retirement; discipline: hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances; and
uniform. Some of these regulations are first negotiable within the Police

Duties
Negotiating Board for the United Kingdom, which has an independent chairman
and representatives of the police authorities, police staff associations and the
home departments. Matters of a non-negotiable kind and general questions are
discussed by the Police Advisory Boards.
All police forces (except the Metropolitan Police, for which the Home Secretary
is directly responsible) are subject to inspection by inspectors of constabulary
reporting to the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland or the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Inspectors maintain close touch with the
forces they inspect and have advisory functions.
A British police officer is not employed by or under the direction of the police
authority or of the Government, and may be sued or prosecuted for any wrongful
act committed in carrying out duties. Statutory procedures, normally including
an independent element, govern the way in which complaints are handled. The
establishment in 1984 of a new Police Complaints Authority, with powers to
supervise the investigation of any serious complaint against a police officer, has
substantially reformed the complaints system in England and Wales. In
Scotland, complaints against police officers involving allegations of any form of
criminal conduct are investigated by independent public prosecutors. Relations
between the police and the community have been the subject of public
discussion for a number of years. It is recognised that the action of the police in
enforcing the law rests mainly on their ability to secure the consent and support
of the public. Police authorities in England and Wales and, for London, the
Metropolitan Police Commissioner, are required by law to make arrangements
for obtaining the views of local people on the policing of their area and for
obtaining their eo-operation in joint efforts to discourage and prevent crime.
Consultative committees now operate in most police areas and some 3,000
neighbourhood watch schemes are in existence.
Police work ranges from the protection of people and property, road or street
patrolling (the trend is increasingly away from the car patrol and back to
‘community' policing on foot) and traffic control to crime prevention, criminal
investigation and arresting offenders. In urban areas, particularly, police
officers have to deal with social problems and may bring in other social agencies
and expert help. In England and Wales (but not in Scotland) the police at present
also prosecute accused people and may decide whether to grant bail before the
court proceedings (see p 108). The main departments in all forces are the
uniform department, criminal investigation department, traffic department and
specialised departments, which in some forces include river or marine police,
mounted police, and dog handlers.
In order to release as many uniformed police officers as possible for
operational duties, police authorities employ over 38,800 civilians (including
part-time employees) on administrative and technical duties in England and
Wales and over 3,000 in Scotland. The number of civilian support staff has been
growing as forces secure economies by replacing police officers with civilians
where posts do not require police powers and training. Traffic wardens (of whom
there are nearly 5,000 in England and Wales and about 530 in Scotland) carry
out specified duties concerned with traffic and parking. Wardens are under the
control of the chief constable.
Each force has an attachment of volunteer special constables who perform
police duties in their spare time, without pay, acting mainly as auxiliaries to the
regular force. In Northern Ireland there is a part-time and full-time paid reserve.
Members of the police service may not belong to a trade union nor may they
withdraw their labour in furtherance of a trade dispute. All ranks, however, have
their own staff associations to represent their interests.

Common
Services
Powers of
Arrest
A number of common services are provided by central government departments
and by arrangements between forces. The most important are: training services:
a Forensic Science Service in England and Wales (the Metropolitan Police
maintains its own laboratory); telecommunications services which provide
police radio equipment: and central and provincial criminal records available to
all forces. Regional crime squad teams of detectives from several forces
investigate major crimes involving inquiries in more than one police area. The
Scottish Crime Squad assists forces in crime investigation and prevention.
Certain special services such as liaison with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (Interpol) are provided for other British forces by the Metropolitan
Police. The services of the Fraud Squad, run jointly by the Metropolitan Police
and City of London Police to investigate company frauds, are available in
England and Wales.
In all areas of police work the use of scientific aids is widespread. A national
police computer helps to rationalise records and speed up the dissemination of
information.
In England and Wales arrests may be made with or without a warrant issued by a
magistrate. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 established an arrest
scheme providing a general conditional power to arrest a person reasonably
suspected of any offence. However, a person can only be arrested under the
scheme if it is necessary in order to ensure that he (or she) can be brought before
a court (for example, because of failure to give a satisfactory address for service
of a summons) or in order to prevent the continuation of a specific serious
offence. In addition, the Act categorises certain offences as ‘arrestable’ or
serious arrestable' and provides a full power of arrest in respect of them for the
protection of the public.
A code of practice on detention, treatment and questioning is one of four codes
which the Home Secretary has issued under the 1984 Act. Failure to comply
with the provisions of these codes renders a police officer liable to disciplinary
proceedings.
An arrested person is entitled to consult a solicitor and to ask the police to
notify a named person likely to take an interest in his or her welfare about the
arrest. Where a person has been arrested in connection with a serious arrestable
offence, but has not yet been charged, the police may delay the exercise of these
rights in the interests of the investigation if certain criteria are met. The police
must caution a person upon arrest for an offence in most circumstances.
Questions relating to an offence may normally not be put to a person after he or
she has been charged with that offence or informed that he or she may be
prosecuted for it.
The detention scheme in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act provides that a
person may be detained only if, and for as long as, necessary for a purpose
specified by law. There is an absolute limit on detention without charge and a
person can only be detained beyond 36 hours if a warrant is obtained from a
magistrates' court. The Act allows for the possibility of detention without charge
for up to 96 hours in strictly defined and controlled cases.
Once a person has been charged, he (or she) must be released on bail unless
there are grounds for believing that detention is necessary for his own
protection, to prevent him causing harm to people or property or interfering
with witnesses or obstructing the course of justice, or that he will fail to answer
bail if released. Where a person is detained after charge, there is provision in the
Act for him or her to be brought before a court quickly. This will usually be no
later than the following day.
If bail is refused, the defendant may apply to a judge of the High Court and, if
committed to the Crown Court, may apply for bail to that court. The majority of
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
109
CRIMINAL
COURTS
people remanded by magistrates are given bail. Reviews must be made of a
person's detention, whether he or she charged or not, at regular intervals to
check whether the criteria for detention are still satisfied. If they are not, the
person must be released immediately.
A person who thinks that the grounds for detention are unlawful1 may apply
to the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus against the person who detained
him or her, requiring the person to appear before the court to justify the
detention. An application for this writ is normally made by the person detained
or by someone acting on his or her behalf. Similar procedures apply in Northern
Ireland. The Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 establishes in England and Wales
an independent prosecution service which will be responsible for the conduct of
all proceedings at present instituted by the police. Its measures include the
provision of statutory time limits on the period from arrest to commencement of
trial in criminal proceedings in England and Wales. Field trials to establish the
appropriate time limits are to be held. The new service will be in operation by late
1986.
In Scotland, the police may detain and question a suspected person for a
period of up to six hours. Thereafter the person must either be released or
charged. An arrest must be accompanied by a criminal charge. Once a person
has been charged there is little scope for questioning and only voluntary
statements will normally be allowed in evidence at the trial. The court will reject
statements unless satisfied that they have been fairly obtained. Anyone arrested
must be brought before a court with the least possible delay (generally not later
than the first day after being taken into custody), or—in less serious
cases—liberated by the police, often on a written undertaking to attend court on
a specified date. Where a prosecution on indictment is intended (that is, where
an accusation of a more serious offence is to be made), the accused is brought
before the sheriff to be committed, either for further examination or until
liberated in due course of law. A judicial examination may take place. Eight days
may elapse between commitment for further examination and commitment
until liberated in due course of law. The latter—which is also described as ‘full
committal'—is commitment for trial. No evidence requires to be presented to the
sheriff for such commitment. Anyone accused of a crime, except murder or
treason, is entitled to apply for release on bail. Money bail has been virtually
abolished and the courts, or the Lord Advocate, may release an accused person
on conditions.
Breach of any of the conditions without reasonable excuse is a separate
offence. There is a right of appeal to the High Court by the accused person
against the refusal of bail, or by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by
either party against the conditions imposed. The writ of habeas corpus does not
apply in Scotland but if a person is to be prosecuted on indictment and has been
kept in custody pending trial, the trial must begin within 110 days of the date of
full committal. The trial of a person charged with a summary offence and held in
custody must begin within 40 days.
The decision to prosecute normally rests, in England and Wales, with the police
at present (see above) and in Scotland with public prosecutors. In Northern
Ireland there is a Director of Public Prosecutions. In England and Wales (and
exceptionally in Scotland) a private person may institute criminal proceedings.
Police may issue cautions and in Scotland the public prosecutor may warn,
instead of prosecuting.
1 Detention is lawful in pursuance of criminal justice, for contempt of court or of either House oi
Parliament and when expressly authorised by Parliament. It is also sometimes lawful in the case
of the mentally disordered.

Courts in
England and
Wales
In England and Wales some offences can be prosecuted only with the consent of
the Attorney General, others only with his consent or by, or with the consent of,
the Director of Public Prosecutions, who acts under his superintendence. Such
crimes as bribery and corruption of officials, and the use and possession of
explosives, are offences requiring the Attorney General’s consent to prosecute;
in the case of incest, for example, the Director’s consent to prosecute is
sufficient. Pending the introduction of the new Crown Prosecution Service the
Director’s Office, as presently constituted, would prosecute the more serious
and sensitive criminal cases. The police must report to the Director’s office a
further list of offences, including serious offences against the person, sedition,
criminal offences by police officers, and offences relating to obscene or indecent
publications. The Director does not necessarily prosecute all such cases but may
do so in any that appear to be important or where intervention is thought
necessary; otherwise proceedings are conducted by solicitors employed by the
police. The Director also considers whether proceedings should be taken in
cases reported by the government departments, and advises the police and
others concerned with administration of the criminal law.
When cases go for trial, barristers in private practice appear on the Director’s
behalf. While much of the prosecution work at the Central Criminal Court in
London is conducted by a team of Treasury Counsel appointed by the Attorney
General, experienced barristers are also nominated from time to time to lead a
member of the Treasury team.
The prosecution process in Scotland is different from that in the rest of the
United Kingdom. The Lord Advocate is responsible for the prosecution of all
suspects but delegates most of the work to the Solicitor General (see p 125), to
12 advocates depute and to procurators fiscal. The permanent adviser to the
Lord Advocate on prosecution matters is the Crown Agent, who is head of the
procurator fiscal service and is assisted by a staff of civil servants with legal
qualifications known as the Crown Office. Prosecutions in the High Court of
Justiciary are prepared by procurators fiscal and the Crown Office and
prosecuted by the Lord Advocate, Solicitor General and advocates depute, while
crimes tried before the sheriff and district courts are prepared and prosecuted
by the procurators fiscal, who are lawyers and full-time civil servants operating
from offices within the various sheriff court districts. The police investigate
offences and report to the procurator fiscal, who decides whether to prosecute,
subject to the directions of the Crown Office.
The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, who is responsible to
the Attorney General, prosecutes all offences tried on indictment, and may do so
in summary cases of a serious nature. Other summary offences are prosecuted
by the police.
Magistrates’ courts deal with nearly all criminal cases in England and Wales, and
conduct preliminary investigations into more serious offences. The Crown
Court, situated in a number of towns and cities, takes all criminal work above
the level of magistrates’ courts and trials are held before a jury.
Magistrates’ courts hear charges against people accused of ‘summary
offences’, those that can be legally disposed of by magistrates sitting without a
jury. There are some 700 courts and some 27,250 magistrates (justices of the
peace', JPs) who are advised on points of law and procedure by a clerk to the
justices, who is also in charge of the court’s administrative arrangements. When
the clerk to the justices is not in court, the magistrates are advised by a qualified
assistant. Each court normally consists of three unpaid lay magistrates who
ascertain the facts of a case and apply the law to them. Magistrates are

appointed by the Lord Chancellor (except in Lancashire, Greater Manchester
and Merseyside, where appointments are made by the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster). In large urban areas where work is heavy, professional ‘stipendiary
magistrates, full-time, salaried and legally qualified, usually preside alone.
Magistrates must as a rule sit in open court, but when they make preliminary
inquiries into a serious case to see whether there is evidence to justify committal
for trial in the Crown Court the media may report only certain basic particulars
of the defendant, the charges and any arrangements for bail or legal aid unless
the court, at the defendant's request, lifts the reporting restrictions. Magistrates
cannot usually impose a sentence of more than six months imprisonment or a
fine exceeding £2,000. If an offence carries a higher maximum penalty and the
defendant has previous convictions, they may commit him or her for sentence at
the Crown Court if they consider their own power inadequate.
Cases involving people under 17 are heard in juvenile courts, specially
constituted magistrates’ courts which sit apart from other courts, or at a
different time; only limited publicity is allowed. If a young person under 17 is
charged jointly with someone of 17 or over, the case is heard in the ordinary
magistrates’ court. If the young person is found guilty, the court may transfer
the case to a juvenile court, unless it wishes to pass sentence itself.
The Crown Court deals with trials of the more serious cases, the sentencing of
offenders committed for sentence by magistrates’ courts, and appeals from
magistrates’ courts. It sits at about 90 centres and is presided over by High
Court judges, full-time ‘circuit judges’ and part-time recorders. All contested
trials take place before a jury. Magistrates sit with a circuit judge or recorder to
deal with appeals and committals for sentence and, on occasion, for the trial of
less serious cases.
The Crown Court may impose on a convicted offender a fine either limited by
the statutory maximum, or where there is no statutory maximum, of unlimited
amount, and, within the permitted statutory maximum, any other custodial or
non-custodial penalty.
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal to the Crown Court, if he
pleaded guilty, against the sentence; if he did not plead guilty, against the
conviction or sentence. Where the appeal is on a point of law, either the
prosecutor or the defendant may appeal from the magistrates' court to the High
Court (see p 121). Appeals from the Crown Court, either against conviction or
against sentence, are made to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). A further
appeal from the Court of Appeal to the House of Lords can be brought if the court
certifies that a point of law of general public importance is involved and it
appears to the court or the Lords that the point is one that ought to be
considered by the House. A prosecutor or defendant may appeal to the Lords
from a decision of the High Court in a criminal case.
The Attorney General may seek the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point of
law which has arisen in a case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted;
the court has power to refer the point to the House of Lords if necessary. The
acquittal in the original case is not affected, nor is the identity of the acquitted
person revealed without his or her consent.
In Scotland the High Court of Justiciary tries such crimes as murder, treason
and rape; the sheriff court is concerned with less serious offences and the
district court with minor offences. Criminal cases are heard either under solemn
procedure, when proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a
jury of 15 members, or under summary procedure, when the judge sits without a
jury. All cases in the High Court and the more serious ones in sheriff courts are
tried by a judge and jury. Summary procedure is used in the less serious cases in
112
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Northern

Trial
the sheriff courts, and in all cases in the district courts. District courts are the
administrative responsibility of the district and the islands local government
authorities. The judges are lay justices of the peace; the local authorities may
appoint up to one-quarter of their elected members to be ex-officio justices. In
Glasgow there are four stipendiary magistrates who are full-time salaried
lawyers. Children under 16 who have committed an offence or are for other
reasons specified in statute considered to need compulsory care may be brought
before a children s hearing comprising three members of the local community
(see p 119).
Scotland's six sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court districts, each
of which has a sheriff or sheriffs, who are the judges of the court.
The High Court of Justiciary, Scotland's supreme criminal court, is both a
trial and an appeal court. Any of the following judges is entitled to try cases in
the High Court: the Lord Justice General (the head of the court), the Lord
Justice Clerk (the judge next in seniority) or one of the Lord Commissioners of
Justiciary. The main seat of the courts is in Edinburgh, although the High
Court on circuit also tries cases in other towns.
All appeals are dealt with by the High Court in Edinburgh. In both solemn and
summary procedure, an appeal may be brought against conviction, or sentence,
or both. The Court may authorise a retrial if it sets aside a conviction. There is
no further appeal to the House of Lords. In summary proceedings the prosecutor
may appeal on a point of law against acquittal or sentence. The Lord Advocate
may seek the opinion of the High Court on a point of law which has arisen in a
case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted. The acquittal in the
original case is not affected.
The structure of Northern Ireland courts is broadly similar to that in England
and Wales. The day-to-day work of dealing summarily with minor cases is
carried out by magistrates' courts presided over by a full-time, legally qualified
resident magistrate. Young offenders under 17 and young people under 17 who
need care, protection and control are dealt with by juvenile courts consisting of
the resident magistrate and two lay members (at least one of whom must be a
woman) specially qualified to deal with juveniles. Appeals from magistrates’
courts are heard by the county court.
The Crown Court deals with criminal trials on indictment. It is served by High
Court and county court judges. Proceedings are heard before a single judge, and
all contested cases, other than those involving offences specified under
emergency legislation, take place before a jury. Appeals from the Crown Court
against conviction or sentence are heard by the Northern Ireland Court of
Appeal. Procedures for a further appeal to the House of Lords are similar to those
in England and Wales.
Criminal trials in the United Kingdom take the form of a contest between the
prosecution and the defence. Since the law presumes the innocence of an
accused person until guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not granted any
advantage, apparent or real, over the defence. A defendant (in Scotland, called
an accused) has the right to employ a legal adviser and may be granted legal aid
from public funds. If remanded in custody, the person may be visited by a legal
adviser to ensure a properly prepared defence. In England, Wales and Northern
Ireland during the preparation of the case, the prosecution usually tells the
defence of relevant documents which it is not proposed to put in evidence and
discloses them if asked to do so. The prosecution should also inform the defence
of witnesses whose evidence may help the accused and whom the prosecution
does not propose to call. The defence or prosecution may suggest that the
defendant’s mental state renders him or her unfit to be tried. If the jury (or in
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
113
The Jury
Coroners’
Courts
Scotland, the judge) decides that this is so, the defendant is admitted to a
specified hospital.
Criminal trials are normally in open court and rules of evidence (concerned
with the proof of facts) are rigorously applied. If evidence is illegally admitted, a
conviction can be quashed on appeal. During the trial the defendant has the
right to hear and cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution, normally
through a lawyer; to call his or her own witnesses who, if they will not attend
voluntarily, may be legally compelled to attend; and to address the court in
person or through a lawyer, the defence having the right to the last speech at the
trial. The defendant cannot be questioned without consenting to be sworn as a
witness in his or her own defence. When he or she does testify, cross-
examination about character or other conduct may be made only in exceptional
circumstances and generally the prosecution may not introduce evidence of
such matters.
Injury trials the judge decides questions of law, sums up the evidence for the
jury and instructs it on the relevant law, and discharges the accused or passes
sentence. Only the jury decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. In
England and Wales, if the jury cannot reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may
direct it to bring in a majority verdict provided that, in the normal jury of 12
people, there are not more than two dissentients. In Scotland, where the jury
consists of 15 people, the verdict may be reached by a simple majority. However,
as a general rule, no person may be convicted without corroborated evidence. If
the jury returns a verdict of‘not guilty' (or in Scotland not proven’, which is an
alternative verdict of acquittal), the prosecution has no right of appeal and the
defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. If ‘guilty' the defendant
has a right of appeal to the appropriate court. A jury is completely independent
of the judiciary. Once members are sworn in, they are protected from all
interference. Both the prosecution and the defence can object to particular
jurors. People between the ages of 18 and 65 whose names appear on the
electoral register, with certain exceptions, are liable for jury service and their
names are chosen at random. Ineligible persons include the judiciary, priests,
people who have within the previous ten years been members of the legal
profession, the Lord Chancellor's Department, or the police, prison and
probation services, and certain sufferers from mental illness. Disqualified
persons also include those sentenced to two or more years' imprisonment and
those who have, within the previous ten years, served any part of a sentence of
imprisonment, youth custody or detention, or been subject to a community
service order, or, within the previous five years, been placed on probation.
Coroners investigate violent and unnatural deaths or sudden deaths where the
cause is unknown. Cases may be brought before the local coroner (a senior
lawyer or doctor) by doctors, the police, various public authorities or members of
the public. If the death is sudden and the cause unknown, the coroner need not
hold an inquest in court, but may order a post-mortem examination to
determine cause of death. Where there is reason to believe that the deceased died
a violent or unnatural death or died in prison or in other specified circum¬
stances the coroner must hold an inquest and it is the duty of the coroner’s
court to establish how, when and where the deceased died. In Scotland the office
of coroner does not exist. The local procurator fiscal inquires privately into all
sudden and suspicious deaths and may report the findings to the Crown Office.
In a minority of cases a fatal accident inquiry may be held before the sheriff. For
certain categories (such as deaths in custody) a fatal accident inquiry is
mandatory. In addition, the Lord Advocate has discretion to instruct an inquiry

TREATMENT

Non-custodial
Treatment
in the public interest in cases where the circumstances give rise to public
concern.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a person may only be sentenced to
custodial treatment if the court is satisfied that no other sentence will suffice.
Unless that person has previously received a custodial sentence of the same
kind, he or she must also have been legally represented. In England and Wales,
extended sentences longer than the normal maximum term may be imposed on
persistent offenders. In the case of murder there is a mandatory penalty of life
imprisonment. This is the maximum penalty for a number of serious offences
such as robbery, rape, arson and manslaughter. The death penalty has been
repealed for almost all offences (including murder and the other common
serious crimes) and it is no longer used.
In Scotland similar safeguards exist in relation to the imposition of custodial
sentences. Unless the sentence is limited by statute, the maximum penalty is
determined by the status of the court trying the accused. In trials on indictment,
the High Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for any term up to life,
and the sheriff court any term up to two years but may send any person to the
High Court for sentence if the court considers its powers are insufficient. In
summary cases, the sheriff may normally impose up to three months’
imprisonment or six months for some repeated offences, although his powers
are extended by statute in some exceptional cases. In the district court the
maximum term of imprisonment is 60 days.
The commonest sentence in courts throughout the United Kingdom is a fine,
which is imposed in more than 80 per cent of cases. There is no limit to the size
of fine which may be imposed on indictment, but in summary procedure the
maximum in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is £2,000. In Scotland it is
£2,000 in the sheriff court and £1,000 in the district court.
The Government's policy is to maintain and develop an effective range of
non-custodial sentences including fines, probation and absolute discharge. In
England, Wales and Northern Ireland the court may impose conditional
discharge when it considers there is no need to impose punishment; and
‘binding over' where the offender pledges money, with or without sureties, to
keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
Offenders aged 16 or over (17 in Northern Ireland) convicted of imprisonable
offences may, with their consent, be given community service orders. The court
may order between 40 and 240 hours’ unpaid service (the maximum is 120
hours where the offender is under 17) to be completed within 12 months. (This
does not apply in Northern Ireland.) Examples of work done include decorating
the houses of old or disabled people and building adventure playgrounds. The
number of community service orders increased by 130 per cent between 1979
and 1983, in England and Wales. In Scotland the number of community service
orders made by the courts has increased from 492 in 1980 to 2,062 in 1983.
Experimental schemes have been started to enable offenders to make direct
reparation to their victims, for example, by undertaking some substantial work
for them.
The sentence imposed on an offender in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
may also, with his or her consent, be deferred for up to six months to enable a
court to take into account conduct after some expected change in circum¬
stances. In Scotland sentence may also be deferred with or without the
offender's consent. There is no limit to the length of deferment.
The courts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland may order an offender to
pay compensation for personal injury, loss or damage resulting from an offence.
Where the loss amounts to £15,000 or more they may make a criminal

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a judge is free to pass a suspended
sentence of not more than two years. The sentence is not served unless the
olfender is convicted of a further offence punishable with imprisonment; in that
event the suspended sentence normally takes effect and another sentence may
be imposed for the new offence. An offender receiving a suspended sentence of
more than six months may be placed under the supervision of a probation officer
tor all or part of the period. Courts in England and Wales have the power, when
passing a sentence of between three months' and two years’ imprisonment, to
order that part should be served and the rest held in suspense.
In certain circumstances courts may order forfeiture of property involved in
the commission of crime. An offender convicted of a serious crime may be
disqualified trom driving if a motor vehicle was used in its commission.
In most circumstances, after a rehabilitation period of from six months to ten
years depending on the nature of the sentence imposed, a person convicted of a
criminal offence need not disclose it, and the offence will not be held against him
or her. This does not apply to those with a prison sentence of more than 21/2
years.
At present in the United Kingdom the number of offenders subject to
supervision in the community considerably exceeds the number in custody. The
purpose of probation is to protect society by the rehabilitation of the offender,
who continues to live a normal life in the community while subject to the
supervision of a probation officer. Before placing an offender on probation,
which may last from six months (12 months in Scotland) to three years, the
court must explain the order in ordinary language, ensuring that the offender
consents to the requirements of the order and understands that a failure to
comply with them will make him or her liable to a penalty or to be dealt with for
the original offence. In England and Wales such an order can be made only for
offenders aged 17 years or more. In Scotland the minimum age is 16 years and in
Northern Ireland 14 years. About 15 per cent of orders contain a variety of
additional requirements concerning place of residence, attendance at day
centres or treatment for mental ill health. The probation service also adminis¬
ters supervision orders, the community service scheme and parole. In addition,
social work services are provided in custodial establishments.
In England and Wales the cost of the probation service is shared between
central and local government and it is administered locally by probation
committees of magistrates and members co-opted from the local community. In
Scotland it is administered by local authority social work departments and in
Northern Ireland by a probation board, whose membership is representative of
the community.
Probation committees provide and maintain day centres and hostels together
with schemes and programmes designed to meet the needs of a broad range of
offenders, and, if possible, drawing the community into partnership in
responding to offending. In Scotland and Northern Ireland these responsibilities
are undertaken respectively by local authority social work departments and the
probation board.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation officers are
available to every court, of both criminal and civil jurisdiction. In Scotland,
officers of the local authority social work department are similarly available.
The Government's objective is to provide a humane, efficient and effective prison
service. Although the courts have made less use of prison as a penalty for
criminal activity, there has been an increase in the prison population as a result
116
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the rise in recorded crime. The daily average inmate population in 1984 in
England and Wales was nearly 43,300, and this is expected to rise to about
47,400 by 1990. In Scotland the average population in custody has remained
fairly steady for the last decade at around 4,900. In 1984, however, it fell to
4,753. In Northern Ireland the daily average inmate population in 1984 was
2.248 and is expected to fall to 1,957 in 1987-88.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known as
local prisons : all are closed. Other prisons, open or closed, receive prisoners on
transfer from local prisons (open prisons do not have physical barriers to
prevent escape). In England, Scotland and Wales sentenced prisoners are
classified into groups for security purposes. There are separate prisons for
women. There are no open prisons in Northern Ireland, where the majority of
offenders are serving sentences for terrorist offences. The Government has
announced measures to improve procedures for the security classification of
prisoners.
People awaiting trial are entitled to privileges not granted to convicted
prisoners and, as far as practicable, are separated from convicted prisoners.
Those under 21 awaiting trial are, where possible, separated from older
prisoners.
Because many prisons built during the nineteenth century in England and
Wales are now unsatisfactory and overcrowded, a major building programme is
in progress and the Government aims to end overcrowding by 1990. Existing
establishments are being refurbished, six new prisons are under construction
and eight more are being designed. In Northern Ireland two new prisons—
one for men and one for women prisoners—are scheduled to open at the end
of 1985.
Remission of
Sentence and
Parole
Most prisoners in Great Britain are eligible for remission of one-third of their
sentence provided it does not reduce the sentence to less than five days.
However, people sentenced to life imprisonment for certain categories of
murder, including terrorist murders and the murder of police officers, must
serve a minimum of 20 years' imprisonment. In Northern Ireland the Secretary
of State reviews life sentence cases in such a way as to reflect fully their gravity
and to take account of the special circumstances of Northern Ireland. The
average time served under sentence in prisons in England and Wales by people
discharged between 1981 and 1983 from custodial sentences for murder was
IOV2 years. Remission may be forfeited for serious misconduct. There is no
remission for prisoners serving sentences under civil law and those serving
sentences of unspecified length (for example, the criminally insane, whose
release depends upon improvement in their mental condition).
Prisoners serving fixed sentences of more than 18 months become eligible for
release on parole after six months. However, for those serving sentences of more
than five years for violence or drug smuggling, parole is granted only in
exceptional circumstances. The parole licence remains in force until the date on
which the prisoner would have been released but for the parole. It prescribes the
conditions with which the offender must comply. In 1984, about 4-3 per cent of
prisoners granted parole in England and Wales and about 5-5 per cent of those
in Scotland were recalled to prison.
Prisoners serving life sentences are also eligible for release on licence, after
consideration by the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland who
consults the judiciary, and on the recommendation of the appropriate Parole
Board. Those released remain on licence for the rest of their lives subject to recall
at any time should the circumstances warrant. Similar arrangements exist in
Northern Ireland except that the recommendations are made to the Secretary of
State by an internal review body.

In Northern Ireland prisoners serving a sentence of more than five days are
eligible for remission of half of their sentence. A prisoner serving a sentence of
more than 12 months who is released with remission is liable, if convicted of a
further imprisonable offence at any time before the expiry of the full term of the
sentence, to be ordered to serve the remaining balance of the sentence in
addition to the sentence for the further offence.
Prison industries aim to give inmates work experience which will assist them
when released and to secure a return which will reduce the cost of the prison
system. The main industries are clothing and textile manufacture, engineering,
woodwork, laundering, electro-mechanical production, farming and horticul¬
ture. Most production caters for internal needs and for other public services but
much of it is for the commercial market. A few prisoners are employed outside
prison. Small payments are made for work; in some prisons, incentive schemes
provide an opportunity for higher earnings on the basis of output and skill.
Education is financed by the prison service and provided by local education
authorities. Prison education officers are assisted by teams of teachers.
Education is compulsory, full-time, for young offenders below school-leaving age
and, in England and Wales, part-time for those between 16 and 21. For older
offenders it is voluntary. Some prisoners study for public examinations
(including those of the Open University). Within the resources available there is
teaching in recreational and leisure pursuits. Vocational training is provided
directly by the prison service. Physical education is voluntary but offenders
under 21 have to attend a certain number of classes. Many establishments lack
the proper facilities, although there have been recent improvements.
Education in Northern Ireland prisons is traditionally an evening activity, but
governors may and do permit prisoners who need help in basic education and
those preparing for public examinations to spend part of their working week on
educational pursuits. Recently, the distance-learning mode of study has been
introduced in a wide range of subjects, lessening the need for evening classes.
Prison education is provided by full-time and part-time staff. A wide range of
educational and vocational training facilities, from remedial education to Open
University level, is available.
The prison medical service has a general responsibility for the physical and
mental health of all those in custody. Each establishment has accommodation
for sick people and patients can also be transferred to National Health Service
hospitals. Psychiatric care is available.
The work of psychologists includes evaluating treatment programmes,
studying management practices, contributing to the management and treat¬
ment programmes of individuals and groups, taking part in advisory and
training work with staff and making assessments for treatment or allocation
purposes.
Prisoners are entitled to write and receive letters and to be visited by relatives
and friends. Privileges include a personal radio, books, periodicals and
newspapers, and the right to make purchases from the canteen with money
earned in prison. Depending on facilities prisoners may be granted the further
privileges of dining and recreation in association, and watching television.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or by the boards
of visitors (visiting committees in Scotland), who have power to order forfeiture
of remission and forfeiture of privileges. Boards of visitors (and visiting
committees) consist of lay people, two of whom must be magistrates.
Welfare
The welfare of prisoners is the concern of all prison staff. Much of this work is
the responsibility of probation officers (in Scotland social workers) stationed in
118
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Discharge and
After-care
Children in
Trouble
England and
Wales
prisons who help prisoners in their relations with individuals and agencies
outside and play a leading part in helping prisoners to make constructive
resettlement plans before their release. Prisoners may also receive visits from
specially appointed prison visitors whose work is voluntary.
Chaplains give spiritual help and advice to inmates and are increasingly
involved in management decisions affecting their needs and quality of life.
All prisons in England and Wales make pre-release preparations. Prisoners
serving four years or more are considered for outside employment before release.
For those selected, work is found outside the prison for about the last six
months of sentence; during the period prisoners may live in a separate part of
the prison or in a hostel outside. Normal wages are paid so that they can resume
support for their families. (In Scotland pre-release arrangements differ from
these in some respects.) Periods of home leave may be granted in the last nine
months of sentence to those serving two years or more to assist them with their
resettlement. In Northern Ireland arrangements exist for prisoners serving fixed
sentences to have short periods of leave near the end of their sentences and at
Christmas. As in England, Wales and Scotland, compassionate home leave may
be granted to sentenced prisoners and to life-sentenced prisoners who have a
fixed provisional date of release.
The aim of after-care, run by the probation and after-care service (in Scotland,
the local authority social work departments), is to assist offenders on return to
society. Compulsoiy supervision is given to most offenders under 21 when
released, adult offenders released on parole, and those released on licence from a
life sentence. A voluntary system is offered to others. After-care is also provided
by voluntary societies, most of which are members of the National Association
for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. There is also a Scottish Association
for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. Hostels and accommodation may be
provided, often with government financial help. The Northern Ireland Associa¬
tion for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, also a voluntary group, is
mainly concerned with assisting petty criminals and alcoholics towards
rehabilitation and social awareness.
In England and Wales no child under ten years can be held guilty of an offence. A
child above that age but under 17 who is alleged to have committed an offence
may be brought before a court in either criminal proceedings or care
proceedings. In criminal proceedings the court is usually ajuvenile court, and in
care proceedings it always is. Before an order may be made in care proceedings,
it must be shown not only that the child has committed the offence, but also that
he or she is in need of care or control which he or she is unlikely to receive unless
the order is made; this further condition must also be satisfied where a court
makes a care order in criminal proceedings. A number of orders are available in
both care and criminal proceedings: the court may make a care order or a
supervision order or, if the child's parents consent, an order requiring them to
agree to exercise proper care and control over the child: it may also make an
order under the mental health legislation.
Under a care order a local authority becomes responsible for deciding where
the child should be accommodated; whether, for example, to leave the child at
home under supervision or to place him or her with foster parents or in a
community home. For children too severely disturbed or disruptive to be treated
in local authority homes, there are two special Youth Treatment Centres run by
the Department of Health and Social Security. The authority must review each
care order every six months and consider whether an application should be
made to the court to end it; the order normally expires when the child reaches 18
or 19. The courts have powers to make a charge and control condition when a
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
119
Scotland
Northern
Ireland
child who is already under a care order as a result of an offence commits a
further offence (for which an adult could be punished by imprisonment). This
suspends for six months the local authority’s discretion to place the child in his
or her own home, but does not oblige the authority to place the child in a
community home. The local authority may, for example, place the child with
foster parents.
Under a supervision order (which is usually in force for not more than three
years) a child normally remains at home under the supervision of a social worker
or a probation officer, though the court may require him or her to live with a
specified person. The court has power to require that the child comply with
directions given by his or her supervisor or, in criminal proceedings, with
requirements made by the court itself. By either of these means, the supervision
order can be used to provide for a programme of intermediate treatment',
consisting of participation, under a supervisor, in a variety of constructive and
remedial activities through a short residential course or, more usually,
attendance at a day or evening centre. Government finance is available to help
individuals, groups or organisations set up intermediate treatment facilities.
In criminal proceedings, the courts may order payments of compensation, or
impose fines or grant a conditional or absolute discharge. When a fine,
compensation or costs are awarded against a juvenile offender the courts must
normally order that the parent or guardian should pay. Offenders, both boys and
girls, may be ordered to spend a total of up to 24 hours of their spare time on
Saturdays at an attendance centre (up to three hours on any one occasion). The
centres, which provide physical education and instruction in practical subjects,
are for those found guilty of offences for which older people could be sent to
prison. Boys aged 14 to 16 may be sent to a junior detention centre, where the
regime is similar to that in senior detention centres (see p 120). Boys and girls
aged 15 or 16 may also be sentenced to a term of youth custody. In the case of a
very serious crime, detention in a place approved by the Home Secretary may be
ordered, and must be ordered in the case of homicide.
In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight years but prosecution of
children under the age of 16 years in court is rare and can take place only as
instructed by the Lord Advocate; court proceedings normally take place only
where the offence is of a serious nature, or where a child is prosecuted together
with an adult. Instead, children under 16 (or in certain circumstances those
aged between 16 and 18 if subject to a supervision requirement) who have
committed an offence or are considered to be in need of care and protection may
be brought before a children's hearing. The hearing, which consists of three lay
people drawn from a panel for each region or islands area, determines in an
informal setting whether compulsory measures of care are required and, if so,
the form they should take. An official ‘reporter’ decides whether a child should
come before a hearing. If the grounds for referral are not accepted by the child or
parents, or if for any reason the child is not capable of understanding the
explanation of the grounds, the case goes to the sheriff for proof. If he finds the
grounds established, the sheriff remits the case to the reporter to arrange a
hearing. The sheriff also decides appeals against any decision of a children's
hearing.
The age of criminal responsibility in Northern Ireland is ten. Children under the
age of 17 charged with committing a criminal offence may be brought before a
juvenile court. If the child is found guilty of an offence punishable by
imprisonment when committed by an adult, he or she may be sent to a training
school, placed in the care of a ‘fit person’, possibly the area health and social
services board, or put under supervision. Alternatively the court can order a

period at an attendance centre or a remand home, or impose a fine or
compensation. A conditional or absolute discharge is also possible. Whatever
other order it makes, a juvenile court can also make an order requiring parents
to ensure the child s good behaviour. Children brought before the courts in need
of care and protection may be placed in care locally.
Offenders aged 17 to 20 years (16 to 21 years in Scotland) are treated as a
category distinct from child and adult offenders. The custodial sentences
available in England and Wales are: detention centre orders for males for from
three weeks to four months and youth custody sentences for both sexes. The
senior detention centres are for young male offenders who need to be taught
respect for the law through some form of custody. Life in a centre demands high
standards of discipline. Training comprises a full working week, including an
hour a day of physical training, and for offenders of school age education is
provided for at least 15 hours a week. Young offenders are eligible for parole on a
similar basis to adults and all are supervised after discharge.
Courts may impose a custodial sentence only when no other measure is
appropriate: a number of alternatives to custody are open to the courts.
Community service orders (see p 114) are available from the age of 16 and courts
may order young offenders to give up Saturday afternoon leisure at attendance
centres. The courts may also attach conditions to probation orders on offenders.
In Scotland young offenders sentenced to detention serve their sentences
either in a detention centre (in the case of males only) or a young offenders'
institution, depending on the length of the sentence. Remission of part of the
sentence for good conduct, release on parole, and supervision after release are
available. In Northern Ireland, offenders aged between 17 and 21 who are
sentenced to three years or less may be sent to a young offenders’ centre.
Civil Justice
The main sub-divisions of the civil law of England, Wales and Northern Ireland
are: family law, the law of property, the law of contract and the law of torts
(covering injuries suffered by one person at the hands of another irrespective of
any contract between them and including concepts such as negligence,
defamation and trespass). Other branches of the civil law include constitutional
and administrative (particularly concerned with the use of executive power),
industrial, maritime and ecclesiastical law. Scottish civil law has its own, often
analogous, branches.
An inquiry into the system of civil justice in England and Wales was set up in
early 1985. Its aim is to improve the machinery of civil justice through reforms
in jurisdiction, procedure and court administration, and in particular to reduce
delay, cost and complexity.
The limited civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial
proceedings tor custody and maintenance orders, adoption orders and affilia¬
tion and guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction regarding
nuisances under the public health legislation and the recovery of rates.
Committees of magistrates license public houses, betting shops and clubs.
The jurisdiction of the 300 or so county courts covers actions founded upon
contract and tort (with minor exceptions); trust and mortgage cases; and
actions for the recovery of land. Cases involving claims exceeding set limits may
be tried in the county court by consent of the parties, or in certain
circumstances on transfer from the High Court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the Rent
Acts, landlord and tenant, and adoption cases. Undefended divorce cases are

determined in those courts designated as divorce county courts (defended cases
are transferred to the High Court) and outside London bankruptcies are dealt
with in certain county courts. The courts also deal with complaints of race and
sex discrimination. Where small claims are concerned (especially those involving
consumers), there are special arbitration facilities and simplified procedures.
All judges of the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, the Crown
Court and the High Court) and all circuit judges and recorders have power to sit
in the county courts, but each court has one or more circuit judges assigned to it
by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court are mostly taken by
them. The judge normally sits alone, although on request the court may,
exceptionally, order a trial with a jury.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen's
Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction is both original and
appellate and covers all civil and some criminal cases. In general, particular
types of work are assigned to a particular division. The Family Division, for
instance, is concerned with all jurisdiction affecting the family, including that
relating to adoption and guardianship. The Chancery Division deals with the
interpretation of wills and the administration of estates. Maritime and
commercial law is the responsibility of admiralty and commercial courts of the
Queen's Bench Division.
Each of the 80 or so judges of the High Court is attached to one division on
appointment but may be transferred to any other division while in office. The
Lord Chancellor is president of the Chancery Division, administered by the
vice-president, the Vice-Chancellor. The Queen's Bench Division is presided over
by the Lord Chief Justice of England, who ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in
the legal hierarchy, and the Family Division is headed by the President. Outside
London (where the High Court sits at the Royal Courts of Justice) sittings are
held at 25 Crown Court centres. For the hearing of cases at first instance. High
Court judges sit alone. Appeals in civil matters from lower courts are heard by
courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of the appropriate
division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial, adoption and guardianship proceedings heard by
magistrates courts go to a divisional court of the Family Division of the High
Court. Affiliation appeals are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals from
decisions of the licensing committees of magistrates. Appeals from the High
Court and county courts are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and
may go on to the House of Lords, the final court of appeal in civil cases.
The ex-officio members of the Court of Appeal are the Lord Chancellor, the
Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division and the Master of the
Rolls; the ordinary members are 18 Lords Justices of Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and
sometimes even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally take place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber), but
peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit. The president of the
House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor.
The main civil courts are the sheriff courts and the Court of Session. The civil
jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to most kinds of action (including
divorce actions) and is normally unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the
work is done by the sheriff, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to
the sheriff-principal or directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits only in Edinburgh, and in general has jurisdiction to
deal with all kinds of action. The main exception is an action exclusive to the
122

Northern
Ireland
Civil
Proceedings
sheriff court, where the value claimed is less than a set amount. It is divided into
two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House,
mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions of equal
status, each consisting of four judges—the first division being presided over by
the Lord President and the second division by the Lord Justice Clerk. Appeals to
the Inner House may be made from the Outer House and from the sheriff court.
From the Inner House an appeal may go to the House of Lords. The judges of the
Court of Session are the same as those of the High Court of Justiciary. The Lord
President of the Court holds the office of Lord Justice General in the High Court
(see p 105).
The Scottish Land Court, a special court dealing with agricultural tenancies
and similar matters, consists of a judge and three lay specialists in agriculture.
Minor civil cases in Northern Ireland are dealt with in county courts, though
magistrates' courts also deal with certain classes of civil case. The superior civil
law court is the High Court of Justice from which an appeal may be made to the
Court of Appeal. These two courts, together with the Crown Court, comprise the
Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland and their practice and
procedure are similar to those in England. The House of Lords is the final civil
appeal court.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary inquiry on the authenticity of the grievance is required. Actions
in the High Court are usually begun by a writ of summons served on the
defendant by the plaintiff, stating the nature of the claim. A defendant intending
to contest the claim informs the court. Documents setting out the precise
question in dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court. County court
proceedings are initiated by a summons served on the defendant by the court;
subsequent procedure is simpler than in the High Court.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced in open court, but a procedure for
most undefended cases dispenses with the need to give evidence in court and
permits written evidence to be considered by the registrar.
Civil proceedings, as a private matter, can usually be abandoned or ended by
compromise at any time. Actions brought to court are usually tried without a
jury, except in defamation, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution cases,
when either party may, except in certain special circumstances, insist on trial by
jury, or a fraud case, when the defendant may claim this right. The jury decides
questions of fact and damages awarded to the injured party; majority verdicts
may be accepted.
An action in a magistrates’ court is begun by a complaint on which the court
may serve the defendant with a summons. This contains details of the complaint
and the date on which it will be heard. Parties and witnesses give their evidence
at the court hearing. Domestic proceedings are heard by not more than three lay
justices including, where practicable, a woman; members of the public are not
allowed to be present. The court may order provision for custody, access and
supervision of children, as well as maintenance payments for spouses and
children.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by seizure
of the debtor's goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order requiring an
employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction from the debtor’s
wages). Other judgments can take the form of an injunction restraining
someone from performing an illegal act. Refusal to obey judgment may result in
imprisonment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order of committal may be
effected only on a warrant.
The general rule is that the costs of the action (lawyers’ charges, court fees and
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
123
Restrictive
Practices Court
Administrative
Tribunals
other payments) are within the discretion of the court. Normally, the court
orders them to be paid by the party losing the action, but in the case of family
law maintenance proceedings a magistrates’ court can order either party to pay
the whole or part of the other's costs.
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of Session or ordinary actions in the
sheriff court are initiated by serving the defender with a summons (an initial
writ in the sheriff court). In Court of Session actions the next step is the
publication of the action in the court lists. A defender who intends to contest the
action must inform the court: if he or she does not appear, the court grants a
decree in absence in favour of the pursuer. In ordinary actions in the sheriff
court the defender is simply required to give notice of intention to defend within
a certain number of days after service of the initial writ, and this is followed by a
formal appearance in court by the parties to the dispute or their solicitors.
In summary causes (involving small sums) in the sheriff court the procedure is
less formal. The statement of claim is incorporated in the summons. The
procedure is designed to enable most actions to be carried through without the
parties involved having to appear in court. Normally they (or their representa¬
tives) need appear only when an action is defended.
Proceedings in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England and Wales.
County court proceedings are commenced by a civil bill served on the defendant;
there are no pleadings in the county court. Judgments of civil courts are
enforceable through a centralised procedure administered by the Enforcement
of Judgments Office.
The Restrictive Practices Court is a specialised United Kingdom court which
deals with monopolies and restrictive trade practices. It comprises five judges
and up to ten other people with expertise in industry, commerce or public life.
Administrative tribunals consist of people or bodies exercising judicial func¬
tions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a rule, they are set up
under statutory powers which also govern their constitution, functions and
procedure. Their composition and procedures vary greatly. Compared with the
courts, they tend to be less expensive, less formal and more accessible: they also
have expert knowledge of their particular subjects. The expansion of the
tribunal system is comparatively recent, most tribunals having been set up since
1945. Independently of the executive, tribunals decide the rights and obliga¬
tions of private citizens towards one another or towards a government
department or other public authority. A number of important tribunals (notably
the rent and industrial tribunals) decide disputes between private citizens.
Some (such as those concerned with social security) resolve claims by private
citizens against public authorities. A further group (including tax tribunals)
decide disputed claims by public authorities against private citizens, and still
others decide issues in dispute which do not directly affect financial rights or
liabilities, such as entitlements to licences or the right to enter the United
Kingdom. Tribunals usually consist of an uneven number of people so that a
majority decision can be reached: some consist of one person sitting alone.
Members are normally appointed by the minister concerned with the subject but
other authorities have the power of appointment in appropriate cases. The Lord
Chancellor (or the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland) makes
most appointments where a lawyer chairman or member is required.
Appeals on a point of law from all the more important tribunals may be made
in England and Wales to the High Court, in Scotland to the Court of Session and
in Northern Ireland to the Court of Appeal. In some cases an appeal may be made
to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a government minister or to an
independent referee. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, which hears appeals on

BILITIES
England and
Wales
questions of law from decisions of industrial tribunals, has High Court and
Court of Session status in Great Britain. The Council on Tribunals (an
independent body, established in 1958) exercises general supervision over
tribunals, advising on draft legislation and rules of procedure, monitoring their
activities and reporting on particular matters; those peculiar to Scotland are
dealt with by the Scottish Committee of the Council. The Council has a similar
responsibility with regard to public inquiries.
Administration of the Law
The United Kingdom judiciary is entirely independent of the Government and is
not subject to ministerial direction or control. There is no minister of justice.
Responsibility for the administration of justice rests with the Lord Chancellor,
the Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Also concerned is the Prime Minister, who recommends the highest
judicial appointments to the Crown.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the judiciary (and sometimes sits as a judge
in the House of Lords); he is concerned with court procedure, is responsible for
the administration of all courts other than magistrates' and coroners' courts,
appoints magistrates, and has general responsibility for the legal aid and advice
schemes. He is also responsible for the administration of civil law reform.
The Home Secretary is concerned with the criminal law (including law
reform), the police service, prisons, and the probation and after-care service:
and has general supervision over magistrates’ courts, together with some
specific responsibilities (such as approving the appointment of justices’ clerks).
Prison policy and the administration of custodial centres are functions of the
Home Office Prison Department, and the Home Secretary appoints to each
centre a board of visitors representing the local community to investigate and
advise on the state of prison premises, administration and treatment of
inmates. The boards have disciplinary powers in relation to serious breaches of
discipline and hear applications or complaints from inmates. The Home
Secretary is advised by a special Parole Board on the release of prisoners on
licence.
Responsibility for the treatment of offenders under 17 is shared between the
Home Office and the Department of Health and Social Security. The Home
Secretary is also responsible for advising the Queen on the exercise of the royal
prerogative of mercy to pardon a person convicted of a crime or to cancel all or
part of a penalty imposed by a court.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is responsible for providing
accommodation for all the superior courts in England and Wales, except the
Central Criminal Court, which is the responsibility of the City of London.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor General (the Law Officers of the Crown
for England and Wales) are the Government’s principal advisers on English law,
and represent the Crown in appropriate domestic and international cases. They
are senior barristers, elected members of the House of Commons and hold
ministerial posts. The Attorney General is also Attorney General for Northern
Ireland. As well as exercising various civil law functions, the Attorney General
has final responsibility for enforcing the criminal law; the Director of Public
Prosecutions is subject to the Attorney General’s superintendence. The Attorney
General is concerned with instituting and prosecuting certain types of criminal
proceedings, but must exercise an independent discretion, and must not be
influenced by government colleagues. The Solicitor General is, in effect, the
deputy of the Attorney General.

THE
PERSONNEL

Judges
The Legal
Profession
The Secretary of State for Scotland recommends the appointment of all judges
other than the most senior ones, appoints the staff of the High Court of
Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the composition,
staffing and organisation of the sheriff courts. District courts are staffed and
administered by the district and islands local authorities. The Secretary of State
is also responsible for the criminal law of Scotland, crime prevention, and the
police and the penal system, and is advised on parole matters by the Parole
Board for Scotland. The Secretary of State is also responsible for legal aid in
Scotland and for the legal advice and assistance schemes.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish questions and the principal representa¬
tives of the Crown for the purposes of litigation in Scotland. Both are
government ministers. The Lord Advocate is closely concerned with questions of
legal policy and administration and is also responsible for the Scottish
parliamentary draftsmen. He has overall responsibility for the prosecution of
crime in Scotland and although he holds a ministerial post he must exercise an
independent discretion in carrying out this responsibility.
In Northern Ireland the judiciary is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the
Lord Chancellor. The administration of all courts is the responsibility of the
Lord Chancellor, while the Northern Ireland Office, under the Secretary of State,
deals with the police and the penal system. The Lord Chancellor has general
responsibility for the legal aid and advice scheme in Northern Ireland.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen's Courts since the Crown is the
historic source of all judicial power. The Queen, acting on the advice of
ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary.
Full-time judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor, who is
head of the judiciary, speaker of the House of Lords and a Cabinet minister. With
the exception of lay magistrates, judges are normally appointed from practising
barristers, advocates (in Scotland) or solicitors (see below). Thejudiciary is not a
career service as in many other countries. Lay magistrates in England and Wales
need no legal qualifications but on appointment undergo basic training to give
them sufficient knowledge of the law, including the rules of evidence, and to
enable them to understand the nature and purpose of sentencing. The Scottish
district court justices of the peace likewise need no legal qualifications. In
Northern Ireland lay magistrates serving on juvenile courts undertake training
courses; resident magistrates are drawn from practising solicitors or barristers.
In certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of misconduct or proven
incapacity) judges of the inferior courts may be removed from their positions
but, in order to safeguard the independence of thejudiciary from the executive,
superior judges in England and Wales and Northern Ireland (other than the Lord
Chancellor who changes with the Government) are subject to removal only by the
Queen on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament; in Scotland there
is no statutory provision for removing judges of the Court of Session or High
Court of Justiciary from office and special legislation would probably be needed
to secure a dismissal.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Barristers are known collectively as the ‘Bar', and
collectively and individually as ‘counsel’. Solicitors undertake legal business for
lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems submitted through
solicitors and present cases in the higher courts; certain functions are common

to both. Although people are free to conduct their own cases, most people prefer
to be legally represented in the more serious cases.
The professional organisations for barristers are: the Senate of the Inns of
Court and the Bar (in England and Wales),1 the Faculty of Advocates (in
Scotland) and the General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland and the
Executive Council of the Inn of Court of Northern Ireland. For solicitors they are:
the Law Society, the Law Society of Scotland and the Law Society of Northern
Ireland.
Legislation is before Parliament to provide greater protection for the public
against inadequate professional work by solicitors.
A person in need may be entitled to help from public funds to meet the costs of
legal advice and legal representation in court. This help may be provided free, or
subject to a contribution, depending on the assisted person’s means. If, during
the course of the proceedings, the person recovers or preserves money or
property, the Legal Aid Fund may have a first charge on that money or property
to meet the costs incurred.
People with moderate means may obtain help from a solicitor on any legal matter
either free or subject to a contribution. The solicitor's help includes giving
advice, writing letters, drafting wills, obtaining opinions from a barrister or
advocate and, where specifically authorised by the legal aid authorities in
England and Wales, representing the client in certain civil proceedings in
magistrates’ courts, mental health appeal tribunals and certain disciplinary
hearings before prison boards of visitors. A solicitor may act for a client until
costs and expenses reach a total of £50 (£90 for divorce or judicial separation
cases in England and Wales) after which the agreement of the legal aid
authorities must be obtained. A person seeking help must give details about
income and savings, which must be below a certain calculated figure.
In a number of urban areas law centres provide free advice to people of limited
means. Most law centres (voluntary organisations financed from various
sources, including government grants) have at least two full-time salaried
lawyers and many employ community workers. Much of their time is devoted to
tenant—landlord disputes and other housing problems. Free legal advice is also
available in Citizens Advice Bureaux, consumer and housing advice centres and
in specialist advice centres run by various voluntary organisations.
Legal aid for civil proceedings is available to people whose disposable incomes
and capital fall below certain prescribed amounts, but a contribution may be
payable according to the level of the applicant’s income and capital: if they are
below prescribed amounts, legal aid is given free.
An applicant for legal aid must also show reasonable grounds for taking or
defending the proceedings. If the application is successful the case is conducted
in the ordinary way, except that no money passes between the assisted person
and the solicitor—payments being made in and out of the legal aid fund. The
costs of an action which an assisted litigant loses against an unassisted
opponent may also, subject to certain conditions and if the court so orders, be
met out of the fund. Solicitors and counsel must review the case at each stage to
see that it is not being pursued unreasonably at public expense. Legal aid is not

generally available in cases where redress is sought for alleged defamation or for
representation in proceedings in most administrative tribunals.
The civil legal aid schemes are run by the Law Society, the Law Society of
Scotland and the Law Society of Northern Ireland, under the general guidance of
the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Aid in Criminal In criminal proceedings in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made by
Proceedings the court concerned if it appears to be in the interests of justice and if a
defendant qualifies for financial help. An order must be made (subject to means)
when a person is committed for trial on a murder charge or where the prosecutor
appeals or applies for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal (Criminal
Division) to the House of Lords. No person who is unrepresented can be given a
custodial sentence for the first time unless given the opportunity to apply for
legal aid.
Under a national scheme the Law Society is making arrangements for duty
solicitors at magistrates courts to provide initial help to unrepresented
defendants. This service is to be supplemented by a scheme of duty solicitors to
be available to advise suspects at police stations.
The criminal legal aid scheme in England and Wales is administered by the
courts, under the overall responsibility of the Lord Chancellor. Committees of
the Law Society provide a right of recourse against the refusal of legal aid in
some cases by a magistrates' court.
The arrangements for aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland and Northern
Ireland are broadly similar, but in Scotland there is a statutory duty solicitor
scheme for accused people in custody in sheriff, and district, court cases and the
interests of justice' test applies only in summary cases. In Northern Ireland a
duty solicitor scheme has been introduced at the principal magistrates’ court in
Belfast. Legal aid for criminal cases in Scotland and Northern Ireland is free; the
assisted person is not required to make any contributions towards the cost of
his or her legal representation.
LAW REFORM While changes in the law are matters for Parliament, the duty of keeping the law
under review lies with the Law Reform Committee, the Criminal Law Revision
Committee and the Law Commission in England and Wales, and with the
Scottish Law Commission in Scotland. The Law Reform Committee and the
Criminal Law Revision Committee comprise judges and practising and
academic lawyers, appointed respectively by the Lord Chancellor and the Home
Secretary, to examine aspects of the civil and criminal law in England and Wales.
The Law Commission, a permanent body reporting to the Lord Chancellor and
consisting of a High Court judge and four other members who are required to be
practising and academic lawyers, scrutinises the law with a view to its
systematic development and reform, and its simplification and modernisation.
The Scottish Law Commission is similar, and reports to the Lord Advocate. Law
reform in Northern Ireland is a matter for the Law Commission and the Office of
Law Reform.
6 Social Welfare
The British social welfare system comprises the National Health Service, the
personal social services and social security. The National Health Service provides
a comprehensive range of medical services which are available to all residents,
irrespective of means. Local authority personal social services and voluntary
organisations provide help and advice to elderly people, disabled people and
children in need of care. The social security system is designed to secure a basic
standard of living for people in financial need by providing income during
periods of inability to earn, help for families and assistance with costs arising
from disablement.
Central government is directly responsible for the National Health Service,
administered by health authorities and boards acting as its agents, and for the
social security system. It has an indirect responsibility for the personal social
services administered by local authorities. Joint finance and planning between
health and local authorities aims to prevent overlapping of services and to
encourage the development of community services.
Planned spending on social welfare in 1985-86 is: health £17,600 million
(13-3 per cent of general government expenditure): personal social services
£2,900 million (2-2 per cent): and social security £41,400 million (31 per cent).
Expenditure on the health service has increased in real terms by some 9 per
cent since 1980, and current spending is planned to grow by a further 2 per cent
over the next two years. More patients are now being treated than ever before.
Spending on social security is rising because of increased numbers of
beneficiaries, especially retirement pensioners and the unemployed, and the
value of retirement and most other long-term benefits has been increased in real
terms since 1980. (Proposals for the reform of social security were put forward in
1985 to provide a clearer, simpler system which would be more capable of
meeting genuine need (see p 147).) Spending on the personal social services is
determined by local authorities within the reduced levels that they have been
asked to achieve as part of the Government's programme to control the growth
in public expenditure.
National Health Service
The National Health Service (NHS) is based upon the principle that there should
be a comprehensive range of publicly provided services designed to help the
individual to stay healthy and to provide effective and appropriate treatment and
care where necessary. All taxpayers, employers and employees contribute to its
cost so that those members of the community who do not require health care
help to pay for those who do. Some forms of treatment, such as hospital care, are
provided free of charge: others (see p 131) may be charged for.
Growth in real spending on the health service is being used to meet the needs
of increasing numbers of elderly people (over 45 per cent of health authority
expenditure on hospital and community services is spent on care of the elderly):
to provide lor advances in medical treatment, including new surgical tech¬
niques: to provide more appropriate types of care, often in the community rather
than in hospital, for priority groups like the elderly, mentally ill and mentally
handicapped people: to combat the growing health problems arising from

TRATION

alcohol and drug misuse; and to remedy disparities in provision between the
regions of Britain.
The Government emphasises the importance of preventive health services,
and the responsibility of individuals for their own health. While great progress
has been made in eliminating infectious diseases such as poliomyelitis and
tuberculosis, there has been less success in controlling the major causes of
death—heart disease, cancer and stroke—which accounted for 68 per cent of all
mortality in England in 1983. Because of the close link between such diseases
and individual life-styles or social habits, emphasis is placed on helping people
to adopt healthier ways of living through education and other policies.
The Government stresses the need for a partnership between the public and
private health sectors and for improving efficiency in order to secure the best
value for money and the maximum patient care. In order to secure more effective
management of resources in the National Health Service, general managers
drawn from inside and outside the Service have been appointed at all levels.
Further measures have included improving the accountability of health
authorities for the way in which they plan and manage their resources,
increasing the proportion of total staff who provide direct patient care, such as
doctors and nurses, and the introduction of a range of programmes to provide
existing services at lower cost. Considerable savings have been made in many
areas through a policy of competitive tendering for hospital ancillary services
such as cleaning, catering and laundry. Economies are also made in prescribing
by restricting the use of expensive branded products in favour of cheaper but
equally effective generic equivalents.
The health ministers (the Secretary of State for Social Services in England and
the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) are respon¬
sible for all aspects of the health services in their respective countries. The
health departments (the Department of Health and Social Security in England,
the Scottish Home and Health Department, the Welsh Office and the Depart¬
ment of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland) are responsible for
national strategic planning. District health authorities in England and Wales
and health boards in Scotland are responsible for planning and operational
control of all health services in their areas. In England, because of its greater size
and population, a tier of regional authorities is responsible for regional
planning, resource allocation, major capital building work and certain special¬
ised hospital services best administered on a regional basis. The authorities and
boards co-operate closely with local authorities responsible for social work,
environmental health, education and other services. Family practitioner com¬
mittees (health boards in Scotland), accountable to the Secretaiy of State,
arrange for the provision of services by doctors, dentists, pharmacists and
opticians. Community health councils represent local opinion on the health
services provided. (In Scotland this function is exercised by local health
councils.)
In Northern Ireland health and social services boards are responsible for all
health and personal social services in their areas. The representation of public
opinion on these services is provided for by district committees.
There are three Health Service Commissioner posts (for England, Scotland and
Wales) for dealing with complaints from members of the public about the health
service. All three posts are held by the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (Ombudsman). The jurisdiction of the Health Service Commis¬
sioner covers the failure of a health authority or family practitioner committee to
carry out its statutory duties, a failure in a service provided, or maladministra¬
tion causing injustice or hardship, but not actions taken solely in the exercise of
SOCIAL WELFARE
131
clinical judgment or the actions of family practitioners, for which separate
complaints procedures exist. The Commissioner reports annually to ministers
who lay the reports before Parliament, and may make other reports when
necessary. In Northern Ireland the Commissioner for Complaints has a similar
role.

Services
About 85 per cent of the cost of the health service is paid for through general
taxation; the rest is met from the National Health Service contribution paid with
the National Insurance contribution and from the charges towards the cost of
certain items such as drugs prescribed by a family doctor, and dental treatment.
Health authorities may raise funds from voluntary sources. Certain hospitals
increase their revenue by taking private patients who pay the full cost of their
accommodation and treatment.
The charges for medical prescriptions do not apply to children under 16 years,
expectant mothers and women who have had a baby in the last 12 months,
women aged 60 and over and men aged 65 and over, patients suffering from
certain medical conditions, war and armed forces disablement pensioners (for
treatment of their disability), and families with very low incomes. Some 70 per
cent of prescription items are supplied free of charge. No charges for dental
treatment are made for dental examinations and denture repairs. Some groups
of patients receive entirely free dental treatment, for example, women who are
pregnant or who have had a baby in the last year, anyone under the age of 18, or
19 if in full-time education, and people receiving supplementary benefit or
family income supplement (see p 151). Patients with low incomes may have their
charges remitted. Some groups also receive grants towards the cost of
spectacles.
Hospital medical staffs are salaried and can be employed full time or part time.
Hospital doctors can accept private patients. Family practitioners (doctors,
dentists, opticians and pharmacists) are self-employed contractors. Doctors
(also known as general practitioners) are paid by a system of fees and allowances
designed to reflect responsibilities, workload and practice expenses. Dentists
providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed scale of fees.
Pharmacists dispensing on their own premises are reimbursed for the cost of
the items supplied together with professional fees. Ophthalmic medical
practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the general ophthalmic
service receive approved fees for each sight test made; opticians who dispense
spectacles are paid a fee based on the number and type of pairs supplied.
Primary health care is offered by doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists
working within the Service as independent practitioners, and by health visitors,
district nurses and midwives employed by the health authorities; a wide range of
other services is also available, including the school health service and the
chiropody service. The remedial professions of physiotherapy, occupational
therapy and speech therapy are making an increasingly important contribution
to primary care.
There have been substantial increases in primary care staff in recent years: for
example, the number of doctors and dentists in England increased by over 2,000
and nearly 1,800 respectively between 1978 and 1984, and the average number
of patients per doctor fell from 2,312 to 2,116.
Special funds have been earmarked by the Government for improving the
quality of primary health care in inner city areas.
The family practitioner services are those given to patients by doctors, dentists,
opticians and pharmacists of their own choice. Family doctors provide the first
diagnosis in the case of illness and either prescribe a suitable course of

treatment or refer a patient to the more specialised services and hospital
consultants. Ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic and dispensing
opticians test the sight and supply spectacles; patients requiring treatment are
dealt with through the Hospital Eye Service. In order to provide the public with a
wider and cheaper choice of spectacles, the monopoly on the supply of spectacles
held by registered ophthalmic and dispensing opticians was ended in 1985 and
unregistered opticians may now sell spectacles to adults under carefully
prescribed conditions. While most people are now required to obtain their
spectacles privately, children, those on low incomes and people needing
particularly complex prescriptions are eligible for subsidised spectacles under
the NHS.
Health visitors are responsible for the preventive care and health education of all
families, particularly those with young children. They work closely with general
practitioners, district nurses and other professions. District nurses give skilled
nursing care to people at home or elsewhere outside hospital; they also play an
important role in preventive care and health education. Although almost all
babies are born in hospital, some antenatal care and the majority of postnatal
care is given in the community by midwives and general practitioners, who also
care for women who have their babies at home. All midwives are responsible for
educating and supporting women and their families during the childbearing
period.
About four-fifths of family doctors in Britain work in partnerships or group
practices, often as members of health-care teams which also include health
visitors and district nurses and sometimes midwives, social workers and other
professional staff. About a quarter in Great Britain and over a half in Northern
Ireland work in modern and well-equipped health centres, where medical and
nursing services are provided. Health centres may also have facilities for health
education, family planning, speech therapy, chiropody, assessment of hearing,
physiotherapy and remedial exercises. Dental, pharmaceutical and ophthalmic
services, hospital out-patient and supporting social work services may also be
provided.
A full range of hospital services is provided by district general hospitals,
including treatment and diagnostic facilities for in-patients, day-patients and
out-patients, maternity departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric and
geriatric facilities, rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes and all forms of
specialised treatment. There are also specialist hospitals for children, mentally
ill, mentally handicapped and elderly people, and for the treatment of specific
diseases; examples include the world-famous Hospital for Sick Children, Great
Ormond Street, and the Brompton Heart and Chest Hospital in London.
Hospitals designated as teaching hospitals combine treatment facilities with
training medical and other students and research work.
Many of the hospitals in the National Health Service were built in the
nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations, such as the famous St Bartholomew’s and St Thomas' hospitals in
London. Much has been done to improve and extend existing buildings and
many new hospitals have been or are being opened. Between 1980 and 1984, 35
major hospital schemes were completed in England, providing 11,000 new beds
and new facilities such as operating theatres and X-ray rooms; over 70 other
schemes, costing more than £840 million, were being planned or constructed.
Recent policy in England has been to provide smaller hospitals for local areas
in preference to large district hospitals which may be remote from local
communities. The latest development in hospital design is the ‘nucleus’ hospital
of some 300 beds which makes more intensive use of space and facilities; it can

be used either as the first stage of a new hospital or as an extension of an
existing one. The world's first low-energy nucleus hospital, which is expected to
use less than half the energy of an ordinary nucleus hospital, is under
construction on the Isle of Wight.
National Health Service hospitals provide nearly half a million beds and have
over 480,000 medical, nursing and midwifery staff. The hospital service is now
treating more patients per year than ever before: between 1978 and 1983 the
number of in-patient and day cases treated rose by 900,000 (15 per cent) and
there were over 2-5 million (8 per cent) extra out-patient and emergency
attendances. Newer forms of treatment and diagnosis, such as kidney dialysis,
hip replacements, laser treatment for certain eye conditions, and body scanning
are being made more widely available. Community services such as the
psychiatric nursing service, day hospitals, and local authority day centres have
expanded so that more patients remain in the community and others are
discharged sooner from hospital.
It is the Government’s policy to encourage the private sector to meet a larger
share of the nation’s health needs in the belief that this will benefit the National
Health Service by relieving pressure on it. Some health authorities share
expensive facilities and equipment with private hospitals, and NHS patients are
sometimes treated (at public expense) in the private sector to reduce waiting
lists. The scale of private practice in relation to the NHS is, however, small. Some
6 per cent of acute hospital beds are in private hospitals and nursing homes and
about 1,300 beds in health service hospitals in England are occupied by private
patients. It is estimated that about half of those receiving acute treatment in
private hospitals or hospital pay-beds are covered by provident schemes which
make provision for private health care in return for annual subscriptions. In
1984 there were some 2 million subscribers to such schemes of whom the
majority were involved in group schemes, some arranged by firms on behalf of
employees. Subscriptions often cover more than one person (for example,
members of a family) and a total of 4-5 million were covered. Private practice is
also undertaken by family doctors and dentists. Many overseas patients come to
Britain for treatment in private hospitals and clinics, and Harley Street in
London is an internationally recognised centre for medical consultancy.
There is growing interest in alternative therapies such as homeopathy,
osteopathy and acupuncture, which are mainly practised outside the National
Health Service.
Over the past 25 years there have been significant developments in transplant
surgery in Britain. Since 1972 the United Kingdom Transplant Service has pro¬
vided a centralised kidney matching and distribution service. At the end of 1983
about 4,000 people were living with functioning kidney transplants and during
1984 some 1,400 more kidney transplants were performed. In 1983 a similar
service was initiated for corneas, about 2,000 being transplanted each year.
Heart transplant operations have been conducted since early 1979, mainly at
Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire and Harefield Hospital, West London. By
March 1985, 290 transplants had been performed: one-year survival is currently
in the order of 70 per cent and the two-year survival rate is about 60 per cent.
Several combined heart and lung transplant operations have been carried out
since the first was performed at Harefield in December 1983. Other organs and
tissues which are now successfully being transplanted include the liver, the
pancreas and bone marrow. A voluntary organ donor card system enables people
to indicate their willingness to become organ donors in the event of their death.
Several million people now participate in the scheme.

The blood transfusion service collects over 2 million donations of blood and over
27,000 donations of plasma each year from voluntary unpaid donors. Regional
transfusion centres recruit donors and organise donor sessions in towns and
villages, factories and offices, and within the armed forces. Donors must be
between the ages of 18 and 65. The centres are also responsible for blood
grouping and testing, maintaining blood banks, providing a consultancy service
to hospitals, teaching in medical schools, and instructing doctors, nurses and
technicians. Four laboratories manufacture blood products and undertake
research. While the use of whole blood for transfusions remains an important
part of the Service’s work, there is increasing emphasis on the most efficient and
effective use of blood and in particular its separation into components such as
plasma for specific uses. Britain aims to be self-sufficient in blood products by
late 1986.
Where necessary on medical grounds free transport by ambulance is provided by
the health authorities. The ambulance service performs emergency work,
dealing with sudden illness, urgent maternity eases, and accidents of all kinds;
and non-urgent work, providing transport for people needing out-patient
treatment at hospitals, clinics and day hospitals. In some areas the service for
non-urgent cases is augmented by voluntary organisations using their own
vehicles or by volunteers using their own cars. In Scotland an air ambulance
service is available in the islands and in the remoter parts of the mainland.
Rehabilitation, an important part of which is patient care, begins at the onset of
illness or injury and continues throughout with the aim of helping people to
adjust to changes in life-style and to live as normally as possible. It is especially
important for elderly, young, disabled, mentally ill and mentally handicapped
people who need such help to resume life in the community. Rehabilitation
activities are carried out in hospitals, centres in the community and in people's
own homes through co-ordinated work by a range of professional workers
including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech
therapists, hearing therapists, clinical psychologists, dietitians and social
workers. These staff may also work closely with the disablement resettlement
service of the Manpower Services Commission (the Department of Economic
Development in Northern Ireland), housing, education and social services
departments of local authorities and with the voluntary sector.
Medical services may include the provision, free of charge, of artificial limbs
and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, wheelchairs, and other appliances.
Following assessment, very severely physically handicapped patients may be
provided with environmental control equipment which enables them to operate
devices such as alarm bells, radio and television, a telephone, and heating
appliances. Nursing aids can be provided on loan for use in the home.
Local authorities may provide a range of facilities to assist patients in the
transition from hospital to their own homes, including the provision of aids and
adaptations, domiciliary care from home helps and professional help from
occupational therapists and social workers. Voluntary organisations also
provide valuable help in complementing the work of the statutory agencies and
in widening the range of available services.
A number of hospices provide care for the dying either directly in residential
homes or through nursing and other assistance in the patient’s own home.
Control of symptoms and psychological support for patients and their families
form the central features of the modern hospice movement, which originated in
Britain and is now world-wide. Some hospices are administered entirely by the
National Health Service; the remainder, some of which receive support from
public funds, are run by independent charities.

Special preventive services are provided under the health service to safeguard
the health of expectant mothers and mothers with young children. Services
include free dental treatment, dried milk and vitamins; vaccination against
certain diseases (see p 138); and health education, which is available to parents
before and after childbirth through talks, discussion groups and demonstra¬
tions. Pregnant women may also visit antenatal clinics or their family doctor for
medical check-ups, and working women have the right to visit the clinics during
working hours. Some 98 per cent of women have their babies in hospital,
returning home shortly afterwards to be attended by the family doctor, a midwife
and a health visitor. The Government attaches great importance to improving
the quality of maternity services, and to making them more sensitive and
sympathetic to mothers and their families. A Maternity Services Advisory
Committee set up in 1981 has reported on antenatal care and care during
childbirth. The perinatal mortality rate (the number of stillbirths and deaths in
the first week of life) has been reduced in recent years and in 1984 stood at 10-3
per thousand births in England and Wales, compared with 21 per thousand in
1973.
A network of child health centres provides facilities for surveillance by doctors,
dentists and health visitors of the physical and mental health and development
of pre-sehool-age children. Information about preventive services is given and
welfare foods are distributed. About 95 per cent of babies under one year are
taken to the centres. The school health service organises health care for
schoolchildren, including medical surveillance and dental inspection and
treatment where necessary.
Child guidance and child psychiatric services provide help and advice for
children who have psychological or emotional problems.
The birth of the world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ in Britain in 1978, using the
technique of in vitro fertilisation, opened up new horizons for the alleviation of
infertility and for the science of embryology, but also gave rise to unease at the
apparently uncontrolled advances of science and the new possibilities of
manipulating the early stages of human development. In view of this public
concern, a committee of inquiry was established in 1982 under Baroness
Warnock to examine the social, ethical and legal implications of developments in
this field. Reporting in 1984, the committee concluded that certain specialised
forms of infertility treatment, including artificial insemination by donor and in
vitro fertilisation, were ethically acceptable, but that surrogate motherhood (the
practice whereby one woman bears a child for another) should be prohibited;
that research on human embryos was acceptable, but only up to the fourteenth
day after fertilisation; and that a licensing authority should be established to
regulate infertility services and research. Following the first birth to be arranged
by a commercial surrogate motherhood agency in Britain in January 1985,
legislation to ban commercial surrogacy agencies was passed later that year. The
Government is considering its response to the wider recommendations of the
committee.
Free family planning facilities are available through family planning clinics,
hospitals and a domiciliary service. Most family doctors provide a similar service
for women only.
The Abortion Act 1967 allows the termination of pregnancy by a registered
doctor if two registered doctors consider that its continuance would involve a
greater risk to the life of the pregnant woman (or of injury to her physical or
mental health or that of any existing children in the family) than if the
pregnancy were ended. Termination may also be allowed if two doctors consider
136
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Drug
Misuse
Solvent Misuse
that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from
such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.
Abortions are carried out in National Health Service hospitals or in private
premises approved for the purpose by the Secretary of State. About half of the
135,800 legal abortions to women resident in Great Britain in 1984 were
performed in private hospitals and clinics. The Act does not apply in Northern
Ireland.
The growing misuse of dangerous drugs such as heroin and cocaine has
emerged as a serious social and health problem and the Government has made
the fight against such misuse a major priority. Its strategy comprises action to
reduce the supply of illicit drugs from abroad and to tighten controls on drugs
produced and supplied in Britain; to provide even more effective law enforce¬
ment by the police and customs services; to increase the deterrent effects of the
law; to support effective programmes to treat and rehabilitate misusers; and to
discourage young people from experimenting with drugs. As part of its
prevention policy, the Government initiated a £2-3 million publicity campaign
in 1985 to dissuade young people from drug-taking and to advise parents,
teachers and other professional staff on how to recognise and combat the
problem. It has also provided £12 million over three years (beginning in 1983) to
stimulate additional treatment and rehabilitation services and to expand efforts
in prevention.
The Government is advised on a wide range of matters relating to drug misuse
and connected social problems by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.
The Council reported in 1982 on treatment and rehabilitation services, and in
1984 reviewed prevention policy and security arrangements for the storage and
transit of controlled drugs.
Treatment for drug dependence is mainly provided on an out-patient basis.
About 100 NHS hospitals provide some specialist treatment for drug misusers,
mainly in psychiatric units; 35 hospitals have special drug treatment units.
Some addicts have a period of in-patient treatment when necessary. An
increasing number of family doctors also treat addicts but only certain specialist
doctors are licensed to prescribe heroin, cocaine and dipipanone (dicanol). All
doctors must notify the authorities of any patient they consider to be addicted to
certain controlled drugs, and guidelines on good medical practice in the
treatment of drug misuse have been issued to all doctors in Great Britain. The
Home Secretary has statutory powers for dealing with doctors found to have
prescribed irresponsibly.
A number of non-statutory agencies work with and complement the health
service provision; advice and rehabilitation services including residential
facilities, for example, are mainly provided by voluntary organisations. Support
in the community is provided by the probation service and local social services
departments.
Research on various aspects of drug misuse is funded by several government
departments.
Action is also being taken by the Government to curb the incidence of solvent
abuse (the inhaling of vapour from glue, lighter fuel and other solvents) by young
people. In 1983 voluntary guidelines were drawn up in co-operation with
retailers to curb the sale of solvents, and legislation passed in Scotland added
solvent misuse to the list of grounds on which a child may be considered to need
compulsory care. In 1985 legislation was passed which made it an offence in
England and Wales knowingly to sell such substances to children under 16.
(Such sales have been prosecuted successfully under common law in Scotland.)
Information and guidance material have been distributed to parents, teachers

and other professional workers to help them to educate young people on the
dangers of the habit and to dissuade them from experimenting.
Cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable cause of illness and death in
Britain. It accounts for not less than 100,000 deaths each year and costs the
NHS an estimated £170 million a year for the treatment of diseases attributable
to smoking (for example, heart disease, lung cancer and bronchitis). Concerned
at these harmful effects, the Government is following an active health education
policy based on advice and education, supported by voluntary agreements with
the tobacco industry aimed at reducing the level of smoking.
National public and media campaigns organised by the government-funded
Health Education Council and the Scottish Health Education Group form the
main thrust of official efforts to discourage smoking. The Government also
supports the work of the voluntary organisation Action on Smoking and Health
(ASH), and seeks the co-operation of a wide range of other organisations in
banning and restricting smoking in trains, buses, theatres and other public
places. (All smoking has been banned, for example, on the London Under¬
ground.) Health authorities have been encouraged to promote non-smoking as
the normal practice on health service premises and, where there is a demand, to
set up special units to give help and advice to people who want to give up
smoking. In this sphere the family doctor continues to play an important role.
Voluntary agreements between the Government and the tobacco industry
regulate the advertising and promotion of tobacco products, tobacco product
modification and sports sponsorship by the industry. Among other things these
control the content of cigarette advertisements and have brought about
reductions in the volume of cigarette poster and cinema advertising, ensured
greater universality and visibility for the Government's health warning (which
now appears on advertisements for sponsored sports events as well as on direct
cigarette advertising and cigarette packets), secured further reductions in the
tar yields of cigarettes, and generated considerable funding from the tobacco
industry for research on the effects of tobacco product modification as well as on
wider aspects of public health. Cigarette advertising is banned on television and
radio.
The Government’s policy has contributed to the general decline in smoking
which is taking place. Cigarette consumption in Britain has fallen by over 20 per
cent since 1978, reflecting a significant reduction in the proportion of people
who smoke.
There has been a growing public awareness in recent years of the importance to
good health of a correct diet. Further evidence of this connection was provided in
1984 in a report on diet and cardiovascular disease produced by a government
committee on medical aspects of food policy. This advised that a reduction in the
amount of certain fats in the diet could help to reduce the incidence or to delay
the onset of disease. In order to help people to reduce their fat intake, the
Government plans to introduce statutory requirements for the labelling of food
to indicate fat content; full nutritional labelling which would include informa¬
tion on energy, protein and carbohydrate content is being encouraged on a
voluntary basis. Certain supermarket chains have already introduced voluntary
labelling schemes. In addition, the Health Education Council and the British
Nutrition Foundation have produced practical dietary advice based on the
committee’s report.
The far-reaching effects of alcohol misuse in terms of illness, family disruption,
inefficiency at work, loss of earnings, accidents and crime are widely acknow¬
ledged. The Government considers that the reduction of such misuse requires a
138

Diseases
range of action by central and local government, voluntary and community
bodies, the health professions, business and trade unions. Of great importance
is the need for individuals to recognise and accept responsibility for their own
health, while attempts to influence the minority who misuse alcohol must, to be
realistic, respect the freedom of the majority who use alcohol responsibly.
In conjunction with the Health Education Council and other agencies, the
Government continues to seek better information about the causes of problem
drinking, to encourage healthier life-styles and to provide earlier identification
and help for the problem drinker.
Treatment and rehabilitation include in-patient and out-patient services in
general and mental hospitals and specialised alcoholism treatment units.
Primary care teams (general practitioners, nurses and social workers) and
voluntary organisations providing hostels, day centres and counselling services
also play an important role. There is close co-operation between statutory and
voluntary organisations and a new national voluntary body, Alcohol Concern
(the National Agency on Alcohol Misuse), was established with government help
in 1984: the organisation is playing a prominent role in prevention of misuse,
training for professional workers and improving the network of local voluntary
agencies and their collaboration with statutory bodies. The Scottish Council on
Alcoholism undertakes similar activities in Scotland.
Health education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is promoted mainly by
the government-financed Health Education Council. The Council mounts
campaigns, produces health education material and engages in a range of
research and evaluation work. It co-operates closely with the health authorities,
professional organisations, voluntary bodies and industry. Its activities strongly
support government action on smoking and problem drinking, and other topics
covered include preparation for parenthood, diet and exercise, dental health and
prevention of coronary heart disease. Health education in Scotland is promoted
by the Scottish Health Education Group.
Most health authorities now have their own health education service which
works closely with health professionals, health visitors, community groups,
local employers and others to determine the most suitable local programmes.
Increased resources in the health service are being directed towards health
education and preventive measures.
District health authorities (health boards in Scotland) carry out programmes of
immunisation against diphtheria, measles, rubella (women and girls only),
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough.
Immunisation is voluntary. Parents are encouraged to protect their children
since the benefits of immunisation far outweigh the small rise of adverse
reactions. The proportion of children being vaccinated has been increasing
since the end of 1978 following an earlier decline. A series of measures are being
taken to limit the spread of the disease AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome), including the introduction of a blood screening test developed by
British researchers, and research into the disease is continuing.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct research
and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of communicable diseases.
Its largest establishment is the recently rebuilt Central Public Health Laboratoiy
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection of
Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms. Two surveillance
centres, one in England and one in Scotland, investigate and monitor human
communicable diseases. Microbiological work in Scotland and Northern Ireland
is conducted mainly in hospital laboratories.

Environmental health officers employed by local authorities are responsible for
the control of air pollution and noise, food hygiene and safety, occupational
health and safety aspects of a variety of premises including offices and shops,
the investigation of unfit housing, and in some instances for refuse collection
and home safety. Doctors who specialise in community medicine and are
employed by the health authorities advise local authorities on the medical
aspects of environmental health, infectious diseases and food poisoning. They
may also co-operate with the authorities responsible for water supply and
sewerage. Environmental health officers at ports and airports carry out duties
concerned with shipping, inspection of imported foods and disease control. In
Northern Ireland district councils are responsible for noise control, collection
and disposal of refuse, clean air, and food composition, labelling and hygiene.
It is illegal to sell food unfit for human consumption or to apply any treatment,
process or additive to lood which makes it injurious to health. Premises where
food or drink is prepared, handled, stored or sold must conform to certain
hygiene standards. Environmental health officers may take for analysis or for
bacteriological or other examination samples of any food on sale or in the
distribution chain. Special regulations control the safety of particular foods
such as milk, meat, ice-cream and shellfish. The Department of Health and
Social Security, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish
Office, the Welsh Office and the Department of Health and Social Services in
Northern Ireland are the central departments responsible for giving advice and
making regulations.
Under the Medicines Act 1968 the health and agriculture ministers are
responsible for licensing the manufacture, marketing and importation of
medicines for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission advises
the ministers on policy regarding medicinal products. The Committees on
Safety of Medicines, on Dental and Surgical Materials and on the Review of
Medicines advise on the safety, quality and efficacy of medicinal products. The
Committee on Safety of Medicines also monitors adverse drug reactions. The Act
also controls the advertising, labelling, packaging, distribution, sale and supply
of medicinal products.
In 1984-85 the health departments spent about £30 million on research and
development, in addition to expenditure by the Medical Research Council (the
main government agency for the support of biomedical research). Priority areas
include primary care, mental health and handicap, physical handicap and
rehabilitation, care of the elderly and children, and dental and nursing research.
The programme is administered in England and Wales by the Chief Scientist of
the Department of Health and Social Security (in Scotland by the Chief Scientist
of the Scottish Home and Health Department) who is supported by independent
advisers covering a wide range of scientific disciplines. The Department is
involved in international research and development, and all the health
departments participate in the European Community’s medical and public
health research programme.
Only people whose names are on the medical or dentists' registers may practise
as doctors or dentists in the National Health Service. University medical and
dental schools are responsible for teaching; the National Health Service provides
hospital clinical facilities for training. Full registration as a doctor requires five
or six years' training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year’s
experience in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years’ training at a dental
school is required. The regulating body for the medical profession is the General
140

Medical Council and for dentists, the General Dental Council. The main
professional associations are the British Medical Association and the British
Dental Association.
The minimum period of training required to qualify for registration as a first
level nurse in general, mental or mental handicapped nursing (and sick
children's nursing in Scotland) is normally three years. Registration as a second
level nurse (enrolled nurse) takes two years (in Scotland 18 months). Midwifery
training for registered general nurses takes 18 months, and for all other student
midwives three years. Health visitors are registered general nurses with
midwifery or approved obstetric experience who have successfully completed a
one-year course in health visiting. District nurses are registered general nurses
who have successfully completed a six-month course followed by a period of
supervised practice in district nursing. The examining bodies for all nurses,
midwives and health visitors are the National Boards for Nursing, Midwifery and
Health Visiting established in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The regulation and registration of these professions is the responsibility of the
United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting.
Pharmacists in general practice and in hospital must be registered with the
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain or the Pharmaceutical Society of
Northern Ireland. A three-year degree course approved by the Pharmaceutical
Society followed by a year's approved training is necessary before registration.
The majority of medicines can be sold or dispensed only by, or under the
supervision of, a registered pharmacist.
The General Optical Council regulates the professions of ophthalmic optician
and dispensing optician; only registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered
medical practitioners) may test sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes
four years including a year of practical experience under supervision. Dispens¬
ing opticians take a two-year full-time course with a year's practical experience
or a part-time day-release course while employed with an optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory scientific officers, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiothera¬
pists, radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight
boards, corresponding to the professions, under the general supervision of the
Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. Training lasts two or four
years and only those who are state registered may be employed in the National
Health Service and some other public services.
Dental therapists (who have undergone a two-year training course) and dental
hygienists (who have undergone a training course of about a year) may carry out
some simple dental work under the direction of a registered dentist.
The member states of the European Community have special health arrange¬
ments under which Community nationals resident in a member state are
entitled to receive any immediately necessary treatment, either free or at a
reduced cost, during visits to other Community countries. There are also
arrangements to cover people who go to work or live in other Community
countries. In addition, there are reciprocal arrangements with some other
countries under which immediately necessary medical treatment is available to
visitors. Otherwise, with some exceptions, visitors are expected to pay if the
purpose of their visit is to seek treatment, and also if they should fall ill while in
the United Kingdom.
Personal Social Services
Responsibility for personal social services rests with the social services
authorities (local authority social services departments in England and Wales,
SOCIAL WELFARE
141
The Elderly

social work departments in Scotland and health and social services boards in
Northern Ireland). Many of their services are directed towards the same groups
of people as those needing health services, for example, elderly or disabled
people. Other groups helped include young families with social problems,
children deprived of a normal home life, mentally ill or handicapped people and
young offenders. Close co-operation is maintained between local authority social
services departments and health authorities, and funding for joint schemes is
being increased. In Scotland local authorities also undertake duties similar to
those of the separate probation and prison after-care service in England and
Wales.
Much of the care given to the elderly and disabled people is provided in the
community itself, by their families, self-help groups and through voluntary
agencies. The statutory sector offers the skilled care needed in particular
services. The importance of the contribution made by the voluntary organisa¬
tions is recognised especially when economies are being made in public
expenditure and the demand on the statutory services is heavy.
The demand for personal social services is expected to rise over the next few
years, owing to the number of elderly people and the changing pattern of care for
mentally ill and mentally handicapped people and the chronically sick. The
Government s policy, embodied in a Care in the Community’ programme, is to
speed up the transfer from hospital to care in the community of patients who do
not specifically need hospital care. It believes that groups such as the elderly, the
disabled, and mentally ill or handicapped people can lead more normal lives in
the community, given appropriate support and facilities.
Services for elderly people are provided by statutory and voluntary bodies to help
them to live at home whenever possible. (Only about 5 per cent of the elderly over
65 live in institutional accommodation.) These services may include advice and
help given by social workers, domestic help, delivery of cooked meals, sitters-in,
night attendants and laundry services as well as day centres, luncheon clubs
and recreational workshops. Appropriate adaptations to the home can overcome
problems of restricted mobility, and there is a wide range of environmental aids
to help people with impaired hearing. Mobile alarm call systems have been
developed to help elderly housebound people to obtain assistance in an
emergency and in some areas ‘good neighbour’ and friendly visiting services are
arranged by the local authority or a voluntary organisation. Many local
authorities provide free or subsidised travel to elderly people within their areas.
Social services authorities also provide residential care for the elderly and infirm
and have powers to register homes run by voluntary organisations or privately.
Local authorities, as part of their responsibility for public housing, provide
accommodation specially designed for elderly people; some of these develop¬
ments have resident wardens. Housing associations and private builders also
build this type of accommodation.
Local social services authorities provide a wide range of personal social services
for disabled people to assist with social rehabilitation and adjustment to
disability. They are also required to establish the number of disabled people in
their area and to publicise services, which may include counselling on personal
and social problems arising from disability; occupational, educational, social
and recreational facilities, either at day centres or elsewhere; adaptations to
homes (such as ramps for wheelchairs, and ground-floor toilets); aids to daily
living; the delivery of cooked meals; and domestic or care attendant help. In
cases of special need, assistance is given with the installation of a telephone or a
television set. For severely disabled people residential accommodation or respite
care may be provided by local authorities and voluntary organisations, and

specially designed housing may be available for those able to look after
themselves.
Some authorities provide free or subsidised travel for disabled people on
public transport, and they are encouraged to provide special access facilities to
public buildings.
Social services authorities make arrangements for the provision of preventive
care for mentally ill people and after-care for both mentally ill and mentally
handicapped people in the community. Services include training centres for the
mentally handicapped and day centres for the mentally ill, as well as social
centres and a variety of residential care for mentally ill and mentally handicap¬
ped people of all ages. Social workers help patients and their families to deal with
social and family problems arising from mental illness or mental handicap and
in certain circumstances can make an application for a mentally disordered
person's compulsory admission to and detention in hospital. The rights of
compulsorily detained patients were extended by legislation in 1983, and a
Mental Health Act Commission was set up to provide better safeguards.
Two recent priorities have been to transfer mentally handicapped children
from long-stay hospitals to community care, and, through a number of special
projects, to improve care for elderly mentally ill people.
An important role in provision of services is played by the many voluntary
organisations concerned with mental illness and mental handicap.
The Government believes in the central importance of the family to the
well-being of society and that stable adult relationships are necessary to support
and enhance family life. Social services authorities, through their own social
workers, give practical help and advice to families facing special problems. This
help includes services for children at risk of injury or neglect who require
accommodation, and support for family carers who look after elderly and other
family members in order to give them a respite. They also help lone parents,
including unmarried mothers, and counsel divorced or separated women. There
are now many reluges run by local authorities or voluntary organisations for
women, often with young children, whose home conditions have become
intolerable. The refuges provide short-term accommodation and support while
attempts are made to alleviate the women’s problems. Many authorities also
contribute to the cost of social work with families (such as marriage guidance)
carried out by voluntary organisations.
An initiative launched by the Government in 1983 seeks to increase voluntary
sector provision in England for disadvantaged families with children under five.
In the same year the Family Policy Studies Centre was established with official
funding to review the impact of public policies on the family and to bring
together research findings.
Day care facilities lor children under five are provided by local authorities, by
voluntary agencies and privately. In allocating places in the day nurseries and
other facilities they themselves provide, local authorities give priority to children
with special social or health needs for day care. They also register, and provide
support and advice services for, childminders, private day nurseries and
playgroups operating in their areas.
The authorities are empowered to offer advice, guidance and assistance to
families in difficulties to promote the welfare of children. The aim is to intervene
at an early stage to reduce the need to receive children into care or bring them
before a court.
The recognition, prevention and management of cases of child abuse are the
joint concern of many authorities, agencies and professions, and local review
SOCIAL WELFARE

committees provide a forum for discussion and co-ordination and draw up
policies and procedures for handling these cases.
Authorities must receive into their care any child under the age of 17 who has
no parent or guardian, who has been abandoned, or whose parents are unable to
provide for him or her, if they are satisfied that such intervention is in the best
interests of the child. The child remains in care until the age of 18 unless
discharged to the care of parents, other relatives or friends. The local authority
may find it necessary to assume the rights and duties of one or both parents.
The parents must be notified and if they object the matter is decided in a court of
law. When taking a decision concerning a child in care, the authorities have to
give first consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the
child. Where children are in care, every effort is made to work with their families
in order, where appropriate, to enable the children to return home.
Children in England and Wales may be brought before a juvenile court if they
are neglected or ill-treated, exposed to moral danger, are beyond the control of
parents, not attending school or (if ten years or over) have committed an offence
other than homicide. At the same time it must be shown that the children need
care or control which they are unlikely to receive unless a care order or other
relevant order is made by the court. Local authorities are responsible for
undertaking inquiries through social workers and consultation with parents,
schools and the police. Children may be committed to the care of a local
authority under a care order if the court considers this appropriate. As an
alternative the court may order supervision by a social worker or a probation
officer for up to three years.
Increasing use is being made of intermediate care orders, especially for young
offenders, under which a child subject to a supervision order is required to
spend a limited period away from home engaged in constructive and organised
activities such as residential courses or camping holidays or evening attendance
at youth clubs.
The law relating to children in care in England and Wales is currently under
review with the aim of rationalisation and amendment.
In Northern Ireland the court may send children to a training school, commit
them to the care of a fit person (which includes a health and social services
board), or make a supervision order. The law relating to children is being
reviewed and the intention in future is to make a distinction between young
offenders and children in need of care and protection. Strong emphasis is placed
on preventive work.
In Scotland children in trouble or in need may be brought before a children's
hearing, which can impose a supervision requirement on a child if it thinks that
compulsory measures of care are appropriate. Under these requirements most
children are allowed to remain at home under the supervision of a social worker
but some may live with foster parents or in a residential establishment while
under supervision. Supervision requirements are reviewed at intervals of not
more than one year until terminated by a children’s hearing or by the Secretary
of State.
When appropriate, children in care are boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home is not
considered appropriate or cannot be found, the child may be placed in a
children's home, voluntary home or other suitable residential accommodation.
Community homes for children in care in England and Wales comprise local
authority and some voluntary children's homes, and include community homes
with education on the premises which provide long-term care usually for the
more difficult children. In Scotland local authorities are responsible for placing
children in their care in foster homes, in local authority or voluntary homes, or
in residential schools. In Northern Ireland there are residential homes for

Adoption
Custodianship
Social Workers
children in the care of the health and social services boards; training schools
and remand homes are administered separately. Regulations concerning
community homes, registered voluntary homes and the boarding out of children
in care are made by central government.
It is generally accepted that adoption is an appropriate way to find a new family
for a very wide range of children of all age groups, including those with physical
and mental handicaps. About 2,000 of the 9,000 children adopted each year
were previously in the care of a local authority. Since 1982 it has been possible
for agencies to offer prospective adoptive parents an allowance if this would help
to lind a family for a child. Adoption is strictly regulated by legislation, and
adoption societies must be approved by the respective social services minister.
Local authorities can also provide an adoption service. The Registrars-General
keep confidential registers of adopted children. Adopted people may be given
details of their original birth record on reaching the age of 18, and counselling is
provided to help them understand the circumstances of their adoption.
Custodianship orders were introduced in 1985. A person who has cared for a
child for some time (for example, a foster parent, step-parent or relative) can
apply to a court for an order giving him or her the legal custody of the child. On
the making of such an order the custodian will have the parental rights and
duties of a natural parent and will be able to make decisions about a child’s
day-to-day care and upbringing, in the same way as a parent. Unlike an adoption
order, a custodianship order may be revoked.
The effective operation of the social services largely depends on the appointment
of professionally qualified social workers trained in the methods of social work.
Training courses in social work are provided by universities, polytechnics (in
Scotland, central institutions) and colleges of further education; their length
depends upon educational qualifications and previous experience and can
extend from one to four years. The Central Council for Education and Training
in Social Work recognises social work courses and offers advice to people
considering entry to the profession.
Professional social workers (including those working in the National Health
Service) are mainly employed by the social services departments of local
authorities. Others work in the probation service, the education welfare service,
or in voluntary organisations.
Voluntary Social Services
There is a long tradition of voluntary service to the community in Britain, and
the partnership between the voluntary and statutory sectors is encouraged by
the Government. It has been estimated that nearly a quarter of all adults take
part in some form of voluntary work during the course of a year. Local and health
authorities plan and carry out their duties taking account of the work of
voluntary organisations, and include them in the planning process. Voluntary
provision enables these authorities to continue the trend towards local
community care rather than institutional care for the elderly, the mentally ill
and mentally handicapped people.
An Opportunities for Volunteering Scheme, started by the Government in
1982, together with an Unemployed Voluntary Action Fund in Scotland and a
Community Volunteering Scheme in Northern Ireland, have provided support
for over 1,000 schemes by voluntary agencies to enable unemployed volunteers
to help disadvantaged groups in the community. Voluntary organisations also
participate in several other government schemes, including the Community
Programme, the Voluntary Projects Programme and the Youth Training Scheme.
SOCIAL WELFARE
145
Voluntary
Organisations
Voluntary organisations derive their income from several sources including
voluntary contributions, central and local government grants, earnings from
commercial activities and investments. Some 450 bodies receive direct grants
from government health and social services departments; in 1983-84 these
amounted to some £30 million out of a total government funding of £182-3
million to voluntary organisations. Tax changes in recent budgets have helped
the voluntary movement to secure a larger flow of funds.
Many voluntary organisations are registered charities, and in England and
Wales the Charity Commission, a government agency, gives free advice to
trustees of charities, initiating schemes to modify their purposes or facilitate
their administration when necessary. Voluntary organisations qualify for
charitable status if their activities help to relieve poverty, advance education or
religion, or promote certain other purposes of public benefit including good
community relations, the prevention of discrimination on the grounds of race
and sex, the protection of health and the promotion of equal opportunity. The
Charities Aid Foundation, an independent body, aids the flow of funds to charity
from individuals, companies and grant-making trusts.
Co-ordination of government interests in the voluntary sector throughout
Britain is the responsibility of the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit.
There are thousands of voluntary organisations concerned with health and
social welfare, ranging from national bodies to small individual local groups.
‘Self-help' groups have been the most rapidly expanding part of the voluntary
sector in the last decade—examples include bodies which provide playgroups for
pre-school children, or help their members to cope with a particular disability.
Many organisations belong to larger associations or are represented on local or
national co-ordinating councils or committees. Some are chiefly concerned with
giving personal service, others with the formation of public opinion and
exchange of information. Some carry out both functions. They may be staffed by
both professional and voluntary workers.
The main co-ordinating body in England, which aims to provide central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies, is the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations, which acts as a resource and development agency for
the voluntary sector. It works to extend the involvement of voluntary organisa¬
tions in dealing with social issues, to protect the interests and independence of
voluntary agencies, and to provide them with a range of advice, information and
other services. The Scottish Council for Community and Voluntary Organisa¬
tions, the Wales Council for Voluntary Action and the Northern Ireland Council
for Voluntary Action perform similar functions.
The Volunteer Centre is a national voluntary organisation and centre for
information and research on voluntary work. There are many full-time and
part-time local volunteer bureaux which direct volunteers to opportunities for
voluntary service in both the voluntary and statutory sectors.
Specialist voluntary organisations concerned with personal and family
problems include the family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Associa¬
tion, Family Service Units and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage
Guidance Council; the National Council of Voluntary Child Care Organisations;
the National Council for One Parent Families; Child Poverty Action Group and
the Claimants' Union, both of which provide expert advice on social security
benefits; and the Samaritans, who help the lonely, the depressed and the
suicidal.
Community service of many kinds is given by young people; this is often
channelled through national and local organisations such as Community
Service Volunteers, Pensioners Link, Scouts and Girl Guides.

BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled is given by—among others—the
British Red Cross Society, St John Ambulance, the Women’s Royal Voluntary
Service and the Leagues of Hospital Friends. Societies which help people with
particular disabilities and difficulties include the Royal National Institute for the
Blind, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, the Royal Association for
Disability and Rehabilitation, the Disabled Living Foundation, the Disablement
Income Group, MIND (National Association for Mental Health), MENCAP (Royal
Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults), the Spastics Society,
Alcoholics Anonymous, Age Concern, Help the Aged and their equivalents in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
National organisations whose work is specifically religious in inspiration
include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Committee on Social
Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England Children's Society, the
Church of England Council for Social Aid, the Young Men's Christian
Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Catholic Marriage
Advisory Council and the Jewish Welfare Board.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and
old people, provides flats and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with family
problems, and assists in hospitals and clinics and in emergencies.
Over 900 Citizens Advice Bureaux give explanation and advice to people who
are in doubt about their rights or who do not know about the state or voluntary
services available. Some areas have law centres and housing advisory centres.
Social Security
The general aim of the social security programme is to provide an efficient and
responsive system of financial help for people who are elderly, sick, disabled,
unemployed, widowed or bringing up children. Certain benefits provide an
income for people who have no earnings because they are retired, unemployed or
sick. Others provide income for widows; assistance with extra expenses arising
from disablement; compensation for injury or disease caused at work or while in
the armed forces; and help with the cost of bringing up children. Alongside these
benefits there are certain means-tested benefits for people who have insufficient
means of support.
The payment of many benefits depends on prior payments to the National
Insurance scheme, while others are available without contribution conditions.
The former are paid from the National Insurance Fund, which consists of
contributions from employed people and their employers, self-employed people
and the Government. Non-contributory benefits are financed from general
taxation revenue. Appeals relating to claims for the various benefits are decided
by independent tribunals.
Expenditure on social security has nearly doubled in real terms since 1970
and now costs the equivalent of nearly £2,100 a year for every household. Part of
the increase has been due to the rising numbers of the elderly, and part to the
growth in unemployment; much, however, has been due to real improvement in
the level of benefits, the creation of new benefits and increased family support.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers the services in
Great Britain: in Northern Ireland they are administered by the Department of
Health and Social Services. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners
and their dependants are the responsibility of the Department of Health and
Social Security throughout the United Kingdom. Advice on social security is
given to the Government by the Social Security Advisory Committee.
Over the 40 years since the basic structure of the present social security
system was established there have been many piecemeal changes and develop¬
ments, and the system has become very complex. As spending on the system

accounts for nearly one-third of all public expenditure, and pressures for
improvements and increased expenditure are bound to continue, the Govern¬
ment considered that a re-examination of the system was required. It therefore
established in 1984 four reviews covering provision for retirement, help with
housing costs, benefits for children and young people, and supplementary
benefit. A survey was also carried out to find out more about the numbers of
disabled people and their needs.
As a result of the reviews, the Government published in June 1985 a
consultative paper. Reform of Social Security, containing proposals for a
wide-ranging reform of the structure of the system. The main proposals include
the phasing-out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, which is
additional to the basic state pension, and its replacement by a system of
compulsory contributions by employers and employees to occupational or
personal pension schemes; the introduction of a new range of income-related
benefits to replace family income supplement, supplementary benefit and
housing benefit; and the provision of better help for low-income families at times
of special need such as bereavement and maternity. If adopted, the main reforms
will be introduced from April 1987.
As part of its plans to improve the management of the social security system
and the quality of its service to the public, the Department of Health and Social
Security is embarking on the biggest computerisation programme in Europe.
Entitlement to National Insurance benefits such as retirement pension,
sickness and invalidity benefit, unemployment benefit, widow's benefit,
maternity allowance, death grant and child’s special allowance is dependent
upon the payment of contributions. Industrial injuries benefits are non¬
contributory, but are also payable from the National Insurance Fund. There are
four classes of contributions. Class 1 contributions, which are related to
earnings, are paid by employees and employers. The contribution is lower if the
employer operates a ‘contracted-ouf occupational pension scheme (see below).
Self-employed people pay a flat rate Class 2 contribution and a Class 4
contribution which is assessed as a percentage of profits or gains within certain
limits; they are not eligible for unemployment and industrial injuries benefits.
Voluntary Class 3 contributions are made by people wanting to safeguard rights
to some benefits.
Employees who continue working after pensionable age (60 for women and 65
for men) do not pay contributions but the employer continues to be liable. People
earning less than the lower earnings limit are not liable for contributions;
neither are their employers. Self-employed people with earnings below a set
annual amount may apply for exemption and those over pensionable age are
excused payment of contributions.
For most benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before benefit
can be paid at all, a certain number of contributions has to be paid; secondly,
the full rate of benefit cannot be paid unless contributions have been made or
credited up to a specific level over a specified period. Benefits are increased each
November, the uprating being linked to increases in retail prices. The main
benefits (payable weekly) are summarised below. The rates shown in Tables 5-9
are those effective from November 1985.
A state retirement pension is payable on retirement to women at the age of 60
and to men at the age of 65. At present, the state pension scheme consists of a
basic pension together with an additional earnings-related pension. Pensioners
are permitted to earn up to £75 a week before the amount of their pension is
reduced; those still at work five years after the minimum pension age are eligible
to receive a full pension. A non-contributory retirement pension is payable to
148

Mothers and

Widows
Sick and
Disabled
People
people over the age of 80 who have not qualified for a contributory pension.
People whose pensions do not give them sufficient resources to live on may be
entitled to supplementary pension, which is calculated on the same basis as
supplementary benefit (see p 151).
Rights to basic pension are safeguarded for mothers who are away from work
looking after children or for people giving up work to care for severely disabled
relatives. Women contributors receive the same pension as men with the same
earnings.
Employers are free to ‘contract-out' their employees from the state scheme for
the additional earnings-related pension and to provide their own occupational
pension in its place, provided that the latter is at least as good as the state
additional pension. The State remains responsible for the basic pension. There
are at present around 90,000 occupational schemes, with some 11 million
members—about half the working population. As part of a programme to reform
the occupational pensions system, the Government is introducing measures to
protect against inflation the pension rights of people who change jobs before
pension age; to give workers the right on leaving a scheme to a fair transfer
value; and to require pension funds and other pension schemes to provide
access to more information about their schemes.
A non-contributory maternity grant of £25 is payable for each living child born
and for a stillborn child if the pregnancy lasts for at least 28 weeks. Contributory
maternity allowance is a weekly benefit normally paid for 18 weeks, starting 11
weeks before the baby is expected to women who have paid full National
Insurance contributions. A working mother is entitled to paid maternity leave if
she has been working for the same firm for at least two years (five years in the
case of part-time workers). The payment is calculated at 90 per cent of weekly
earnings, less the standard maternity allowance, and is paid for the first six
weeks of absence.
Non-contributory child benefit is the main social security benefit for children.
Tax free and normally paid to the mother, it is payable for children up to the age
of 16 and for those up to the age of 19 if they continue in full-time non-advanced
education. A sum in addition to child benefit, called one-parent benefit, is
payable to certain people, whether parents or not, bringing up one or more
children on their own. A weekly contributory child's special allowance is payable
to a mother on the death of a former husband if the marriage was dissolved or
annulled and he was contributing to the support of the children. A non¬
contributory guardian's allowance for an orphaned child is payable to a person
who is entitled to child benefit for that child. In certain circumstances it can be
paid on the death of only one parent.
A widow's allowance may be payable for the first 26 weeks of widowhood, and an
additional sum is often payable for each child. After this a widowed mother with
a young family receives a widowed mother’s allowance with an addition for each
child. Widow’s pension is payable to a widow who is 40 years or over when her
husband dies or when her entitlement to widowed mother’s allowance ends.
Payment continues until the widow remarries or begins drawing retirement
pension. Widows also benefit under the industrial injuries scheme.
A man whose wife dies when both are over pension age inherits his wife’s
pension rights just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.
There is a large variety of benefits for people unable to work because of sickness
or disablement. Statutory sick pay with additions for a wife or other adult
dependants is payable by an employer for the first 28 weeks of an employee's
illness in any tax year. Employees not covered for statutory sick pay can claim
sickness benefit instead, as can self-employed people.
SOCIAL WELFARE
149
Unemployment
Benefit
An invalidity pension with additions for a wife and children is payable when
statutory sick pay or sickness benefit ends if the beneficiary is still incapable of
work. An invalidity allowance is paid with the pension to those people who
become sick more than five years before minimum retirement age. An additional
earnings-related pension may also be payable. A severe disablement allowance is
payable to people of working age, including housewives, who are unable to work
and do not qualify for the National Insurance invalidity pension.
Various benefits are payable for disablement caused by an accident at work or
a prescribed disease. Disablement benefit is usually paid after a qualifying
period of 15 weeks if, as a result of an industrial accident or a prescribed
disease, there is a loss of physical or mental faculty. (During the qualifying
period sick pay or sickness benefit may be payable.) The amount depends on the
extent of the disablement as assessed by an adjudicating medical authority but
for disablement of less than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid. In certain
circumstances disablement benefits may be supplemented by unemployability
supplement; constant attendance allowance; an additional allowance payable in
certain cases of exceptionally severe disablement; a special hardship allowance
for a person who is unfit to return to his or her regular job or to do work of an
equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowance, which raises the
disablement pension or gratuity to the 100 per cent assessment rate during
hospital treatment for the industrial injury. Increases of disablement benefit for
dependants may be payable with unemployability supplement.
A non-contributory, tax-free attendance allowance may be payable to severely
disabled people at either a higher or a lower rate depending upon the amount of
care and attention they require.
An invalid care allowance may be payable to certain categories of people aged
between 16 and pension age who cannot go to work because they are caring for a
severely disabled person receiving an attendance allowance.
Physically disabled people unable or virtually unable to walk may be entitled to
a tax-free mobility allowance to help to pay their transport costs. People aged
between 5 and 66 may claim and payment can continue up to the age of 75.
An independent organisation called Motability assists disabled drivers and
passengers wanting to use their mobility allowance to obtain a vehicle.
Unemployment benefit is payable for up to a year in any one spell of unem¬
ployment. Periods covered by unemployment or sickness benefit, maternity
allowance or some training allowances, which are eight weeks or less apart, are
linked to form one period of interruption of employment. Generally anyone
claiming unemployment benefit has to be available for employment, but
unemployed people wishing to do voluntary work in the community can do so in
certain circumstances without loss of entitlement to benefit.

A death grant is payable on the death of a contributor or a contributor's near
relative. It is normally £30 for an adult and a smaller sum for a child.
Supplementary benefit is payable to people of the age of 16 and over who are not
in full-time work or at school and whose financial resources fall below a certain
level. The amounts shown in Table 6 are the weekly levels laid down for the
requirements of married couples, single householders and others. The benefit
payable amounts to the difference between a person's existing resources and
these levels. The long-term rates apply to people aged 60 or over, most disabled
people, and to those people aged less than 60 who have received supplementary
benefit or long-term incapacity benefit continuously for one year, provided that
the award is nof subject to the condition of being available for employment.
Families receiving supplementary benefit (as with family income supplement)
are entitled to a number of other benefits including housing benefit (see below),
free spectacles, free school meals, milk and vitamins for expectant mothers and
for children under school age, and exemption from National Health Service
prescription charges and charges for dental treatment. Lump sum payments
may also be made for special needs such as clothing, furniture and domestic
appliances.

Family income supplement is a cash benefit for families with low incomes where
one of the parents is in full-time work and where there is at least one dependent
child. It is payable when the gross weekly income of a family falls below a
prescribed amount, which varies according to the number of children in the
family but is the same for single- and two-parent families. ‘Full-time’ work
means, for the purpose of the benefit, work of at least 30 hours a week by either
parent in two-parent families or 24 hours a week for one-parent families. The
weekly rate of the supplement is half the difference between the family's gross
income and the prescribed amount, up to a maximum figure depending on the
number and age of children in the family.
People with low incomes, whether in work or not (for example, those who have
retired, or are sick or unemployed) who have difficulty in paying their full rent
and rates (local property taxes) may qualify for housing benefit, which is

administered by local authorities (in Northern Ireland, by the Department of the
Environment for owner-occupiers and by the Housing Executive for tenants).
Council (public sector) tenants may apply for a rent rebate, and private tenants
for a rent allowance. Both tenants and owner-occupiers may apply for rate
rebates. The amount of benefit depends on four considerations: income (some of
which may be disregarded): the amount of rent and rates paid; the size of the
family; and the presence of other people in the household. Benefit is worked out
by comparing a ‘needs allowance', which is intended to cover basic weekly living
expenses (the amounts are shown in Table 8), against income. Where income
equals the needs allowance, entitlement will be equal to 60 per cent of the eligible
rent and rates. This amount is progressively increased or decreased if income is
less than or greater than the needs allowance. Deductions from benefit are
usually made if a non-dependant lives in the same household. People receiving
supplementary benefit are entitled to a 100 per cent rebate or allowance of their

Pensions are payable to people disabled as a result of service in the armed forces
or by certain injuries received in the merchant navy or civil defence during
war-time, or to civilians injured by enemy action. The amount varies according
to the degree of disablement and rank; an allowance is paid for dependants.
There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the main ones being for
unemployability, the need for constant attendance, the provision of extra

comforts, and as a compensation for a lower standard of occupation. An age
allowance is payable to disabled pensioners aged 65 or over and whose
assessment is 40 per cent or more. Pensions are also paid to war widows and
orphans.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service for
war pensioners, war widows and war orphans. It works closely with the many
voluntary and ex-Serviee organisations who give financial aid and personal help
to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.

Social security benefits, other than child, maternity, sickness, invalidity and
disablement benefit, are included in the taxable income on which income tax is
assessed. Various income tax reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account of
age or liability for the support of dependants. Supplementary benefit (except
that paid to the unemployed), family income supplement, attendance allow¬
ances, mobility allowance, war disability pensions including supplementary
allowances, and war widow’s pension and allowances are not taxable.
Other benefits for which unemployed people and those on low incomes may be
eligible include exemption from health service charges (see p 131), free
spectacles, free school meals and free legal aid. Reduced charges are often made
to the unemployed, for example, for adult education and public entertainments,
and pensioners usually enjoy concessionary transport fares.

As part of the European Community’s efforts to promote the free movement of
labour, there are regulations providing for equality of treatment and the
protection of social security rights for employed and self-employed people
working in another member state. The regulations also cover retirement
pensioners and other beneficiaries who have been employed, or self-employed,
as well as dependants. Benefits affected include child benefit and those for
sickness and maternity, unemployment, retirement, invalidity, accidents at
work and occupational diseases.
Britain also has reciprocal social security agreements with a number of other
countries. Their scope and the benefits they cover vary, but the majority cover
most National Insurance benefits and benefits for families.
7 Education
Policies
British education aims to develop fully the abilities of individuals, both young
and old, for their own benefit and that of society as a whole. Compulsory
schooling takes place between the ages of 5 and 16, although some provision is
made for children under 5, and many pupils remain at school beyond the
minimum leaving age. Post-school education (mainly at universities,
polytechnics and colleges of further and higher education) is organised flexibly
to provide a wide range of opportunities for academic and vocational education
and continuing study throughout life. For many years the education service has
been characterised by change, and much of the post-1945 period has also been
marked by growth: large increases in the number of pupils, the expansion of
higher educational opportunities, and increased expenditure. Although the
process of change continues, recent years have seen increasing reassessment
and consolidation with a view to making the best use of resources in the light of
difficult economic circumstances and a substantial drop in the birth rate.
The overriding objectives of the Government's education policies are to raise
standards and to achieve better value for money throughout the education
system. In schools, standards of achievement are being raised by securing a
broader and more balanced curriculum for all pupils, by reforming the public
examination system and by improving the quality of teaching through better
teacher selection, training and deployment. Parental choice of school and
involvement in school organisation is being increased, and gifted children from
less well-off homes are being helped to benefit from attendance at certain
independent schools.
Special attention is also being given both to the provision of better
pre-vocational education and training in schools and colleges for the 14- to
18-year-old age-group, and to the 40 per cent of lower-attaining pupils in the
final years of compulsory education for whom public examinations at 16-plus
are not appropriate. It is recognised that co-operation between the education
system and industry can help young people to acquire the skills necessary to
maintain Britain's position as a leading industrial and trading nation. Many
organisations already work to improve such links, and further contacts are
being encouraged. An important objective has been to extend the knowledge and
use of microcomputers in schools.
The Government's policies for raising standards in schools in England and
Wales were set out in a White Paper, Better Schools, published in March 1985. In
response to the report of an inquiry into the education of ethnic minority groups
the Government has also described its policies for encouraging children from
the ethnic minorities to achieve their full potential.
A forecast decline of about one-third in the number of 18- to 21-year-olds by
the mid-1990s, and the continuing need to restrict government funding are
among the major factors which have led the Government to review the future of
higher education. Its conclusions were set out in a discussion paper, The
Development of Higher Education into the 1990s, published in May 1985. A
continuing aim is to encourage institutions to improve their management and
planning, and to become more flexible and responsive to the economic and social
needs of the country. In line with the concern to maintain British expertise in
science, engineering and technology, a shift in provision from the arts and social
156

sciences towards these areas is occurring, while higher education institutions
and industry are being encouraged to collaborate more closely for their mutual
benefit. The Government considers that access to higher education courses
should be available to all those who can benefit from them and who wish to do
so, provided that the benefit derived from the course is sufficient to justify its
cost to the taxpayer.
The already strong vocational element in many courses in the non-advanced
sector of further education is also being increased. The role played by further
education institutions in providing training and continuing education is of
great importance, especially at a time of increasing technological change and
high unemployment.
One of the distinctive features of the education service is the large degree to
which responsibility for provision is decentralised. Overall responsibility for all
aspects of education in England, and for the Government’s relations with and
support for universities throughout Britain, rests with the Secretary of State for
Education and Science. The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have responsibility in their respective countries for non¬
university education, and are consulted about education in universities.
The main concerns of the education departments (the Department of
Education and Science in England, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Education
Department, and the Department of Education for Northern Ireland) are
formulating national education policies, allocating resources and influencing
the other partners in the education service (the local education authorities,
school governing bodies and teachers). The departments are also responsible for
the supply and training of all teachers.
The provision of maintained school education and most post-school education
outside universities is the responsibility of local education authorities. They
employ teachers and other staff, provide and maintain buildings, supply
equipment and materials and, in England and Wales, provide grants to students
proceeding to further and higher education. Universities are self-governing
institutions receiving most of their income from central government grants. In
Scotland the central institutions, which provide most vocational higher
education to degree level, and colleges of education, which provide teacher¬
training, are administered by independent governing bodies. In Northern
Ireland colleges of education are controlled by the Department of Education or by
voluntary agencies.
Planned spending on education in 1985-86 is some £13,600 million, about 10
per cent of general government expenditure. More than four-fifths of this
expenditure is incurred by local authorities, which plan their spending
according to local needs and circumstances.
Reductions in spending by authorities on schools reflect the declining number
of schoolchildren, the removal of surplus school places, and considerable
savings in the provision of school meals and milk. Additional provision is being
made to meet the cost of a large increase in the number of young people staying
on at school after 16.
Local education authorities are directly responsible for the funding of most
non-advanced further education courses. In order, however, to make training
and vocational education more relevant to employment needs, responsibility for
a quarter of the budget spent in England and Wales on work-related courses has
been placed with the Manpower Services Commission.
An education support grant scheme introduced in England and Wales enables
the Government to pay a limited sum (some £22 million in 1985-86) to support
local authority expenditure on educational activities of national priority.
EDUCATION
157
SCHOOLS
Management
Support for the universities and certain other higher education institutions,
and grants to students, account for most of the direct expenditure by central
government. Nearly 90 per cent of universities' expenditure is financed by the
Government, the major part being made available through a block grant to the
University Grants Committee, which allocates the funds to individual universi¬
ties and certain other institutions. The Committee also advises the Government
on the future development of the universities. The independent University of
Buckingham receives no assistance from public funds although its students can
apply for mandatory grants.
Funds for advanced courses in polytechnics and other colleges of further
education maintained by local authorities are allocated centrally. The National
Advisory Body for Local Authority Higher Education advises the Government on
how these resources should be allocated in England; a Welsh Advisory Body has
a similar function in Wales. In Scotland the Scottish Tertiary Education
Advisory Council has advisory functions on non-university education.
Many universities, polytechnics and other higher education institutions
undertake training, research or consultancy for commercial firms, and the
Government is encouraging them to secure a larger flow of funds from these
sources. A number have endowments or receive grants or gifts from foundations
and benefactors.
Parents are required by law to see that their children receive efficient full-time
education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.
Some 9-9 million children attend Britain's 36,500 schools. Most receive free
education financed from public funds, but a small proportion (roughly 6 per
cent) attend schools wholly independent of direct public financial support.
Boys and girls are taught together in most primary schools, and 86 per cent of
pupils in maintained secondary schools in England and Wales and over 60 per
cent in Northern Ireland attend mixed schools. In Scotland nearly all secondary
schools are mixed. Most independent schools for younger children are co¬
educational; the majority providing secondary education are single-sex,
although the number of mixed schools is growing.
No fees are charged to parents of children at maintained schools, and books
and equipment are free, although in Northern Ireland a small proportion of
grammar school pupils is admitted on a fee-paying basis.
Schools supported from public funds are of two main kinds in England and
Wales: county schools and voluntary schools. County schools are provided and
maintained by local education authorities wholly out of public funds. Voluntary
schools, mostly established by religious denominations, are also wholly main¬
tained from public funds but the governors of some types of voluntary school
contribute to capital costs. Nearly a third of the 31,000 or so primary and
secondary schools supported by public funds in England and Wales are
voluntary schools, most of them Anglican or Roman Catholic. Each publicly
maintained school has a governing body, which includes governors appointed
by the local education authority and teacher and parent representatives. The
Government considers that the powers and duties at present exercised by
governing bodies give them too restricted a role in school management in
relation to that of the education authority or the head teacher. As part of its
strategy to improve standards, it proposes to change the composition of such
bodies and to extend their powers. Planned legislation will provide for equal
numbers of parent and local authority governors, so that no single interest will
predominate. In future, governing bodies will have responsibility for the main
policies of their schools, and for the preparation of a statement of their schools'

Schools
curricular aims and objectives. They will also have ultimate responsibility for
school discipline, and will have a say in the appointment and dismissal of staff.
In Scotland most of the schools supported from public funds are provided by
education authorities and are known as public schools (in England this term is
used for a type of independent school, see p 159). There is a statutory
requirement to establish school councils whose membership includes teachers,
parents, people interested in religious education, and in certain cases repre¬
sentatives of further education and of the community at large.
In Northern Ireland there are three main categories of grant-aided school:
controlled schools, owned and managed by the area education and library
boards and having all their expenditure met from public funds; voluntary
schools, mainly under Roman Catholic management and also maintained
largely by public funds: and voluntary grammar schools, which may be under
either Roman Catholic or non-denominational management and receive grants
from the Department of Education. Since the end of 1985 all grant-aided schools
have included elected parents and teachers on their boards of governors. It is
government policy to encourage integrated education, providing for both ;
Protestant and Roman Catholic pupils, where there is a local desire for it.
In England, Wales and Scotland parents have a statutory right to express a |
preference for a particular school for their children, and have an effective
channel of appeal at local level. Schools also have to publish basic information :
about themselves and their public examination results.
Although there is no statutory requirement to provide education for the |
under-fives, successive governments have expanded nursery education within
the constraints of limited resources. Current expenditure plans allow for the |
maintenance of existing levels of provision or a small increase, mainly by
converting surplus primary school accommodation to nursery use. In England
some 40 per cent of three- and four-year-olds receive education in nursery
schools or classes or in infants’ classes in primary schools. In addition, many
children (a further third of three- and four-year-olds) attend informal pre-school
playgroups organised by parents and voluntary bodies such as the Pre-School
Playgroups Association.
Compulsory education begins at five when children in England and Wales go
to infant schools or departments; at seven many go on to junior schools or
departments. The usual age for transfer from primary to secondary schools is 11
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but a number of local authorities in >
England have established ‘first’ schools for pupils aged 5 to 8, 9 or 10 and
middle’ schools covering various age-ranges between 8 and 14. In Scotland the
primary schools take children from 5 to 12, normally having infant classes for
children under seven, although in a few areas there are separate infant schools.
The publicly maintained system of education aims to give all children an
education suited to their particular abilities. About 90 per cent of the
maintained secondary school population in England and Wales attend compre¬
hensive schools, which take pupils without reference to ability or aptitude and
provide a wide range of secondary education for all or most of the children of a
district. The schools can be organised in a number of ways, including those that
take the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; middle schools whose
pupils move on to senior comprehensive schools at 12, 13 or 14, leaving at 16 or
18; and schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a sixth-form
or a tertiary college for pupils over 16. Tertiary colleges provide a full range of
vocational courses for students over 16, as well as academic courses. Most other
children receive secondary education in ‘grammar’ or ‘secondary Inodern'
schools to which they are allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11.
EDUCATION
159
Scottish secondary education is almost completely non-selective; the majority
of schools are six-year comprehensives. Because of local circumstances there are
some comprehensive schools at which courses may last only four years or less;
pupils may transfer at the end of their second or fourth years to a six-year
comprehensive.
In Northern Ireland secondary education is organised largely along selective
lines according to children's abilities.
Independent schools are outside the publicly maintained sector, but they must
register with the appropriate education department and are open to inspection.
They can be required to remedy serious shortcomings in their premises,
accommodation or instruction and to exclude anyone regarded as unsuitable to
teach in or to be the proprietor of a school.
There are about 2,500 independent schools educating more than 500,000
pupils of all ages. They charge fees, varying from about £100 a term for day
pupils at nursery age to £2,000 a term for senior boarding pupils. Many offer
bursaries to help pupils from less well-off families. Such pupils may also be
helped by local education authorities—particularly if the authorities’ own
schools cannot meet the needs of individual children—or by the Government’s
assisted places scheme, under which assistance is given in relation to parental
income (over 200 schools participate in the scheme). The Government also gives
income-related help with fees to pupils at certain specialist music and ballet
schools.
There is great variety of provision within the independent sector, ranging
from small kindergarten to large boarding schools and from new and in some
cases experimental schools to ancient foundations. A number of independent
schools have also been established by religious and ethnic minorities. The 550
boys’, girls' and mixed preparatory schools are so called because they prepare
children for the Common Entrance Examination to senior schools. The normal
age range is from seven-plus to 11, 12 or 13, but many of the schools now have
pre-preparatory departments for younger children.
Independent schools for older pupils—from 11, 12 or 13 to 18 or 19—include
nearly 500 which are sometimes referred to as public schools’. Today the term is
becoming less frequently used but refers to the mainly boys’ schools (which are
increasingly admitting girls) belonging to the Headmasters’ Conference and/or
the Governing Bodies Association and to schools in membership of the
Governing Bodies of Girls' Schools Association. They should not be confused
with the state-supported public schools in Scotland.
Special educational needs embrace learning difficulties arising from emotional
or behavioural disorders as well as physical or mental handicap. Local education
authorities in England and Wales must ensure that children with special needs
are educated in ordinary schools provided that the parents’ wishes have been
taken into account and that this is compatible with meeting the needs of the
child, with the provision of efficient education for the other children in the
school, and with the best use of resources. In Scotland, school placing is a
matter for agreement between education authorities and individual parents.
There are over 1,800 special schools (both day and boarding), including those
run by voluntary organisations, which cater for a wide variety of handicap.
Teachers in publicly maintained schools are appointed by local education
authorities or school governing bodies. There are more than 520,000 teachers,
and the overall pupil—teacher ratio in primary and secondary schools is about
18 to 1. Teachers in these schools must hold qualifications approved by the
appropriate education department (see p 167).

BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The
Curriculum
Technical
and Vocational
Education
Initiative
The content of the secular curriculum in maintained schools in England and
Wales is the responsibility of the local education authority and of the schools'
governors. In practice, responsibility is largely devolved on head teachers and
their staff. In order to ensure a broad and balanced education which is relevant
to the needs of the modern world, and to widen educational opportunities as
much as possible, the Government has issued guidance on the curriculum for
both primary and secondary school pupils. It considers that secondary pupils up
to the age of 16 should follow a broad curriculum including English,
mathematics and science, some study of the humanities including history,
religious and physical education, and opportunities for both practical and
aesthetic activities. Most pupils should also study a foreign language. One aim of
the guidelines is to seek to ensure that girls do not limit their career prospects,
as some now do, by dropping the study of science, craft and certain other
subjects too early in their school education. A programme of development
projects has been introduced to provide a more effective education with a
practical slant for lower-attaining pupils who do not benefit fully from existing
courses. A large number of school-industry links schemes have been initiated in
recent years in order to improve liaison between schools and the world of work.
In Wales, the Welsh language is taught and is used as either the main or
secondary medium of teaching in some schools. The content and management
of the curriculum in Scotland is the responsibility of education authorities and
individual head teachers though guidance is issued by the Scottish Education
Department. Provision is made for teaching in Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas. A
new curriculum structure for 14- to 16-year-olds has been established which
includes the compulsory study of English, mathematics and science. In 1984, as
part of a development programme for 16- to 18-year-olds, a flexible system of
vocational courses based on modules or short units of study was introduced in
schools and colleges in disciplines ranging from business and administration to
engineering and industrial production. Though designed primarily to improve
the preparation of young people for working life, the courses should also meet
the needs of many adults entering training or returning to education. The
courses lead to the award of a new National Certificate.
In Northern Ireland major programmes of curriculum review and development
are in progress in both primary and secondary schools. The objective in the
secondary sector is to improve the quality and relevance of education for all
pupils in the 1 l-to-16 age-range, with more emphasis on economic and political
awareness, technological understanding, personal development and the en¬
couragement of study skills. At the same time teaching methods are being
reconsidered.
Over the last 20 years much has been done by the educational authorities to
meet difficulties encountered by the ethnic minorities. English language
teaching has received priority, but attention has been increasingly directed at
the question of mother-tongue teaching. Emphasis has been placed on the need
for schools to take account of the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of pupils.
The monitoring of curriculum content and promotion of curriculum develop¬
ment are performed in England and Wales by the Schools Curriculum
Development Committee, in Scotland by the Consultative Committee on the
Curriculum and in Northern Ireland by the Council for Educational Develop¬
ment. At some 500 teachers' centres in England and Wales, teachers meet for
curriculum development work, discussion and in-service training.
A growing recognition of the need to equip pupils with the skills needed by
modern commerce and industry led the Government to launch a Technical and
Vocational Education Initiative in England and Wales in 1983. Run by the
Manpower Services Commission, the scheme consists of a series of pilot projects

which are providing some 40,000 young people aged 14 to 18 with full-time
courses of technical, vocational and general education leading to recognised
technical qualifications. The scheme was extended to Scotland in 1984 and will
last for at least five years.
Great importance is attached to the acquisition and use of computers by
schools, in view of the growing importance to the economy and society of
information technology. As a result of the Government’s Micros in Schools and
Micros in Primaries schemes, every secondary and almost all primary schools in
Britain now have at least one microcomputer and the average in secondary
schools is now ten (making a total of over 100,000 machines). A six-year
Microelectronics Education Programme (MEP) in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland which began in 1980, and the separate Scottish Microelectronics
Development Programme (SMDP), aim to give young people a better understand¬
ing of the new technology’ and its applications. Priority has been given to
curriculum development (especially in subjects such as science, mathematics,
crafts, design and technology) including the production and supply of more and
better computer software; in-service teacher training; and the creation of
regional information centres. When the MEP ends in 1986 a new Microelectro¬
nics Support Unit will continue to assist the work of local education authorities
and for three years from 1985 special funds are being made available to promote
the use of educational software in schools. Britain has developed a world lead in
several aspects of computer education and the large number of countries which
have bought British educational software, signed licensing agreements or
purchased consultancy services from the MEP or SMDP include India, Australia,
Mexico, Israel, the United States and Tunisia.
British School Technology, an independent education centre to promote the
teaching of technology in secondary schools and colleges, is being developed
with funding of £2-5 million over three years (beginning in April 1984) from the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Manpower Services Commission.
The centre provides help to local education authorities wanting to introduce
courses into their schools, assists in training teachers, co-operates with
examination boards to assess new courses, and assists new firms planning to
produce equipment for British schools and for export.
In England and Wales all children in county or voluntary schools receive
religious education by law and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents choose otherwise. In county schools, and sometimes in
voluntary schools, non-denominational religious instruction is given in accord¬
ance with a locally agreed syllabus which may include the study of comparative
religions. Syllabuses have been revised in many areas to take account of the
faiths of the local population. In all kinds of voluntary schools there is the
opportunity for denominational instruction. In Scotland religious instruction
must be given, the content being determined by education authorities and
schools in accordance with the wishes of the local community. Certain schools
provide for Roman Catholic children but in all schools there are safeguards for
the individual conscience. In controlled schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a
right of access which may be used for denominational instruction; in voluntary
schools corporate worship and religious education are controlled by the
management authorities.
The principal examinations currently taken by secondary school pupils in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland at the age of 16 and over are those leading
to the General Certificate of Education (GCE) at Ordinary (O) level and to the
162
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE). Both are normally taken after five
years of secondary education. The GCE Advanced (A) level is normally taken after
a further two years’ study. The highest grade (grade 1) in the CSE is accepted as
equivalent to the standard of a higher grade pass (grades A to C) at GCE O-level,
and these are the qualifying grades for entry to further education and training.
The A-level examination is the standard for entrance to university and other
higher education, and to many forms of professional training. Entries for GCE
examinations are also accepted from private candidates and those attending
further education establishments. Pupils take on average five or more O-levels
and two or three A-levels. The numbers achieving success in these examinations
have increased considerably in recent years, and fewer than one in ten left school
without a single graded result in 1984. In 1983 some 10 per cent of pupils
achieved five or more higher grades at O-level or CSE equivalent, while 17 per
cent achieved at least one A-level. Slightly more girls than boys sit for A-levels.
In view of certain defects in the dual system of GCE O-level and CSE
examinations, the Government has decided to replace these by a single
qualification, the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE). Two-year
courses leading to the new qualification will be introduced in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland in the autumn of 1986. In order to improve pupils’
motivation and raise standards of achievement the Government has decided
that the new examination should measure absolute and nationally determined
standards of performance rather than relative standards between candidates; all
syllabuses and assessment procedures will therefore comply with nationally
agreed guidelines, known as national criteria. The main objective of this and
other policies is to bring 80 to 90 per cent of all pupils at least to the level
achieved by pupils of average ability in individual subjects (CSE grade 4), and to
do this over a broad range of skills and competence in a number of subjects. The
Government also plans to introduce from 1986 a new examination, the
Advanced Supplementary (AS) level, to be taken alongside existing A-levels. This
will provide an opportunity for sixth-form pupils to study a wider range of
subjects than at present; students specialising in the arts and humanities, for
example, would be able to continue the study of mathematics and technological
subjects at the new level.
1 he Certificate of Pre-vocational Education, a new qualification to be awarded
for the first time in 1986, is intended for those at school or college who wish to
continue in full-time education for a year after the age of 16 to prepare either for
work or for vocational courses.
The Government has decided that all pupils in England and Wales should, by
the end of the decade, be issued with a written record of their school
achievements and performance when they leave school; this would reflect
achievements across the whole educational programme of the school going
beyond examination results.
A Secondary Examinations Council has been established to co-ordinate and
supervise systems of examination and assessment in England and Wales
designed principally for pupils in secondary education.
The public examination system in Scotland is different from that in other
parts of Britain. Scottish pupils take the Scottish Certificate of Education (SCE)
at Ordinary grade at the end of their fourth year of secondary education
(equivalent to the fifth year in England and Wales). Pupils in the fifth and sixth
years sit the SCE Higher grade, and passes at this grade are the basis for entry to
university, college of education or professional training. For those who have
completed their main studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their
studies in particular subjects there is the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.
Reforms of the examination system are already under way in Scotland. As
from 1984-85 Ordinary grade courses are being replaced by new Standard grade

courses and examinations which will cater for the whole ability range with
syllabuses at three levels—Foundation, General and Credit—and all pupils will
be assessed in examinations against nationally determined standards of
performance. The Higher and Post Higher examinations are also being revised to
ensure compatibility with the new Standard grade.
As part of the Government’s plan for the reform of non-advanced further
education in Scotland, a new qualification, the National Certificate, was
introduced in 1984—85 for students over 16 who had successfully completed a
programme of vocational courses based on study units known as modules.
Her Majesty's Inspectors report to ministers on the quality of education provided
in all schools (and in most further education establishments outside the
universities) and advise local education authorities, schools and the Govern¬
ment; their reports on individual establishments are published (except in
Northern Ireland). Local education authorities also employ inspectors or
advisers to guide them on maintained schools.
There is general concern that there should be an effective means of assessing
the standards of pupils' performance. The Assessment of Performance Unit of
the Department of Education and Science promotes the development of methods
of assessment and monitors the achievement of schoolchildren. Programmes of
monitoring have been undertaken in English language and mathematics at the
ages of 11 and 15, in science at the ages of 11, 13 and 15, and in the first foreign
language at the age of 13. A survey of performance at the age of 15 in design and
technology is to be undertaken in 1988.
Teachers and pupils use a range of aids to assist the processes of teaching and
learning. Most schools have audio-visual equipment such as slide projectors and
overhead projectors, and educational broadcasting is of major importance. Each
year more than 600 hours of school radio and 1,000 hours of television are
transmitted by the BBC and the independent broadcasting companies.
Teachers' notes, pupils' pamphlets and computer software accompany many
broadcast series. All primary and secondary schools are now equipped with
microcomputers which can be used for computer-assisted learning (see p 161).
The autonomous Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom
is the central organisation for promoting the application of audio-visual,
technological and other aids to education and training.
Increasing importance is being attached by schools (and by further education
establishments) to careers education to increase young people’s awareness of
further education and careers opportunities and generally help them to prepare
for post-school life. The work of careers officers at local level is supported by
careers information material produced by the Government's Careers and
Occupational Information Centre.
Physical education, including organised games, is part of the curriculum of all
maintained schools, and playing fields must be available for pupils over the age
of eight. Most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
The government health departments are responsible for the medical inspec¬
tion of schoolchildren and for advice on, and treatment of, specific medical and
dental problems associated with children of school age.
Local education authorities have discretion to decide what milk, meals or
other refreshment to provide at their schools, and what charges to make. (In
Northern Ireland, school meals must be provided.) Provision has to be made free
of charge, however, for pupils from families receiving certain social security
benefits. Under certain conditions the authorities must provide free school

transport, and they have discretionary powers to assist with the cost of travel to
school.
Post-school education for young people above school-leaving age is provided at a
range of levels. More than a third of young people receive some form of
post-school education, compared with a fifth in 1965, while some 13-7 per cent
of young people in the 18-year-old age-group entered full time higher education
courses (that is, lirst degree, postgraduate and other courses of a standard
higher than GCE A-level) in 1984. The number of degrees awarded per age-group
is comparable with that of other developed countries and the proportion of
people in all further and higher education also compares well, taking into
account the large proportion of part-time students and the large group of
students receiving professional training in firms rather than in educational
institutions.
Post-school education is provided at universities, polytechnics, the Scottish
central institutions and other publicly maintained or assisted colleges; the latter
have a variety of titles including colleges of higher or further education, colleges
of technology, colleges of art, agricultural colleges and adult education centres.
There are also many independent specialist establishments, such as secretarial
and correspondence colleges and colleges for teaching English as a foreign
language. A number of voluntary and public bodies provide cultural and general
education, sometimes with assistance from local education authorities and
central government, and many education and training schemes are run by
public or private organisations, or firms.
Higher education is provided by universities, polytechnics, the Scottish
central institutions and some 350 colleges and institutes of higher education,
some concerned wholly with teacher training. The need to reduce the public
expenditure on higher education has necessitated some restructuring of
courses and departments in universities and other colleges. However, a decline
in the intake of new students by universities in the years 1981-83 has now been
reversed, and expansion elsewhere meant that in 1983-84 there were 51,000
more full-time home students in higher education than in 1980-81.
In order to maintain British expertise in information technology and related
fields the Government launched a three-year initiative in 1982 to expand higher
education and research in electronics, engineering and computer science. A
total of 50,000 extra student places, and additional staff and research
fellowships in universities, polytechnics and Scottish central institutions were
provided by 1985. Under a separate scheme, some 800 researchers and lecturers
have been appointed, mostly in the natural sciences and technology.
The term turther education is used to define all post-school education outside
the universities, and includes non-advanced courses (of A-level standard or
below) for 16- to 19-year-olds who have left school. Non-advanced and some
advanced courses are provided by 740 colleges of further education, almost all of
them controlled by local education authorities. Non-advanced courses are also
provided by adult education centres.
Much ol the provision outside the universities is broadly vocational in
purpose; it extends from lower-level technical and commercial courses to
advanced courses for those aiming at higher-level posts in commerce, industry
and administration, or taking up a variety of professions (for example, town
planning or estate management). The system is flexible and permits the student
to acquire whatever qualifications his or her capabilities and time allow.
A large proportion of students on non-advanced courses attend part time,
either by day release or block release from employment or during the evenings. A
particular leature of the further education system is its strong ties with
commerce and industry: some two-thirds of spending in the non-advanced

sector, for example, is devoted to work-related studies. Co-operation with the
business world is encouraged by the Government and its agencies, and
employers are often involved in designing courses. A series of College-Employer
Links Projects, launched in 1984, help colleges to meet the education and
training needs of local firms by identifying the particular skills and qualifica¬
tions required by employers and developing ways of providing them. Further
education colleges provide much of the education element in industrial training
programmes like the Youth Training Scheme and the Training Opportunities
Scheme, both sponsored by the Manpower Services Commission. The former
scheme offers the opportunity of a year s planned work experience and training
to all 16- and 17-year-old school-leavers who are unemployed (this will rise to two
years for 16-year-olds from 1986); the latter provides people aged 19 and over
with the opportunity to acquire new skills. The Further Education Unit is an
advisory and development body for further education.
Some 972,000 students were taking full-time courses in 1984-85, including
sandwich courses (where substantial periods of full-time study alternate with
periods of supervised experience on a relevant job), at universities and major
establishments of further education in Britain. Of these about 292,000 were at
universities while another 274,000 were following advanced courses outside
universities, at colleges of further and higher education, polytechnics and
Scottish central institutions. More than 406,000 take non-advanced courses,
most of them studying for recognised vocational or educational qualifications.
There were also about 3-2 million part-time students, over 542,000 of whom
are released by their employers for further education during working hours.
Many of the remainder take part in adult education classes.
Over 90 per cent of full-time students on advanced courses are helped by
grants from public funds, which are mandatory for those students taking first
degree and other comparable courses who qualify under national rules. (Grants
for other courses may be given at the discretion of a local education authority.)
Grants cover tuition fees and maintenance, but parents contribute to main¬
tenance costs according to their income. They are awarded by local education
authorities in England and Wales up to first degree level; equivalent schemes are
administered in Scotland by the Scottish Education Department, and in
Northern Ireland mainly by the education and library boards. For postgraduate
study and research, grants are offered by the education departments and the
research councils. Some scholarships are available from endowments and from
particular industries or companies.
In view of the rising costs ol higher education, the Government conducted a
review of the grants system during 1985 and examined alternative methods of
support, including loans.
There are 47 universities in Britain, including the Open University, compared
with 17 in 1945. They are governed by royal charters or in some cases by Act of
Parliament, and enjoy complete academic freedom, appointing their own staff
and deciding which students to admit, what and how to teach, and which
degrees to award. The English universities are: Aston (Birmingham), Bath,
Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Brunei (London), Cambridge, City (London),
Durham, East Anglia, Essex, Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury, Lancaster,
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough, Manchester, Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford,
Reading, Salford, Sheffield, Southampton, Surrey, Sussex, Warwick, York and
the independent University of Buckingham. The Royal College of Art, the
Cranfield Institute of Technology, the London Graduate School of Business
Studies and the Manchester Business School also have university status. The
166
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Open
University
Polytechnics
and Other
Institutions
federated University of Wales comprises seven constituent institutions. The
Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt
(Edinburgh), St Andrews, Stirling and Strathclyde (Glasgow). In Northern
Ireland there are the Queen's University of Belfast and the University of Ulster.
The universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish universities of St Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Admission to universities is by examination or selection. Of the 292,000
full-time university students in 1984-85 (excluding those at the Open
University and the University of Buckingham), about 47,500 were postgraduate.
About half lived in colleges and halls of residence.
There are some 30,000 full-time university teachers paid wholly from
university funds. The ratio of staff to students is about one to ten, one of the
most favourable in the world.
Except at the Open University, first degree courses are mainly full time and
usually last three or four years, though medical and veterinary courses usually
require five or six years. Degree titles vary according to the practice of each
university; in England, Wales and Northern Ireland the most common titles for a
first degree are Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSe) and for a
second degree Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MSc), and Doctor of
Philosophy (PhD); in Scotland Master is used for a first degree in arts subjects.
Uniformity of standards between universities is promoted by the practice of
employing external examiners for all university examinations, and the general
pattern of teaching is fairly similar throughout Britain.
Research is an important feature of university work; many staff combine
research with their teaching duties and about half of postgraduate students are
engaged on research projects.
The Open University is a non-residential university which provides part-time
degree and other courses, using a combination of television and radio
broadcasts, correspondence texts and summer schools, together with a network
of study centres for contact with part-time tutors and counsellors and with
fellow students. No formal academic qualifications are required to register for
these courses, but the standards of its degrees are the same as those of other
universities. The university's first degree, for which courses began in 1971, is
the BA (Open), a general degree awarded on a system of credits for each course
completed. The University also has a programme of higher degrees, BPhil, MA,
MSc, MPhil and PhD, available mainly through research. Courses started in
1983 for English-speakers in Belgium, and the university has advised many
other countries on the setting-up of similar institutions. A Continuing
Education Programme, including short courses of community education,
in-service training for teachers, and up-dating courses for managers, scientists
and technologists, is the fastest-growing aspect of the University’s work. In 1985
some 120,000 students were following Open University courses, more than half
at degree level.
A major contribution to post-school education in England and Wales is made by
the 30 polytechnics which have been established since 1967. They provide
courses in a wide range of subjects at all levels, though the trend is towards a
concentration on advanced work. Courses may lead to first and higher degrees,
certain graduate-equivalent qualifications, the examinations of the main
professional bodies, and to qualifications such as those of the Business and
Technician Education Council (see p 167). Polytechnics have close links with
commerce and industry, and many polytechnic students have jobs and attend

on a part-time basis. Similar provision is made in Scotland in the 14 central
institutions and a number of further education colleges, and in Northern Ireland
by the University of Ulster.
Institutes and colleges of higher education, formed by the integration of
teacher training with the rest of higher education, also account for a significant
proportion of higher education students, and other further education colleges
run some, usually specialised, higher education courses.
Initial plans were announced in 1984 for the establishment of Britain's first
independent institute of information technology, to be funded mainly by
sponsorship from British electronics manufacturers and users. The institute
would be located in Milton Keynes, to the north-west of London.
An increasing proportion of students on advanced courses in Great Britain
outside the universities are taking courses leading to the qualifications of the
Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). The Council awards degrees
and other academic qualifications comparable in standard with those granted
by the universities. The courses range from science and technology to the
arts, social studies, business studies and law, but the proportion of technologi¬
cal, business or other broadly vocational courses is much higher than in
universities.
The Business and Technician Education Council (BTEC) plans and administers
a unified national system of courses at technician or equivalent level for
students in industry, commerce and public administration in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. Courses leading to BTEC awards are available at
polytechnics, colleges of further and higher education, and in some schools. The
main BTEC qualifications are awarded at two levels: national certificate and
diploma and higher national certificate and diploma. BTEC also offers pre-
vocational preparation and awards for people already in employment who need
additional qualifications. The Scottish equivalent of the Council is the Scottish
Vocational Education Council, which is also the awarding body for the new
non-advanced National Certificate in Scotland.
Qualifications in a wide range of craft skills are offered by the City and Guilds
of London Institute, and a variety of qualifications in commercial and office
practice are awarded by the Royal Society of Arts.
All entrants to teaching in England and Wales must have taken a recognised
course of teacher training. Courses are offered by institutes of higher education,
most universities, many polytechnics and by certain other colleges. Non¬
graduates usually qualify by way of three- or four-year courses leading to the
Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree; graduates take a one-year Postgraduate
Certificate of Education.
In Scotland all teachers in education authority schools must be registered
with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. All primary teachers are
required to be graduates, and qualify either through a four-year BEd course or a
one-year postgraduate course of teacher training at a college of education.
Teachers of academic subjects at secondary schools must also be graduates.
Graduates and holders of specialist diplomas take a one-year postgraduate
course at a college of education. Courses in practical and aesthetic subjects for
non-graduates extend to two, three or four years.
In Northern Ireland teacher training is provided by the two universities and
the two colleges of education. The principal courses are BEd (three- or four-year
honours), BA and BSc with education (three, four or five years) and the one-year
Certificate of Education for graduates.
In response to demographic trends the number of teachers to be trained to
teach in secondary schools is being greatly reduced, except in a few subjects (in
168
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Adult and
Continuing
Education
particular, mathematics, physics, and craft, design and technology) where there
have been long-standing shortages. At the same time arrangements have been
made to meet the increase in the number of primary schoolchildren expected in
the second half of the decade.
The Government is taking steps to improve the quality of teaching by revising
selection, training and placement procedures for new teachers, and by providing
more in-service training opportunities. Management training courses for head
teachers are also being provided. Another proposal under consideration is the
establishment of a national system for the appraisal ol teachers’ performance.
Measures taken to strengthen initial teacher training have included the
establishment of a Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education to review
all existing courses and to issue new criteria against which courses can be
assessed.
It is becoming increasingly recognised that education is a process which
continues throughout adult life. The scope of adult and continuing education
has widened in recent years and now includes, in addition to the development of
the individual through cultural, physical and craft pursuits, such subjects as
basic education (for example, in literacy and numeracy); education for disadvan¬
taged groups and those with special needs such as ethnic minorities or the
disabled; consumer education; health education; and pre-retirement education.
Continuing education includes training for those in employment, to enable
them to keep pace with technological change. The Government has taken a
number of recent initiatives to improve opportunities for both adult and
continuing education. In 1982 it launched a Professional, Industrial and
Commercial Updating Programme (PICKUP), designed to help colleges,
polytechnics and universities to meet the need to up-date and broaden the skills
of those in mid-career in industry, commerce and the professions. A three-year
programme to encourage the expansion of educational opportunities for the
adult unemployed, called REPLAN, was launched in 1984.
Apart from provision for mature students at universities, courses are provided
by further education colleges, adult education centres, residential colleges,
extra-mural departments of universities, the Open University and various other
bodies including a number of voluntary organisations. Most of the provision is
made by the local education authorities in a wide variety of establishments,
including schools used for adult evening classes and ‘community schools' which
provide educational, social and cultural opportunities for the wider community.
Most courses are part time. Local authorities also maintain or aid many of the
short-term residential colleges or centres which provide courses lasting between
a weekend and a fortnight. Long-term residential colleges, grant-aided by central
government departments, provide courses of one or two years and aim to provide
a liberal education without academic entry tests. Most students admitted are
entitled to full maintenance grants.
University extra-mural departments and the Workers' Educational Associa¬
tion, the largest recognised voluntary body, provide extended part-time courses
of liberal studies; they also run short courses for special (including vocational)
interests. Various kinds of education and training are provided by a wide range
of other organisations, including the National Federation of Women’s Institutes,
the Young Men's Christian Association and the Pre-Retirement Association.
The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education is a centre of
information, research, development work and publication for adult and
continuing education, as well as a channel of co-operation and consultation for
the many interested organisations in England and Wales. The Institute also
administers the government-funded Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit, which
covers proficiency in literacy, numeracy and communications skills, and a large

part of the REPLAN programme. The Institute's counterpart in Scotland is the
Scottish Institute of Adult Education.
In Scotland the Scottish Community Education Council advises the Govern¬
ment on all community education matters and administers the Scottish Adult
Basic Education Unit.
In Northern Ireland the Council for Continuing Education advises the
Department of Education on adult and continuing education matters.
The general pattern of teaching and learning on full-time courses of higher
education remains a mixture of lectures, prescribed or suggested reading,
seminars and tutorials, exercises and tests, and, where appropriate, practical
work or work experience. Educational aids are widely available at most
establishments.
Radio and television programmes, both specifically educational and general,
are important media for continuing education and are often linked to a range of
supplementary publications, courses and activities. The BBC, the independent
television companies and Channel 4 provide programmes which range from
basic education and progressive vocational training to domestic, social and craft
skills. The BBC also works with the Open University (see p 166), producing and
broadcasting radio and television programmes as part of the University’s
courses.
Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
educational services is supported financially by central and local government,
the Economic and Social Research Council, philanthropic organisations,
universities and other higher education institutions, teachers’ associations and
certain independent bodies.
The major research institute outside the universities is the autonomous
National Foundation for Educational Research in England and Wales, with
income mainly from funds received from research projects and from corporate
members, including local education authorities, teachers’ organisations and
universities; it also receives a small government grant. The Scottish Council for
Research in Education and the Northern Ireland Council for Educational
Research have similar functions.
Schoolchildren, students, teachers and others concerned with education come
to Britain from overseas to study, and British people work and train overseas.
Many opportunities for such movement are the result of international co¬
operation at government level within the European Community and within the
Commonwealth, and of educational schemes, courses and professional contacts
organised in Britain by officially funded and voluntary organisations. The
British aid programme encourages links between educational institutions in
Britain and developing countries.
British membership of the European Community is creating closer ties with
other member countries. Both in schools and in the colleges and universities
there has been an expansion of interest in European studies and languages, and
exchanges of teachers, schoolchildren and students take place. Britain has
adhered to the Statute of the European Schools (nine of which have been
established throughout the Community including one at Culham, Oxfordshire)
to provide education for children of people employed in Community institutions.
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training.
British universities, polytechnics and other further education establishments
have built up their reputation overseas by offering tuition of the highest

Language
standards, maintaining low student-to-staff ratios, and providing courses and
qualifications to meet present-day and possible future needs. First degree
courses tend to be shorter and more intensive than in many other countries
(three years is the normal length in England and Wales; four years in Scotland).
In the academic year 1983-84 there were some 28,000 overseas students at
universities and about 22,000 at polytechnics and other establishments of
higher and further education. A further 24,000 were training for such
occupations as nursing, law, banking and accountancy, and service and other
industries. About 42 per cent of all overseas students were from the Common¬
wealth and Britain's dependencies. Many come to Britain for advanced training:
some 32 per cent (15,000) of students enrolled for full-time postgraduate study
or research at British universities in 1983-84 came from overseas.
Most overseas students pay their own fees and expenses or hold awards from
their own governments. Those following courses of higher or further education
are charged fees which cover the full cost of their courses. Nationals of other
member countries of the European Community are generally charged the lower
level of fees that applies to British students.
The Government continues, however, to make considerable provision for
students from developing countries under its overseas aid programme. Nearly
11,000 students and trainees from such countries were fully supported in
1984-85 under the Technical Co-operation Training Programme, run by the
Overseas Development Administration, and the Commonwealth Scholarship
and Fellowship Plan. The total cost of these measures was some £48 million. The
Government has increased its financial support for overseas students by £46
million over the three years 1983-84 to 1985-86, using the money to finance a
number of new measures including provision for some five to six thousand
additional scholarships and awards each year. Under a new Overseas Develop¬
ment Administration Shared Scholarship Scheme, to be launched in 1986—87,
450 awards over five years will be available for postgraduate students from the
developing countries of the Commonwealth, with costs being shared between
the Government and the educational institutions.
Outside the aid programme, the Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme,
run by the Department of Education and Science, provides assistance for
overseas research students of high ability to attend British universities while
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Scholarships and Awards Scheme, which
operates in some 90 countries, is designed to benefit individuals likely to hold
positions of responsibility in their future careers.
Many public and private scholarships and fellowships are available to students
from overseas (and to British students who want to study overseas). Among the
best known are the British Council Scholarships, the Commonwealth Scholar¬
ship and Fellowship Plan, the Fulbright Scholarship Scheme, the Marshall
Scholarships, the Rhodes Scholarships, and the Churchill Scholarships for men
and women in all walks of life. Most British universities and colleges offer
scholarships for which graduates of any nationality are eligible.
A number of British colleges of further education have entered into arrange¬
ments with British universities to provide courses for overseas students before
they enter university.
The continuing increase in interest in English as a foreign language is reflected
in the growth in the number of private language schools in Britain and the
larger proportion of these recognised by the British Council. At the same time
the British Council has expanded the volume of its own teaching of English
overseas by opening new centres in many countries and extending existing
ones, and runs a programme for teaching English related to specific jobs and
skills. Publications and other material relating to English language teaching
EDUCATION
171
Educational
Exchanges
have also increased in number and are now a large component in many
publishers' lists, constituting a major export.
The BBC's English by Radio and English by Television services provide a
world-wide facility for the individual learner at home.
The promotion of cultural and educational relations with other countries is a
major concern of the British Council, which plays an important part in the
management of the aid programme to education. It recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short visits overseas by British experts, and encourages
cultural exchange visits. It also runs schemes to promote academic interchange
between universities and higher education institutions in Britain and other
countries, and exchange schemes in other scientific, educational and cultural
areas. Co-operation between universities in Britain and developing countries is
promoted by means of recruiting staff for overseas universities, the secondment
of staff from British universities, interdepartmental faculty link schemes, local
staff development, short-term teaching and advisory visits, and general consul¬
tancy services.
The Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges, an independent
foundation financed by the Government, aims to enrich British education
through international contact and exchange. It is responsible, with the League
for the Exchange of Commonwealth Teachers, for teacher exchanges with most
West European countries, a number of Commonwealth countries and the United
States. It is responsible with the British Council for the development and
funding of youth exchanges and it arranges links and exchanges between
schools, further education establishments and local authorities, and organises
study visits for teachers, education administrators and young workers. It also
administers the Language Assistant Scheme in Britain and provides an
information service on all aspects of educational exchange.
The Association of Commonwealth Universities promotes co-operation be¬
tween member universities in 28 Commonwealth countries. It organises
meetings, provides information and academic appointments services, adminis¬
ters the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan in Britain, and
generally promotes the movement of academic and administrative staff and of
students from one country to another.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth. The
United Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs is an independent body
serving overseas students, and organisations and individuals concerned in
student affairs.
The Youth Service
The youth service forms part of the education system and is concerned with
promoting the personal development and social education of young people by
providing opportunities for them to participate in a wide range of leisure-time
activities. Young people take part in the youth service on a voluntary basis.
Extending the range of experiences open to young people and giving them
opportunities to participate in the running of their organisations are seen as key
elements in the provision.
The youth service is a partnership between central government, local
authorities and voluntary youth organisations; at local level the youth service is
provided by voluntary organisations and local education authorities. Govern¬
ment education departments formulate broad policy objectives and encourage
their achievement through financial assistance and advice. The need to achieve
better planning, management and co-ordination of the youth service in

been endorsed by the Government.
National voluntary youth organisations promote the major share of youth
activities through local groups which raise most of their day-to-day expenses by
their own efforts. Many receive financial and other assistance from local
education authorities, which also provide their own facilities in many areas. The
voluntary organisations vary greatly in character and include the uniformed and
church organisations. Many local authorities and voluntary youth organisations
have responded to new needs in society by making provision, for example, for
the young unemployed, young people from the ethnic minorities, young people
in inner cities or rural areas and those in trouble or at risk. Among the largest of
the voluntary youth organisations are the Scout and Girl Guides Associations
(with about 530,000 and 736,000 members), the National Association of Youth
Clubs (about 700,000), the National Association of Boys' Clubs (some 174,000),
the Youth Hostels Association (a total of 250,000 members, two-thirds under 25)
and clubs run by the churches. The three pre-service organisations (the Sea
Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps), with a membership of
some 100,000, combine social, educational and physical development with
training for possible entry to the armed forces. Many authorities have youth
committees on which official and voluntary bodies are represented, and employ
youth officers to co-ordinate youth work and to arrange in-service training.
There are also youth councils which are representative bodies of young people
from local youth organisations. At national level many voluntary organisations
belong to the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services, which is a
consultative body. The British Youth Council is a national forum for young
people, youth organisations and youth councils, including the youth wings of
the major political parties, and represents young people at an international level.
The youth service in England and Wales can draw on information, advice,
training and research services provided by the National Youth Bureau, which is
funded primarily by central government.
In England and Wales a basic two-year training course at certain universities
and higher education colleges leads to the status of qualified youth and
community worker. A number of teacher-training courses also include a youth
and community option and there are courses for graduates who wish to become
youth workers. In Scotland one-, two- and three-year courses are provided at
certain colleges of education and in Northern Ireland courses are provided by the
University of Ulster. All qualified school teachers are recognised as qualified
youth workers.
Full-time youth workers are supported by some 500,000 part-time workers,
many of them unpaid, both qualified and unqualified. Short courses and
conferences on youth and community work are held. There are also in-service
courses for serving youth workers and officers. Under new arrangements, both
initial and in-service courses are now validated by a single body, the Council for
Education and Training in Youth and Community Work.
A substantial sum of money is awarded by the many grant-giving foundations
and trusts each year for activities involving young people. The Royal Jubilee
Trusts, formed in 1978 from King George's Jubilee Trust (started in 1935 at the
time of the Silver Jubilee of King George V) and The Queen's Silver Jubilee
Trust, which arose from the 1977 Queen’s Silver Jubilee Appeal, support work
involving young people aged 8 to 25 (King George’s Jubilee Trust) and young
people up to the age of 25 involved in voluntary community service work (The
Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust). King George’s Jubilee Trust has distributed

nearly £6 million since 1935 and The Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust over £10
million since 1978.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme, which operates through bodies such
as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, enables
young people from Britain and other Commonwealth countries to take part with
the voluntary assistance of adults in a variety of challenging activities in four
areas: community service, expeditions, the development of personal interests
and social and practical skills, and physical recreation.
Thousands of young people voluntarily take part in community service designed
to assist those in need, including the elderly and the disabled, and many others
work on conservation projects. Organisations providing opportunities for
community service, such as Community Service Volunteers, Pensioners’ Link,
International Voluntary Service and the British Trust for Conservation Volun¬
teers, receive grants from the Government. Many schools also organise
community service activities as part of the curriculum.
8 The
Environment
By comprehensive land-use planning and development control Britain has had
considerable success in resolving the conflicting demands of industry, com¬
merce, housing, transport, agriculture and recreation and in reducing environ¬
mental pollution. The underlying approach is to promote efficiency, economy
and amenity in the use and development of land, respecting both the needs of
development and the interests of conservation. There is no ‘national plan’ for
urban and land development, but there is a statutory system of land-use
planning applying to virtually every kind of development, and there are laws
dealing specifically with environmental health and the control of pollution. In
general, all development requires local planning permission’, and applications
for permission are dealt with in the light of development plans which set out
strategies for each area on such matters as housing, transport, industry and
open land. However, many minor developments are subject to a general
permission under which they do not need a specific planning application; the
opportunity is being taken to expand this general permission wherever possible.
Throughout Britain voluntary organisations take an active interest in planning,
conservation and the control of pollution.
Planning
The system of land-use planning in Great Britain involves a centralised
structure under the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Wales and
Scotland and compulsory planning duties for local planning authorities. The
Department of the Environment brings together the major responsibilities in
England for land-use planning, housing and construction, countryside policy
and environmental protection. The Welsh Office and the Scottish Development
Department have broadly equivalent responsibilities. Large-scale planning in
England and Wales is primarily the responsibility of the county councils and the
Greater London Council1 while district councils and the councils of the London
boroughs and the City of London are responsible for most local plans and
development control, the main housing functions and many environmental
health matters. In Scotland planning functions are undertaken by regional and
district councils whose responsibilities are divided on a basis broadly similar to
that in England and Wales. In the more rural regions and the islands, all
planning responsibilities are carried out by the regional and islands councils
respectively. In Northern Ireland the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland is responsible for planning matters through six divisional
planning offices which work closely with the district councils. The councils have
local environmental health responsibilities.
General problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number
of government departments, but each development proposal normally requires

their planning responsibilities would be consolidated with those already exercised by the London
boroughs, the City of London and the metropolitan district councils.

the local planning authority's consent. For some planning purposes England is
divided into eight regions, each with a planning board. Wales has an Economic
Planning Board and Northern Ireland has an Economic Council.
The development plan system in England and Wales involves ‘structure’ and
local' plans. Structure plans are prepared by county planning authorities and
require ministerial approval. They set out broad policies for the development
and other use of land including measures for the improvement of the physical
environment and traffic management. Local plans provide detailed guidance,
either generally for development expected to start within about ten years, or,
more specifically, in ‘action area- plans, where implementation is to be given
short-term priority, and in ‘subject’ plans which concentrate on special issues
such as mineral working. The plans are normally prepared by district planning
authorities, although sometimes by county planning authorities, and must
conform generally to the approved structure plan. In exceptional cases, with
ministerial approval, the adoption of a local plan may precede the approval of a
structure plan. Local plans are adopted by the planning authorities without
being subject to ministerial approval unless called in by the Secretary of State.
All plans are kept under review and may be altered from time to time. Scotland
has a broadly similar system which can also include the production of a regional
report by regional and islands authorities, outlining their priorities and policies.
Under Northern Ireland’s single-tier system, plans are prepared by the Depart¬
ment of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity to
express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative stages of
the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must ensure
adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans; representa¬
tions may be made about them to the authorities. These opportunities for public
participation are additional to provisions for objecting to prepared plans. In the
case of structure plans the Secretary of State normally holds an examination in
public of matters on which he or she requires more information in order to reach
a decision. In the case of local plans objectors have a right to be heard at a public
local inquiry held by the planning authorities.
Where specific proposals for development differ substantially from the
intentions of a development plan, they must be publicised locally. Other
schemes affecting a large number of people are usually advertised by the local
planning authority, and applications seeking permission for certain types of
development must also be advertised. (In Scotland there is a system of
neighbour notification of planning applications, under which the applicant
must notify the proprietors of land and buildings adjoining the site of a
proposed development at the same time as the application is submitted to the
local planning authority.) The applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of
State if planning permission is refused or is granted subject to conditions. Most
appeals are transferred for decision to inspectors (in Scotland reporters)
appointed by the Secretary of State.
Similar provision is made in Northern Ireland for public participation in the
planning process and for the hearing of representations at public inquiries. For
planning applications which do not give rise to public inquiries there is a right
of appeal to an independent Planning Appeals Commission.
The Secretaries of State can direct that a planning application be referred to
them for decision. This power is exercised sparingly and usually only in respect
of proposals of national or regional importance, for example, proposals for a
major new airport or coalfield. The applicant and the local planning authority

have the right to be heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and a
public inquiry is normally held for this purpose. In the case of development
schemes of exceptional importance the departments concerned have set up
procedures to aid the progress of the inquiry by helping the parties to resolve
peripheral matters beforehand. Where highway development is proposed, the
government minister concerned can hold such inquiries as he or she considers
appropriate; these generally relate to the compulsory acquisition of land.
The 32 new towns designated since 1946 (see map. p 178) represent one of the
most significant achievements in recent British planning. Twenty-one of them
are in England, two in Wales, five in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland. Most
of them had an existing town or village as a nucleus. The new towns programme
has taken account of a number of policy objectives, notably the dispersal of
industry and population from congested cities to the surrounding regions, and
the stimulation of the regional economy in areas suffering from the decline of old
industries or in need of industrial diversification. The new towns have a total
population of over 2 million and by the time their growth is complete are
expected to house 2-5 million people. Several new towns have become regional
centres for shopping and office accommodation.
In England the new towns programme is nearing completion. Eleven of the
new towns have been substantially completed and their development corpora¬
tions (which supervised the planning and development of the towns) dissolved.
The target for the dissolution of the remainder is the late 1980s. When a
development corporation is wound up, its remaining assets are transferred to
the Commission for the New Towns, which manages the assets and arranges for
their disposal, mainly to the private sector. The New Towns and Urban
Development Corporations Act 1985 provides for the eventual dissolution of the
Commission. The dissolution of the five Scottish development corporations will
not begin before the 1990s. In Wales responsibility for Newtown rests with the
Development Board for Rural Wales (known as ‘Mid-Wales Development’) while
the corporation responsible for Cwmbran is to be dissolved in 1988. In Northern
Ireland development of the new towns has been incorporated in a new District
Towns Strategy which is the responsibility of the Department of the Environ¬
ment for Northern Ireland.
Town development (or ‘expanding town ) schemes, introduced in 1952 in
England and Wales and in 1957 in Scotland, involved the transfer of people and
industry from overcrowded areas to existing towns suitable for expansion; these
were arranged directly between the local authorities of the towns concerned. As
with the new towns, the schemes are now being wound up; the programme has
resulted in the provision of new homes for over 300,000 people.
Revitalising the inner areas of many towns and cities is one of the most
important tasks in modern planning. Past policies have produced many
successes including the replacement of most of the slums and the improvement
of much old housing, but other problems remain. They include high unemploy¬
ment, decay and dereliction, and population structures with relatively large
proportions of the disadvantaged and the elderly. It is the Government's policy to
work out, in co-operation with local authorities, a package of measures for the
most badly affected areas that is most likely to improve conditions and
encourage, as far as possible, local voluntary action, notably by means of
‘partnerships’ (see p 179), and the co-operation of the private sector in
regenerating local economies. Various special measures, aimed at increasing
employment opportunities and the involvement of residents in the rejuvenation
of their areas, have been introduced.

THE ENVIRONMENT
179
Urban
Programme
The inner city areas have been given greater resources and priority by central
government for a number of years. The ‘urban programme’ has been increased
from a 1977-78 level in England and Wales of under £30 million to £363 million
in 1985—86. The programme complements the main social, environmental and
economic programmes of local authorities, often by providing extra facilities
which would otherwise not be available, such as day nurseries, centres for the
elderly and language classes for immigrants, and covers industrial, commercial,
environmental and recreational provision as well. The urban programme
represents only a part of the central assistance to urban, and other, local
authorities. The main contributions are through the annual rate support grant,
housing subsidy and other programmes.
In certain places, special schemes are in operation. A co-ordinated ‘part¬
nership' approach has been running for some years in seven English areas
(Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester/Salford, Newcastle upon Tyne/Gateshead
and the inner London boroughs of Hackney, Islington and Lambeth) in which
central and local government work together to tackle urban problems where they
are at their most severe. Each partnership has a three-year action programme
rolled forward annually, which is based on the needs of the area and its
particular priorities. Partnerships receive allocations of urban programme
resources ranging from £10 million to £25 million a year. In February 1985 the
Government announced the establishment of five city action teams’ (one for the
inner London boroughs and one for each of the other partnership areas) to
secure improved co-operation between government departments in developing
and implementing their policies and programmes for these areas.
To meet the particular problems and opportunities of the London docklands
and the Merseyside dock area following large-scale dock closures, the Govern¬
ment has set up urban development corporations modelled on the new town
development corporations, and these are receiving some £67 million in
1985-86. Elsewhere in England 23 areas have been identified where the
problems are on a slightly smaller scale but still merit special attention. These
areas prepare their own inner city programmes and, like the partnerships,
receive special allocations of urban programme resources. Additional resources
are also made available to a further 16 English and eight Welsh districts
designated under the Inner Urban Areas Act 1978.
Since 1982 an arrangement has operated with the urban programme to
attract more private sector investment into urban areas. Local authorities were
invited to prepare a range of investment projects in co-operation with private
interests which can qualify for an Urban Development Grant from the
Government; projects must involve substantial private funds and make a
significant impact on the area. Since the scheme was launched some 180
projects have been approved, representing a total capital investment of over
£480 million.
National Garden Festivals, based on the European idea of garden shows, are
being introduced with the aim of rejuvenating inner city areas and reclaiming
derelict sites. Following the first festival in Liverpool in 1984, which had
international status and attracted nearly 3-4 million visitors, further festivals
will be held in Stoke-on-Trent in 1986, Glasgow in 1988 and Gateshead in
1990.
In Scotland, where the urban programme amounts to £31 million in 1985-86,
a major urban renewal exercise in Glasgow to regenerate the city’s east end (the
Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal Project) is organised on somewhat similar lines
to the partnership areas in England, and a further eight Scottish districts have
been designated under the Inner Urban Areas Act. In addition, the Scottish
Development Agency operates the Local Enterprise Grants for Urban Projects
Scheme (equivalent to the Urban Development Grant). A similar urban

programme operates in Northern Ireland, where a special effort is being made to
tackle Belfast's inner city problems.
Since 1981 the Government has set up 25 ‘enterprise zones’ (see map, p 181).
The aim ot this experimental policy is to see how far industrial and commercial
activity can be stimulated by the removal of certain tax burdens and by relaxing
or speeding up the application of a number of administrative controls. The
zones, which vary widely but all contain land suitable for development, range in
size from about 50 to 450 hectares (about 120 to over 1,100 acres). Benefits in
the zones include exemption from rates (the local property tax); 100 per cent
allowances for corporation and income tax purposes for capital expenditure on
industrial and commercial buildings; a much simplified planning system in
which most forms of development are automatically permitted; and a reduction
in government requests for statistical information.
Housing
The pattern ol housing tenure has changed considerably in recent years, with a
substantial increase in owner-occupation and a decline in privately rented
accommodation. Between the end of 1971 and 1983 the proportion of
owner-occupied dwellings in Great Britain rose from 50 to 60 per cent of the
housing stock, while the proportion accounted for by dwellings rented from a
local authority or new town authority fell from 31 to 28 per cent, and the
proportion of other types of tenure fell from 19 to 12 per cent. The fall in the last
category reflected the decline in privately rented dwellings, while the number of
housing association dwellings increased substantially during this period. There
are variations, however, in the distribution of tenure between different parts of
the country: in Scotland more than half the dwellings are rented from public
authorities while in Wales nearly two-thirds of dwellings are owner-occupied.
The encouragement of a further extension of home ownership is a major aim of
the Governments housing policy, while the emphasis of public sector housing
policy has shifted from new building to modernisation, improvement and
making better use of existing dwellings.
There are some 22 million dwellings, houses being much more common than
flats (the ratio is roughly four to one), and more than two families in every five
live in a post-1945 home. Throughout this century pressure on housing
accommodation has been increased more by the rapid rise in the number of
separate households than by the increase in population. While the number of
people has increased by about two-fifths, the number of households has more
than doubled. The 1981 Census showed the total number of households in
Great Britain as 19-5 million. Improvements in living standards were con¬
tinuing; only 1-3 per cent were not in self-contained accommodation, 4-3 per
cent lived at an average density of more than one person per room and 3-2 per
cent were lacking or sharing use of a bath.
New house construction is undertaken by both public and private sectors but
over the past few years the private sector has built many more dwellings than the
public sector. In addition, about 8 per cent of the new building in 1983 was
carried out by voluntary housing associations and societies. Public authorities
provide dwellings mainly for renting while private interests build mainly for sale
to owner-occupiers.
As with environmental planning, responsibility for formulating housing policy
and supervising the housing programme is borne by the Secretary of State for
the Environment in England and by the Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland

and Northern Ireland. Although the policies are broadly similar throughout
Britain, provisions may differ slightly in Northern Ireland and Scotland from
those in England and Wales.
The construction or structural alteration of housing is subject to building
regulations laid down by the Government. Building in the private sector is
regulated by an independent organisation, the National House-Building Coun¬
cil, which sets standards and enforces them by inspection and certification.
Almost all new private houses are covered by the Council’s insurance scheme
which provides ten-year guarantees against major structural defects. A two-year
guarantee is also given against faulty workmanship. Most lenders will not make
a loan for the purchase of a new house unless it is covered by the Council’s
certificate.
Local authorities are responsible for the payment of house renovation grants
and the implementation of housing renewal programmes. Many have housing
advisory centres to provide information on aspects of housing.
The number of people owning their own homes has more than trebled in the last
35 years, and the number of owner-occupied dwellings amounted to over 13
million in 1983, compared with 4 million in 1951. Most public sector tenants
have the right to buy the homes they occupy at discounts which vary according
to the length of their occupancy. Local authorities have been asked to encourage
low-cost home ownership by selling land to builders to construct homes for
‘first-time’ buyers, or to individuals or groups to build their own ‘first-time’
homes in partnership with private builders; by improving homes for sale; by
selling dilapidated homes for improvement by the purchaser (’homesteading );
by offering shared ownership (part owning, part renting); and by using local
authority guarantee powers to facilitate lending by building societies.
In Northern Ireland the concept of shared ownership has been developed in
the public sector by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and in the private
sector by the Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing Association. The Execu¬
tive has offered most of its homes for sale to the tenants and some 26,000 have
been sold.
Most people buy their homes with a mortgage loan (for which the properties are
regarded as securities) from such sources as building societies, banks,
insurance companies, industrial and provident societies, and local authorities.
Some companies also make loans for house purchase to their own employees.
Building societies are by far the largest sources of such loans, their share of
the market being about 87 per cent. For first-time buyers they usually advance
about 90 per cent of their valuation of a property with the help of an appropriate
insurance guarantee but it is possible to borrow up to 100 per cent. Loans are
normally repayable over periods of 20 or 25 years (up to 30 or 35 years in certain
circumstances) by equal monthly instalments to cover capital and interest.
Ordinary mortgage loans from building societies are usually available to
purchasers on average income or above. People with insufficient income to
obtain a mortgage for outright purchase may be able to participate in a scheme
in which a housing association buys the home and sells a share in it to them,
allowing them to rent the remainder and to purchase it at a later stage if they
wish.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on interest payments arising on up
to £30,000 of their mortgage loans (on their main home only). Under the
Homeloan Scheme first-time home buyers who have saved for two years and are
buying a home in the lower price range may qualify for an extra loan of £600
interest-free for up to five years, and a tax-free bonus of up to £110.

Housing
Most of the public housing in Great Britain is provided by 460 local housing
authorities. The authorities are: in England and Wales (outside London), the
district councils; in London, the London borough councils and the Common
Council of the City of London; and in Scotland, the district and islands councils.
Other public housing authorities are the new town authorities, the Scottish
Special Housing Association, which supplements building by local authorities
in Scotland, and the Development Board for Rural Wales. The Northern Ireland
Housing Executive is responsible for the provision and management of public
housing in Northern Ireland.
Subsidies may be made available to the authorities to assist them with
housing costs, and guidance is given on design and layout. Public housing
authorities own about 6 million houses and flats. The number of homes owned
by each authority varies widely, several of the larger authorities having a stock of
well over 100,000.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of new house construction and of
modernisation of their existing stock by raising loans on the open market, by
borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board (an independent statutory body
set up to make loans to local authorities) or from the capital receipts generated
by the sale of local authority houses and housing land. Current expenditure,
including maintenance and management costs and loan interest and repay¬
ment, is met from rents, which may be supplemented by subsidies from the
Government and, where required to balance housing revenue accounts, from
the rates. Local authorities are required to charge their tenants reasonable rents
(which keep a balance between the interests of tenants and ratepayers).
Sheltered housing (usually accommodation with an alarm system and
resident warden) is provided for those elderly people who need this degree of
support, but increasing emphasis is being placed on schemes to help elderly
people to continue to live in their own homes and on schemes to adapt existing
housing to meet the housing needs of physically handicapped people. Local
authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that accommodation (not necessarily
owned by the authority) is available for homeless people who have dependent
children or are vulnerable on grounds such as age or disability.
The Housing Act 1980 established a charter for public sector tenants in
England and Wales, giving them statutory rights which include security of
tenure, provision for a resident member of the tenant's family to succeed to the
tenancy on the death of the tenant, rights of subletting and taking in lodgers,
and, at the landlord's discretion, reimbursement for improvements made by the
tenant. With a few exceptions, public sector tenants of at least two years’
standing can buy their house or flat at a discount which depends on the length
of occupation. Similar provisions are made for Scotland and Northern Ireland
under separate legislation. By March 1985 some 843,000 tenants in Great
Britain had bought their homes under these provisions. The Housing and
Building Control Act 1984 further extended the rights of public sector tenants
by giving them the right to repair and the right to exchange their homes.
A National Mobility Scheme, sponsored by the Department of the Environ¬
ment, the Scottish Development Department, the Welsh Office and the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, has been introduced to
assist tenants who need to move to another area for employment or social
reasons. Tenants who wish to move by exchanging homes are able to make use
of a computer-based national information scheme.
There has been a steady decline in the number of rented dwellings available from
private landlords (including tied accommodation), from over 50 per cent of the
housing stock in 1951 to less than 10 per cent in 1983 (about 2 million
dwellings). Major factors have been the increased demand for owner-occupation.
184
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Housing
Associations
the greater availability of public rented housing and the operation of rent
restriction. Privately rented dwellings are predominantly found in older hous¬
ing. Many landlords are individuals owning a small amount of property, but
some rented housing is provided by larger property owners, including property
companies.
Most private lettings are subject to the system of protection provided by the
Rent Act 1977 and associated legislation. Where the letting is a fully protected
regulated tenancy', the tenant or the landlord may apply for a ‘fair rent' to be
fixed by independent rent officers and there is a wide degree of security of
tenure. More limited provisions apply where there is a resident landlord, when a
reasonable rent' may be fixed by a rent tribunal (in Scotland by a rent
assessment committee) and there is no lifetime security of tenure. The Housing
Act 1980 (and similar legislation for Scotland and Northern Ireland) introduced
an additional system of‘shorthokT lettings, giving tenants security of tenure for
an agreed period between one and five years, after which the landlord is
guaranteed repossession. In London and in Scotland a fair rent must be
registered for a shorthold; elsewhere it is optional. An existing regulated tenancy
cannot be converted to a shorthold. The 1980 Act also introduced for England
and Wales the system of assured' tenancies, which allows approved bodies to let
newly built property at freely negotiated rents outside the Rent Acts. This has
encouraged some new building for private renting by such bodies as building
societies, pension funds and insurance companies. Tenants and most other
residential occupiers may not be evicted without a court order. Harassment of
residential occupiers is a criminal offence. Occupiers may, depending on their
personal circumstances, be eligible for housing benefit to assist them in paying
their rent and rates under a scheme operated mainly by local authorities and
financed by government subsidies.
In Northern Ireland only pre-1956 properties subject to rent restriction come
under statutory control, and rent levels are linked to those of the Northern
Ireland Housing Executive. Rent increases are permitted only for properties
which meet a prescribed standard. There is an uncontrolled rent sector,
comprising mostly furnished accommodation.
Housing associations extend the choice of housing by providing accommodation
available for rent or sale through new building or the rehabilitation of older
property. The associations normally cater for people who would otherwise look to
a local authority for a home. In addition to normal family housing, they provide
particularly for the special needs of elderly, disabled and single people.
The associations, which are non-profit-making, have grown under govern¬
ment encouragement and now own some 500,000 homes. Individual associa¬
tions range in size from a group of almshouses' for fewer than ten old people to
associations with more than 10,000 homes. In-Great Britain housing schemes
carried out by associations qualify for government grant if the association is one
of over 2.500 registered with the Housing Corporation, a statutory body. Rented
homes owned by housing associations come within the fair rent arrangements,
and most housing association tenants have rights under the tenants' charter in
the Housing Act 1980—in Scotland the Tenants’ Rights, Etc (Scotland) Act
1980—including, in England and Wales, the right to buy. Housing associations
also provide accommodation on a shared ownership basis, allowing the occupier
to part-rent and part-own a home, and they can purchase and improve
older properties for outright sale. Both activities are eligible for government
grants.
In Northern Ireland assistance is available to associations registered with the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. Rent levels are linked to
those of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Tenants have rights under a

tenants’ charter, but not the right to buy, although housing associations may
sell their dwellings voluntarily.
In urban areas of Britain slum clearance and redevelopment used to be major
features of housing policy. Large-scale clearance is now virtually at an end.
although there are still pockets of unfit housing for which demolition is
considered the best solution. Greater emphasis has been placed on the retention
of existing communities accompanied by the modernisation and conversion of
sub-standard homes. Although housing conditions have improved considerably,
problems remain in some areas where there are high concentrations of dwellings
lacking basic amenities or requiring substantial repairs.
More recently there has been concern about the problems associated with
high-density local authority estates in inner city areas, some of which have not
been popular with tenants, and about serious structural defects found in some
local authority dwellings. Authorities are tackling these problems in a variety of
ways including refurbishment and sale to the private sector.
In view of deteriorating conditions on many local authority estates, the
Department of the Environment set up in 1979 its Priority Estates Project’ to
promote local management arrangements, under which officers based on the
estates are responsible for providing a co-ordinated range of services; tenant
management co-operatives have also been promoted. In a pilot initiative on
Merseyside, funds from the urban programme and from the Manpower Services
Commission’s Community Programme have been used to support work by the
unemployed on improving conditions on run-down estates. The Department has
recently established the Urban Housing Renewal Unit to develop these
approaches and to encourage private investment for improving the quality of life
on run-down estates.
Over 500,000 home improvement grants were paid to householders in Great
Britain between 1980 and 1984. There are four types of grant: improvement
grants, for carrying out improvements to a good standard: intermediate grants,
for the provision of standard amenities (such as a bath and an inside lavatory)
and associated repairs; grants for substantial and structural repairs to pre-1919
houses (pre-1957 in Northern Ireland and pre-1964 in Scotland, where a grant
can cover all forms of repair work); and special grants for providing standard
amenities and repairs (not available in Scotland) and means of escape from fire
in houses which are in multiple occupation. In addition, since 1978 grants for
loft insulation have been paid in respect of some 2 million homes. In May 1985
the Government issued a consultative document on private sector home
improvement policy in England and Wales which contained a number of
proposals including the establishment of a unified grant structure.
Declaring ‘general improvement areas' and ‘housing action areas’ enables local
authorities in England and Wales to tackle the improvement of whole areas of
older housing systematically. General improvement areas (of which there are
more than 1,600) contain fundamentally sound houses and a stable population.
Housing action areas (of which there are about 300 in England and Wales) are
characterised by relatively poor housing and bad environmental conditions
combined with social stress. Local authorities have special powers to bring
about an improvement in living conditions for the benefit of residents. In both
types of area government financial aid for environmental improvement (such as
landscaping and work to improve the external appearance of buildings) is
available to local authorities. In these areas home improvement grants may
range up to 75 per cent of the eligible expense limit, and in certain cases of
hardship up to 90 per cent. ‘Enveloping’, introduced in 1982, involves the
renovation of the external fabric of whole terraces or streets of mainly privately
owned property in housing action areas which has deteriorated beyond routine

maintenance. It is carried out by local authorities at public expense, and the
encouragement it gives to residents is reflected in the increased take-up of
grants for improvements to the interiors after enveloping.
An improvement-for-sale' scheme has also been introduced; the Government
helps to meet any loss a local authority may make in buying, improving and
selling run-down or neglected housing.
In Scotland housing action area powers are available for the improvement of
areas in which at least half the houses fail to meet a statutory tolerable standard.
Since 1975 some 1,400 housing action areas, covering houses requiring
improvement or demolition, have been declared by local authorities. Outside
such areas in Scotland local authorities have powers to require the improvement
of houses below the statutory tolerable standard, or lacking a bathroom, by
improvement orders. In housing action areas or where an improvement order
has been made, grants of 75 per cent (up to 90 per cent in cases of hardship) of
the eligible expense limit may be made. Government financial aid is also given
towards the costs incurred by local authorities in improving the environment of
predominantly residential areas.
Northern Ireland has a major problem of derelict and unfit housing, especially
in Belfast, the situation having been made worse by civil disturbance. Concerted
measures are being taken in housing action areas, and there is a continuing
programme of rehabilitation in Belfast. Housing receives priority in Northern
Ireland’s social and environmental programme. A strategy has been designed to
ensure a reduction in the amount of unfit housing by 1 per cent a year and in the
urgent element of the waiting list by a third by 1988.
Conservation
Britain is one of the leading countries in the conservation movement. A wide
range of groups, including many voluntary organisations, are active in it. The
Council for Environmental Conservation is a national coalition of non¬
governmental organisations which focuses attention on major issues.
Lists of buildings of special architectural or historical interest are compiled, as
required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment and
the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; over 345,000 buildings are listed
in England, over 33,000 in Scotland and 10,600 in Wales. It is against the law to
demolish, extend or alter the character of any listed building without special
consent from the local planning authority or the appropriate Secretary of State;
where consent is given to demolish a building, the Royal Commission on
Historical Monuments (for England) and similar bodies for Scotland and Wales
have an opportunity to make a photographic and written record of the building.
Emergency ‘building preservation notices' can be served by the local planning
authority to protect buildings not yet listed.
Maintaining royal parks (which are open to the public) and palaces is the
responsibility of the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and
Wales. The Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England (known
as English Heritage), set up in 1984 and incorporating the Ancient Monuments
Board for England and the Historic Buildings Council for England, manages
some 400 ancient monuments on behalf of the Secretary of State for the
Environment and gives grants for ancient monuments, historic buildings and
buildings in conservation areas in England. In Scotland and Wales similar
functions are performed by the Scottish Development Department and by Cadw
(Welsh Historic Monuments) with advice from an ancient monuments board and
a historic buildings council for each country. Local authorities can make grants
and loans for any building of architectural or historic interest. The National

Preservation
Heritage Memorial Fund, financed by the Government, provides assistance
towards the cost of acquiring, maintaining or preserving land, buildings, works
of art and other items of importance to the national heritage; since 1984, for
example, the Fund has played a major part in the preservation of Fyvie Castle
(Grampian) and the Eastern Moors in the Peak District National Park. The
Government gave the Fund an additional £25 million early in 1985 to enable it to
secure the preservation of Kedleston Hall (Derbyshire), Nostell Priory (West
Yorkshire) and Weston Park (Shropshire). The Architectural Heritage Fund,
with capital derived from both the private and public sectors, provides loans to
supplement the funds of local preservation trusts to help them to preserve
historic buildings.
Local planning authorities have designated for special protection about 5,800
‘conservation areas' of particular architectural or historic interest. Grants and
loans are available for works which make a significant contribution towards the
preservation or enhancement of such an area.
In Northern Ireland the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland
has 159 historic monuments in its care, and some 550 monuments are
scheduled for protection. The Department is also responsible for listing
buildings of special architectural or historic interest and for the designation of
conservation areas; there are some 6,500 listed buildings and 20 conservation
areas. It may also provide grants and loans to help with the repair and
maintenance of listed buildings and to preserve or enhance conservation areas.
It has the advice of a Historic Buildings Council and a Historic Monuments
Council.
Among the voluntary organisations which campaign for the preservation of
buildings are the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and the Ancient
Monuments Society; the Georgian Group; the Architectural Heritage Society of
Scotland; the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society; the Victorian Society; and
the Council for British Archaeology. The National Trust (for Places of Historic
Interest or Natural Beauty), an independent charity with more than 1 million
members, owns and protects about 200 historic buildings in addition to
240,000 hectares (600,000 acres) of land and 735 km (457 miles) of coastline in
England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Scotland has its own National Trust.
Besides helping to conserve the finest buildings inherited from the past, the
Government encourages high standards in new building. The Secretary of State
for the Environment, in collaboration with the independent Royal Institute of
British Architects (RIBA) and the National House-Building Council, makes
awards for good design in housing, with categories for renovation as well as new
building. Scotland and Wales have similar but separate awards schemes. The
Government has also encouraged the use of architectural competitions, and has
set an example in the award of some of its own contracts. Royal Fine Art
Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland advise government
departments, planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of
public amenity or artistic importance.
The RIBA, the principal professional body for architects, exercises control over
standards in architectural education and encourages the maintenance of high
architectural standards in the profession. The Royal Incorporation of Architects
in Scotland is allied to it. The Civic Trust, with associate trusts in Scotland,
Wales and north-east and north-west England, encourages high standards in
urban design and the protection and improvement of the environment.
The local planning authorities have power to protect trees and woodlands in the
interest of amenity by means of tree preservation orders. When granting
planning permission for development, a local planning authority must, where
188
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Green Belts
The Coast
Countryside
Commissions
appropriate, impose conditions to secure the preservation or planting of trees.
Landowners generally must replace trees which die or are removed or destroyed
in contravention of a preservation order.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
neighbouring towns merging into one another, or to preserve the special
character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts’ (areas
where it is intended that the land should be left open and free from further
building development and where people can seek recreation) have been
established on the fringes of certain urban areas. Much of London’s green belt,
for example, is agricultural land or woodland, some of which is used for
recreation. Some 1-9 million hectares (4-7 million acres) of land have been
designated as green belt in Great Britain. There are also areas specifically for
recreational use, such as country parks, public open spaces, playing fields and
golf courses.
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use at
the coast providing, for example, recreational facilities and amenities for
holidaymakers and local residents; at the same time they attempt to safeguard
and enhance the coast's natural attractions and preserve areas of scientific
interest.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales, undertaken by
the Countryside Commission (see p 189) in 1966-70, recommended that
certain stretches of undeveloped coast of particular scenic beauty should be
treated as heritage coast. Jointly with local authorities, the Commission has
defined 37 of these coasts so far, protecting nearly 1,200 km (750 miles).
In 1965 the National Trust launched its Enterprise Neptune campaign to raise
funds for the nation to acquire stretches of coastline of great natural beauty and
recreational value. More than £6 million has been raised so far and as a result
the Trust has under its protection 669 km (416 miles) of coastline in England
and Wales. The next stage of this campaign was launched in 1985 to acquire a
further 724 km (450 miles) considered at risk. Some 128 km (80 miles) of coast
in Scotland are protected by conservation agreements with the National Trust
for Scotland. In Northern Ireland 66 km (41 miles) of coast and coastal path have
been acquired by the National Trust.
In exceptional cases economic arguments override conservation; development
associated with North Sea oil and gas is occurring on remote and unspoiled
coastal areas in Scotland, for instance, but planning guidelines drawn up by the
Scottish Development Department aim to ensure that oil-related activities are
sited so as to make the best use of existing labour and infrastructure and to
minimise the effect on the coastline. Provision has also been made for funds to
be set aside for the restoration of sites once there is no further need for them.
The protection of the coastline against erosion is administered centrally by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Welsh Office and the Scottish
Office. The maritime local authorities, which have powers to carry out coastal
protection works, are presented with difficult engineering problems and heavy
costs, but substantial grants from central funds may be made available.
Two Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) are responsible for encouraging and promoting measures to conserve
and enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside and for
encouraging the development of facilities for open-air recreation in the
countryside. These include the provision by local authorities (sometimes in
association with other bodies) and private individuals of country parks and
picnic sites often within easy reach of towns; the provision or improvement of

recreational paths; the encouragement of amenity tree-planting schemes: and
the increased use of reservoirs, canals and other waterways for bathing, sailing
and other activities. Some 200 country parks and 236 picnic sites have been
recognised in England and Wales by the Countryside Commission. In Scotland
32 country parks are recognised and a large number of local authority and
private sector schemes for the provision of a variety of countryside facilities have
been approved for grant aid. The Commissions undertake research projects and
experimental schemes, working in consultation with local authorities and such
bodies as the Nature Conservancy Council (see p 190) and the Sports Councils.
The Commissions give financial assistance to public, private and voluntary
bodies and individuals carrying out countryside recreation and amenity
projects.
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) is empowered to
designate, for confirmation by the appropriate minister, national parks and
areas of outstanding natural beauty'; to define heritage coasts in conjunction
with local authorities (see p 188); and to make proposals for the creation of
long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished, covering 13,600 sq km (5,250 sq miles), or 9 per cent of the area of
England and Wales. Some 36 areas of outstanding natural beauty have been
designated and confirmed, covering 17,000 sq km (6,600 sq miles).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures, for
which grants are available, such as tree planting and the removal of eyesores. In
the national parks other measures for the benefit of the public include the
provision of car parks, camping and caravan areas, and information centres. All
national parks and some other designated areas have warden services. Most
local authority expenditure on national parks is met by government grants.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Countryside Committee advises the Depart¬
ment of the Environment on the preservation of amenities and the designation
of areas of outstanding natural beauty. Eight areas of outstanding natural
beauty have been designated, covering 259,500 hectares (641,000 acres), and
seven areas are being managed as country parks and one as a regional park.
In Scotland there are no national parks as such, but there are 40 national
scenic areas’, covering more than 1 million hectares (2-5 million acres), or 13 per
cent of the country, where certain kinds of development are subject to
consultation with the Countryside Commission for Scotland, and the Secretary
of State for Scotland, in the event of a disagreement. More than 98 per cent of
the land in Scotland is designated countryside within which the Commission
may provide grants for a wide range of countryside projects.
There are seven forest parks in Great Britain, covering some 243,000 hectares
(600,000 acres) and administered by the Forestry Commission, and nine in
Northern Ireland administered by the Forest Service of the Department of
Agriculture. Camping and other recreational facilities are provided.
Many voluntary organisations are concerned to preserve the amenities of the
countryside; they include the Councils for the Protection of Rural England and
of Rural Wales, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland and the
Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside.
County councils in England and Wales are required to prepare and keep under
review definitive maps showing public rights of way; they are also responsible for
keeping rights of way free from obstruction, and signposted. If a path is not
shown on the map, a private citizen may claim that it is a public right of way if it
190

Conservation
has been used and regarded as such without hindrance for at least 20 years.
Public footpaths are maintained by local authorities which also supervise
landowners' duties to repair stiles and gates. Local authorities in Great Britain
can create paths, close existing paths no longer needed for public use and divert
paths to meet the needs of either the public or landowners. Local planning
authorities can also convert minor roads into footpaths or bridleways to improve
the amenities of their area. There are 13 approved long-distance footpaths and
bridleways in England and Wales covering some 2,580 km (1,600 miles) and
three approved long-distance routes in Scotland covering some 530 km
(330 miles). Voluntary organisations concerned with footpaths include the
Open Spaces Society, the Scottish Rights of Way Society and the Ramblers
Association.
There is no automatic right of public access to open countiy, although many
landowners permit more or less free access. Local planning authorities can
secure access by means of agreements with landowners; if agreements cannot be
obtained, authorities may acquire land or make orders for public access. Similar
powers cover Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 600,000 hectares (1-5 million acres) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.) This land is usually privately
owned, but people other than the owner may have various rights on or over it, for
example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by law and cannot
be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries of State for the
Environment or Wales.
The official body responsible for nature conservation in Great Britain is the
Nature Conservancy Council which has the functions of establishing, maintain¬
ing and managing nature reserves, advising the Government, providing general
information and advice, and commissioning or supporting research. There are
202 national nature reserves covering some 153,500 hectares (379,300 acres).
Some 4,500 sites of special scientific interest have been scheduled for their flora,
fauna or geological or physiographical features.
About 46,000 hectares (114,000 acres) of Forestry Commission land are
managed as areas in which nature conservation is the main object. Local
authorities have declared about 95 local nature reserves. Voluntary nature
conservation trusts and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds play an
important part in protecting wildlife, having established between them some
1,500 reserves. The trusts are affiliated to a parent organisation, the Royal
Society for Nature Conservation. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,
with nearly 400,000 members, is the largest voluntary wildlife conservation
body in Europe.
In Northern Ireland the Committee for Nature Conservation advises the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland on nature conservation
matters including the establishment and management of terrestrial and marine
nature reserves and the declaration of areas of special scientific interest.
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 extended the list of protected species,
restricted the introduction into the countryside of animals or plants not
normally found in the wild and afforded greater protection for areas of special
scientific interest and other important habitats. In Northern Ireland two orders,
which became operative in April 1985, have brought legislation into line with
the rest of Britain on species and habitat protection.
Other conservation measures promoted by the Government have included a
ban (in conjunction with other European Community countries) on the import
of whale products and certain seal pup products, a system of licensing zoos to

ensure that captive animals are kept in suitable conditions, and stricter controls
for the protection of wild birds.
Derelict land, often concentrated in places associated with nineteenth-century
industrial development, presents special problems to planners. It includes
mineral waste tips, old mineral workings, obsolete industrial buildings and
disused railways and docks. In England most derelict land reclamation is
undertaken, with the help of central government grant, by local authorities,
which have the power to acquire derelict land and bring it back into use or
improve its appearance. Grants are also available to people and public bodies
other than local authorities. The expenditure provision for the derelict land
programme in 1985-86 is £76 million. Priority is given to joint schemes by local
authorities and private developers aimed at bringing land reclaimed by public
expenditure into private development for industrial, commercial, housing and
recreational use. Since 1974 some 17,000 hectares (41,900 acres) of derelict
land have been restored to beneficial use in England, 6,000 hectares (14,800
acres) in Scotland, and 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) in Wales.
In Scotland and Wales responsibility for derelict land reclamation rests with
the respective development agencies, which may acquire and reclaim land,
employ local authorities as their agents (in Scotland) or make grants to local
authorities for the purpose (in Wales). In Northern Ireland grants may be paid to
landowners who restore or improve derelict sites.
To prevent new dereliction, planning controls require that when permission is
given for mineral working various measures must be taken to minimise the
disturbance caused by the work and to secure whatever restoration is
practicable, either progressively or when working ceases. The use of land for
disposal of waste materials is also subject to conditions restricting the height of
waste tips or requiring treatment of waste on completion of workings.
The amount of agricultural land taken for development has been steadily
reduced from about 18,000 hectares (45,000 acres) a year between 1965 and
1970 to about 9,000 hectares (23,000 acres) a year between 1975 and 1980.
In England the Government has instituted, and made available for inspection,
registers of under-used land held by local authorities, nationalised industries
and other public bodies; some 46,000 hectares (113,700 acres) have been
identified. There is power to direct a public body to dispose of registered land.
Registers have also been published for certain areas of Wales.
Control of Pollution
Government measures to control environmental pollution, in which industry
and voluntary organisations co-operate, are long established, and are com¬
plementary to the planning system and the various measures to conserve
amenities and the country's heritage.
The Control of Pollution Act 1974, which applies to England, Scotland and
Wales, sets out a wide range of powers and duties for local and water authorities,
including control over wastes, air and water pollution and noise, and contains
important provisions on the release of information to the public on environmen¬
tal conditions. In particular, it introduced a new system for the comprehensive
planning of waste disposal operations so as to ensure that disposal is carried out
to satisfactory standards and that where practicable waste materials are
recovered and recycled. The Act also increased the penalties for a large number
of pollution offences. The provisions relating to noise and air pollution are fully
in force, as are a substantial number of those relating to waste on land; most of
192
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

the part dealing with water pollution will be fully implemented by 1986. Similar
legislation applies in Northern Ireland.
Executive responsibility for pollution control rests in general with local and
water authorities, although certain registered industrial processes are con¬
trolled by the Industrial Air Pollution Inspectorate (of the Health and Safety
Executive). Local authorities are responsible for matters such as collection and
disposal of domestic wastes; control of air pollution from domestic and certain
non-registered industrial premises; and noise abatement measures. Sewerage
and sewage treatment and disposal are the responsibilities of regional water
authorities in England and Wales, of local authorities in Scotland and of the
Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland. The regional water
authorities in England, the Welsh Water Authority, the river purification boards
and islands councils in Scotland and the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland are responsible for control of water pollution.
An independent standing Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution
advises the Government on national and international matters concerning the
pollution of the environment, on the adequacy of research and on the future
possibilities of danger to the environment. It has so far produced ten reports
covering a wide range of topics.
Central government is principally concerned with formulating policy, exercis¬
ing general budgetary control, promoting the necessary legislation, and advising
pollution control authorities on its implementation. The Secretary of State for
the Environment has general responsibility for co-ordinating the work of the
Government on environmental protection and in this is assisted by a Central
Directorate of Environmental Protection within the Department. In Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland the respective Secretaries of State are responsible
for pollution control co-ordination in their countries. They are assisted by the
Scottish Development Department, the Water and Environmental Protection
Division of the Welsh Office, and the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland respectively.
The main risks of land pollution lie in the indiscriminate dumping of waste
materials on land, careless disposal of pesticides and chemicals and the
deposition of materials from the atmosphere and from flood-water. The Control
of Pollution Act places a duty on waste disposal authorities to ensure that there
are adequate arrangements to dispose of controlled wastes. It requires them to
draw up and revise periodically a waste disposal plan and establishes a licensing
system for all waste disposal sites, treatment plants and storage facilities
receiving controlled wastes. In addition, it provides for a more intensive control
system for certain especially hazardous or difficult wastes. A Hazardous Waste
Inspectorate has been set up in the Department of the Environment to help local
authorities to improve their control of waste management and to work towards
environmentally acceptable standards for dealing with hazardous wastes.
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any public place in the open air or to
dump rubbish except in designated places. To help to counteract the problem of
litter, financial support is given to the Keep Britain Tidy Group, which provides
a comprehensive litter abatement programme in collaboration with local
authorities.
The Government encourages the reclamation and recycling of waste materials
wherever this is practicable and economic in order to reduce imports and waste
disposal costs and to help to conserve natural resources. Industry already makes
considerable use of reclaimed waste material such as metals, paper and textiles.
Local authorities collect about 200,000 tonnes of waste paper and about
THE ENVIRONMENT
193
Water Pollution
Marine
Pollution
100,000 tonnes of ferrous scrap annually. In an increasing number of areas
there are ‘bottle banks' and ‘can banks’ where the public can deposit used glass
and metal containers respectively. Voluntary organisations also arrange collec¬
tions of waste material. Waste disposal authorities have powers under the
Control of Pollution Act to take full account of opportunities for waste
reclamation and have a duty when drawing up their waste disposal plans to
include information as to the methods of disposal to be used, including
reclamation.
There has been a steady and significant improvement in water quality: the level
of pollution in the tidal Thames, for example, has been reduced to a quarter of
the 1950s’ level and over 100 different kinds of fish have been identified there
since 1964. A major scheme has been launched to clean up the Mersey, the
largest British estuary still suffering from severe pollution. Discharges of
polluting matter into rivers and estuaries have been controlled for many years
and recently powers have been extended to provide full control over discharges
into underground and coastal waters. More than 95 per cent of the population is
provided with main drainage, and public authority sewage treatment works
serve over four-fifths of the population—a very high proportion by international
standards.
Control of marine pollution from ships is based largely on international
conventions drawn up under the auspices of the International Maritime
Organisation, a United Nations agency with headquarters in London, and
implemented for British ships by domestic legislation. The Merchant Shipping
(Prevention of Oil Pollution) Regulations 1983 make it an offence for ships of any
nationality to discharge oil or oily mixtures into British territorial waters and for
British registered ships to make similar discharges anywhere into the sea,
except in accordance with the regulations.
To deal with spillages of oil or chemicals at sea, which may cause coastal
pollution or threaten wildlife, the Department of Transport has a Marine
Pollution Control Unit and can also call upon the resources of the Marine Survey
and Coastguard services. The main treatment method is to spray dispersant
from aircraft or surface vessels, and emergency cargo transfer equipment is
available to remove oil from a damaged tanker. Local authorities have a primary
role in dealing with oil and chemical pollution of beaches and inshore waters,
and receive government advice and support.
The development of the offshore oil industry has brought an increased risk of
oil pollution in the North Sea. Offshore operators must ensure that oil does not
escape into the sea and are required to have contingency plans for dealing with
oil spilled accidentally. Discharges containing oil are controlled under the
Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971. Discharges of chemicals are controlled and
monitored by a non-statutory Chemical Notification Scheme, administered by
the Department of Energy in consultation with fisheries departments.
The Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (which superseded the
Dumping at Sea Act 1974) tightened the controls over dumping at sea, the most
significant change being the introduction of specific controls on marine
incineration. Under the Act a licence has to be obtained for the permanent
deposit of any substance or article into tidal waters and the sea. Dumping at sea
is permitted on the basis of the scientific criteria set out in the annexes to the
Oslo Convention (International Convention for the Prevention of Marine
Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972) and the London
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and
Other Matter 1972.

Clean Air
Noise
Responsibility for clean air rests primarily with local authorities. Under the
provisions of the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968 they may declare ‘smoke control
areas' within which the emission of smoke from chimneys constitutes an
offence. About two-thirds of the premises in conurbations are now covered by
smoke control orders. Emissions from most industrial premises are also subject
to the control of local authorities under the Clean Air Acts. The emission of dark
smoke from any trade or industrial premises or from the chimney of any
building is in general prohibited, and new furnaces must be capable as far as
practicable of smokeless operation. The height of the chimney serving a new
furnace must generally be approved by the local authority, and approved grit and
dust arrestment plant has to be installed. Regulations prescribe specific limits
to the quantities of grit and dust which may be emitted from certain furnaces.
Industrial premises that give rise to noxious or offensive emissions are, in
England and Wales, under the control of the Industrial Air Pollution Inspec¬
torate of the Health and Safety Executive. In Scotland this function is
discharged by the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate. The Inspectorates require
the best practicable means to be used to prevent emissions or render them
harmless. Similar legislation and controls apply in Northern Ireland.
Strict controls are in force on emissions from motor vehicles, and Britain has
played a constructive role in European Community discussions on tighter
limits. The maximum permitted lead content of petrol will be reduced to 015
grammes per litre on 31 December 1985. The European Community has
adopted a directive providing for the introduction of unleaded petrol by October
1989.
Considerable progress has been made towards the achievement of cleaner air
and a better environment, especially in the last 30 years or so. Total emissions of
smoke in the air have fallen by about 85 per cent since 1960. The domestic
smoke control programme has been particularly important in achieving this
result. London no longer has the dense smoke-laden smogs' of the 1950s and in
central London winter sunshine has increased by about 50 per cent since 1958.
Similar improvement has been achieved in other cities including Glasgow and
Sheffield. National sulphur dioxide emissions have fallen by nearly 40 per cent
since 1970. The Government intends to achieve further reductions of 30 per
cent from the 1980 levels of emissions of both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides by the end of the 1990s.
Britain has become increasingly involved in international air pollution issues
such as acid rain, and with the possible implications of growing concentrations
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. While the causes of acid rain are becoming
more clearly understood, there are still uncertainties about its effects. To help
resolve these uncertainties, Britain is supporting a programme of research on
air pollutants, their effects and the technology for their control, and is also
participating in international research programmes and monitoring schemes.
The Control of Pollution Act 1974 (and similar legislation in Northern Ireland)
requires local authorities to inspect their areas for noise nuisance and gives
them the power to deal with it. It also enables them to designate ‘noise
abatement zones’ within which registered levels of noise from classified
premises may not be increased without their permission. The Act contains
specific provisions to control noise from construction and demolition sites. It
also contains provisions enabling individuals to take action against noise
amounting to a nuisance.
Transport is one of the main offenders in noise pollution, and control
measures are aimed at reducing noise at source, through requirements limiting
the noise that aircraft and motor vehicles may make, and at protecting people
from its effects. The Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1978 set
THE ENVIRONMENT
195
Radioactivity
out the permissible noise levels for various classes of vehicles when new and
when in use. More stringent limits have applied for vehicles coming into use
since 1983 and further reductions in noise limits will begin to take effect for new
vehicles in 1988.
Under the Land Compensation Act 1973 and similar legislation in Scotland,
compensation is payable for loss in property values caused by physical factors
including noise arising from the use of new or improved public works such as
roads and airports. Regulations made under the Acts also enable highway
authorities to carry out or make grants for insulation of homes subject to
specified levels of increased noise caused by new or improved roads. Noise
insulation may also be provided where construction work for new roads is likely
to seriously affect nearby homes.
Noise emission levels of most aircraft on the United Kingdom Register of Civil
Aircraft are regulated in accordance with standards agreed by the International
Civil Aviation Organisation. Subsonic jets acquired by British operators after
September 1978 must already meet the noise certification criteria and all those
on the United Kingdom Register will have to do so from 1 January 1986. In
addition, jets on overseas registers entering Britain must meet these criteria by
1 January 1988. Various operational restrictions have been introduced to
reduce noise disturbance further, and people living in the worst affected areas
round a number of airports may be eligible for noise insulation grants.
Radiation resulting from industrial and other processes represents only a small
fraction of that to which the population is exposed from the natural environ¬
ment. Nevertheless, that fraction is subject to stringent control because of
possible effects on health or longer-term genetic effects. Under the Radioactive
Substances Act 1960 users of radioactive materials other than those subject to
licence under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 must be registered by the
appropriate department, and authorisation is also required for the disposal of
radioactive waste. The Health and Safety Executive, through its Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate, is the authority concerned with the granting of
nuclear site licences for commercial nuclear installations. No installation may be
constructed or operated without a licence granted by the Executive. The
National Radiological Protection Board established under the Radiological
Protection Act 1970 provides an authoritative point of reference on radiological
protection.
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature and level of activity, and the practices
followed reflect this variation. Some wastes are dispersed safely in the
environment. The Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive is responsible
for developing and operating disposal facilities for solid wastes with a low or
intermediate level of activity. Research is being carried out, in collaboration with
other countries, into disposal of high-level wastes, but these will first be stored
in vitrified form for at least 50 years.
9 Religion
The Church of
England
Everyone in Britain has the right of religious freedom (in teaching, worship and
observance) without interference from the community or the State. Churches
and religious societies may own property, conduct schools, and propagate their
beliefs in speech and writing. There is no religious or denominational bar to the
holding of public office.
There are two established churches, that is, churches legally recognised as
official churches of the State: in England the (Anglican) Church of England, and
in Scotland the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. Clergy of the established
churches work in services administered by the State, such as the armed forces,
national hospitals and prisons, and are paid a salary by the State. Clergy of other
denominations are also appointed. Voluntary schools provided by religious
denominations may be wholly or partly maintained from public funds.
There is no precise or uniform information about the number of church
adherents since no inquiries are normally made about religious beliefs in
censuses or other official returns, and each church adopts its own criteria in
counting its members. Membership figures in this chapter are therefore
approximate.
About one-sixth of the adult population in Britain are members of a Christian
church and there are considerable regional variations in church membership:
England has the lowest membership with 13 per cent, Wales has 23 per cent,
Scotland 37 per cent, and Northern Ireland the highest with 80 per cent.
There has been a decline in recent years in both the number of full¬
time ministers and the recorded adult membership of the larger Christian de¬
nominations. This has been accompanied by a significant growth among
small break-away, independent, or Pentecostal churches and new religious
movements.
The Church of England's relationship with the State is one of mutual
obligation—privileges accorded to the Church balanced by certain duties which
it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always be a member of the Church, and
promises to uphold it: Church of England archbishops, bishops and deans are
appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; all clergy take an
oath of allegiance to the Crown. The Church can regulate its own worship. The
two archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the bishops of London, Durham and
Winchester, and 21 other bishops (according to their seniority as diocesan
bishops) sit in the House of Lords. Clergy of the Church (together with those of
the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church)
are not allowed to sit in the House of Commons.
The Church has two provinces: Canterbury, comprising 30 dioceses (includ¬
ing the Diocese of Europe), and York, 14 dioceses. The Archbishop of
Canterbury is ‘Primate of All England', and the Archbishop of York ‘Primate of
England'. The dioceses are divided into 13,500 parishes. In 1983 it was
estimated that, in the two provinces (excluding the Diocese of Europe), some
238,000 people were baptised into the Church: of these 201,000 were under one
year old (34 per cent of live births). In the same year there were 81,950
confirmations. Attendances at services on a normal Sunday are around 1-2
million. Many people who rarely, if ever, attend services, nevertheless regard

themselves as belonging to the Church of England (amounting perhaps to some
60 per cent of the population).
The central governing body, the General Synod, has both spiritual authority
and legislative and administrative powers; and bishops, clergy and lay members
are involved in decisions. Certain important issues must be referred for the
approval of the dioceses before being decided by the Synod. Lay members are
associated with church government in the parishes through the ancient office of
churchwarden and the modern parochial church councils.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with such
matters as education, mission, inter-church relations, social questions, recruit¬
ment and training for the ministry, church work at home and overseas and the
care of church buildings, particularly those of historical and architectural
interest. It is also concerned with church schools (which are maintained from
public funds) and colleges of education, theological colleges, and centres for
training women in pastoral work. At present, men only are admitted to the
priesthood, but in 1984 the General Synod voted in favour of legislation being
prepared to enable women to be ordained priests; final decisions on the matter,
however, are not expected to be taken for some years.
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
church property and matters of ecclesiastical discipline.
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses, with
contributions to a central fund for the maintenance of central services,
including capital expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants for
training candidates for ordination. The State makes no direct financial
contribution to church expenses. The Church's endowment income is mainly
administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for the
payment of clergy stipends and pensions.
The Anglican Communion comprises 28 autonomous provinces in Britain and
overseas and three regional councils overseas with a total membership of about
70 million. In the British Isles, there are four provinces: the Church of England
(established), the Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church in Scotland,
and the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years the Lambeth Conference meets for unofficial consultation
among all Anglican bishops (the last meeting was in 1978). Presided over by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Conference has no executive authority, but
enjoys great prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with
other communions, and attitudes to political and social questions are widely
studied. The Anglican Consultative Council (an assembly of laymen and clergy
as well as bishops) meets every two or three years and is designed to provide
consultations within the Anglican Communion and to serve as an instrument of
common action. The Council last met in 1984.
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian form of government, that is,
government by elders, all (including ministers) of equal rank. Its status as the
national church derives from the Treaty of Union 1707, and the Church of
Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete freedom in all spiritual
matters. It appoints its own officers, and its decisions on questions of doctrine
and discipline are not subject to parliamentary discussion or modification.
Both men and women are admitted to the ministry and each of 1,765
churches is governed locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the minister and
the elected elders of the Church; above the Kirk Session is the Court of the
Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly,
consisting of elected ministers and elders, which meets annually under the

presidency of an elected moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is
represented at the General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The adult
communicant membership of the Church of Scotland is over 887,000.
The expression 'Free Churches' is commonly used to describe those Protestant
churches in Britain which, unlike the Church of England and the Church of
Scotland, are not established. In the course of history they have developed their
own convictions in church order and worship. All the major Free Churches—
Methodist, Baptist, United Reformed and Salvation Army—admit both men and
women to the ministry.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with nearly 500,000
adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the evangeli¬
cal revival under John Wesley, and is based on a 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not join the
union include the Independent Methodists (4,250 members) and the Wesleyan
Reform Union (with some 3,400 members). The Methodist Church in Ireland
has over 21,000 members in Northern Ireland.
The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of which
belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in 1813), with a
total membership of about 166,600. In addition, there are separate Baptist
Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland and other Baptist Churches.
The United Reformed Church, with some 140,000 members, was formed in
1972 when the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the oldest
community of dissenters in Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of England
merged—the first transdenominational union of churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth century. In 1981 there was a further union with
the Reformed Association of the Churches of Christ.
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland (with
some 133,000 regular communicants in Ireland); the Presbyterian (or Calvin-
istic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the revivalist movement led
in 1735 by Howell Harris; the Union of Welsh Independents; the Free Church of
Scotland; the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of
Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed
Presbyterian Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church
of Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations include: the Unitarian and Free Christian
Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States as Disciples
of Christ), which have been an organised community in Britain since early in
the nineteenth century; the British Province of the Moravian Church, which is
an international missionary church; the Free Church of England (or Reformed
Episcopal Church), which was formed in 1844 as a direct result of the Oxford
Movement; and the Congregational Federation, formed from Congregational
Churches which did not enter the United Reformed Church. There are also the
Pentecostalists, who are increasing in numbers. Their two main bodies
operating in Britain are the Assemblies of God and the Elim Pentecostal Church,
many of whose members are of West Indian origin. There are also a number of
small West Indian and African churches.
The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), with about 17,500 adult members
in Britain and 447 places of worship, came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox. Silent worship is
central to its life as a religious organisation and Friends work for peace and the
relief of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 85 other
countries. Within Britain there are 60,000 active members operating from
nearly 1,000 centres of worship. The Salvation Army’s distinctive ministry of

Christian evangelism and practical care is also expressed through the work of
170 social service centres, ranging from hostels for the homeless to homes for
the elderly, for abused children and for teenagers on probation, and recreational
centres for Service personnel.
A recent development in Christian worship has been the house church
movement, which began in the early 1970s and now has an estimated
membership of over 180,000. Each house church has an average of 100
members, the majority of whom are former members of various Protestant
denominations; groups of between 15 and 20 members hold services and prayer
meetings in private houses, with the position of chairman being taken in
rotation. House churches receive money from their members to enable them to
support their leaders and carry out missionary and social work.
There are also a number of other religious organisations in Britain all of which
were founded in the United States in the last century. These include the
Jehovah's Witnesses, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the
Mormon Church), the Christian Scientists and the Spiritualists.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became tempo¬
rarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish
hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in
1878. There are now seven Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each
under an archbishop, 29 episcopal dioceses (21 in England and Wales, eight in
Scotland), and over 3,000 parishes. In Northern Ireland, there are six dioceses,
some with territory partly in the Irish Republic. It is estimated that there are
some 5-7 million adherents to the Roman Catholic faith in Britain. Men only are
admitted to the priesthood. In 1982 Pope John Paul II paid a pastoral visit to
Britain, the first by a reigning pontiff. l
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of its
children and requires its members to try to bring up their children in the
Catholic faith. A number of schools for Catholic children are staffed by members
of the religious orders (to the extent of one teacher in 20). These orders also
undertake other social work such as nursing, child care, and the conduct
of homes for old people. The great majority of Catholic schools are maintained
out of public funds and new schools may be established with government
grants.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman Conquest, but the
present community in Britain dates from 1656, having been founded by those of
Spanish and Portuguese origin (known as Sephardim). Later and more
numerous settlers were of German and Eastern European origin, known as
Ashkenazim. The present community, numbering about 360,000, is the second
largest in Europe.
The community is, broadly speaking, divided into two groups. About 80 per
cent of the majority Ashkenazi Jews are Orthodox and most acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the Chief Rabbi, with the Sephardi Orthodox element following
their own spiritual head (the Haham). The Reform movement which was
founded in 1840 and the Liberal and Progressive movement which followed in
1901 account for the remaining 20 per cent.
Jewish congregations in Britain number about 350. Jewish denominational
schools (some of them supported by public funds) are attended by about one in
three Jewish children. There are a number of charitable and welfare agencies
caring for the aged and handicapped.
The officially recognised representative body is the Board of Deputies of
British Jews.
RELIGION
201
Christian communities of foreign origin, including the Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European countries, together with the Armenian
Church, have established their own centres of worship, particularly in London.
Britain has a long tradition of religious tolerance, a feature which has been
much in evidence during the past 30 years with the acceptance of a wide variety
of religious beliefs and traditions brought in by substantial numbers of
immigrants of different nationalities. There are now large and growing
communities of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, and arrangements have been made
in places of work to allow the members of non-Christian religions to follow their
religious observances.
Britain's Muslim population is estimated at around 1-5 million, the largest
number of whom originate from Pakistan and Bangladesh, with sizeable groups
from India, Cyprus, the Arab world, Malaysia and parts of Africa. There is also a
growing community of British-born Muslims, mainly the children of immigrant
parents, but including an increasing number of converts to Islam. The Islamic
Cultural Centre (and London Central Mosque) on the edge of Regent's Park is the
most important Muslim institution in the Western world, and there are over
1,000 mosques and prayer centres throughout Britain.
There are an estimated 175,000 members of the Sikh religion and over
140,000 followers of Hinduism in Britain. Both groups originate from India and
each has 150 or more temples throughout the country. The Hindu Centre in
London provides religious and social services as well as meeting the cultural
needs of the Indian community.
There are well over 100 Buddhist groups and centres and at least seven
monasteries and a number of temples. All schools of Buddhism are represented.
The Buddhist Society, with its headquarters in London, publicises the
principles of Buddhism and encourages their study and practice: it adheres to
no one school of Buddhism.
The British Council of Churches, with representatives or observers from all the
main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates common action and
seeks to further Christian unity. It works through five divisions: Christian Aid
(which has a separate constitution); Conference for World Mission; Ecumenical
Affairs; Community Affairs; and International Affairs.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches of England and
Wales. It promotes unity and joint action among the Free Churches and is a
channel for communication with central and local government.
Inter-Church conversations about the doctrinal and practical issues involved
in the search for unity now take place through international as well as national
bodies. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches are represented on some of
these as well as the Anglican and some of the Free Churches.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches also participate in the World
Council of Churches (of which the British Council of Churches is an associated
national council). This links together some 300 churches in over 100 countries
for co-operation and the study of common problems. The Council of Christians
and Jews works for better understanding among members of the two religions
and deals with problems in the social field. The British Council of Churches has
also established a Committee for Relations with People of Other Faiths.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969 enables agreements to be made by
two or more churches for the sharing of church buildings.
10 National
Economy
ECONOMIC
BACKGROUND
In 1985 the British economy entered its fifth year of continuous recovery from
the low point of the economic recession in May 1981. This represented as long a
period of growth as any since 1945. The growth rate of gross domestic product
exceeded 3 per cent in 1983, and would have done so again in 1984 but for the
effects of a protracted strike in the coal industry. With exports and investment
rising, the British economy in mid-1985 looked set for a further period of
economic growth. While the level of unemployment remained high, the number
of people in work was rising.
Britain has an open economy and, in consequence, international trade is a vital
part of economic performance. In 1984 exports of goods and services accounted
for almost one-third of its gross domestic product, one of the highest shares in
the major economies. The proportion has increased over the last two decades
from about 20 per cent in the early 1960s. Similar rises have occurred in most
other developed countries, reflecting the growing importance of international
trade in an increasingly interdependent world economy.
The economy is primarily based on private enterprise, and government policy
is aimed at encouraging the private sector, which accounts for 74 per cent of
gross domestic product and 72 per cent of total employment.
The traditional economic strength of Britain, as a pioneer in the industrial
revolution, has been manufacturing. However, the period since 1945 has seen a
marked rise in living standards and, as in other major developed countries, the
increase that has taken place in real personal disposable income has led to a
faster growth of demand for services than for manufactures. An adjustment to
the relative size of the manufacturing sector has also resulted from the growth of
North Sea oil output. Services now account for nearly three-fifths of gross
domestic product and of employment, compared with just under half in 1950,
while manufacturing accounts for about a quarter, compared with just over
one-third in 1950.
Some 2-5 per cent of Britain's employed labour force is engaged in
agriculture—a lower proportion than in any other major industrial country.
However, because of a high level of productivity, Britain is able to produce nearly
two-thirds of its own food.
Britain’s energy position has been transformed in the last decade. With the
discovery and exploitation of oil and natural gas from the Continental Shelf
under the North Sea, the country has become self-sufficient in energy in net
terms. In 1984 some 7 per cent of gross domestic product was attributable to the
oil and gas sectors. Coal—traditionally the most important source of energy—
still accounts for over a third of Britain's needs; the value of Britain's coal
reserves has been enhanced by the substantial increase in world oil prices in the
1970s.
One of the world's largest exporters of visible goods, Britain accounts for about
5 per cent of the total. It is among the major exporters of aerospace products,
204

Competitiveness
Industrial
Output and
Investment
electrical equipment, most types of machinery, chemicals and oil. It is also one of
the world's largest importers of agricultural products, raw materials and
semi-manufactures.
The broad historical pattern of Britain's overseas trade has been a deficit on
visible trade offset by a surplus on transactions in invisibles. The significant
contribution made by invisibles to the current account is partly a reflection of
Britain’s position as a major financial centre. The banks, insurance under¬
writers and brokers, and other financial institutions of the City of London
provide world-wide financial services, and the City contains perhaps the most
comprehensive and advanced capital market in the world.
In the period since the end of the second world war in 1945 there has been a
marked rise in living standards, the emergence of new industries and the
renewal and improvement of much of the country's infrastructure. At the same
time, in spite of short periods of rapid economic expansion, the rate of growth
has been low in comparison with the rates in most other industrialised
countries, averaging 2-3 per cent annually up to 1973 but only about 1 per cent
after that until the early 1980s. By 1983, however, with the economy moving out
of recession, the rate of growth increased to 3 per cent and was sustained at this
level throughout 1984 and the first half of 1985 (allowing for the effects of the
coal strike), with the expectation of continued growth into 1986.
From the late 1960s until about 1980 the rise in wage and price inflation
affected Britain's competitiveness. Following the fivefold increase in world oil
prices in 1973-74, which was accompanied by a rapid growth in money supply
and public spending, the inflation rate reached a peak of 27 per cent in 1975.
After falling into single figures in 1978 and early 1979, inflation again rose
rapidly, reaching 22 per cent in May 1980, partly as a result of the doubling of oil
prices in 1979. The growth in earnings also accelerated, particularly in the
1979-80 pay round when they rose by 22 per cent. By the end of 1981, however,
inflation had fallen to 12 per cent and had come down to 5 per cent by the end of
1982. It has since remained at about this level, running somewhat below the
average level of inflation in the European Community. In mid-1985 inflation
rose slightly to 7 per cent but was expected to fall back again.
In the later 1970s British manufacturers experienced a sharp loss of
international cost competitiveness due to the appreciation of sterling in
1978-80 and much more rapid increases in unit labour costs than in other
countries. Sterling then depreciated, partly as a result of the weakness in the
world oil market. This depreciation, together with greater moderation in pay
settlements and a substantial rise in manufacturing productivity since the end
of 1980 (see p 205), led to a considerable improvement in Britain’s cost
competitiveness. Measured by relative unit labour costs, competitiveness in
British manufacturing is estimated to have improved by about 29 per cent
between the first quarter of 1981 and the first quarter of 1985.
In the decade to 1973 industrial output grew at a faster rate than the economy as
a whole. Following the world oil price rises of 1973—74, however, it grew more
slowly, at almost the same rate as the rest of the economy, until 1979, partly
reflecting strong competition in overseas markets both from other developed
countries and from newly industrialising countries.
In the period 1979-81 the severe recession (induced partly by the stagnation
in the world economy and a second substantial increase in world oil prices)
caused firms to cut back on investment, stockbuilding and employment.
Industrial output fell by about 14 per cent between the second quarter of 1979
(the previous cyclical peak) and the second quarter of 1981 (the trough of the

recession), the fall being most pronounced in the manufacturing and construc¬
tion industries. It has improved steadily and gradually since the second half of
1981, with all industrial sectors benefiting from the increase in activity. By the
first quarter of 1985 the average estimate of output was about 3 per cent higher
than a year earlier, and was 6-3 per cent above its 1979 level, having grown by 11
per cent since 1981. Manufacturing output rose by 3-8 per cent in 1984, an
increase of 7 per cent on 1981.
Total fixed investment grew at an average rate of about 4 per cent a year
throughout the 1960s and early 1970s but, since reaching a peak in 1973, the
level has altered little (apart from cyclical variations). In 1984 it was on a rising
trend, having increased by 8 per cent on the previous year. Within the total,
manufacturing investment and investment in services and construction had
grown particularly rapidly, having increased by 14 per cent in both cases over
the 1983 level. Over the period 1974—84 there has been an increase in the
private sector’s share of total investment (from 59 to 75 per cent), mainly
reflecting the sharp rise in service investment (particularly banking, finance and
insurance). Manufacturing's share has fallen (from 18 to 13 per cent) whereas
investment in oil and gas extraction has risen, accounting for 6 per cent of the
total (compared with 3 per cent in 1974).
As in other industrialised countries, unemployment has proved to be a more
intractable problem since the early 1970s than it had been formerly. From a level
of 300,000 to 400,000 in the mid-1960s, it rose to over 1 million in the late
1970s (representing around 5 to 6 per cent of all employees) and then increased
again very sharply after 1979 to reach 3 million by the end of 1982.
Although unemployment remains high—over 13 per cent of all employees in
June 1985—other labour market indicators have improved. Overtime in
manufacturing has risen and short-time working has fallen. The employed
labour force rose by over 600,000 between the first quarter of 1983 and the
fourth quarter of 1984. Self-employment is at its highest level since 1921.
Output per head in manufacturing has risen markedly since the recession of
1979—81 and at the end of 1984 was 28 per cent above its low point at the end of
1980. Productivity in the economy as a whole has improved by some 3 per cent a
year since 1980.
Britain’s overseas trade performance fluctuated during the 1970s. In general,
imports of food, energy, raw materials and manufactured goods were greater
than visible exports, which were largely manufactured goods. This deficit on
visible trade was wholly or partly offset by a surplus on invisibles, which cover
earnings from services, together with interest, profits and dividends, and
transfers.
However, in 1980—82 there was a surplus on visible trade. Between 1982 and
1984 imports rose faster than exports, partly to meet the need for higher stocks
as the economy continued its recovery. Throughout the period 1980—84 there
was a surplus on current account, supported by a rapidly growing surplus on oil.
Membership of the European Community from 1973 has had a major impact
on Britain’s pattern of trade, increasing the proportion with other member
countries and reducing the share of Commonwealth trade. Between 1972 and
1984 the proportion of Britain’s exports of goods going to other member
countries of the Community rose from 30 to 45 per cent while that going to other
Commonwealth countries fell from 19 to 11 per cent. Imports followed a similar
trend. Trade with the newly industrialising countries, including Singapore,
Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia, has risen substantially.
The strength of overseas earnings from invisibles has been maintained by the
continued adaptation to new conditions, particularly following the abolition of
206
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
exchange controls in 1979, and growth in world markets of insurance, banking,
tourism, construction, consultancy and other services. In 1984 earnings from
.invisibles comprised 36 per cent of Britain's earnings on current account. In
1983 Britain accounted for 9 per cent of world invisible receipts (excluding
government transactions).
The substantial cumulative surplus on current account from 1980 onwards
implies a corresponding increase in Britain’s net external assets which are
estimated to have risen from £12,500 million at the end of 1979 to £75,000
million at the end of 1984. Following the abolition of exchange controls in 1979
investment outflows, particularly portfolio investment, increased sharply.
Portfolio investment growth accelerated again in early 1985 as banks moved into
lending in readily marketable forms (such as floating rate notes) and away from
traditional loans. British banks' sterling lending abroad has also been at a high
level since the abolition of exchange controls.
0il The development of North Sea oil and gas production has had a significant effect
on the economy; by 1985 Britain had become the world's fifth largest oil
producer. The beneficial effects on the balance of payments were apparent over
the second half of the 1970s and the early 1980s, a deficit on trade in oil of nearly
£4,000 million in 1976 having been turned into a favourable balance of £7,000
million by 1984. In 1974 oil accounted for some 4 per cent of Britain’s visible
exports and 19 per cent of visible imports; by 1984 the proportions were 21 per
cent and 10 per cent respectively. Exports, mainly to other European
Community countries, are equivalent to more than half of domestic production.
They are partly offset in balance of payments terms by imports of other grades of
crude oil from the Middle East and elsewhere.
North Sea oil helped to alleviate the fall in real national income which Britain
along with other industrial countries suffered following the oil price rises of the
1970s. It has helped to ease the task of controlling public sector borrowing,
contributing to the Government's counter-inflation strategy. Without North Sea
oil, the benefits of which are expected to continue for some time, non-oil taxes
would have had to be higher or public expenditure lower.
Sterling During periods of high world demand for oil the pound has been strong in
foreign exchange markets, reflecting Britain’s position as a net oil exporter.
During 1979 and 1980 sterling appreciated markedly but has since fallen back.
The world price of oil fell sharply in early 1983 since when it has changed little. A
major influence on sterling since 1983 has been the rapid appreciation of the
United States dollar against all major currencies. The sterling exchange rate
index, which shows changes in the value of the currency as a weighted average
of changes in its exchange rate against other individual currencies, was 79-9 in
June 1985 (1975 = 100). The Government does not set an exchange rate target
but, as noted below, takes the exchange rate into account in assessing monetary
conditions.
ECONOMIC The Government elected in 1979 has adopted economic policies which in some
POLICY respects represent a break with the policies adopted by successive governments
that preceded it. In particular it has made a reduction in inflation (through
monetary control) the prime objective of macroeconomic policy and has set a
medium-term strategy designed to achieve this objective.
In the decades after 1945 British governments sought to influence the rate of
growth and the level of employment by macroeconomic policy measures (that is,
by variation in government expenditure, taxes or controls on consumer credit).
At the same time they attempted to keep inflation down and to achieve
approximate equilibrium in the balance of payments. However, each time the

economy expanded, inflation tended to accelerate and a strong rise in imports
typically gave rise to a balance of payments problem. The effects would finally
lead to the imposition of restraints on home demand. The cyclical pattern of
stimulus followed by restraint became known as ‘stop-go'.
From the late 1960s until about 1980, fluctuations in wage and price levels
had an adverse effect on competitiveness, profitability and business confidence.
This was associated with an increase in unemployment over the period. At
various times governments attempted to control pay rises and (less frequently)
price rises by means of voluntary or statutory controls, but such policies were
largely unsuccessful.
Summarising the Government s economic strategy in 1984, the Chancellor of
the Exchequer noted that under previous governments macroeconomic policy
had been expected to control output and employment (through demand
management) while control of inflation (through incomes policies) had formed
part of microeconomic policy. This assignment of instruments to objectives has
now been reversed.
The essential aim of the medium-term financial strategy, introduced with the
1980 Budget, and carried forward each year since, is the reduction in the rate of
inflation with the goal of stable prices over the medium term. This is expected to
help create the conditions for a sustainable growth in output and employment.
Controlling the growth of the money supply is at the heart of the strategy to
bring about a sustained fall in the rate of inflation. Within this strategy the
reduction in monetary growth is buttressed by a progressive reduction in public
sector borrowing. In the 1985 Budget, the public sector borrowing requirement
was set to fall to 2 per cent of gross domestic product in 1985—86 from around
3-25 per cent in 1984—85. Among the money supply measures, targets are set for
the MO narrow liquidity measure and the sterling M3 broad liquidity measure.1
The target ranges for these are 3 to 7 per cent and 5 to 9 per cent respectively in
1985-86.
In assessing monetary conditions, the Government places special, but equal,
importance on the behaviour of MO and sterling M3, while taking account of
structural influences on the different monetary measures and the behaviour of
other financial indicators, including the exchange rate. While the targets have
been modified in successive Budgets, there has been considerable success in
controlling inflation, the level of which since late 1982 has been less than a third
of its 1980 peak (see p 204). To some extent this achievement has been assisted
by a general weakness in world commodity prices.
While designing macroeconomic policy with the intent of reducing inflation, the
Government has sought to improve the supply response of the economy through
microeconomic policies. Action has been taken to expose more of the economy to
market forces. Direct controls (for example, on pay, prices, foreign exchange,
dividend payments and commercial credit) have been abolished, competition in
domestic markets strengthened, labour market reforms introduced and a
substantial programme of transferring activities from the public to the private
sector is under way. In addition, regulatory burdens on business are being
reduced.
In the labour market the Government has sought to improve work incentives
by reducing personal income tax rates and raising tax thresholds and also by
encouraging the extension of share ownership among employees. To improve
1 MO is notes and coin in circulation with the public and banks' holdings of cash and their
operational balances at the Bank of England. Sterling M3 comprises notes and coin in circulation
with the public and private sector sterling sight and time deposits in Britain.

employment prospects, it has also abolished the National Insurance Surcharge
(a tax on employed labour) and has announced, to take effect in October 1985, a
new. graduated, structure of National Insurance contribution rates which will
reduce the cost to the firm of hiring lower-paid workers. The Government has
also taken steps to achieve a better-balanced legal framework for industrial
relations and is working to improve vocational training and to remove obstacles
to the mobility of labour.
In order to improve the working of capital markets, the Government has
abolished controls on foreign exchange, company dividends, hire purchase and
bank lending. Competition among financial institutions is being encouraged
within a new statutory framework of investor protection. The Government is
also taking steps to reduce the distorting effects of the tax system on investment
and savings decisions by, among other things, reducing corporation tax.
Planning restrictions on industrial investment have been eased, while industrial
subsidies (both generally and in the context of regional policy) have been made
more selective and more closely related to job creation. Particular efforts have
been made to improve the flow of investment funds to small firms and to assist
the innovation process in industry.
The Treasury has prime responsibility for the formulation and conduct of
economic policy, which also involves the Departments of Trade and Industry,
Employment, Energy, the Environment and Transport and the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Other bodies are concerned with specific
aspects of economic policy. These include the Bank of England (the central
bank), the National Economic Development Council (in which the Govern¬
ment meets representatives of industry under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister), the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy, and on
the economic problems it faces, the Government makes known its purposes and
keeps in touch with developments throughout the economy by means of
informal and continuous links with the chief industrial, financial, labour and
other interests. Final responsibility for the broad lines of economic policy rests
with the Cabinet.
The value of all goods and services produced in the economy is measured by the
gross domestic product. This can be expressed either in terms of market prices
(the prices people pay for the goods and services they buy) or at factor cost (the
cost of the goods and services before adding on taxes and subtracting subsidies).
It can also be expressed in current prices or in constant prices (that is, removing
the effects of inflation in order to measure the underlying growth in the
economy). In 1984 gross domestic product at current factor cost totalled
£275,000 million.
Gross domestic product is conventionally estimated in three different ways as
the sum totals of expenditures, incomes or outputs in a given year. Each method
yields the same total in principle, but in practice there are slight differences.
Over the longer term the average of the three is the best indicator of growth in
the economy. In 1984 the index of the average estimate of gross domestic
product at constant factor cost was 106-1 (1980 = 100), compared with 93 0 in
1974, an increase of 4 per cent.
Table 10 gives figures for the expenditure-based measure of gross domestic
product, at both current market prices and current factor cost, and shows how
other main aggregates used in the national accounts, such as gross national
product and national income, are derived.

Personal incomes at current prices before tax rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from £76,192 million in 1974 to £279,556 million in 1984. Personal disposable
income (that is, personal incomes after deductions—mainly taxation and
National Insurance contributions) was £220,524 million in 1984, 1 per cent
higher in real terms than in 1983. Consumers' expenditure amounted to 70 per
cent of pre-tax personal income in 1984 the same as in 1974.
Table 12 shows the pattern of consumers' expenditure in 1984. Food,
alcoholic drink, housing, fuel and power, and clothing and footwear together
accounted for 49 per cent of the total. Consumers’ expenditure increased by over
1 per cent in real terms between 1983 and 1984. The changes in the pattern
between 1974 and 1984 in Britain were paralleled in other industrialised
countries, with declining proportions spent on food, and on clothing and
footwear. Over the longer term, as incomes rise (real personal disposable income
in Britain having more than doubled since 1945), people tend to spend
increasing proportions on consumer durables and services—personal, financial
and leisure services in particular.

Personal saving as a percentage of personal disposable income has fluctuated
over the last decade and was slightly lower in 1984 (11-5 per cent) than in 1974
(12-5 per cent). (Movements in the personal savings ratio may reflect people's
wish to compensate for the rise or fall in the real value of assets fixed in money
terms in response to changes in price levels.)
The proportion of total personal income accounted for by income from
employment was 65 per cent in 1984: average gross weekly earnings in April
1984 in Great Britain were £174-30 for full-time male workers on adult rates
and £114-90 for full-time female workers on adult rates. The three other main
sources of personal income were self-employment (10 per cent), income from
rent, dividends and interest (10 per cent) and current grants from general
government (15 per cent).
Current expenditure on goods and services by central government and local
authorities rose by 15 per cent in real terms over the period 1974—84, at the end
of which it amounted to 21 per cent of gross domestic product. The main cause
of this was the growth over the period of the social services, especially education
and the National Health Service.
In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of
National Insurance and other social security benefits, grants, and interest and
subsidies. Central government also makes grants to local authorities to finance
about one-half of their current expenditure.
Table 13 shows gross domestic product by industry in 1974 and 1984. Over a
period of time agriculture and manufacturing have come to account for smaller
proportions of national income, while energy and services have grown relatively.
Services now account for about 60 per cent of gross domestic product.
11 Framework
of Industry
Among the most prominent trends in industrial activity in Britain during the
1970s and early 1980s have been the growth of the offshore oil and gas
industries together with related products and services; the rapid development of
electronic and microelectronic technologies and their application to a wide
range of other sectors; and a continuous rise in the service industries’ share of
total employment. Industrial output in Britain has twice been affected by
recession since 1973, partly as a result of fluctuations in oil prices. Output
declined for two years after 1973, recovered steadily between 1975 and 1979, fell
again in 1980 and the first half of 1981 and has since risen gradually. By 1983
there had been a fall in oil prices to a level which has since stabilised. This, and a
marked increase in productivity, are among the factors which have eased the
process of economic recovery. In early 1985 total output was 10-9 per cent
higher than at the low point of the recession in early 1981. Gains in
productivity, however, meant that this increased output was produced with
fewer workers. Consequently, employment, though beginning to increase, was
still lower than in 1981. Table 14 shows gross domestic product (GDP) by sector
and the percentage of total GDP and of total employment in each sector in 1984.

The Government is pursuing policies designed to help British industry
become more competitive and responsive to market forces, both at home and
abroad (see p 220), and also to encourage development in advanced industries
such as microelectronics and biotechnology. These objectives are also borne in
mind by the Government when participating in the formulation of European
Community industrial policies.

INDUSTRIAL
ORGANISATION
Industrial
Financing
This chapter describes some of the general features of industrial organisation
in Britain, such as the forms of enterprise, methods of financing and industrial
association. It looks at factors affecting productivity and competitiveness,
including investment, technological advance, research and development, and
management and workforce training, as well as means of improving standards
of design and quality assurance. It also outlines the framework of incentives for
general industrial development provided by the Government, and by Community
institutions, and the regulatory framework within which industry operates.
The forms of industrial organisation and the patterns of ownership and control
are varied. The main categories of organisation are: unincorporated businesses
(sole traders and partnerships) of which there are at least 1 million; incor¬
porated companies: and public sector enterprises, which are owned by the
Government (see p 221). Incorporation means that companies are registered on
the official register of companies (see p 231); at the end of 1984 there were
nearly 900,000 such companies, but it is estimated that only about three-
quarters of them were trading. About 3,340 of these companies were public
limited companies. There are about 16 major public sector enterprises with an
employed labour force of 1-3 million. The Government is pursuing a programme
of ‘privatisation’ whereby some of these enterprises are transformed into
incorporated companies and their shares sold to the public (see p 222).
Employees in such companies are being given a preferential right to buy shares
in their new companies and employee share ownership in general has been
facilitated by changes in legislation, thus enabling employees to have a financial
interest in the profitability of their companies. Although not numerous,
co-operative enterprises (which are also incorporated companies) are becoming
more common and since 1980 there has been a rise in the number of‘buy-outs’
in which the staff, or management, of a company raises the finance to purchase
it.
In some sectors a small number of large companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a great proportion of total production. However, it is rare for a
few shareholders to have a controlling interest since shares in these companies
are usually distributed among many holders or held by insurance companies or
pension funds representing a cross-section of the community.
The private sector accounts for about 74 per cent of GDP in Britain and for the
greater part of activity in the agricultural, mining and quarrying (apart from
coal), manufacturing (except steel and shipbuilding), construction, distributive,
financial and miscellaneous service industries. Industries in public sector
ownership include most of the energy, transport and communications indus¬
tries. Unincorporated businesses, corporate enterprises and public sector
enterprises contribute about 20, 54 and 9 per cent of GDP respectively (the
remainder being accounted for by central and local government).
About 78 companies registered in Britain each had net assets of over £500
million in 1984. In terms of annual sales three of the top six industrial groups in
Europe were British, with British Petroleum first and Shell Transport and
Trading third. Alongside the larger organisations the many hundreds of
thousands of small firms play an essential part in the economy.
Over half of companies' funds for further investment and other purposes are
internally generated, with banks providing the chief external source of finance.
The main forms of short-term finance available in the private sector are bank
overdrafts, trade credit, bill financing (essentially a more formal kind of trade
credit) and factoring (making cash available to a company in exchange for its
debts). Types of medium- and long-term finance include bank loans, the

through The Stock Exchange. The leasing of equipment may also be regarded as
a form of finance. Other sources of finance for industry include the Government
(see p 223), the European Community and specialist financial institutions.
Capital gearing (the ratio of debt to equity) has historically been low relative to
most other countries, reflecting the highly developed stock market in Britain. In
1981, capital gearing was 48 per cent.
The 1980s have been particularly notable for the growth of venture capital
schemes run by financial institutions in both the public and private sectors to
provide ‘start-up' and development finance for small and new firms. The
organisation of an Unlisted Securities Market and over-the-counter markets has
enabled fast-developing young companies to raise capital through share issues,
even if they are not eligible for a full Stock Exchange listing.
There are several types of voluntary association representing private enterprises
and covering, with varying degrees of completeness, most of British industry.
The central body representing British business and industry is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI). The CBI represents about 250,000 businesses,
directly or indirectly (through employers' organisations and trade associations),
as well as the majority of public sector enterprises. For its members, it acts as an
advisory and consultative body, providing them with information and statistics,
ascertaining their collective views and representing them nationally to the
Government and public as well as internationally. CBI representatives sit on
such bodies as the National Economic Development Council, the Manpower
Services Commission and the Health and Safety Commission.
Trade associations consist of companies producing or retailing a particular
product or group of products, and about 700 major associations are listed by the
Department of Employment. They exist to provide common services, regulate
trading practices and represent their members to government departments.
Employers' organisations are usually concerned with the negotiation of wages
and conditions of work in a particular industrial sector, although sometimes
one institution may undertake the function of both a trade association and an
employers’ organisation.
Chambers of commerce are open to producers and traders of all kinds and are
organised on a geographical basis. They exist to provide export assistance as
well as advisory and information services and training courses. There are 85
local chambers of commerce, representing 55,000 firms, affiliated to regional
associations and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and there
are additional central organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Other voluntary associations include industrial development associations for
particular regions or areas and the Scottish Council (Development and Industry)
in Scotland.
Although output per head in Britain has generally been low by international
standards, it has risen sharply since 1981. The rise for manufacturing has been
greater than for the economy as a whole. The index for the whole economy in
1984 was 111-3 (1980 = 100). Table 15 shows the output and employment
indices for 1983 and 1984. There was a fall in employment in production
industries between these years, but this was more than offset by a rise in
employment in service industries, which led to an overall increase. Output and
output per head in both production and service industries rose between 1983
and 1984. The Government believes that the increased competitiveness
resulting from these productivity gains will lead to a sustained rise in living
standards and a fall in unemployment.
Among the factors affecting productivity are capital investment, innovations
and improvements in products and processes, and the performance and

Excluding self-employment.
Total fixed capital expenditure increased by 8 per cent between 1983 and 1984
in real terms. In the recession of 1979-81, investment fell by almost 14 per cent,
but began to recover in 1982. The fall occurred mainly in manufacturing
investment, which fell substantially between 1979 and 1983, recovering
somewhat in 1984. Investment in distribution, financial services and transport
fell slightly between 1979 and 1981, but otherwise has shown a consistent
rising trend. Investment in major sectors of the economy in 1984 (at 1980
prices) is shown in Table 16. The figures for manufacturing industry do not
include expenditure on leased assets since these are attributed to the service
industries on the basis of ownership. Manufacturing industry is, however, the
major user of leased assets. The practice of leasing has grown rapidly since the
early 1970s but is likely to decline owing to changes made in the tax treatment of
capital investment in the 1984 Budget (see p 222).
Britain was a pioneer in both computing and telecommunications and has an
important computer industry. It is among the world’s leading nations in the
production and use of micro- and minicomputers as well as in the provision of
computing services and systems. Extensive use of electronics and automated
controls is to be found across the whole range of industry. The use of
computerised control is becoming widespread in steel mills, coal mines, oil
refineries and chemical plants, and an independent survey has estimated that
nearly half of British manufacturing plants employing more than 20 people were
using microelectronics by 1983. The use of robots is increasing rapidly,
especially in the motor industry: Britain was the world's sixth largest user of
industrial robots at the end of 1984 according to the British Robot Association.
Greater use of robotics and of other new technologies such as fibre optics and

optoelectronics is encouraged by various Department of Trade and Industry
schemes.
The use of personal computers in offices is now common, and advanced data
transmission systems and databases are being developed. New technology is also
being used in the area of personal banking and sales as electronic funds transfer
at point of sale (EFT-POS) equipment begins to be installed in addition to the
automated teller machines which are now widespread.
British industry has a record of success in biotechnology. The pharmaceuti¬
cals sector is among the world leaders in the production of antibiotics by
fermentation and there has also been steady improvement of fermentation
techniques in the production of food and beverages. Biotechnology has gained a
new impetus from research achievements in genetic engineering and cell fusion.
The Department of Trade and Industry and other government bodies are
encouraging the exploitation of new developments. A Biotechnology Unit at the
Laboratory of the Government Chemist is the focus for government co-operation
with industry.
The British Technology Group (BTG) promotes the industrial application of
developments of all kinds made in public sector research institutions and
universities (see p 223). Some of the major technical achievements which it has
exploited or supported are cephalosporin antibiotics, pyrethroid insecticides,
glass-reinforced cement, carbon fibre and advanced integrated circuits.
Industrial expenditure on research and development in 1983 was £4,163
million, of which £3,637 million was spent by private sector companies and
£526 million by public sector companies and by some 40 research associations
formed by groups of companies in a particular sector. The main areas of
expenditure were electronics (£1,463 million), chemicals and allied products
(£735 million), aerospace (£720 million), mechanical engineering (£290 mil¬
lion), and motor vehicles (£240 million). In 1983—84, the government sector
spent £3,380 million (see p 223), universities and further education establish¬
ments £550 million and independent contract research organisations and

others £160 million. Approximately £1,500 million of companies’ and research
associations’ industrial research funds were supplied by the Government or
other outside sources.
The Government has sponsored a major programme in advanced information
technology, known as the Alvey programme, which comprises research projects
involving collaboration between industry, academic institutions and other
research organisations. The programme runs over the years 1983-88 with a
total budget of £350 million, over half of which is being provided by the
Government. The four main areas of research are software engineering,
man-machine interfaces, very large-scale integrated circuits and intelligent
knowledge-based systems. By the end of 1984, 56 per cent of funds were
committed to 77 projects with, typically, two or three firms and one or two
universities taking part in each project. Over 50 firms, 40 universities, six
polytechnics and five government research stations are now involved in the
programme. The European Community’s research programme into the develop¬
ment and application of information technologies, the European Strategic
Programme of Research into Information Technology (ESPRIT), has a budget of
1,500 million ECUs1 (£900 million) for the five years 1984—89, of which 50 per
cent will be provided by the Community. British companies are participating in
67 of the 104 projects which are being supported in the first year (1984-85).
The BRITE programme (Basie Research in Industrial Technology) is a
Community project which will encourage collaborative research into applica¬
tions of advanced technology in some of the more traditional industries and
which will have British participation. It will have a budget of 125 million ECUs
(£78 million) over the four years 1985—89.
Management education is provided by all the polytechnics and many colleges of
further education, while Regional Management Centres have been established
in England and Wales by associations of some of these colleges, with some
similar organisations in Scotland. Universities make an important contribu¬
tion, especially through the full-time postgraduate programmes at business
schools such as those of London, Manchester, City, Durham and Strathclyde
universities. Training courses for managers are offered by several independent
colleges, including the Management College, Henley-on-Thames, and Ashridge
College, Berkhamsted. The British Institute of Management, which has a
representative role for the management and administrative professions, has a
particular interest in management training, while there are also a number of
professional bodies concerned with standards and training in specialised
branches of management.
The Engineering Council was established under Royal Charter in 1981. Its
objectives are to advance education in, and to promote the science and practice
of, engineering (including relevant technology) for the public benefit and thereby
promote industry and commerce in Britain. The Council maintains a register
of professional engineers (which includes chartered engineers), technician
engineers and engineering technicians. In co-operation with the various
professional institutions and other organisations concerned with training in
engineering, it has set standards for education, training and experience, and
accredited courses by which people qualify for registration.
A well-trained workforce is essential for economic growth, and recent technolo¬
gical advances have created a need for an even greater quantity, range and
quality of technical and vocational training, both for young people and for

adults. The main responsibility for training rests with employers and indi¬
viduals, and employers are estimated to have spent around £2,300 million on it
in 1984. The Business and Technician Education Council (BTEC), a privately
funded body, deals with the education and training of technicians and their
equivalents in the professions and commerce, by designing syllabuses and
validating courses offered at colleges of further education and elsewhere in
England and Wales; its Scottish equivalent is the Scottish Vocational Education
Council. BTEC is working with the Engineering Council and the Engineering
Industry Training Board to co-ordinate their systems of assessing and certifying
the skills of those receiving technician education and training, and with the City
and Guilds of London Institute to develop the pre-vocational courses of the two
organisations into a more coherent and comprehensive system.
The Government is increasing its responsibility for some aspects of training.
It is estimated to have spent some £450 million on this in 1979—80, rising to
over £1,000 million in 1984—85. The Manpower Services Commission (MSC),
which consists of representatives of employers, unions and local authority and
educational interests, is the main agency through which the Government
institutes action and monitors progress in training. Its main scheme is the
Youth Training Scheme, which offers a 12-month course of planned work
experience integrated with off-the-job training for unemployed 16- or 17-year-old
school-leavers. The scheme is to be expanded to provide, from 1 April 1986, two
years of training for 16-year-olds and one year for 17-year-olds, leading to a
recognised qualification. The Technical and Vocational Education Initiative
aims at providing four-year courses with a strong technical and vocational
element in schools and colleges for 14- to 18-year-olds. Most education
authorities will be participating by 1986—87.
The MSC's Adult Training Strategy (ATS) is encouraging employers and others
to give training a higher priority as well as developing the MSC’s own training
programmes and assistance. One major programme is the Job Training
Scheme, which offers occupational training to unemployed adults, taking into
account the varying needs of employers in different areas. The Open Tech
Scheme is developing flexible and distance-learning programmes in technician
and supervisory skills. The Professional, Industrial and Commercial Updating
Programme (PICKUP) is encouraging higher education institutions in similar
developments in response to industrial and commercial needs. ATS schemes will
help 200,000 people (including 120,000 unemployed) in 1985—86.
Good design is seen as crucial for maintaining and improving the quality and
competitiveness of goods and services; the Department of Trade and Industry
gives priority to its campaign to encourage greater awareness in industry and
commerce (among both producers and customers) of the value of good design
and to reinforce the importance of design education and training at all levels.
Advice and assistance on design matters are available from the government-
sponsored Design Council, while the Computer-Aided Design Centre also
provides assistance to individual firms. The Design Council has centres in
London, Cardiff and Glasgow, and its operations include giving advice on design
problems; the organisation of product displays at overseas trade fairs, confer¬
ences and seminars on design; providing help for design education; and the
production of a range of publications. A funded consultancy scheme, operated
by the Design Council on behalf of the Government, offers firms employing up to
500 people a maximum of 15 working days’ consultancy at subsidised rates. The
Council provides annual awards for consumer goods, engineering products and
components, medical equipment, and motor vehicles and accessories. The
Society of Industrial Artists and Designers is the representative professional
body in Great Britain of industrial designers.

BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The British Standards Institution (BSD prepares and publishes standards
which specify dimensions, performance and safety criteria, testing methods and
codes of practice for a large range of products and processes in most fields of
production. It is a voluntary non-profit-making body, funded by sales of
standards, subscriptions and government grant. Voluntary acceptance of the
standards by manufacturers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety
and simplifies the specification of requirements. The board of the BSI includes
representatives of the main organisations of employers and workers, profes¬
sional institutions, consumers and the larger government departments. The
BSI, with government support, co-operates with other countries in achieving
international agreements on standards. A new, faster, approach to harmonising
product standards within the European Community, intended to help break
down internal trade barriers and based on the simple requirement of safety, was
agreed in May 1985. The Government is working for recognition of the
importance of standards, believing that they can serve to improve the quality
and thereby the international competitiveness of products. It uses standards in
legislation and public purchasing wherever possible and supports their
development and practical application in national life. In 1983 the Government
launched a long-term National Quality Campaign, supported by a number of
non-government bodies including the BSI. A National Quality Information
Centre was established in 1984 to help industry in its efforts to improve the
competitiveness of its products.
The National Physical Laboratory (NPL), a research establishment of the
Department of Trade and Industry, is responsible for providing the measure¬
ment standards and calibration facilities necessary to ensure that measure¬
ments in Britain are made on a common basis and to the required accuracy.
Measurement standards bear directly on quality control in manufacture,
efficiency in commerce, and on health and safety. The NPL maintains links with
national standards laboratories all over the world to ensure international
compatibility in measurements essential for overseas trade and technological
co-operation. Much of the dissemination of measurement standards is provided
by the NPLs British Calibration Service (BCS), which comprises over 100
independent accredited laboratories located in industry, universities and
government establishments. These offer authenticated calibrations of scientific
instruments and official certificates for electrical, mechanical, flow, optical,
pressure, thermal and time interval measurements. BCS measurements are
linked directly or indirectly, within known and approved uncertainties, to the
national measurement standards at the NPL. The National Testing Laboratory
Accreditation Scheme (NATLAS), also based at the NPL, grants official recogni¬
tion to laboratories shown by independent assessors to be competent to carry
out specific types of test to a required standard. Its purpose is to enhance the
standing of British testing laboratories and secure international acceptance of
test results from accredited laboratories. The BCS and the NATLAS are to be
merged into a single unified scheme, to be known as the National Measurement
Accreditation Service, by October 1985.
In 1984 the Government appointed a committee to review the metrological con¬
trol of weighing and measuring equipment for commercial use taking account
of the impact of modern technology and trading conditions; the committee’s
recommendations are currently under consideration by the Government.
The chief aim of the Government’s industrial policy is to encourage industrial
enterprise and initiative in a flexible and competitive market economy. The
extent of state ownership is being reduced, a review of industrial subsidies has
FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY
221
been carried out and industrial investment agencies in the public sector have
been encouraged to secure private sector participation in their projects.
Competition policy has been strengthened in order to create a climate in which
commerce can flourish. A further policy to promote efficiency and competitive¬
ness takes the form of a campaign to enhance the status of standards and
quality assurance. The Government is also encouraging the development of
small businesses by reducing their administrative burdens, adjusting taxation
and through other policies.
Successive governments have aimed to provide an environment favourable to
industrial expansion. For areas and industries with special needs and difficul¬
ties, there are schemes of financial and other aid, administered by a number of
bodies, chiefly the Department of Trade and Industry. The Department's
schemes of assistance to industry and commerce were regrouped in April 1985
under four headings: business and technical advisory services: support for
innovation: support for national and regional investment; and support for
exports. Aid provided by the Department in 1984—85 amounted to about £1,234
million (compared with some £1,262 million in the previous year). The 1984—85
total included £627 million for regional and general industrial support, £383
million for scientific and technological assistance, and £188 million for
aerospace, shipbuilding, steel, and vehicle manufacture. The largest component
of regional and general industrial support has been the regional development
grant scheme (£356 million in 1984—85). Various other agencies in the public
sector provide aid, either for defined activities (such as tourism) or for specific
geographical areas. The latter include inner urban areas, for which the
Government has schemes of social and economic regeneration; enterprise
zones—areas in which, as an experiment, economic activity is relieved of certain
tax burdens and administrative controls; and freeports (also experimental) in
which traders are freed from certain customs requirements. These national
industrial aids are supplemented by assistance from European Community
funds (see p 228). Direct investment from overseas is encouraged: the Depart¬
ment of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain Bureau provides foreign
companies with advice and assistance on all aspects of locating and relocating
businesses in Britain, and on expanding existing facilities. Britain has for many
years been the leading country for United States manufacturing investment in
Europe and has attracted about one-third of all Japanese investment in the
European Community since 1951. Overseas firms are generally offered the same
facilities and incentives as British-based companies.
Recognition of outstanding industrial performance is conferred annually by
the Queen's Awards for Export and Technology, the Export Awards for Smaller
Manufacturers (for firms employing fewer than 200 people) and the MacRobert
Award, the major award for engineering in Britain (made by the Fellowship of
Engineering for successful technological innovation). The Queen's Awards are
made to firms in all sectors of industry (including services) on the advice of a
committee composed of businessmen, trade union representatives and civil
servants.
Nationalised
Industries
The major nationalised industries are: the electricity supply industry (including
the Central Electricity Generating Board and 12 area electricity boards in
England and Wales): the British Gas Corporation; the National Coal Board; the
British Steel Corporation; British Rail; and the Post Office. In total the
industries account for around 7-5 per cent of GDP and employ about 5 per cent
of all employees.
The managing boards and staffs of the nationalised industries are not civil
servants although they are responsible to ministers who appoint the chairman
222

and members of each board. Ministers are responsible for agreeing with the
industries their general strategies and have the power to give general directions
as to how the industry should be run, but do not interfere in day-to-day
management. The Government's policy is to encourage the nationalised
industries to behave as far as possible as commercial enterprises, and this is
carried out through the financial framework, set by the Government, within
which the industries are expected to operate. This is designed also to integrate
the industries’ medium-term commercial aims with the requirements of
government policy on the management of the economy. The main elements of
the framework are: clear government objectives for the industries; regular
corporate plans and performance reviews; systematic monitoring; agreed
principles relating to investment appraisal and pricing; external financing
limits; and financial targets and performance aims.
To ensure that nationalised industry investment earns an adequate economic
return, there is a ‘required rate of return' which investment programmes are
expected to achieve. The current rate is 5 per cent in real terms before tax.
Financial targets are set for individual nationalised industries to give them a
framework similar to those of private sector companies which need to earn
profits. They are supported by a series of performance aims, covering costs and
standards of service, which are considered particularly important for industries
with some monopoly power where financial targets would not automatically
impose pressures for operating efficiency. External financing limits, which
control the amount of finance (grants and borrowing) that a nationalised
industry can raise from external sources in any financial year, are an important
short-term operating control. They are set in the light of a nationalised
industry's financial target and its expected performance and investment
requirements. Nationalised industries are planning to finance a greater
proportion of investment from internally generated funds.
External scrutiny of nationalised industry efficiency is conducted by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (see p 229), which carries out up to six
investigations each year at the instigation of ministers, and these investigations
are complemented on occasion by studies undertaken by management consul¬
tants. Nationalised industry matters are also considered by parliamentary
committees such as the Treasury and Civil Service Committee and the Public
Accounts Committee.
The Government believes that reform of the nationalised industries is essential
to economic recovery, and that the best way to improve performance in the long
term is to expose the industries to market forces, through privatisation and the
reduction of monopoly. Concerns which have been privatised include British
Aerospace, British Telecom, Cable and Wireless, the National Freight Consor¬
tium, Jaguar, Amersham International, Enterprise Oil, Britoil, Associated
British Ports and some warship-building yards. A variety of assets and
government shareholdings in many other enterprises have also been sold. About
400,000 jobs have been transferred to the private sector. The Government also
intends to privatise British Airways, British Gas, the Royal Ordnance factories,
the National Bus Company, Short Brothers, parts of British Steel and BL, and as
many as possible of Britain's airports. To stimulate efficiency, the Government
has relaxed the statutory monopolies of a number of nationalised industries.
Incentives to encourage capital expenditure by industry on plant and machinery
include a system whereby such expenditure can be partially written off against
profits for tax purposes in the year in which it is incurred. The first-year
allowance on plant and machinery is 50 per cent for 1985-86; from April 1986
this allowance will be abolished but all such expenditure will qualify for annual
FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY
223
allowances of 25 per cent (on a reducing balance basis). Initial allowances on
industrial buildings are 25 per cent; these allowances will also be abolished from
April 1986 but a 4 per cent annual allowance will remain on industrial
buildings. Progressive reductions in the main rate of corporation tax were
brought into effect as a result of the 1984 Budget.

The Department of Trade and Industry provides national selective financial
assistance for major investment projects in manufacturing industry which are
judged to be in the national interest and which would not proceed without
assistance. The Department also operates schemes of selective assistance to
support the introduction by private industry of new products and processes.
Particular importance is attached to encouraging industry to equip itself with
aids to design and manufacture based on microelectronics.
Guarantees are provided for the repayment of loans and interest incurred in
the purchase of new ships and mobile offshore installations built in Britain.
Expenditure on research and development supported by the Department of
Trade and Industry is aimed at improving the capability of firms to exploit
technological opportunities and encouraging firms to undertake innovative
projects which promise high returns. A growing proportion of expenditure is
going towards work carried out in industry; other work is done at research
associations and in government research establishments. The Department’s
research establishments are the National Physical Laboratory (responsible not
only for measurement standards, but also for research and development in
related fields of national importance, including the properties of industrially
important materials, and information technology), the National Engineering
Laboratory (research and development in mechanical engineering, including
manufacturing systems and robotics, materials applications, fluid power,
pumps, fans and heat exchangers, and structural analysis and testing), the
Warren Spring Laboratory (control engineering, materials handling, metal
extraction, mineral processing, waste materials processing and environmental
technology), and the Laboratory of the Government Chemist (analytical services
mainly to central and local government, public institutions and international
organisations).
‘Support for Innovation’ is the Department of Trade and Industry’s general
facility for providing selective financial support for research and development
projects leading to new products and processes and for longer-term applied
research projects. The Department is advised by requirements committees of
senior industrialists and academics on the overall allocation of its resources to
particular technologies and industrial sectors.
The Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development, whose members
include representatives of industry, industrial research and the engineering
profession, is a source of independent advice to ministers collectively on applied
research and development in both the public and private sectors, on the linkage
between this research and scientific research supported by government
departments, on the development and application of technology, and on the role
of Britain in international collaboration in such activities. The Council has
published a number of reports on aspects of new technology. It is served by a
secretariat in the Cabinet Office.
The British Technology Group (BTC) is the name under which the National
Research Development Corporation and the National Enterprise Board have
been co-operating since 1981 following the Government’s decision to combine
the two organisations.

and private sectors, bridging the gap between the emergence of a research idea
and its commercial exploitation. However, the BTG is not a grant-giving body:
rather it seeks to make a return on its investments and approaches every
transaction on a commercial basis. The BTG's objective is to promote the
development of new technology into commercial products, particularly where
the technology originates from public sector sources, such as universities,
polytechnics, research councils and government research establishments. It
offers to take responsibility for protecting and licensing inventions from these
sources, provides funds for development, seeks licensees and negotiates licence
agreements with industry. As part of its technology transfer role it can also offer
project finance to companies that want to develop new products and processes
based on new technology.
The BTG has a portfolio of about 1,700 British patents and patent
applications, over 600 licensees in Britain and overseas, and 340 revenue¬
earning inventions. It is also funding 380 development projects at universi¬
ties and other public sector institutions, and 230 projects with industrial
companies.
In 1984 the BTG announced several major initiatives to promote technology
transfer. It aims to invest about £15 million a year from its own resources. In
addition to its traditional business of supporting the exploitation of inventions
through licensing, the BTG offers up to 50 per cent of the finance for projects
at universities or polytechnics where the technology is to be transferred
ultimately to industry through consultancy or contract research and develop¬
ment. It also provides finance for companies formed by academic institutions.
Economic imbalance between different parts of the country is due partly to the
steady decline over the years, in certain regions, of older industries, such as
coal, steel, shipbuilding and textiles, and partly to the tendency of many newer
and expanding industries to develop elsewhere. Thus the traditional industrial
areas, mainly in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the north of England,
have experienced, for many years, higher unemployment rates than regions
such as the South East, and have suffered from net outward migration and
industrial dereliction. In order to help to restore the economies of the areas of
greatest need the Government has provided incentives to encourage industrial
development in designated assisted areas’. Following a review of policy in Great
Britain (Northern Ireland is treated separately), the Government has reaffirmed
its commitment to maintain an effective regional industrial policy to ease the
process of change in areas which have been dependent on declining industries
and to encourage the setting up of new businesses there. A new structure of
regional industrial incentives, more directly linked to job creation, and a revised
designation of the assisted areas, were introduced in 1984.
There are two categories of assisted areas: ‘development areas' and ‘intermediate
areas’, with the former being adjudged to have the greatest need for assistance
(see map, opposite). Regional development grants are payable for investment in
qualifying activities in the development areas, either as a proportion of capital
expenditure limited by a cost-per-job ceiling or as an amount for each new job
created, whichever is the more advantageous to the investor. Small firms are
not, in general, subject to a cost-per-job ceiling. All manufacturing industries
and some service industries are eligible for regional development grants. In
addition, regional selective assistance may be payable to manufacturing and
certain service sector projects that create or safeguard employment throughout
the assisted areas.

The Government provides factories and workshops where the private sector is
unwilling to invest in them. Special grants are available towards the improve¬
ment of the infrastructure in the assisted areas and towards the clearance of
derelict land.
The Department of Trade and Industry takes the lead in the formulation of
regional industrial policy and administers the regional development grant and
regional selective assistance schemes in England. The Welsh and Scottish
Offices administer these schemes in their respective countries. Factories in the
assisted areas are provided, often in association with the private sector, by the
government-funded English Industrial Estates Corporation (known as English
Estates), and by the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies.
The Industrial Development Board, formed in 1982 under the aegis of the
Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development, offers a range of
incentives similar to those available in the assisted areas (in some cases at
higher rates). Incentives automatically available to manufacturing industry
include grants of up to 20 per cent of the cost of new fixed assets, training
grants, grants for key workers moving to Northern Ireland and exemption from
local authority rates (local property taxes) for manufacturing premises. Manu¬
facturing and service industry projects which create jobs may be eligible for
grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost of new fixed assets, interest relief grants,
favourable rental terms for factories, and grants to assist with setting-up costs
and research and development costs. The Board can also provide equity and loan
capital for new and expanding businesses, assist the development of new
high-technology products and processes, and promote joint ventures with
overseas companies. Other incentives include corporation tax relief of up to 80
per cent for certain new projects; 30 per cent grants for approved energy
conservation projects; grants to attract and retain good management; and an
advisory service on production methods.
Government regional policies have been aimed at encouraging new industries in
order to offset the decline in traditional activities. Accordingly the Scottish and
Welsh Development Agencies promote industrial development in their respective
countries. They encourage investment by overseas companies, provide equity
and loan capital for industrial projects (which they are expected to do with a
maximum of private sector participation), provide government factories, and
have powers to assist small firms and undertake land reclamation.
The Development Commission is responsible for promoting the economic and
social development of rural England. It provides small factories and workshops
which are built and managed by English Estates, and administers a grant
scheme for the conversion of redundant buildings to industrial or commercial
premises. The Commission's main agency, the Council for Small Industries in
Rural Areas, provides technical management and financial advice, training
facilities and loans to small businesses. The Commission also supports
voluntary bodies in rural areas to encourage community activity and self help
and provides finance for small-scale rural housing and transport schemes.
Though its responsibility extends over the whole of rural England, the
Commission's resources are concentrated in the areas of greatest need, which
are designated as rural development areas.
In Scotland and Wales similar services are provided generally through the
development agencies, but separate bodies cater for two particular rural areas.
In Scotland the Highlands and Islands Development Board provides loans and
grants for viable projects in manufacturing, agriculture, fisheries and services,

makes available training grants and advice, and builds factories. The Develop¬
ment Board for Rural Wales (usually referred to as ‘Mid-Wales Development’)
provides factories, key worker housing and advice for small businesses. It has a
general responsibility to promote the economic and social well-being of
mid-Wales and a particular responsibility for the new town (Newtown, Powys).
Direct government support for the tourism industry is provided by five statutory
bodies. The British Tourist Authority (BTA) is responsible for the overseas
promotion of tourism to Great Britain. The English, Scottish and Wales Tourist
Boards, which promote tourism in their respective countries, encourage the
development and improvement of tourist accommodation and amenities, and
administer grants or loans for projects to provide or improve tourist amenities,
and interest relief grants. The Scottish Tourist Board, unlike its English and
Welsh counterparts, is also empowered to carry out its own overseas promo¬
tional activities in consultation with the BTA; these activities are intended to
supplement, rather than replace, the overseas promotional work undertaken by
the BTA. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) has a promotional role
similar to that of the other boards; the BTA carries out overseas promotional
activities on behalf of the NITB on an agency basis.
The BTA offers a trophy annually for the most outstanding tourist develop¬
ment for overseas visitors; in 1984 the trophy was won by the Alton Towers
leisure park.
The Department of Employment is responsible for the formation of policy
towards the small business sector. Together with the Small Business Division of
the Scottish Development Agency and the Welsh Office, the Department
administers the service, which provides advice and guidance on a wide range of
business problems affecting small firms (in manufacturing, generally defined as
those firms employing less than 200 people) and those seeking to set up
businesses. In Northern Ireland the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
established to promote the development of small industries, provides grants,
loans, help with obtaining premises and management advice to new and
expanding companies. Local enterprise agencies, independent of the Govern¬
ment, also provide counselling and other services for small businesses.
The Government has been particularly concerned since the late 1970s to
encourage small firms; between 1980 and 1983 the total number of small
businesses increased by more than 110,000. It has introduced a framework of
measures aimed at reducing burdens and providing incentives for enterprise
and risk-taking. These have included a loan guarantee scheme, under which the
Government guarantees repayment of 70 per cent of medium-term loans made
by participating financial institutions; a business expansion scheme, under
which tax reliefs are available to private individuals investing in small
businesses; and the enterprise allowance scheme, which enables longer-term
unemployed people to claim an allowance while starting a new business. A range
of other tax concessions has also been made for small firms. The development of
new sources of venture capital has been promoted and a number of private
sector initiatives have been made by the clearing banks and by groups of large
firms and financial institutions. Priority is being given to the provision of
relevant and accessible training for those setting up or running small
businesses, together with appropriate advisory services.
The European Community seeks to increase the degree of convergence between
the economies of member states and to ensure a more balanced distribution of
economic activities within the Community. The principal responsibility for
helping depressed areas remains with national authorities but the Community
may complement schemes through aid from a number of sources.

BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The European Regional Development Fund was established in 1975. Its purpose
is to contribute to the correction of the main regional imbalances within the
Community by participating in the development and structural adjustment of
regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining
industrial regions. The Fund's resources are allocated between member states
on the basis of quota ranges; Britain has the second largest quota range. By
December 1984 about £1,620 million had been allocated towards the cost of
industrial and infrastructural projects in the assisted areas and Northern
Ireland. In addition, about £122 million has been allocated to Britain for specific
programmes running over several years to improve the environment and
encourage the development of employment in certain steel, shipbuilding and
textile closure areas and in the border regions of Northern Ireland.
The European Investment Bank (FIB) is a self-governing institution set up by
the Treaty of Rome with member states of the European Community subscrib¬
ing to its capital. The Bank's aims are to help to stimulate development in
less-favoured regions, to modernise or convert industries, to help to create new
activities and to offset structural difficulties affecting certain sectors. The FIB
also serves projects of common interest to several member states or the
Community as a whole. It has loaned about £3,700 million since 1973 for
projects in Britain, mostly for public works such as the Sullom Voe oil terminal,
and manufacturing projects in the assisted areas.
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) makes loans to companies in
the coal and steel industries, and for manufacturing projects which create new
employment opportunities for redundant coal and steel workers. Non-repayable
aid may be available for workers who have been made redundant. The ECSC can
lend up to 50 per cent of the fixed capital costs of a project.
Exchange risk cover may be provided by the Government on certain ECSC loans
for projects qualifying for regional selective assistance. The British borrower
takes on only a sterling liability.
A major feature of the Government’s economic policy is the stimulation of
competition and the control of practices which are restrictive or anti¬
competitive. Linked to this policy is the encouragement of fair trading, with the
particular aim of helping consumers and safeguarding their rights. The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Corporate and Consumer Affairs,
who is answerable to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, has
special responsibilities for competition policy and consumer affairs (although
certain matters, such as safety of foodstuffs and road vehicles, are the con¬
cern of other departments). The Office of Fair Trading, a small govern¬
ment department headed by the Director General of Fair Trading, has
various executive responsibilities relating to competition policy and consumer
protection.
Competition policy is supported by machinery for scrutinising and regulating
monopolies, mergers, anti-competitive practices and restrictive trade practices,
and by powers to regulate any structural changes or anti-competitive practices
which operate against the public interest. The Director General of Fair Trading
administers the Fair Trading Act 1973, which deals with monopolies and
mergers, the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which deals with restrictive
trading agreements, the Resale Prices Act 1976, which deals with minimum

resale price maintenance, and the Competition Act 1980, which deals with
anti-competitive practices.
The Government is working to increase competition in professional services.
It wishes to see an end to restrictive practices, a reduction in charges and a
greater degree of advertising. Measures are being taken to improve competition
in property selling and conveyancing and share-dealing. The opticians’ mono¬
poly on the dispensing of spectacles was ended in 1984, and certain professional
groups (for example, chartered accountants and solicitors) have eased restric¬
tions on advertising by their members. Plans have been announced by the
Government to allow building societies to offer a greater range of services than
they are able to do at present, which will bring a larger degree of competition to
the fields of financial services and estate agency.
The Government believes that most mergers have a ‘market rationale’ and in
most cases does not wish to intervene. However, it recognises the need to control
companies with excessive market shares.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Director General of Fair
Trading can refer monopolies for investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, an independent body made up principally of representatives from
employers, higher education and the trade unions. The legislation defines a
monopoly as a situation where at least a quarter of a particular kind of goods or
service is supplied by or to a single person, or by two or more people acting in a
way which prevents, restricts, or distorts competition. Local monopolies can
also be referred to the Commission, and the Secretary of State can refer public
sector industries. If the Commission finds that a monopoly operates against the
public interest, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has powers to take
action to remedy or prevent the harm which the Commission considers may
exist. Alternatively the Director General may be asked to negotiate undertakings
to remedy the adverse effects identified by the Commission.
Proposals for a merger (defined as occurring when two or more enterprises are
brought under common ownership or control) may be referred to the Commis¬
sion by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, taking account of advice
from the Director General, if the merger would result in or intensify a monopoly
or if the total value of gross assets to be taken over would exceed £30 million. If
the Commission finds that a merger or proposed merger may be expected to
operate against the public interest, the Secretary of State can prevent it from
taking place or obtain undertakings to remedy the adverse effects identified; or,
if it has already taken place, he can require it to be reversed. There are special
provisions for newspaper mergers.
In 1984, following a review of its mergers policy, the Government said that it
would continue to make reference decisions primarily on competition grounds;
and, in evaluating the competitive situation, it would have regard to the
international context—to the extent of competition in the domestic market from
overseas sources and to the competitive position of British firms in overseas
markets.
Subject to limited exemptions, the Director General can investigate any
business practice (whether in the public or private sectors) which may restrict,
distort or prevent competition in the production, supply or acquisition of goods
or services in Britain. If the Director General concludes that a practice is
anti-competitive he may either accept an undertaking from the business
responsible for the practice or, in default of such an undertaking, refer the
matter to the Commission to establish whether it operates against the public
interest. On an adverse finding by the Commission, the Secretary of State has
powers to take remedial action.

The Competition Act empowers the Secretary of State to refer to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission any questions on the efficiency and costs of, the
service provided by, or the possible abuse of a monopoly situation by, various
bodies in the public sector. It is the Government’s intention that at least one
major examination of each industry should take place every four years.
Under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 restrictive trading agreements
have to be registered with the Director General of Fair Trading. Broadly, an
agreement is registrable if two or more parties to it, engaged in business in
Britain in the supply of goods or services, accept some limitation on their
freedom to make their own decisions about matters such as prices or conditions
of sale. Failure to register an agreement means that the restrictions are void and
the parties are liable to legal proceedings. Having placed an agreement oq the
register, the Director General has the duty of referring it to the Restrictive
Practices Court and the Court must declare the restrictions in it contrary to the
public interest unless the parties can satisfy the Court by reference to criteria
laid down in the Act that this is not the case. Restrictions declared contrary to
the public interest are void and the Court can order the parties not to give effect
to them or make any similar agreement. In practice, however, many agreements
do not need to be referred to the Court because, for example, the parties choose
to give up the restrictions rather than go to Court, or the Secretary of State
accepts the Director General’s advice that the restrictions are not significant
enough to warrant reference to the Court.
The objective of the European Community's competition policy is to ensure that
there is free and fair competition in trade between member states and that the
government trade barriers dismantled by the Treaty of Rome are not replaced by
private barriers which fragment the common market. The competition rules are
set out in the Treaty of Rome. These are directly applicable in the law of member
states but their enforcement is the responsibility of the European Commission,
which has powers to investigate and terminate alleged infringements and to
impose fines.
The Treaty prohibits agreements or concerted practices which are likely to
affect trade between member states and have as their object, or effect, the
prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market.
Agreements meeting specified criteria may be exempted from this prohibition
and, subject to particular conditions and safeguards, certain categories of
agreement are exempted completely: these include agreements in respect of
exclusive distribution and purchasing, patent licensing, research and develop¬
ment, and motor vehicle distribution and servicing. The Treaty also prohibits
any abuse of a dominant position within the common market or a substantial
part of it to the extent that it affects trade between member states.
In addition to laws designed to benefit customers by providing effective
competition, there is a body of legislation whose purpose is to ensure that
consumers are adequately protected.
The Fair Trading Act 1973 provides machinery (headed by the Director
General of Fair Trading) for the continuous review of consumer affairs, for
action to deal with trading practices which unfairly affect consumers’ interests
and with persistent offenders under existing law, and for the negotiation of
self-regulatory codes of practice to raise trading standards. The Director General
is also responsible for the working of legislation which regulates consumer
credit and hire business and estate agency work.
The consumer’s interests with regard to the purity of foods, the description
and performance of goods and services and pricing information are safeguarded

by the Food Act 1984, the Medicines Act 1968, the Trade Descriptions Acts 1968
and 1972, the Prices Act 1974, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Sale of
Goods Act 1979 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982. The marking
and accuracy of quantities are regulated by the Weights and Measures Acts 1963
and 1979, the latter introducing a system of average weights for certain
pre-packed goods. The Consumer Protection Acts 1961 and 1971 and the
Consumer Safety Act 1978 empower the Government to control the supply of
most goods in the interests of safety. A White Paper proposing major changes in
the law to prevent unsafe products being marketed was published in 1984. The
Government intends to introduce legislation implementing these proposals and
to clarify the laws prohibiting the displaying of false or misleading price
information.
Advice and information on consumer matters is provided to the general public at
local level by the trading standards or consumer protection departments of local
authorities and in some areas by specialist Consumer Advice Centres. Citizens
Advice Bureaux also provide advice to the public on consumer matters.
The independent, non-statutory National Consumer Council (and associated
councils for Scotland and Wales), which receives government finance, ensures
that the consumer's view is made known to those in government and industry
whose decisions affect the consumer's interest. In Northern Ireland the General
Consumer Council for Northern Ireland (which became fully operational in April
1985) has wide-ranging responsibilities in the field of consumer protection and
consumer affairs in general.
Consumer councils for the energy, rail and other nationalised industries
investigate questions of concern to the consumer, while some trade associations
in industry and commerce have established codes of practice. In addition,
several private organisations work to further consumer interests. The largest is
the Consumers' Association, funded by the subscriptions of its membership of
over 690,000. The Association conducts an extensive programme of comparative
testing of goods and investigation of services; its views and test reports are
published in its monthly magazine Which? and other publications. The
Association provides an advice service on subscription. Local consumer groups,
many belonging to a national federation, also promote consumers' interests and
provide information and advice.
The European Community’s consumer programme covers a number of
important topics, such as health and safety, protection of the consumer’s
economic interests when purchasing goods and services, promotion of con¬
sumer education and strengthening the representation of consumers. The
views of British consumer organisations are represented by the Consumers
in the European Community Group (UK).
The formation and conduct of private sector corporations is regulated by the
Companies Acts. ‘Incorporation’ involves registering an enterprise with an
official registrar of companies, with related obligations such as those concern¬
ing the capital structure of a company, the rights and duties of its directors and
members, and the preparation of accounts. Nearly all corporate businesses are
‘limited liability’ companies, which means that each company is a legal entity
distinct from its members, who are not as such liable for its debts. The
members’ liability is limited to contributing an amount related to their
shareholding. In unincorporated businesses, such as sole proprietorships or
partnerships, by contrast, individuals are personally liable for any business
debts.
Companies may be either public or private. A company must satisfy three
basic conditions before it can be called a public limited company (pic): it must be
232

INDUSTRIAL
AND

PROPERTY
limited by shares or guarantee and have a share capital; it must state in its
memorandum of association that it is to be a public limited company; and it
must meet specified minimum capital requirements. All other registered
companies are, by definition, private companies and, as such, prohibited from
offering their shares to the public.
The consolidation of the Companies Acts 1948—83 has been completed and
came into force in July 1985; it restates existing law in a clearer and more
convenient form, and makes application and interpretation easier for those
concerned with the regulation of company affairs. The consolidation consists of
the Companies Act 1985 and three small associated Acts: the Business Names
Act, which regulates the names under which persons may carry on business in
Great Britain; the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. which restates the
law on insider dealing; and the Companies Consolidation (Consequential
Provisions) Act, which deals with the technical aspects of the consolidation.
Proposals to reform the law on insolvency and to offer greater protection to
investors have been put before Parliament by the Government.
There is a substantial body of legislation designed to secure the rights of the
originators of inventions, new industrial designs and trade marks. These
matters are administered by the Patent Office, which includes the Design
Registry and the Trade Marks Registry, while governmental responsibility is
exercised by the Department of Trade and Industry. Protection is also available
under the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty, and
benefits may be claimed in other countries by virtue of the International
Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. The Government is
reviewing the law on copyright and related matters, with particular attention to
the problems raised by private tape recordings of sound and video copyright
works, the application of copyright to industrial designs, and the use of
photocopying. In February 1985 the Government published a consultative
document in which the problem of unauthorised home taping of audio and video
copyright material is discussed and possible solutions proposed, including the
imposition of a levy on blank tapes. Legislation to extend copyright protection to
owners of computer software was passed in July 1985. The penalties for trading
in pirate sound and film recordings (including video) were greatly increased in
1983.
The Government is concerned to encourage innovation by providing a more
adequate legal and administrative system for the protection of the ownership of
ideas by means of patents, registered designs, trade marks and copyright, and to
improve awareness of the value of these intellectual property rights and of their
accessibility and usage, particularly by individuals and small businesses.
12 Manufacturing
and Service
Industries
The manufacturing and service industries, together with construction, account
for about 85 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Since 1950, GDP has
more than doubled in real terms and both manufacturing and services have
contributed to this growth. As in other developed economies, rising living
standards have led to a faster growth of demand for services than for
I manufactures, so that the proportion of GDP accounted for by services has
increased steadily. About 26 per cent of the employed labour force was engaged
in manufacturing in 1984 (compared with about 40 per cent in 1950) and
around 66 per cent of visible exports consisted of manufactured or semi¬
manufactured goods. In the same year, 65 per cent of the employed labour force
was engaged in service industries, and international trade in services produced
a surplus of £4,000 million. Among traded services, financial and business
services and tourism show the greatest growth.
The statistics in the following sections, relating to the main sectors of
manufacturing industry, are supplied by the Statistical Division of the
Department of Trade and Industry. Unless otherwise stated, export and sales
figures include parts and export figures include re-exports.
Manufacturing
Most manufacturing is carried out by private enterprise. Though the greater
parts of the iron and steel and shipbuilding industries are in public ownership,
the Government is reducing the extent of state ownership of industry. Table 17
shows the size distribution of manufacturing establishments. About 55 per cent
of the largest establishments were in engineering and metals and vehicle
manufacturing. Within the private sector, the 100 largest companies accounted
for 35 per cent of manufacturing employment in 1982. (A company may consist
of one or more establishments.)
The largest manufacturing companies (by £ million turnover in the latest
financial year) are BAT Industries (11,652), Imperial Chemical Industries

(4,381), Ford Motor Company (3,585), BL (3,421), Rothmans International
(3,411) and Associated British Foods (3,376).
The figures in Table 18 show the relative size of the sectors of manufacturing
and their growth rates. Manufacturing output as a whole fell after 1973,
following the rise in international oil prices, but grew again gradually between
1975 and 1979. Following further rises in energy costs, manufacturing output
declined significantly between 1979 and 1981 in almost all of the industrialised
market economies. Additional factors depressing output in Britain were high
domestic interest rates and. for exporters, a rise in the exchange value of sterling
which raised the prices of British goods in overseas markets. Output remained
low in 1982, but rose by 2-9 percent in 1983, and by 3-8 per cent in 1984, partly
due to lower interest rates and a lower exchange value of the pound.
The recovery has been most notable in the chemicals and electrical and
instrument engineering sectors, which are also the sectors which have shown
the highest growth over the last decade. Extensive reorganisation, re-equipment
and modernisation in long-established industries such as steel manufacture,
vehicle-building and shipbuilding have greatly increased productivity. Utilisa¬
tion of advanced technology, especially microelectronics, is steadily increasing
in all sectors. A major stimulus has been provided by the various needs of the
offshore oil and gas industries.
Since manufacturing industry lies mainly in the private sector, investment in
manufacturing tends to be determined by market considerations and to reflect
expectations of profitability. There are discernible cycles in the level of

investment: 1983 saw the beginning of an upturn in the latest trough. Total
direct investment in 1984 was £6,813 million at current prices, comprising
£5,536 million on plant and machinery, £727 million on new building and £551
million on vehicles. In addition, assets worth an estimated £1,088 million were
purchased by financial companies to lease to manufacturers.

Most of the early developments in iron and steel production originated in
Britain, and Britain is the world's tenth largest steel-producing nation (by
volume). The British Steel Corporation (BSC), formed as a public corporation in
1967, has accounted in recent years for 82 to 85 per cent of Britain's crude steel
production by volume and is the world's fourth largest steel company. BSC
invested heavily in modernising its production capacity in the 1960s and 1970s.
The basic oxygen process is now used for bulk steel production with the electric
arc process for more specialised tasks; the traditional open-hearth process
disappeared in 1980. Because of a marked fall in demand for steel, BSC has had
to accelerate the closure of its older steelworks and reduce capacity at other
works. Rationalisation of the industry has involved some transfers of assets
between BSC and the private sector and the closure in both sectors of plants
which cannot be made profitable.
British producers’ deliveries of finished steel were 12-6 million tonnes in
1984, of which 72 per cent was used by home industry, the remainder being
directly exported. The private sector is particularly strong in the manufacture of
alloy and stainless steels and of finished products for the engineering industry.
The industry is concentrated in Wales, northern England and Scotland. As a
member of the European Coal and Steel Community, Britain co-operates with
the other members in efforts to rationalise the structure and improve the
profitability of the steel industry throughout the Community.
Britain has one of the largest non-ferrous metal processing and fabricating
industries in Europe. Output in 1984 included: aluminium (287,000 tonnes of
primary metal and 137,100 tonnes of secondary metal); refined copper (136,800
tonnes of primary metal and 67,000 tonnes of secondary metal); refined lead
(331,000 tonnes of primary metal and 191,000 tonnes of secondary metal); and
zinc (85,600 tonnes of slab metal). Primary metal production relies mainly on
imported ores, concentrates and partially refined metal except in the case of tin,
substantial amounts of which are mined in Cornwall.
Britain is also a major producer of specialised alloys for high technology
requirements in the aerospace, electronic, petrochemical, and nuclear and other

fuel industries. Titanium and titanium alloys are produced and used in aircraft
production, power generation and North Sea oil production. Nearly half of the
industry is situated in the midlands. Europe's largest nickel refinery and only
titanium sponge plant are situated in Wales, near Swansea, West Glamorgan,
and in Deeside respectively. There is a zinc smelter of some 100,000 tonnes
capacity at Avonmouth. Two large-scale aluminium smelters in Lynemouth,
Northumberland, and Anglesey, Gwynedd, provide 75 per cent of Britain's
requirements for primary aluminium. A wide range of semi-manufactures is
produced in copper, lead, zinc and aluminium and their alloys, and, particularly
in aluminium and copper, firms are engaged in smelting, casting and
fabrication by rolling, extrusion and drawing; advanced techniques of powder
metallurgy and pressure die-casting are also employed, which help to conserve
energy and materials. In recent years considerable progress has been made in
the development of‘superplastic' alloys, which are more ductile and elastic than
conventional alloys. Aluminium lithium, a new alloy which is up to 20 per cent
lighter than traditional materials, is currently being developed by a British
company with plans to use it in aircraft construction.
Exports of aluminium and aluminium alloys reached £406 million in 1984
while exports in the same year of copper, brass and other copper alloys reached
£314 million. Exports of silver, platinum and other precious metals totalled over
£735 million in 1984. The major export markets for the whole industry are the
United States and the rest of the European Community.
The manufacture of most building materials is now based on highly mechanised
systems. London Brick PLC supplies about 48 per cent of total brick deliveries.
The cement industry is chiefly concerned with the manufacture of Portland
cement for the home market. This was invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented
in 1824. Three firms dominate the industry, the largest being Blue Circle
Industries.
Glass-reinforced cement composites were invented in Britain in the mid-
1970s and are manufactured under licence in over 40 other countries.
The pottery industry, centred largely in Staffordshire, supplies almost all home
needs for domestic and industrial pottery. It uses largely indigenous clay from
Cornwall and Devon. There has been considerable re-equipment in the industry;
kilns fired by gas or electricity have replaced all the coal-fired kilns, and new
decorating techniques and automatic and semi-automatic machinery, such as
automatic glazing machines, have been introduced. Domestic pottery, including
china, earthenware and stoneware, accounts for 55 per cent of the industry's
output; the other main divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical
ware, and such specialised industrial products as acid-proof stoneware, porous
ceramics and laboratory porcelain. Production of tableware is concentrated in
two major groups, Wedgwood and Royal Doulton. Britain is the world’s principal
manufacturer of fine bone china, much of which is exported; famous makes
include Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton, Minton, Aynsley,
Coalport and Royal Crown Derby. Research is being conducted into ceramics
for use in housebuilding and diesel and jet engines. Important industrial
ceramics invented in Britain include silicon carbides developed by the United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and sialons developed at the University of
Newcastle upon Tyne. Refractory goods include heat-resisting materials such
as magnesite, silica and high-alumina bricks, crucibles, kiln linings and
radiants for gas and electric fires.
Britain's glass industry is one of the biggest in the world and all types of glass
product are made. Glass containers form the largest part of the industry;

another major section is devoted to the manufacture of flat glass in its various
forms, chiefly by the float glass process developed in Britain by Pilkington
Brothers and licensed to glassmakers throughout the world. Pilkingtons have
also developed an energy-saving window glass which reflects room heat without
impairing visibility. There is also a craft sector producing high-quality
handmade lead crystal glass.

’ Sales of principal products.
The chemicals industry is one of the most successful industries in Britain as
well as being its fifth largest industrial sector, accounting for about 10 per cent
of manufacturing net output. It produces a complete range of products
including basic industrial chemicals (inorganic chemicals, basic organic
chemicals, plastics, fertilisers and other products), pharmaceuticals, soap,
toiletries and explosives. The industry is also the third largest in Europe and its
exports of £8,233 million in 1984 (accounting for 16 per cent of British
manufacturing exports) placed Britain among the top five chemicals exporting
nations. Western Europe is the major export market, and organic chemicals,
plastics and pharmaceuticals account for more than 50 per cent of chemical
exports by value. The areas of highest growth between 1984 and 1985 were
formulated pesticides, synthetic resins and plastics, dyestuffs and pigments,
organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals.
The largest British chemicals group. Imperial Chemical Industries, is the fifth
largest chemicals company in the world, accounting for around 30 per cent of
production in Britain. Exports account for 50 per cent of its production. The
industry is represented by the Chemical Industries Association.
A high proportion of inorganic chemicals production consists of relatively
simple bulk chemicals, such as sulphuric acid and metallic and non-metallic
oxides, serving as basic materials for industry. The most important products in
the organic chemicals range (by weight) are ethylene (1,325,000 tonnes
produced in 1984), propylene (975,000 tonnes) and benzene (806,000 tonnes).
Outside the inorganic and organic sectors is a wide range of general chemicals
formulated for specific uses.
Many of the basic discoveries in plastics, including polyethylene, were made in
Britain. Over 30 per cent of production is exported. Expansion in recent years
has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of which the most important are
polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—notably for foodstuffs), poly¬
vinyl chloride (known as PVC and used for a wide range of industrial purposes
and consumer goods), polystyrene (used for toys, light mouldings and many
consumer goods) and polypropylene (which can be fabricated as mouldings,

films and fibres). A new group of plastics materials reinforced with carbon fibres
is also in commercial production: they have up to three times the strength but
are only 20 per cent of the weight of steel, and are being increasingly used in, for
example, vehicle manufacture. Styrene-butadiene and polybutadiene rubbers
used for tyres, high-styrene rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile
rubbers for use where oil resistance is required are also in large-scale
production, together with neoprene rubber.
British companies also produce large quantities of coextruded oriented
polypropylene which is used in packaging food and other consumer products
and which is increasingly replacing cellulose films on grounds of versatility and
cost. ICI is among the world’s top three producers of polyethylene terephthalate,
a new form of polyester used to produce plastic bottles.
The industry produces a wide range of decorative and industrial paints and
varnishes. Specialised products include new ranges of synthetic resins and
pigments, powder coatings, non-drip and quick-drying paints and paints
needing only one top coat. Two significant recent innovations have been solid
emulsion paint and pure urethane paint which was developed for use on
offshore oil platforms and is now being used to protect concrete buildings
against corrosion due to weather and pollution. The industry has set a timetable
for eliminating lead as a drier in paints and is conducting research to find
effective replacements.
Notable recent British discoveries and developments include pyrethroid insecti¬
cides, Id's diquat and paraquat herbicides, and systemic fungicides and
aphicides. The development of chemical fertilisers also owes much to the pioneer
work of British scientists. Manufacture of chemical fertilisers, particularly
ammonium nitrate, is dominated by a few large firms producing almost entirely
for the domestic market. A substantial proportion of world research and
development in agrochemicals is conducted in Britain.
British scientists have played a major part in the development of essential drugs
and medicinal products, and about 12 per cent of the world’s research in
pharmaceuticals takes place in Britain. Britain is the world's fourth largest
exporter of pharmaceutical products. Among the more recent major develop¬
ments pioneered in Britain have been: the introduction of new semi-synthetic
penicillins; the development of salbutamol, sodium cromoglycate and inhaled
beclomethasone dipropionate, which have revolutionised the treatment of
asthma; ibuprofen, an important advance in the treatment of arthritis;
cimetidine and ranitidine, which have profoundly affected the treatment of
duodenal ulceration; humulin, an insulin developed from human beings; and
beta-blockers, used in the treatment of heart disease. Britain is among the world
leaders in the production of antibiotics by fermentation.
The British company, Celltech, which exploits research done by the Medical
Research Council, is a leader in the commercial production of monoclonal
antibodies, which are used as raw materials for other products and in the
purification of alpha-interferon and blood-typing products. The company is also
working on a range of other products such as tissue plasminogen activator,
which dissolves fibrin and can be used in the prevention of heart attacks and
strokes: calcitonin, which may be useful in beating osteoporosis (brittle bones)
and macrophage activating factor, which enhances the activity of the body’s
immune system. A range of immunoradiometric assays for specific biochemicals
is also under development in Britain.
Britain is foremost among the world's developers of molecular graphics, a
computer-aided technique for studying the structure of complicated organic

molecules on a visual display unit, eliminating the need for many physical tests
of drugs.
The industry is made up of British and many international companies which
often have manufacturing facilities in Britain. There are large companies in the
sector, sometimes with interests in the pharmaceutical, soap or detergent
industries, and also a number of small independent companies. Exports of the
industry’s products in 1984 were £295 million, more than double the level of
imports. The home market amounted to about £930 million at manufacturers’
prices.
Many specialised chemical products are manufactured, including dyestuffs,
formulated adhesives and sealants, chemically treated oils and fats, essential
oils and flavouring materials, explosives, industrial gases, products for the
treatment of leather and textiles, adhesive film, cloth and foil, and surfactants
(surface-active agents) for many purposes. There is also major production of
soaps and detergents. Work is progressing on the use of epoxy and anaerobic
adhesives and cyanoacrylates in engineering as replacements for spot-welding
and riveting, especially in the motor industry.
Britain played a major role in the early development of man-made fibres and
continues to be an important producer of these fibres, mainly through a small
number of large companies. The main types of fibre are still those first
developed—regenerated cellulosic fibres such as viscose rayon, and the major
synthetic fibres such as nylon polyamide, polyester (a British invention) and
acrylics. Extensive research continues to produce a wide variety of innovative
products with characteristics designed to meet market needs, such as anti¬
static and flame-retardant fibres. Polyolefins (polypropylene and polyethylene)
now find significant use in carpets, carpet backing and other household textiles.
More specialist products include the aramids (with very high thermal stability
and strength), elastanes (giving very high stretch and recovery), melded fabrics
(produced without the need for knitting or weaving) and carbon fibres (originally
developed for the aerospace industry but now finding numerous wider
applications).

The mechanical engineering sector comprises industries manufacturing all
types of non-electrical machinery, machine tools, industrial engines, mechani¬
cal handling equipment, construction equipment and industrial plant. Since
much of the production of the industry is of capital equipment, it suffered
particularly during the recession which began in 1979. Output dropped
substantially between 1979 and 1981 and has remained at about the same level
since then. In 1984, however, there was a recovery of output in some sectors of
the industry, notably metal-working machine tools, weighing machines, and
power tools and engineers' small tools. Over 40 per cent of the industry's sales
are exported, and exports in 1984 amounted to 11 per cent of all visible exports.
The industry manufactures almost every type of industrial (including process)
plant and steelwork. Of particular importance are fabricated products such as
pressure vessels, heat exchangers and storage tanks for chemical and oil¬
refining (process) plant, steam-raising boilers (including those of high capacity
for power stations), nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment plant and
fabricated steelwork for bridges, buildings and industrial installations. The
industrial plant industry comprises both equipment manufacturers and
contractors responsible for the design, engineering, construction and commis¬
sioning of complete plants for process industries. Equipment for the chemicals
and related industries, such as processing, bottling and packeting machines as
well as mixing equipment and furnaces, ovens and kilns, is also produced.
Britain is one of the world's largest producers of tractors, which make up
three-quarters of output of agricultural equipment. There was a substantial
downturn in the world tractor market between 1976 and 1983 which resulted in
a 50 per cent fall in production in Britain over this period. However, output grew
from 91,464 units in 1983 to 102,762 units in 1984. The industry also produces
a wide range of other general and specialised agricultural equipment such as
fruit, vegetable and root harvesters. Britain’s total output of agricultural
machinery and tractors in 1984 was £1,270 million, of which 67 per cent was
exported, with a trade surplus of £290 million.
The industry's products are shown at the Royal Smithfield Show and
Agricultural Machinery Exhibition, a large-scale annual exhibition held in
London in December. The annual Royal International Agricultural Show is held
in July at the National Agricultural Centre, which also provides regular
demonstrations of technical developments in agriculture. Much of the new
machinery is designed for use in a variety of conditions to meet the needs of
overseas farmers, and in 1984, for the first time, the Royal Agricultural Show
had a specialised tropical machinery centre, where demonstrations of such
machinery were given.
Britain was the birthplace of the machine tools industry and provides a very
wide range of machine tools. Almost all of those produced are purchased by the
engineering, vehicles and metal goods industries. As these sectors are among
those most affected by the recession in world manufacturing, production of
machine tools has also contracted, although new orders increased substantially
in 1984.
The most commonly used metal-cutting machine tools are milling, grinding
and turning machines. The manufacture of computerised numerically con¬
trolled machine tools and the adoption of flexible manufacturing systems are
becoming increasingly important. It is estimated that 50 per cent more robots
were installed in Britain in 1984 than in 1983 and British manufacturers
supplied much of the requirement for new machines. The United States was
again the largest export market for the industry in 1984 (£59-8 million). The

next were the Federal Republic of Germany (£207 million), France (£11-4
million) and the Soviet Union (£10-6 million). The Machine Tool Trades
Association represents most of the industry and is responsible for the
international machine tools exhibition held in Britain every four years, the next
in 1988.
British inventions have remained the foundation of many textile processes in
use internationally and progress has been made in applying automated
techniques (including the use of microelectronics) in the industry. In 1984,
some 70 per cent of the industry’s total sales were to export markets. Recent
innovations in Britain include computerised colour matching and weave
simulation.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is
produced, including excavating, earth-moving and road-making equipment,
pile-drivers, and quarry crushing and screening plant. Overseas sales of con¬
struction equipment and mining machinery and equipment are substantial.
The British mining equipment industry is very strong, especially in the
production of shearing equipment, hydraulic roof supports, conveying equip¬
ment, flameproof transformers, switchgear and subsurface transport control
systems. A conveyor belt for a new lignite mine being developed in Texas will be
constructed by a British company and will be the longest conveyor in the
Americas and the longest conveyor with horizontal curves anywhere in the
world. About 85 per cent of British coal is mined using the longwall method,
which was developed in Britain. British manufacturers are the leaders in the
production of equipment for this type of mining, and exports in 1984
approached £200 million.
Mechanical handling equipment is used not only for construction and related
activities but throughout industry generally. It extends from individual units
and accessories to complete operating systems, the main products being cranes
and transporters, lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators, hoists and powered
industrial trucks. Electronically controlled and completely automatic handling
systems are also produced.
Britain is also an important producer of other machinery such as industrial
engines, pumps, valves and compressors, and pneumatic and hydraulic
equipment.
The castings industry plays an important role in meeting the needs of
manufacturers for essential components for products sold both in Britain and
abroad. Its main customers are the vehicle, mechanical engineering, and
building and construction industries. The larger mechanised foundries are
dominant, but many smaller craft foundries meet needs for specialised and
low-volume castings. Output (by volume) has been falling and the industry has
been progressively changing. While some foundries have been closing, many
others have been investing in new melting equipment, moulding equipment and
processes, and process and quality control equipment, both to meet demands
for castings of higher quality and strength and to improve working and
environmental conditions. A wide range of metal tools, utensils, containers and
fittings is also produced.
This industry produces a wide range of goods which need an exceptional degree
of precision in their manufacture. Non-electrical measuring equipment forms
an important part of output. Other sectors of the industry include photographic,
cinematographic and reprographic equipment; watches, clocks and time
recorders; and medical and surgical instruments and appliances. Important
advances have been made in the application of recent developments in
mechanical and electronic engineering to production and quality control.

This group of industries suffered much less than other manufacturing
industries as a result of the world-wide recession of the early 1980s. Output fell
slightly from 1980 to 1981, but began to recover in 1982 and grew steadily in
1983 and 1984. The outstanding sector has been the electronic data-processing
equipment sector, whose output more than doubled between 1980 and 1984.
Britain produces a wide range of both capital and consumer electrical and
electronic goods. Advances in microelectronics have meant that the borderlines
between office machinery, data-processing equipment, telecommunications
equipment and consumer electronic equipment are becoming ever harder to
define. Britain is in the forefront of these developments, having originated many
of the breakthroughs in the area.
The computer sector, which has grown strongly over the past five years,
produces an extensive range of computer systems, central processors and
peripheral equipment, from large computers for large-scale data-processing and
scientific work to mini- and microcomputers for use in control and automation
systems and for home, educational and office use. The number of innovative
companies in the sector, both in hardware and software, is very large. There are
about 300 such companies of all sizes in ‘Silicon Glen' in Scotland and a similar
number of mainly small firms in the Cambridge area. Sinclair Research is
recognised internationally as a pioneer of home computing. The company has
been involved in many advances in this field, the most recent of which has been
the first use of a 32-bit microchip in a home computer, making this machine
more powerful than most microcomputers designed for office use.
Companies are constantly developing applications for new technology in the
office. In 1984 ICL, the major British computer manufacturer, introduced a
product known as the One-per-desk’ which combines a personal computer,
business software and an advanced push-button telephone in one unit. The
company claims a world lead in this type of product. The equipment incor¬
porates microdrives which were developed in co-operation with Sinclair
Research. Major new mainframe computers, the Series 39 range, were intro¬
duced in 1985.

The office machinery industry produces microfilm readers/printers, duplicators,

British companies are strongly involved in the development of electronic
revenue control equipment, including electronic funds transfer and point of sale
equipment. British-made computerised ticketing equipment is being installed
throughout British Rail's network; this is the world’s largest order to date for
revenue control equipment. Recent export orders include one for integrated
store systems for a group of 139 retail stores across the United States. The stores
will have point of sale terminals, information displays, printers and mini¬
computers and will be linked by a national network, giving management instant
access to information on the whole business.
The dependence of the telecommunications industry on electronic techniques is
increasing as new switching systems are introduced. The main products are
switching and transmission equipment, telephones and terminals for telex,
facsimile and teletex. British Telecom (BT) is the main customer for network
equipment and carries out research and development work in co-operation with
suppliers. Mercury Communication has been licensed to compete with BT in the
provision of network services, while the market for terminals and telephones has
been fully liberalised. Innovative work is being particularly stimulated by the
expansion of cable television and the growth in value added network services.
In 1984, two cellular radio networks began operation. These provide
sophisticated telephone services on portable telephones, and a number of
British companies are engaged in producing equipment for use with these
networks.
One important sector of the industry produces transmission equipment and
cables for telecommunications networks and other purposes: its products
include submarine cables and cables insulated by a wide variety of materials.
The feasibility of using optical fibres (hair-thin strands of glass) in communica¬
tions was first demonstrated in Britain in 1966: they have a much higher
capacity and better durability and efficiency than copper cables. Britain now has
an advanced production capacity in this field. Well over half of the world's
underseas communications cables have been made and laid by one British
company, STC. Hitherto these have been copper cables, but the company is
currently participating in laying the first optical fibre cable between Britain and
the United States.
Another expanding sector of the industry is that which covers the manufac¬
ture of radio communications equipment, radar, radio and sonar navigational
aids for ships and aircraft, thermal imaging systems, alarms and signalling
equipment, public broadcasting equipment and other capital goods. British
equipment is used extensively overseas, for defence, aviation, shipping, health
and educational purposes.
This sector produces a range of electrical and electronic measurement and test
equipment as well as analytical instruments. Production of process control
equipment is a large and expanding area along with the manufacture of
numerical control and indication equipment for use in machine tools.
British companies are leading many developments in advanced electronic
medical equipment. The development of computerised tomography (CT) scan¬
ners in Britain in the 1960s and early 1970s was an important advance in
medical diagnosis. A CT scanner uses a computer to integrate the results
produced by a number of X-ray sources and produce images of sections of the
body or brain of living subjects. Britain is also a pioneer of nuclear magnetic

resonance scanners, which are safer than CT scanners since they do not use
X-rays and have greater potential. British companies also produce other
advanced equipment such as ultrasound scanners and medical equipment
involving lasers.
The components sector manufactures a wide range of both active and passive
electronic components. The comprehensive indigenous industry is sup¬
plemented by subsidiaries of a number of large overseas companies. The sector
meets most domestic requirements and is also very active in international trade.
The manufacture of integrated circuits is an area of particularly rapid change.
Britain has strength in the manufacture of advanced components, especially in
semi-custom devices such as uncommitted logic arrays, and novel micro¬
processors, for example, advanced 32-bit microchips for parallel processing.
The main products of this very important sector are power equipment
(generators, turbines, motors, converters, transformers and rectifiers) and
switchgear, starting and control gear. Electrical equipment for cycles, motor
vehicles and aircraft as well as other electrical equipment for industrial use are
also produced.
All types of electrical and electronic consumer goods are produced in Britain.
The white goods sector' produces domestic appliances such as heating and
cooking equipment, washing machines and driers, refrigeration appliances,
vacuum cleaners, irons and electric kettles. This sector is dominated by a few
large firms.
The major electronic goods produced are radio and television sets, music
centres and high-fidelity audio and video equipment. In the audio field, British
manufacturers have a reputation for high-quality goods but are less strong in
the mass market. Equipment is also manufactured for reception of Britain's
Prestel' and teletext services.

The motor vehicle industry manufactures cars and commercial vehicles,
caravans and trailers, and parts and components. Output of cars and
commercial vehicles is dominated by four groups which account for 96 per cent
of car production and some 98 per cent of commercial vehicle output: BL, in
which there is a majority public shareholding, Ford, Vauxhall and Talbot
(formerly Chrysler UK). The remainder is in the hands of smaller, specialist
producers of cars, heavy commercial vehicles, buses and coaches. The BL board

of management is working in agreement with the Government for the return of
the company, as a whole or in parts, to the private sector. Jaguar, a luxury car
manufacturer and formerly part of the BL group, was privatised in 1984.
In recent years the home market has been increasingly supplied by imports,
mainly from other European countries and Japan, but British manufacturers
are responding strongly to the competition, and the industry remains one of the
major export sectors. The Japanese manufacturer, Nissan, is to open a car
assembly plant in Britain in 1986, while Austin Rover, BL's volume car division,
has reached agreement with Honda of Japan on the production of an executive
car to be built in both Japan and Britain and on other joint projects. In 1984
there was a marked increase in the number of diesel-engined cars sold in
Britain; however, the total represented less than 3 per cent of new car
registrations during that year. The principal trade associations for the industry
are the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and, on the retail side, the
Motor Agents Association. Motor industry shows are held annually at the
National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, and in London in alternate years.
The motor-cycle industry has contracted over the last two decades and the
domestic market is largely supplied by imports. On the other hand, the market
for pedal cycles has increased significantly and is mainly supplied by British
firms, the largest of which is TI Raleigh.
British Rail obtains most of its locomotives and rolling stock from its wholly
owned subsidiary British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL). Since early 1985 all
locomotive and powered rolling-stock orders have been put out to open tender.
BREL also exports equipment, and British Rail provides consultancy services in
many overseas countries. The large private sector supplies a full range of
equipment, including diesel engines, transmission systems, electric traction
and control gear, signalling, heating and ventilating systems, and track
equipment to British Rail; it also builds trains for London Regional Transport
and rapid transit networks. All this equipment is also sold to overseas railway
and rapid transit authorities. In addition, the private sector undertakes
electrification and other major works abroad and provides overseas consul¬
tancy services.
Britain's aerospace industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive in the
Western world. The products of the industry include civil and military aircraft,
helicopters, aero-engines, guided weapons, hovercraft and space satellites,
supported by a comprehensive range of aircraft and airfield equipment and
systems.
The main British airframe manufacturer is British Aerospace (BAe), which is
privately owned. In May 1985 the Government disposed of its residual ordinary
shareholding in the company, but retained a special share which ensures that,
without government consent, no change can be made to those of BAe’s articles of
association which restrict foreign ownership of shares and require the directors
to be British nationals.
The major publicly owned companies are Rolls-Royce and Short Brothers.
Rolls-Royce is responsible for almost the entire output of aero-engines in
Britain; it is one of the world’s three leading aero-engine manufacturers and
over 10,000 of the world’s civil and military aircraft are powered by Rolls-Royce
engines.
Production of BAe includes such civil aircraft as the BAe748 feederliner and
the BAe 125 business jet, the BAe 146 family of passenger airliners and the
Jetstream 31 executive commuter aircraft. The company is in the process of
developing an advanced turboprop airliner, a highly fuel-efficient aircraft aimed
at the regional airline market. BAe is a full partner in the European consortium
246
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Airbus Industrie; it manufactures the wings for the A300 Airbus and designs
and manufactures the wings for the A310 derivatives and for the forthcoming
150-seat A320 Airbus. Military aircraft include the unique Harrier vertical/short
take-off and landing aircraft, the Hawk advanced trainer, the Anglo-French
Jaguar tactical fighter/operational trainer and the Tornado multi-role combat
aircraft, a collaborative venture involving Britain, the Federal Republic of
Germany and Italy.
BAe is also a major producer of guided weapons including the Rapier
ground-to-air missile. Collaborative guided weapon projects between Britain
and its NATO partners are becoming increasingly important.
Short Brothers, which is based in Belfast, produces the Skyvan transporter,
the SD330 and 360 commuter airliners, airframe components and missiles. In
March 1985 the company was awarded a contract to supply a new basic trainer
aircraft, the Tucano, to the Royal Air Force. In addition to performing a wide
range of aerospace equipment work, Westland Helicopters manufactures the Sea
King and Lynx military helicopters and in 1982 introduced the W30 helicopter
for civil offshore and commuter, as well as military, uses. The development of the
E101 multi-role helicopter is being undertaken by Westland in collaboration
with the Italian company Giovanni Agusta.
Rolls-Royce aero-engines in production include the collaboratively produced
RBI99 for the Tornado, the RB211 civil engine and its more powerful derivative
the RB211-524, the Pegasus vectored-thrust engine for the Harrier and the Gem
helicopter engine. The company is a participant in the V2500 project (an engine
being developed by the International Aero Engine Company, a five-nation
consortium, to power 150-passenger airliners) and is developing a new
helicopter engine, the RTM322, in partnership with Turbomeca of France.
Rolls-Royce has an agreement with General Electric of the United States on
mutual participation in the high technology developments of their respective
commercial engines. Industrial versions of Rolls-Royce aero-engines are being
produced for use in oil and gas transmission and as stand-by power generators,
while marine versions are used to power a new generation of warships.
Aviation equipment manufacturers provide a wide range of systems essential
to engines and aircraft, including engine and flight controls, electrical genera¬
tion, mechanical and hydraulic power systems, cabin furnishings, flight decks
and information displays. They also supply radar and air traffic control
equipment, ground power supplies and flight simulators, to airports and
airlines throughout the world.
Britain was one of the first countries to develop space science and technology
and remains one of the few countries that has both built and launched its own
satellites. While retaining an involvement in space transportation systems,
particularly through Ferranti's production of the inertial guidance system for
the European rocket, Ariane, the space industry’s major strength is now in the
manufacture of satellites. BAe has been prime contractor for all the telecom¬
munications satellite projects of the European Space Agency, including the
Orbital Test Satellite launched in 1978 and still in operation; the maritime
series of communications satellites (MARECS) now in service with the Interna¬
tional Maritime Satellite Organisation (INMARSAT); the series of five European
Communications Satellites for EUTELSAT (the European telecommunications
satellite authority); and the large multi-mission satellite, Olympus, to be
launched in 1987, equipped with experimental direct-broadcasting-by-satellite
channels, an advanced on-board switched multi-beam business services payload
by Marconi Defence Systems (MDS) and an experimental payload to explore new
frequencies for commercial services. Internationally, BAe has a major role—
larger than that of any company outside the United States—in the latest series of
INTELSAT-6 global telecommunications satellites now being built for the
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
247
Shipbuilding
and Marine
Engineering
International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation, and it is leading the
team which will supply between three and nine satellites for INMARSAT'S second
generation system commencing in 1988. BAe has also developed and built some
17 space pallets (payload and instrument carriers) for the United States Space
Shuttle; the pallets can fly either as part of Europe's Spacelab or independently.
MDS has a full satellite-priming capability, having primed many telecom¬
munications satellite payloads, including those for the maritime communica¬
tions satellites; it is also a world-wide supplier of satellite sub-systems. Currently
the company is leading the payload development for Europe's advanced remote
sensing satellite, ERS-1, investigating oceans and coastal regions, as well as
that for Britain's own Skynet-IV defence communications satellites, to be
launched in 1986. On the latter project MDS is in a joint partnership with BAe.
The space industry continues to contribute to the ESA’s scientific satellites
through BAe's prime contractorship for the Giotto satellite which will investi¬
gate Halley’s Comet in 1986. British firms will be leading the development of the
man-tended platforms which will form part of the ESA's Columbus programme,
expected to be operational from 1994. Britain's space industry capabilities also
extend to the design and manufacture of all types of satellite ground stations to
meet the requirements of British Telecom and for business and data com¬
munications and television distribution. British firms also built the later
scientific satellites in the Ariel series and manufacture all types of ground
stations both to meet the requirements of British Telecom and for business and
data communications and television transmission.
The aerospace industry carries out an extensive programme of research and
development on airframes, aero-engines and equipment, including avionics,
while considerable research is also undertaken by universities and government
research establishments. As a result of research carried out in Britain and
elsewhere, the industry is now able to make extensive use of lightweight carbon
fibre composites (as alternatives to traditional metals) and of advanced digital
cockpit controls and computer-controlled electronic signalling. It is also
expecting to use aluminium lithium to replace more conventional metals.
Aerospace production and exports, which are fairly evenly divided between
aircraft, engines and equipment (including avionics), have made considerable
progress over the past few years and now stand at record levels.
The main trade association for the industry is the Society of British Aerospace
Companies, which organises a major international air show at Farnborough,
Hampshire, every two years (the next is in 1986).
Britain has a long-established tradition of shipbuilding and remains active in
the construction, conversion and repair of merchant vessels, warships and
offshore structures. In 1984 British shipbuilding companies accounted for
nearly 2 per cent of total world completions; over 40 per cent of output was for
overseas registration. Most of the major British shipyards have been reorganised
in recent years, with the construction, in several cases, of covered-berth ship
factories which are among the most advanced and efficient in the world.
The public sector, which comprises British Shipbuilders and the Belfast
company of Harland and Wolff, accounted for some 85 per cent of British
merchant shipbuilding in 1984 and for all slow-speed marine diesel engines.
Because of world-wide over-capacity in the general shipbuilding sector, British
Shipbuilders is now moving into more specialist areas including ferries and
offshore support vessels of various kinds. Production is being modernised
through computer-aided design and manufacture and the development of the
modular approach to shipbuilding, which involves the building up of vessels
from major sub-assemblies that are supplied already fitted with pipework and
electrical and other systems.
248
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The building of warships and other associated craft—both for the Royal Navy
and for export—is a key area of shipbuilding in Britain. In line with government
policy, British Shipbuilders' warship building yards are being transferred to the
private sector, along with general marine engineering work and ship repairing
activities. The Royal Dockyards at Rosyth and Devonport, which refit ships of
the Royal Navy, are to be leased to commercial management by April 1987.
The private sector plays an important role in the construction and repair of
smaller vessels. Numerous yards specialise in the construction and repair of
tugs, purpose-built coasting and short-sea cargo vessels, smaller product
tankers, fishing boats, and other small craft required to meet the needs of the
armed forces, harbour and pilotage authorities and the leisure market.
The private sector also provides the offshore oil and gas industry with
consultancy services (including advice on exploiting hydrocarbons under
difficult conditions) and has modern and well-equipped construction facilities
able to build all types of fixed platforms and semi-submersible units for drilling,
production and emergency/maintenance support, drillships, jack-up rigs,
modules and offshore loading systems. The world’s first manned submersible
made largely of glass-reinforced plastics was built by a British company, and a
wide range of submersible and other operational equipment is marketed.
Conventional yards within British Shipbuilders can also supply both traditional
and specialised support vessels.

Britain has one of the world's largest and most sophisticated food processing
industries, and processed foods have accounted for a growing proportion of total
domestic demand for food in recent decades, though the rate of growth has
slowed since the early 1970s. Convenience foods, particularly certain frozen
foods, yoghurts and instant snacks, have formed the fastest-growing sector. The
market is also growing in foods for consumers concerned about the effects of

their diet on their health and weight. A high rate of innovation applies to
processed foods, largely owing to the need to increase sales in a food market
which is not growing in size, given a nearly static population. While Britain is a
net importer of foodstuffs, the level of imports declined between 1970 and 1980,
though it has since risen somewhat. The most marked reductions in imports
have been in dairy, meat, fish, fruit and vegetable products, and oils and fats.
Exports, mainly within the European Community, have grown steadily. Basic
research is being conducted into yeasts and new sources of protein. Ranks Hovis
McDougall and ICI have agreed on a joint biotechnology venture to produce on a
large-scale myco-protein, a natural micro-fungus which converts carbohydrates
to high-grade protein; the product will be used to make, among other things,
meat, poultry and fish substitutes.
‘Food from Britain' is the co-ordinating body for the agriculture and food
industries with a wide remit to encourage better marketing and improve the
quality of British food products in Britain and overseas; in 1985 it launched a
quality assurance scheme based on a 'foodmark' guarantee of quality.
The industry uses about one-quarter of Britain's pigmeat in the production of
cured bacon and ham, and one-third is processed into sausages, pies, canned
hams, pates and similar products. Other meat products include canned and
preserved meat, meat extracts and pastes and meat used to prepare other
foodstuffs. A wide range of fish, including shellfish, is processed by freezing,
canning, smoking or coating in batter or breadcrumbs. Products include fish
portions, complete fish meals, smoked fish and spreads.
Production of milk was some 15,568 million litres in 1984. of which just under
half was for sale as liquid milk. Nine out of ten households in Britain receive
pasteurised milk in bottles through a daily door-step delivery system employing
about 40,000 roundsmen (not included in the employment figure in the table)
driving electric vehicles. There are 633 establishments buying and heat-treating
milk for liquid sales. Domestic milk consumption per head (107 litres in 1984) is
among the highest in the world.
The main milk products are butter (207,000 tonnes produced in 1984), cheese
(240,000 tonnes), cream (65,000 tonnes), full-cream condensed milk (163,000
tonnes), full-cream milk powder (40,000 tonnes) and skimmed milk powder
(271,000 tonnes). The dairy industry accounted for 62 per cent of new butter
supplies to the British market in 1984, 67 per cent of new cheese supplies, and
nearly all of other milk products. Production of butter and cheese has increased
significantly in recent years: butter exports in 1984 were 25,000 tonnes and
cheese exports 30,000 tonnes, compared with 16,000 tonnes and 10,700 tonnes
respectively in 1976. The other main exports are skimmed milk powder
(186,000 tonnes in 1984) and whole milk powder (35,000 tonnes). The
industry's interests are represented by the Dairy Trade Federation.
Fruit and vegetable products include canned, frozen, crystallised and dried fruit
and vegetables, prepared nuts, pectin, jam, marmalade, pickles and sauces.
Other products of the food processing industry include sugar, sugar prepara¬
tions and honey, egg-based products, oils and fats, coffee, cocoa, tea and spices,
and cereal preparations. The oils and fats industry comprises a small number of
seed-crushing companies (producing about 383,000 tonnes of crude oil a year)
and several refiners, with a combined output of some 938,000 tonnes of refined
oils and fats. These products are used for a number of purposes including food
manufacturing, animal feeding stuffs, soap and paints.
About 60 per cent of bread in Britain is manufactured in large mechanised
bakeries, most of which use a process (the ‘Chorleywood' process) developed by
the industry's principal research organisation, the Flour Milling and Baking
250
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

Beverages
Tobacco
Research Association, and now widely used in other countries. Two groups are
predominant: Associated British Foods and Ranks Hovis McDougall. There is a
growing consumer interest, however, in locally baked varieties, production of
which is usually allied to the production of cakes and other flour confectionery.
In recent years demand tor wholemeal bread has grown considerably. Biscuits
and related products are a major sector of the industry and have gained a
world-wide reputation. Another sector is grain milling and the production of
various specialised flours and meal.
The cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry is composed of a small
number of very large manufacturers and many medium-sized and small
companies. The three main manufacturers are Rowntree Mackintosh. Cadbury
Schweppes and Mars. Britain has a large share of world trade in chocolate and
sugar confectionery.
Of prime importance among the alcoholic beverages produced in Britain, and in
the food and drink industry as a whole, is Scotch whisky. There are about 100
distilleries in Scotland and the well-known brands of blended Scotch whisky are
made from the products of a number of different distilleries. The Distillers
Company accounts for about a half of Scotch whisky output. Over 80 per cent of
all Scotch whisky produced is exported. The principal overseas markets are the
United States (which takes nearly a third of whisky exports from Britain), the
rest of the European Community and Japan. Production of gin in Britain rose
steadily from the early 1950s until 1980; some of the larger manufacturers own
distilleries overseas. Production of vodka in Britain also increased in the 1970s.
In the brewing and malting industry there are six major brewery groups whose
products are sold nationally, and about 70 smaller enterprises who mainly
supply locally or regionally. In addition, there are a number of small independent
brewers, many producing traditional cask-conditioned ales, for which there has
been a growing demand in the last decade. Firms have introduced new
production methods, including continuous brewing processes, and automated
batch production plants are well established. The main raw materials used are
malt, hops and some sugar. British malt, which is made almost entirely from
home-grown barley, is used by brewers throughout the world. Lager has
increased steadily in popularity since the late 1960s and accounts for over
one-third of beer sales.
Cider, perry and wine producers form the smallest sector of the drinks
industry and are located mostly in southern and south-western England. Cider
consumption has risen sharply since 1980.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade. There are
some very large companies among about 20 producing brands which are
marketed on a national scale, while other companies supply regional markets.
There is some specialisation among firms in the production of various types,
such as carbonated drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes and cordials, ‘mixers',
fruit juices and health drinks.
The British tobacco industry manufactures 80 per cent of cigarettes and tobacco
goods sold in Britain. Over 90 per cent of output is provided by four major
manufacturers (the Imperial Group, Gallaher, Carreras Rothmans and British
American Tobacco). The industry specialises in the production of high-quality
cigarettes made Irom flue-cured tobacco and achieves significant exports,
mainly of cigarettes—countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are
important markets. Britain's most important source of raw tobacco is the
United States followed by Brazil, Zimbabwe, India and Canada. By voluntary
agreement with the Government, cigarette manufacturers restrict their adver-

b Sales of principal products.
Despite its contraction over a number of years, this is still a large group of
related industries, employing 500,000 people and making substantial exports.
Its main products are yarn, woven and knitted fabrics, apparel, household
textiles and carpets based mainly on wool, cotton and man-made fibres. The
textiles industry is made up of a few large companies, which are multi-process,
and a large number of small and medium-sized firms.
The textiles and clothing industries in Britain, as in other developed
countries, have been affected by low-cost imports from developing countries.
Trade in textiles and clothing is regulated by the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA)
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The MFA allows a measure of
restraint on imports of textiles and clothing from low-cost countries into
industrialised countries; the present MFA is due to expire in 1986. The use of
computers and robots and other automated techniques in production processes
is helping the textiles, footwear and clothing industries to compete against
low-cost countries.
In 1984 exports of tops (combed wool and hair), yarns, fabrics and other wool
textile products exceeded imports by about 35 per cent. The industry is one of
the largest in the world and includes the world's biggest wool textile company,
Illingworth, Morris. There are two main branches, woollen and worsted. An
increasing amount of man-made fibre is now blended with wool. West Yorkshire
is the main producing area but Scotland and the west of England are also
famous as specialised producers of high-quality yarn and cloth. Large quantities
of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain in preparation for spinning.
British mills also process the bulk of rare fibres, such as cashmere and mohair,
entering world trade. The largest markets for woollen and worsted fabrics are the
rest of the European Community, Japan and the United States.
During the nineteenth century cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods
industry and cotton piece goods its largest export. Low-cost competition has
cut progressively into British markets and made necessary reorganisation,
modernisation and the introduction of new techniques. Production includes
yarns and fabrics of cotton, spun man-made fibres and mixtures of these.

The linen industry is centred in Northern Ireland, where the lighter types of
fabrics for apparel, furnishings and household textiles are produced. The
heavyweight canvas for sailcloth, tents, awnings and tarpaulins is mainly
produced in Scotland.
The hosiery and knitwear industry comprises about 960 companies situated
mainly in the East Midlands and Scotland, of which most are small to medium
in size. The industry produces fabrics, outerwear, underwear, tights, socks,
stockings, gloves and accessories.
Some 60 per cent of the value of carpet and rug output (80 per cent in volume
terms) is made up of tufted carpets, in the production of which the pile, usually
with a high man-made fibre content, is inserted into a pre-woven backing.
Woven carpets, mainly Axminster, account for most of the remainder of sales.
There is a higher wool content in woven types, although in these, too, more use
is being made of man-made fibres. The high quality and variety of design make
Britain one of the world's leading producers of woven carpets. The volume of
carpet sales has contracted since 1978.
Jute products are manufactured in the Dundee area. Jute yarn and man-made
polypropylene yarn are used in the manufacturing of carpets, cordage and ropes
and woven into fabrics for a wide range of applications in the packaging,
upholstery, building and motor-car industries. New uses for jute, for example as
a plasties reinforcement and for decorative wall coverings, have also been
developed.
The British clothing industry is one of the largest in Europe; it is highly labour
intensive with about 7,000 companies (predominantly small ones), accounting
for 4 per cent of Britain's total employment in the manufacturing sector. It
supplies about two-thirds of domestic demand, while exports have risen since
the mid-1970s. A wide range of clothing is imported from European and Asian
countries.
The footwear manufacturing industry is made up predominantly of small
companies. Though necessarily largely labour intensive, the industry includes
some of the most technologically up-to-date factories in the world and supplies
nearly half the shoes sold in Britain. Imports have, however, risen in recent
years. Leather tanning and the manufacture of leather goods are also long-
established industries; all types of leather (particularly for footwear, clothing
and gloves) and leather goods are produced, and about one-third of leather
production is exported.

MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES 253
The furniture industry comprises about 4,500 companies, mostly small to
medium-sized with only a few of any significant size. A wide range of products is
manufactured, the greater part oi production being accounted for by domestic
furniture and the remainder by office, contract, school and other furniture.
Domestic production of softwood timber has been steadily increasing but the
timber-using industries are mainly dependent on imported supplies. A large
proportion of timber sales goes to the construction industry.
There were about 100 paper and board mills in 1984, operated by 80 companies:
total production was 3-5 million tonnes. The largest British groups are Wiggins
Teape, the Dickinson Robinson Group, Reed International and the Bowater
Corporation. Overseas paper and board groups with manufacturing invest¬
ments in Britain include Georgia Pacific, Kimberly Clark and Consolidated
Bathurst. The main types of paper and board produced are printing and writing
papers and board, corrugated case materials, packaging paper and board, and
tissue. There has been a significant trend towards waste-based packaging
grades in order to reduce the industry's reliance on imported woodpulp supplies.
The use of recycled waste paper is increasing and research is helping to extend
it. Waste paper provides over half of the industry's fibre needs. Domestically
produced wood pulp represents only a small percentage of raw material supplies.
The packaging and converting industries manufacture a variety of products,
including cardboard boxes, cartons, fibreboard packaging and business station¬
ery products.
The printing and publishing industries produce a wide range of items,
including newspapers, periodicals, books, business stationery and greetings
cards. Mergers have led to the formation of large groups in the newspaper,
magazine and book publishing sectors, but general printing, engraving,
bookbinding and a large part of publishing remain essentially industries of
small firms. The book publishing industry is a major exporter. Production
processes include high-speed printing, electronic engraving, advanced pro¬
cesses of photographic reproduction and computer typesetting. Security
printers (of, for example, banknotes and postage stamps) have a high reputation
and are important exporters, the two major companies being De La Rue and
Bradbury Wilkinson. The most important overseas markets for printed matter
are the United States, Australia and the Irish Republic.
Tyres and tubes represent nearly 45 per cent of sales of rubber manufactures,
the most important other goods being vehicle components and accessories,
conveyor belting, cables, industrial, hydraulic and marine hoses, latex foam
products and rubber footwear, gloves and clothing. Rubber is also used for
inflatable life-rafts, containers for fuel and other industrial liquids, and seals for
storage tanks and other products where there are problems of air exclusion and
vapour suppression. Tyre manufacturers include several subsidiaries of United
States and other overseas companies. The industry's consumption of rubber
includes natural, synthetic and recycled rubber.
In addition to plastics components and accessories supplied to many different
industries, the plastics processing industry manufactures a wide range of
building materials, such as pipes, sheeting for roofs, sanitary ware, tanks and
other products. It also supplies flexible foams, used in the vehicle, furniture and
other industries: rigid foams: packaging products, including bottles, containers
and bags: domestic and industrial hollow-ware: many kinds of household goods:
vinyl and other lloorcoverings: and artificial leathercloth. Extensive research is

being conducted into the use of plastics in engineering products, particularly
those associated with transport.
There are about 500 manufacturers of a wide range of toys and games, but few of
significant size. About one-third of total production is exported, the major
markets being France, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States.
British diecast toys and plastic toys (including model construction kits) are well
established in overseas markets.
There are about 350 manufacturers of sports equipment, many of which
are small companies with a high reputation for craftsmanship. British
fishing tackle and golf and tennis equipment have a world-wide reputation.
The main export markets are the United States and the rest of the European
Community.
Jewellery, gold and silverware and the refining of precious metals is an industry
in which British craftsmen are world famous. The Royal Mint makes coins for
some 70 overseas countries. Other miscellaneous manufacturing includes
musical instruments, film processing and small stationery goods.
Construction
The construction industry accounts for 5-4 per cent of gross domestic product.
The total value of output in Great Britain in 1984 was £26,198 million, of which
new work accounted for £14,194 million (54 per cent) and repairs and
maintenance the remainder. In housing, new work was valued at £4,917 million
and repairs and maintenance at £6,243 million. About 1 million people are
employed in the industry (including some 66,000 apprentices), accounting for
nearly 5 per cent of total employment. There are also about 460,000 self-
employed.
The industry includes firms engaged on the construction, alteration, repair,
and maintenance of buildings, highways, bridges, tunnels, airfields, drainage
and sewerage systems, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence works, offshore
structures, electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, and structural
work connected with power stations and telecommunications. Efficiency and
productivity within the industry are benefiting from new computerised tech¬
niques such as the use of electronic load safety measures for cranes, distance
measuring equipment, computerised stock ordering and job costing, and
computer-aided design.
Government sponsorship of the construction industry is the responsibility of
the Department of the Environment. Building regulations prescribe minimum
standards of construction in England and Wales. Made by the Secretary of State
for the Environment and administered and enforced by local authorities, the
regulations apply to new building, the installation or replacement of fittings,
and alterations and extensions to existing buildings. There are broadly similar
controls under separate legislation in Scotland, Northern Ireland and inner
London. As an alternative to local authority building control and in order to
simplify procedures, an optional system of private certification of compliance
with building regulations is provided for in the Housing and Building Control
Act 1984 and is to be introduced in 1985. The British Board of Agrement,
sponsored by the Department, assesses and issues reports and certificates
relating to products and systems for use in the construction industry.
Construction work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. In 1984 about 89 per cent of the
work was done by private firms. Although there were about 95,000 firms

employing two or more people, 95 per cent of them employed fewer than 25.
Some large firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders' equipment; some undertake responsi¬
bility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the smallest
projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either by
architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects, by
consulting engineers. The latter, acting on behalf of a client, may advise on the
feasibility of projects, draw up plans and supervise the construction work.
The Property Services Agency (PSA), which is an integral part of the
Department of the Environment, is responsible for the construction pro¬
grammes undertaken directly by the Government, including work for the armed
forces both in Britain and overseas.
During f984 a total of 190,400 dwellings were started in Great Britain. Starts in
the public sector were 38,200 and those for private owners 152,100. Some
198,400 dwellings were completed, an increase of 9,000 over 1983; 48,000 were
in the public sector and 150,400 in the private sector. Industrialised building
methods employing prefabricated components are used in some of the work in
both sectors.
Among important construction projects in hand or recently completed in Britain
were the Heysham and Torness nuclear power stations, the Thames Barrier,
which forms part of London's flood defences, new air terminals at Heathrow and
Gatwick, the new Lloyd's insurance building, the International Conference
Centre in London, the new British Library, the Docklands Light Railway, and
the M25 motorway; as well as roads, tunnels, bridges, hospitals and large-scale
housing developments.
Within the Department of the Environment, the Building Research Establish¬
ment is concerned with all aspects of construction research and also provides an
advisory service.
In addition to research carried out within the major construction and building
materials firms, work is also undertaken by research associations, universities
and colleges of technology. Certain research organisations also provide an
advisory service.
The Building Centre Group consists of six building centres throughout
Britain, most of which provide exhibition and information services on mate¬
rials, products, techniques and building services.
Net overseas earnings of the construction industry in 1983—84 were estimated
at about £635 million. British contractors earned £115 million, and the related
professions (consulting engineers, architects and surveyors) had earnings of
£650 million while process plant engineering contractors contributed some
£305 million. Exports of construction plant and machinery added another £335
million. However, there was a deficit of £770 million on trade in building
materials despite the fact that exports reached record levels.
In 1983—84 British construction firms carried out work overseas valued at
£2,381 million. New contracts worth £2,451 million were won overseas. Recent
major projects have included the Dubai Dry Dock, the largest in the world, and
the Hong Kong Metro. Other major contracts obtained in 1983—84 included a
microwave radar installation and a major share of a sports complex in Saudi
Arabia, a 500-bed hospital and postgraduate medical education centre in Oman,
an airport in Gaborone, Botswana, an integrated steel mill and blast furnace at
Kwangyang, Korea, office blocks in Kingston, Jamaica, and a residential and
commercial centre at South Marra, Melbourne, Australia.

The International Building Service, within the Building Centre in London,

Service Industries
Growth has been faster in the service sector in Britain than in the rest of the
economy in recent decades. In 1984 services contributed about 62 per cent of
gross domestic product compared with 45 per cent in 1960 and accounted for 65
per cent of employees in employment compared with 48 per cent in 1960.
Overseas trade in services, particularly financial services, has also grown, and in
1984 overseas earnings from services amounted to nearly half the value of
exports of manufactures.
Between 1976 and 1984 total service employment rose by almost 800,000,
compared with a fall in employment in all other sectors. Much of this, however,
was accounted for by growth in part-time (principally female) employment. Since
the late 1970s employment has grown more rapidly in the private sector than in
the public sector, a reversal of the pattern of the 1960s and the early 1970s,
partially reflecting the Government’s policy of restricting employment in public
sector services.
The fastest-growing sectors within services in the 1970s, measured by
employment, were financial and business services, professional and scientific
services (mainly health and education) and miscellaneous services (mainly
leisure and personal services). In the 1980s the financial services have
continued to grow strongly. Among trends in the miscellaneous sector is a
growth in franchising, an operation in which a company owning the rights to a
particular form of trading sells them to franchisees, usually by means of an
initial payment with continuing royalties. Hotel, catering and cleaning
businesses are the main services in which franchising has developed.
Among the reasons for the growth in services is the fact that real personal
disposable income has more than doubled since 1945. As real incomes rise
people tend to spend a greater proportion of income on personal, financial and-
leisure services. While, to some extent, consumers have exchanged services
(such as public transport, laundries and cinemas) for goods (motor cars,
washing-machines and television sets), this has generated demand for fresh
services in the distribution, maintenance and repair of these goods. Increased
consumer expenditure on the running costs of motor cars is a significant factor
in the rise in consumer expenditure on services. Demand for British air travel,
hotel and catering services has resulted from the increase in real incomes in
other countries.
Other factors include a greater readiness to use banking services and the
spread of home ownership, which has increased demand for legal and estate
agency services. Demographic changes, such as the increase in the elderly as a
component of the population, help to explain the growth of medical services.
Shorter working hours tend to raise the demand for leisure services.
Changes in technology have also played a part in the growth of services.
Examples range from the computer services industry to the provision of cash
and credit by means of cards and the growth of information systems such as
viewdata and teletext. It is thought that there are now about 1 million people
employed in the tradeable information sector', which encompasses activities
such as the supply of financial and business information, printing and
publishing, on-line computerised technical services, consultancy, and aspects of
education and training services and of the entertainment industry.
There were over 4 million people engaged in the distributive and allied trades in
Great Britain in mid-1984, together with a large number of owners of
businesses. There were 908,000 people in wholesaling, just over 2 million in
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
257
retailing, 1 million in hotels and catering, and 206,000 in the repair of vehicles
and consumer goods. The distributive and allied trades accounted for about 13
per cent of national income in 1984.
WHOLESALE In 1983 there were some 105,000 businesses engaged in wholesaling and
TRADES dealing, with a turnover (including sales to other wholesalers and dealers) of
some £141,500 million. The main areas in which wholesalers are dominant are
groceries and provisions, petroleum products, and ores and metals. A number of
large retailers carry out the functions of the wholesaler by having their own
warehouses and buying and distributive organisations.
The wholesale grocery trade had a turnover of some £6,200 million in 1984.
The trade is divided between ‘cash and carry' and the traditional delivered trade
in a ratio of 2 to 1. The cash and carry sector, with some 560 depots, grew in
importance during the 1960s and 1970s by offering discounts to customers who
purchased in bulk and limiting expenditure on premises, credit and delivery
facilities. Grocery wholesaling has greatly diminished in recent years; over
two-thirds of groceries are now delivered direct from manufacturers to the large
multiple food retailers, by-passing the traditional wholesalers.
Two large groups, Nurdin and Peacock and the Dee Corporation, predominate
in the wholesale grocery trade. London's wholesale markets play a significant
part in the distribution of foodstuffs. New Covent Garden is the main market for
fruit and vegetables, Smithfield for meat and Billingsgate for fish.
The co-operative movement in Britain has its own wholesale organisation, the
Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), to serve the needs of retail societies; its
turnover was £2,164 million in 1984. Retail societies are encouraged to buy
from the CWS, which supplies about two-thirds of their requirements.
In the grocery trade there are a number of voluntary groups which have been
formed by wholesalers with small independent retailers, whereby the retailers
are encouraged by discounts and other incentives to buy as much as possible
from the wholesaler. This has helped to preserve many smaller retail outlets for
the wholesaler, including the traditional ‘corner shops' and village stores, of
value to local communities, and has given small retailers the advantages of bulk
buying and co-ordinated distribution.
RETAIL Turnover of the retail trades has been growing slowly in real terms in recent
TRADES years, despite the recession. In 1984 retail sales were 8 per cent higher than in
1983, representing, however, only a 3 per cent increase in volume. In 1983 there
were an estimated 232,000 businesses in the retail trade in Great Britain each
with a turnover of more than £18,000 (see Table 19). Their turnover was about
£75,750 million and they invested £1,900 million. As the large multiple retailers
(those with ten or more outlets) have grown in size and diversified their product
ranges, there has been a decline in the number of retail businesses and outlets.
The decline has been particularly evident among small independent businesses
and retail co-operative societies. Shops selling durable household goods have
experienced the fastest growth in turnover in recent years, while those selling
clothing and footwear have recorded the slowest growth.
The largest multiple retailers in the packaged grocery market are the retail
co-operatives, Sainsbury, Tesco, Asda, Allied Suppliers, Kwik Save, Fine Fare
and International Stores. Retail co-operative societies are voluntary organisa¬
tions controlled by their members, membership being open to anyone paying a
small deposit on a minimum share; at the end of 1984 the 112 retail societies
had over 8 million members and more than 6,000 retail outlets. Turnover in
1984 amounted to in excess of £4,000 million. Retail co-operatives and the
Co-operative Wholesale Society (see above) are members of the Co-operative
Union as are a number of other co-operative bodies such as the Co-operative
258

Trends
Bank. In 1984—85 Sainsbury had about 253 stores and sales were valued at
£3,135 million. Tesco had some 400 outlets and the company's sales amounted
to £3,000 million.
The leading mixed retail businesses are Marks and Spencer (with sales of
£3,200 million in 1984—85), Boots, F. W. Woolworth, the John Lewis Part¬
nership, House of Fraser, W. H. Smith & Son, Debenhams and British Home
Stores.
There are a number of discount stores operating on the principle of selling
most or all of their goods at a reduced price. Electrical goods, furniture, carpets
and do-it-yourself supplies are some of the main items sold by discount stores.
About 17 million people regularly shop by post. In 1983 sales by general mail
order firms totalled some £2,550 million, representing 3-5 per cent of retail sales
and 5-8 per cent of retail sales excluding food shops. The volume of mail order
sales increased rapidly in the 1970s but fell off somewhat after 1980. Leading
items sold by mail order are clothing, footwear, furniture, household textiles,
and radio, television and electrical goods. The two main mail order firms are
Great Universal Stores and Littlewoods.
One of the most significant trends in retailing in recent years has been the
increase in the proportion of turnover accounted for by large multiple retailers;
they have 56 per cent of retail turnover. Other important trends have been the
increase in very large self-service stores selling a wide variety of products,
diversification by food multiples into selling a wider range of goods, the

development of specially designed shopping precincts, the growth of shops
selling computers, software and video-cassettes, and an increasing emphasis on
price competition.
There are supermarkets in most towns and cities in Britain. The main multiple
grocery companies have been steadily increasing the size of their main
supermarkets. The trend to greater size has led to a growing number of
superstores and hypermarkets, self-service stores offering a wider range of food
and non-food merchandise and which have at least 2,500 sq m (26,900 sq ft)
and 5,000 sq m (53,800 sq ft) respectively of selling space. They are designed
primarily for shoppers with cars, and substantial free car-parking space is
usually provided. In Britain the first such store was opened in the mid-1960s
and by January 1985 there were some 258 superstores and 40 hypermarkets,
while planning permission for a further 65 superstores and one hypermarket
had been granted. Government policy is that local planning authorities should
take full account both of the growing trend for new stores to be located outside
existing shopping areas and of the likely impact of this on the viability of
established shopping centres. Since 1980 there has been an increase in
‘mini-superstores' in the range 1,000 to 2,500 sq m (10,760 to 26,900 sq ft).
Britain has a variety of new purpose-built shopping centres. The largest are the
Manchester Arndale and the centre in Milton Keynes, which, both covering more
than 93,000 sq m (1 million sq ft), are among the largest in Europe. Other large
centres are at Brent Cross in London, the Luton Arndale and the Eldon Square
Development in Newcastle upon Tyne.
Many of the large multiple groups have diversified over the last few years to offer
a much bigger range of goods and services than previously. This has been
especially noticeable for the large food retailers, which often sell non-food
products, such as beer, wines and spirits, clothing and household appliances,
as well as packaged groceries. Another trend is that many superstores and large
supermarkets offer fresh as well as packaged food, often with special counters or
areas for fresh meat, fish, vegetables and bread baked on the premises. Some
large retailers have in recent years begun to provide financial and estate agency
services.
Retailers are placing greater emphasis on price competition as a means of
promoting sales, while trading stamps, which were an important method of
sales promotion in the late 1960s and early 1970s, have become much less
significant. With the growth of payments by credit card, certain of the large
retailers have issued their own credit cards for regular customers in an attempt
to increase sales, particularly of high-value goods.
Laser-scanning electronic check-outs are expected to have a major impact on
retailing in the next few years. A low-power laser beam at the point of sale scans
a bar code on the package of each item and the price is automatically retrieved
from a central computer. The customer is given a receipt showing the price and
identity of each item purchased, while the store's stock records are altered
automatically. Substantial savings are expected from improved stock control
and a reduction of individual price marking in stores. Key Markets introduced
the first operational laser-scanning electronic check-out in Britain at Spalding
(Lincolnshire) in 1979. Computerised shopping services are being introduced in
the home which enable people to order goods from retailers. Some large multiple
retailers are using electronic order and invoice systems in dealing with their
suppliers, following a legal change permitting tax invoices in forms other than

paper. Small independent retailers, also, are using electronic ordering, pricing
and delivery systems. High-speed labelling techniques, including the use of
electronic printers which can overprint labels, the use of pressure-sensitive
glues and printing in foil instead of ink, are being adopted in order to save time
and labour costs.
A single nationwide 'electronic funds transfer at the point of sale' (EFT-POS)
system is to be established for the retail market by the English and Scottish
clearing banks. The system will use magnetically striped cards and terminals
installed in retail premises to transfer funds directly from card-holders' accounts
to the accounts of retailers. A project to install about 1,000 terminals in
shopping locations within 12 to 15 months was announced by the banks in
June 1985.
In June 1984 some 268,000 people were employed in Great Britain in the retail
distribution of motor vehicles and parts and in petrol stations. In spite of the
continuing increase in the number of road vehicles, the number of petrol
stations is declining and at the end of 1984 there were some 21,700 (6 per cent
fewer than in 1983), of which 32 per cent were owned by oil companies. There
were about 9.410 outlets selling diesel fuel. Self-service stations are becoming
increasingly important and in 1984 they accounted for 37 per cent of petrol
stations. In 1983 there were some 60,000 retail businesses wholly or mainly
engaged in the distribution, repair and servicing of motor vehicles.
The hotel and catering trades employed 1 million people in Great Britain in
mid-1984: 252,000 in hotels and other residential establishments: 189,000 in
restaurants, cafes and snack bars: 242,000 in public houses and bars: 148,000
in clubs: and 117,000 by catering contractors. A large number of self-employed
people are also engaged in hotels and catering. There were 12,900 hotel
businesses in Great Britain in 1983, with a turnover of £2,990 million. Many
licensed hotels as well as most of the numerous guest houses are small, with
fewer than 20 rooms. Of the major hotel business groups the biggest is
Trusthouse Forte Ltd, which runs 800 hotels including 200 in Britain, and has
catering and leisure interests. The total turnover of holiday camps and camping
and caravan sites was about £420 million in 1983. Among the largest firms
running holiday centres (including holiday camps with full board, self-catering
centres and caravan parks) are Butlins, Pontins, Ladbroke Holidays. Warners
and Haven Leisure. There were over 39,000 businesses in Great Britain in 1983
with a total turnover of more than £3,400 million, which were engaged in the
sale of food for consumption both on and off the premises. These include
restaurants, snack bars, cafes, fish and chip shops and other establishments
selling 'take-away' food. Britain has a very wide range of restaurants of which a
substantial number specialise in the dishes of other countries such as Chinese,
Italian, Indian and Greek foods. Fast-food' catering, in which establishments
sell hot food such as hamburgers or chicken to be eaten either on the premises
or elsewhere, is becoming increasingly significant. There are about 41,900
'pubs' (public houses, which mainly sell beer, wines and spirits for consumption
on the premises) in Great Britain, with a total turnover of £6,400 million in
1983.
Business services include advertising, market research, management consul¬
tancy, exhibition and conference facilities, computer services and auction
houses. Most of these sectors have grown rapidly in recent years.
Advertising expenditure rose by 13 per cent in 1984 to £4,055 million,
according to the Advertising Association. Advertising in the press accounted for

63 per cent of the total, television for 31 per cent, posters for 4 per cent,
commercial radio for 2 per cent and cinema for 0-4 per cent. Advertising has
been growing fastest in television, freesheets and directories. Advertising
campaigns are planned mainly by advertising agencies, of which there are
several hundred in Britain: in some cases they also provide marketing,
consumer research and other services.
Britain is acknowledged as. a world leader in the provision of software and
computer services, and software developed in Britain has contributed to
developments in the applications of computers in numerous countries. The
industry comprises software houses, which provide professional services such
as consultancy, the writing of programs to meet the computing needs of their
clients, and, increasingly, packaged software designed for a wider market;
computer bureaux, where the main emphasis is on processing customers' data;
and systems houses, which specialise in the provision of complete systems
(hardware and software).
The computer services industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the
British economy: annual growth has been running at between 15 and 20 per
cent a year since the mid-1970s and turnover now stands at over £2,000 million.
The industry employs around 70,000 people, excluding people working on
‘in-house' computer activities, who number several hundred thousand. About
200 computer service companies are members of the Computing Services
Association, the leading trade association. Many of the companies are sub¬
sidiaries of firms engaged in activities such as banking, insurance, manufac¬
turing and distribution.
There are thought to be some 5,000 management consultants in Britain, of
whom 2,700 are practising members of the Institute of Management Consul¬
tants. Among the largest management consultancy companies are the 27
members of the Management Consultants Association, whose turnover
amounted to £122 million in 1984. Revenue earned within Britain comprised
£98 million, an increase of 40 per cent on the previous year, while overseas
revenue amounted to £22 million. The Association reports a growing demand
for services supporting the application of computer technology, particularly
micro-processing, to all aspects of business.
The 27 members of the Association of Market Survey Organisations (AMSO)
accounted for about three-quarters of total turnover by market research
companies in 1984. The turnover of AMSO members increased to £117 million
in 1984 from £96 million in 1983. The largest company, the AGB group, had a
turnover of £25 million. Research on behalf of food and soft drinks companies
accounted for 23 per cent of revenue.
With the steady increase in new and renovated facilities, some 55 to 60 towns
and cities are well equipped to hold conferences and exhibitions. Among the
most modern buildings are the National Exhibition Centre at Birmingham, the
Wembley Conference Centre and the Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences
in London, the Brighton Centre in Sussex, the Harrogate Centre in North
Yorkshire, the Bournemouth International Centre in Dorset. St David's Hall in
Cardiff and the Royal Centre in Nottingham. Other large facilities are the Earls
Court, Olympia and Wembley Arena sites in London. The major conference
towns are Blackpool (Lancashire) and Brighton. Britain is one of the world’s
three leading countries for international conferences (the others being the
United States and France); the Union of International Associations, based in

Brussels, estimated that about 9 per cent of the world's main international
conferences were held in Britain in 1984. British firms are very active overseas
in the market for exhibition organising services.
Britain's chief auction houses are active in the international auction markets for
works of art, trading on the acknowledged expertise of British valuers and
dealers. The two largest houses, Sotheby's and Christies, are established
world-wide and had turnovers of £502 million and £338 million in 1984—85
respectively.
Other business services include land and estate companies, estate agents, and
typewriting, duplicating, document copying, translating and employment
agencies.
Some 98,000 people were employed in film, theatre, literary, musical, broadcast¬
ing and related services in Great Britain in mid-1984, 292,000 in sanitary
services, 127,000 in research and development services and 261,000 in services
connected with sport, recreation, gambling and betting. Other services provided
included hairdressing and beauty parlours (88,000 employees), laundries, dyers
and dry cleaners (64,000), photographic studios, religious organisations,
tourist offices, learned societies, employers' and trade union organisations, and
funeral services.
Major trends in the film and television industry in recent years include the
development of the specialised film and television services sector, the decline of
the cinema sector (partly as a result of the growth of public television services)
and the extension of video and cable television services. Technical develop¬
ments, such as the use of magnetic video tape instead of film, and the
exploitation of computer-generated graphics, have been responsible for changes
both in the production and exhibition of film and television material. They have
also played a part in the growth of the specialised sector, in which relatively
small studios, mostly based in London, provide a wide range of film and
television services, including the making of advertising films, ‘special effects'
sequences for feature and other films, documentary and educational pro¬
grammes, and cartoon films. In addition, new audio-visual technology is
being adopted in industrial, commercial, medical and scientific contexts for
information, observation and training purposes.
The Department of Trade and Industry conducts an annual inquiry into the
value of overseas transactions relating to the production and exhibition of
cinema and television material. For many years the inquiry has shown a surplus
of receipts over expenditure. In 1984 receipts by film and television companies
were £318 million, while expenditure was £195 million, a surplus of £123
million. Film companies' receipts totalled £229 million and television com¬
panies' receipts £91 million, the North American market accounting for about
three-fifths of revenue in both eases. Some 323 film companies and 18 television
broadcasting companies were covered in the 1984 inquiry.
The aim of British Film Year, which began in April 1985, with government
support, is to promote the cinema, develop the use of films in education and
increase awareness of the quality of the British film production industry both in
Britain and overseas.
Legislation was passed in 1985 to reduce statutory intervention in the film
industry and to increase the flow of both public and private funds for domestic
film production.
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
263
TRAVEL
AND
TOURISM
The travel business is another growth sector and some 2,595 travel agencies,
with about 5,895 offices (over 90 per cent of the total), belong to the Association
of British Travel Agents (ABTA). In general travel agents are small businesses
but many ABTA members have more than one office. There are a few large firms
(of which the biggest is Thomas Cook with over 250 branches). Computerised
information and booking systems are being introduced in travel agencies. There
are also 630 tour operator members of ABTA; some 230 companies are both
retail agents and tour operators. The leading tour operators are British Airways
(through its subsidiaries. Sovereign and Enterprise), Cosmos, Horizon,
Intasun, Rank Travel and Thomson. ABTA operates financial protection
schemes to safeguard its members’ customers, maintains codes of conduct
drawn up with the Office of Fair Trading, and offers a free conciliation service to
help to resolve complaints against members and an independent arbitration
scheme for tour operators' customers.
Spending by British residents and overseas visitors on tourism in Britain
during 1984 amounted to more than £10,000 million (excluding fares paid on
travel to and from Britain). About 1 million jobs in Britain were supported,
directly or indirectly, by tourism expenditure in 1983. The industry is now
Britain’s second largest source of invisible earnings. It is estimated that in 1984
some 13-7 million overseas visitors to Britain (1,248,000 more than in the
previous year) spent £4,169 million, £518 million more than in 1983. British
residents made 22 million trips abroad and spent £4,617 million, giving a deficit
on the travel account of £448 million. About 44 per cent of overseas visitors to
Britain came from the other European Community countries, 24 per cent from
North America and about 12 per cent from elsewhere in Western Europe. There
was an increase of 11 million visits abroad by British residents in 1984; the
main destinations were the European Community (just over half of all visits) and
elsewhere in Western Europe (36 per cent).
Official support for the promotion of tourism to and within Britain is provided
by the British Tourist Authority and the tourist boards for England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. Voluntary registration schemes exist for tourist
accommodation throughout Britain and facilities offered by registered estab¬
lishments are listed in the boards’ accommodation guides. Information on
tourist facilities and accommodation is available from official information
centres throughout Britain (most of which are administered by local authorities)
and on videotex information services in Britain and overseas. The development
of the tourist and leisure industries, and the obstacles inhibiting their growth,
are being examined by the Government.
13 Energy
and Natural
Resources
Energy and non-fuel minerals make an important contribution to the British
economy. The approximate value of minerals produced in 1983 was £24,334
million, of which crude oil accounted for 68 per cent, coal 19 per cent and
natural gas 5 per cent.
All minerals in Great Britain are privately owned, with the exception of gold,
silver, oil and natural gas (which are owned by the Crown), and coal and some
minerals associated with coal. On the United Kingdom Continental Shelf the
right to exploit all minerals except coal is vested in the Crown. 1 he exclusive
right to extract coal, or license others to do so, both on land and under the sea, is
vested in the National Coal Board. Normally, ownership of minerals belongs to
the owner of the land surface but in some areas, particularly where mining has
taken place, these rights have become separated. Mining and quarrying, apart
from coal, are usually carried out by privately owned companies.
Water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial require¬
ments; supplies are obtained from surface sources such as mountain lakes and
from underground sources by such means as wells and boreholes.
Energy
Britain has the largest energy resources of any country in the European
Community and is a major world producer of oil, natural gas and coal. The other
main primary sources are nuclear power and some water power; secondary
sources are electricity, coke and very small quantities of town gas. Since 1980
Britain has been self-sufficient in energy in net terms as a result of the
continued growth in offshore oil production, and self-sufficiency should be
maintained for a number of years. Coal is the country s richest natural resource
and estimated recoverable reserves are 7,000 million tonnes, equivalent to
output at present rates of extraction for nearly 60 years; total coal resources are
many times higher. A major capital investment programme in the coal industry
is in progress. Nuclear power provided about 19 per cent of electricity generated
by the public supply system in 1984 and the proportion will grow as recently
built nuclear power stations reach full capacity and as those under construction
are brought into service.
Privately owned companies predominate in offshore oil and gas production
and oil refining, while publicly owned bodies are responsible for most coal
production, gas distribution, and electricity generation and distribution. The
publicly owned fuel and power industries (excluding the British National Oil
Corporation) in Britain employ in total about 470,000 people (some 2 2 per cent
of all employees); their annual turnover is about £20,000 million and capital
investment £2,900 million. In Great Britain the Secretary of State for Energy is

responsible for these industries, except for electricity in Scotland which is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The Government's energy policy is designed to ensure the secure, adequate and
economic provision of energy to meet Britain's requirements. The Government
seeks to ensure that all economic forms of energy are produced, supplied and
used as efficiently as possible, having regard also to the international
application of the technologies involved. Oil and gas resources continue to be
developed profitably. The Government attaches importance to the development
of a competitive coal industry and to the safe and economic development of
nuclear power. Particular attention is paid to achieving the most cost-effective
use of energy through the adoption of energy efficiency measures.
Britain is actively engaged in international collaboration on energy questions,
notably through its membership of the European Community and of the
International Energy Agency (IEA, a body with 21 member countries attached to
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Since its
establishment in 1974, the IEA has agreed a wide range of co-operative
measures to reduce member nations' dependence on imported oil, and it
continues to support the adoption of realistic energy pricing policies by all
member countries, both to discourage wasteful use of energy and to stimulate
new methods of utilising and saving it.
Inland primary energy consumption amounted to 312-2 million tonnes of coal
equivalent in 1984 (see Table 20), slightly less than in 1983, and well below the
level of the 1970s, reflecting energy conservation and lower levels of industrial
production. In 1984 consumption of coal was substantially lower than in
previous years as a result of a lengthy industrial dispute in the coalmining
industry, which also led to higher oil consumption. Energy consumption by
final users in 1984 amounted to 54,052 million therms1 on a ‘heat supplied"
basis, of which industrial users consumed about 30 per cent, domestic users
28 per cent, transport 28 per cent and public services 6 per cent.

The aim of obtaining the best value for money from energy consumed is an
integral part of the Government’s strategy to increase the efficiency with which
energy is supplied and used throughout the economy.
In 1983 the Government set up the Energy Efficiency Office within the
Department of Energy, with its objective being to make Britain the most

energy-efficient country in the Western world. Studies have suggested that
Britain's energy efficiency performance could be improved by 20 per cent,
making annual savings of £7,000 million (at 1984 prices).
Ministers have been conducting a series of meetings around Britain with
leaders of industry, commerce and local authorities to encourage greater
efficiency in the supply and use of energy. Some 15,000 senior business people
have attended to discuss the benefits to their companies of energy efficiency
measures. The year 1986 has been designated Energy Efficiency Year.
Schemes for industry and commerce provide assistance towards the cost of
energy efficiency surveys, demonstration projects, monitoring, and research
and development including feasibility studies on combined heat and power or
district heating. Regional energy efficiency officers provide help to companies
and support for firms' energy managers, of whom there are some 7,000. The
Energy Saver Show, aimed at domestic consumers, has visited over 200
locations, including shopping centres and home exhibitions throughout
Britain, giving information and advice on energy efficiency in the home.
Grants are available to householders for loft and water-tank insulation. The
Energy Efficiency Office gives grants towards the establishment of community
insulation projects and is helping to develop home energy audits—assessments
of the degree of efficiency in a household's use of energy.
The Government sets certain compulsory standards including minimum
insulation levels for new buildings and a maximum temperature of 19°C (66°F)
for non-domestic buildings.
Britain's energy position has been transformed by the discovery of substantial
oil and gas reserves offshore in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS).
Seismic prospecting began in the early 1960s and full-scale exploration
activities in 1964. The total area covered by production licences is some 90,700
sq km (35,430 sq miles) out of a total designated area of about 651,650 sq km
(251,600 sq miles), over which Britain has exercised its rights to explore and
exploit the seabed and subsoil. Expenditure on offshore and onshore explora¬
tion and development amounted to more than £27,300 million (at 1984 prices)
in the period 1976—84 of which expenditure in 1984 was estimated at about
£3,200 million. By the end of 1984 over 2,600 wells had been or were being
drilled on the UKCS (more than 1,200 production wells and nearly 1,400
exploration or appraisal wells).
The Offshore Supplies Office of the Department of Energy has three main
functions: to ensure that the market in goods and services for UKCS
developments is open, with British suppliers fully considered by the multi¬
national operators; to foster the growth of British-controlled offshore tech¬
nology; and to promote exports of offshore products and services. In 1984 goods
and services valued at £3,600 million were ordered for UKCS developments, the
British share of orders received being £2,650 million (74 per cent).
Before the 1970s Britain was almost wholly dependent for its oil supplies on
imports, the only indigenous supplies coming from a small number of
land-based oilfields. However, the first discovery of oil in the UKCS was made in
1969 and the first oil was brought ashore in 1975. Output of crude oil from the
UKCS in mid-1985 was about 2-2 million barrels (290,000 tonnes) a day,
making Britain the world's fifth largest producer.
There were 27 offshore fields producing crude oil in mid-1985. The largest fields
are Brent and Forties, while six more fields are under development and another
19 significant finds may prove to have commercial potential after further

appraisal. Production from most large fields is controlled from production
platforms of either steel or concrete which have been built to withstand severe
weather including gusts of wind of up to 260 km/h (160 mph) and waves of 30 m
(100 ft).
Britain's primary oil production, including condensates and petroleum gases,
amounted to about 126 million tonnes in 1984 (see Table 21), 10-4 per cent
more than in 1983. Output is reaching its maximum, and although production
is forecast to be at a slightly lower level in the rest of the 1980s, Britain should
remain a significant producer well into the 1990s and, on a smaller scale, into
the twenty-first century. The Government's oil policy is intended to encourage
exploration and development with the objective of maximising economic oil
production for the foreseeable future. Remaining proven reserves of oil in the
UKCS amount to about 800 million tonnes while the total remaining reserves of
the UKCS could be as high as 4,780 million tonnes.
There are several large oil companies operating in Britain or engaged in work on
the UKCS. In total there are about 300 companies with interests in the North
Sea. The two leading British oil companies are British Petroleum (BP) and Shell
Transport and Trading, which are the two largest industrial companies in
Britain in terms of turnover. Sales by BP (in which the Government has a 32 per
cent stake) averaged 3-8 million barrels (0-51 million tonnes) a day of crude oil
and petroleum products in 1984, and its gross income was £37,933 million. It
has about 130,000 employees, of whom 29,950 are employed in Britain.
The Oil and Pipelines Bill provides for the abolition of the publicly owned
British National Oil Corporation and its replacement by a government oil and
pipelines agency. The agency would retain the Government's rights in participa¬
tion agreements with the oil companies, and would be responsible for handling
oil received by the Government under its powers to require royalty payments-in-
kind; these responsibilities would help to safeguard the security of supply. The
agency would also manage the Government's pipeline and storage system, which
is important for defence and civil purposes.
The Government has disposed of its residual (49 per cent) shareholding in
Britoil, an independent private sector company with a major involvement in oil
production on the UKCS, while retaining a special share allowing it to prevent a
take-over of the company.
Onshore production of crude oil in Britain is much less significant than offshore
production. In 1984 it amounted to 345,000 tonnes, including 227,000 tonnes
produced from Britain's largest onshore field at Wytch Farm (Dorset), which
started production in 1979. Twelve other onshore fields are in operation,
notably Bothamsall and Egmanton in Nottinghamshire, Gainsborough in
Lincolnshire and Kimmeridge in Dorset.
At the beginning of 1985 the distillation capacity of Britain's 15 oil refineries
stood at 95-8 million tonnes a year, 5 million tonnes less than a year earlier.
Excess capacity is being eliminated, while existing refineries are being adapted
to the changing pattern of demand by the construction of new upgrading
facilities (‘catalytic crackers') which are leading to a higher output of motor
spirit and naphtha at the expense of fuel oil.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1984 totalled 81-4 million tonnes, including 27-8 million
tonnes of fuel oil, 20-2 million tonnes of motor spirit, 16-7 million tonnes of gas
and diesel oil (including derv fuel used in road vehicles) and 6-5 million tonnes of
kerosene.

Exports of crude oil have grown rapidly and in 1984 amounted to 81 -4 million
tonnes (equivalent to over half of UKCS output). Virtually all exports went to
Britain's partners in the European Community and the International Energy
Agency, the largest markets being the United States, the Netherlands and
France. Some 16 million tonnes of petroleum products were also exported. The
volume of imports of crude oil has fallen considerably to about 20 per cent of the
level of the peak year of 1973. Heavy crude oil continues to be imported to enable
the full range of petroleum products to be made efficiently, as not all of these can
be made from the high-quality oil produced in the UKCS. The main sources of
crude oil imports in 1984 were Norway (which supplied about 41 per cent by
value), Saudi Arabia and Iran (which each supplied 8 per cent) and Nigeria (7 per
cent).

Oil pipelines brought ashore about 81 per cent of offshore oil in 1984. Some
1,540 km (960 miles) of major submarine pipeline have been built to bring
ashore oil from a number of North Sea oilfields (see map, p 268). Major crude oil
onshore pipelines in operation from harbours, land terminals or offshore
moorings to refineries include those connecting Finnart to Grangemouth, Angle
Bay to Llandarcy, Tranmere to Stanlow, Amlwch to Stanlow, and Cruden Bay to
Grangemouth. Onshore pipelines also carry refined products to major market¬
ing areas; for example, a 423-km (263-mile) pipeline runs from Milford Haven to
the midlands and Manchester.
Research into petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the leading oil
companies, which have extensive research and development programmes in
support of oil exploration and production and on new and improved fuels. All
aspects of production are covered, including the design of production facilities
and enhanced oil recovery techniques. Research centres are at Sunbury-on-
Thames (BP), Ellesmere Port in Cheshire and Sittingbourne in Kent (Shell),

development effort in offshore technology is undertaken by the Department of
Energy with the advice of the Offshore Energy Technology Board. In 1985—86
the Department expects to spend some £23 million in support of offshore
technology.
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain began in the early nineteenth
century in Westminster in central London. For many years gas was produced
from coal but during the 1960s, when growing supplies of oil were being
imported, there was a switch to producing town gas from oil-based feedstocks.
However, a more significant change began in the late 1960s following the first
commercial natural gas discovery in the UKCS in 1965 and the start of offshore
gas production in 1967. Supplies of offshore natural gas grew rapidly and
natural gas has now replaced town gas in the public supply system in Great
Britain. Originally used almost exclusively for lighting, gas is now used for
domestic cooking and heating and for industrial and commercial purposes.
The gas industry in Great Britain has been under public ownership and control
since 1949 and is run by the British Gas Corporation, set up in 1973 under the
Gas Act 1972. The Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 gives power to permit the
disposal of assets held by the Corporation, and permits the supply of gas to large
consumers by suppliers other than the Corporation. The Government has
announced plans for the privatisation of the Corporation, and legislation is
expected to be introduced by the end of 1985.
In 1984—85 the turnover of the Corporation and its subsidiary companies
amounted to £6,913 million, of which sales of gas accounted for £6,291 million.
Its current cost operating profit was £651 million. Recently the Corporation has
been wholly self-financing and has repaid all its long-term debt to the
Government. The Corporation has a large investment programme, amounting to
£2,525 million (at 1984 prices) in the five years from 1985 to 1990, a large part
of which is accounted for by investment in the Rough and Morecambe fields (see
below and p 273). The Corporation has some 93,000 employees.
In 1984 indigenous natural gas accounted for about 72 per cent of total natural
gas supplies, the remainder coming from Norway. Production of natural gas
amounted to 40,162 million cubic metres (mcm), of which 2,761 mcm were used
for drilling, production and pumping operations offshore, and some 37,072
mcm by the public supply gas industry. Production comes mainly from six major
gasfields: Leman, Frigg (UK), Indefatigable, Hewett, Viking and West Sole.
Production from the Victor field began in 1984, when approval for the
development of five new fields in the southern North Sea was given: North and
South Sean, Esmond, Forbes and Gordon. The British Gas Corporation is
undertaking a major investment programme to develop the Morecambe field in
the Irish Sea, and the first supplies were brought ashore in January 1985.
Proven plus probable remaining gas reserves in known discoveries increased
by 176,000 mcm in 1984 to 1 -325 million mcm. Total remaining recoverable gas
reserves, including possible gas from existing discoveries and potential future
discoveries, are in the range of 875,000 mcm to 2-443 million mcm. Indigenous
offshore natural gas reserves are likely to meet most of the demand from the
British market throughout the 1990s.
The British Gas Corporation's national high-pressure pipeline system of some
5,000 km (3,100 miles) provides for the distribution of natural gas. It is
supplied by feeder mains from four North Sea shore terminals, and a new
terminal near Barrow-in-Furness is nearing completion. The whole of the
high-pressure transmission system is regularly inspected: the Corporation has

developed the world's most advanced computerised inspection vehicle for
high-pressure pipelines that detects flaws as it travels through them.
Various methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions are
used including salt cavities and storage facilities for liquefied natural gas. The
British Gas Corporation is also developing the partially depleted Rough field as a
major gas store. This, the first such use of an offshore field, will involve the
injection into the Rough reservoir in the summer months of gas drawn from
the national transmission system for recovery during periods of peak winter
demand.
Sales of gas by the public supply industry in Britain totalled 17,302 million
therms in 1984. About half of all gas sold by the British Gas Corporation to its
16-4 million consumers is for industrial and commercial purposes, the
remainder being for household use. Gas is used extensively in industries
requiring the control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy such as the
pottery industry and certain processes for making iron and steel products. In
1984, 5,864 million therms of gas were sold to industry in Britain, 178 million
therms to public supply and transport power stations and 2,329 million therms
to commercial users. The domestic load includes gas for cookers, space heaters,
water heaters and refrigerators, but an increasingly large part of domestic
demand is for gas for central heating. In 1984, 8,931 million therms were sold to
domestic users.
The British Gas Corporation conducts research at five research stations into all
aspects of gas supply and use. Its total expenditure on research and development
and on technical services and testing amounted to about £69-4 million in
1984—85. Work on processes for the manufacture of substitute natural gas
(SNG) from coal is one of the Corporation's main research projects. A
demonstration coal gasification plant (‘slagging gasifier') has been built at the
Westfield Development Centre in Fife. Other research is concerned with the
design, efficient operation and maintenance of the transmission and distribu¬
tion systems and with the efficient use of gas in its various industrial and
domestic applications.
Coalmining in Britain can be traced back to the thirteenth century. It played a
crucial part in the industrial revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and in its peak year, 1913, the industry produced 292 million tonnes
of coal, exported 74-2 million tonnes and employed over a million workers. In
1947 the coal mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal Industry
Nationalisation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board (NCB) as a
statutory corporation to manage the industry.
The NCB has, with limited exceptions, exclusive rights over the extraction of
coal in Great Britain, but is empowered to license private operators to work
small mines and opencast sites. It also has powers to work other minerals, where
discoveries are made in the course of searching for, or working, coal; and to
engage in certain petrochemicals activities beneficial to the future of the coal
industry. Retail sales remain largely in private hands, although the NCB makes
bulk sales to large industrial consumers.
At the end of March 1985 there were 169 NCB collieries in operation. The main
coal-bearing regions are shown on the map on p 274.
Britain's coal industry is one of the largest in Western Europe, and one of
the world's most technologically advanced. The NCB has a substantial
capital investment programme, which amounted to £700 million in 1983—84.

Considerable progress has been made in techniques for mining coal. Develop¬
ments are concentrated on the increasing use of heavy-duty equipment, such as
powered roof supports, power loaders and armoured flexible conveyors, capable
of sustained high performance with minimum maintenance, and on the
introduction of computerised automatic monitoring and remote control of
machines.
Although many good seams of coal have now been worked out because of the
early development of the industry, total coal resources in Britain are estimated
at 190,000 million tonnes, of which about 45,000 million tonnes (sufficient for
at least 300 years at present rates of consumption) are considered to be
recoverable using established technology. In 1983 production started at the new
mining complex at Selby in North Yorkshire (one of the world's most advanced
deep mines) and should build up to 10 million tonnes a year by the late 1980s.
Investment of £400 million has been allocated to develop a new mine at Asfordby
in the Vale of Belvoir (Leicestershire) and a similar amount has been allocated
for a new development in the South Warwickshire coalfield.
The first coal to be discovered on a significant scale in Northern Ireland is a
substantial deposit of lignite (brown coal) on the eastern shore of Lough Neagh.
Recoverable reserves are estimated at 420 million tonnes, and four smaller
deposits have also been discovered in Northern Ireland.
In 1984—85 deep-mined coal production was only 30 per cent of normal levels,
mainly due to a year-long strike that ended in March 1985. Previously, annual
production had been about 110 million tonnes, of which some 84 per cent was
deep-mined coal, 13 per cent came from opencast mines and over 2 per cent was
from other sources, including coal recovered from slurry. A substantial
proportion of coal production is used for electricity generation. Consumption of
indigenous coal was also adversely affected by the dispute in 1984—85, leading to
a rise in coal imports and a decline in exports. It is anticipated that production
in 1985—86 will also be below normal while the industry recovers from the
dispute.
In 1984—85 the NCB spent £45 million on research. It has two main research
establishments: the Mining Research and Development Establishment at
Stanhope Bretby (Staffordshire), for work on mining methods and equipment,
particularly improving the performance and reliability of equipment and
developing systems for remote and automatic control: and the Coal Research
Establishment at Stoke Orchard (near Cheltenham), concerned with the
utilisation of coal, including a major research and development programme on
fluidised bed combustion for industrial steam-raising and heating. This project
has led to successful commercial exploitation, and development work continues.
Agreements to exchange technical information have been signed by the NCB
with several countries. Britain is responsible through an NCB subsidiary for the
management of a service which provides information on and analyses of coal
topics under the auspices of the International Energy Agency.
The first public supply of electricity in the world was in 1881, at Godaiming
(Surrey). In 1948 all municipal and private undertakings in Great Britain were
acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the British Electricity
Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland where they
became the responsibility of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board
(NSHEB), which had been set up in 1943. Two subsequent Acts (1954 and 1957)
effected a measure of decentralisation and established the present structure of
public corporations. Electricity from the public supply system is available to all
premises in Britain except for some very remote rural households. The public

supply industry employed about 150,000 people and invested some £1,750
million in 1984—85. The main transmission system (national grid) in England
and Wales is one of the largest fully interconnected power networks under
unified control in the Western world.
The Energy Act 1983 allows private generation to compete with the public
supply industry. It entitles private generators of electricity to sell their electricity
to the boards on terms reflecting costs fairly incurred by the boards, and allows
them to use the public transmission and distribution system.
The Electricity Council is the central co-ordinating body of the supply industry
in England and Wales. It has a general responsibility for promoting the
development and maintenance of an efficient, co-ordinated and economical
system of electricity supply. Electricity is generated and transmitted by the
Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), which is responsible for the
operation and maintenance of power stations and the national grid. Twelve area
electricity boards are responsible for distribution and for the retail sale of
electricity. In 1984—85 the income of the electricity supply industry in England
and Wales was £9,941 million.
In Scotland two boards, the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB), generate, distribute and sell electricity. The boundary separating
their areas runs from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth
of Tay (see map, p 276). In 1984—85 the turnover of the SSEB and the NSHEB
was £806 million and £292 million respectively.
In Northern Ireland generation, transmission and distribution are carried out
by the publicly owned Northern Ireland Electricity Service.
Sales of electricity in 1984 amounted to 229,000 gigawatt hours (GWh).
Domestic users took 36-6 per cent of the total, industry 36 per cent and
commercial and other users the remainder. About one-fifth of domestic sales is
for space heating, one-sixth for water heating and one-tenth for cooking.
Electricity is used in industry mainly for motive power, melting, heating and
lighting. It is supplied to 23-9 million consumers of whom 21-2 million are in
England and Wales, 1-6 million are supplied by the SSEB, 571,000 by the
NSHEB and 556,000 are in Northern Ireland.
Generation by the public supply electricity industry in Britain amounted to
265,990 GWh in 1984. Conventional steam power stations provided 78-6 per
cent of the total, nuclear stations 18-6 per cent and gas turbine, hydro-electric
and diesel plant 2-8 per cent. Public supply power stations consumed 110
million tonnes of coal equivalent in 1984 of which coal accounted for 49 per cent
and oil 33 per cent. The balance between the different sources of energy was
affected by the dispute in the coal industry. The output capacity of the 171
generating stations of the electricity boards at the end of 1984 totalled 62,806
megawatts (MW) including 51,077 MW run by the CEGB, 6,248 MW by the
SSEB, 3,151 MW by the NSHEB and 2,290 MW by the Northern Ireland
Electricity Service. An analysis of electricity generation by and output capacity of
the public supply system is given in Table 22.
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small
(16.479 GWh in 1984). The major sources outside the fuel industries are the
chemicals, engineering, paper, and iron and steel industries and the nuclear
power plants of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and
British Nuclear Fuels pic. In 1984 these nuclear plants supplied 3,849 GWh of
electricity to the public supply system.
Tfte most recent large-scale power stations are based on units of 500 MW and
660 MW. Station capacities have increased and there are 15 stations each with a

capacity of 2,000 MW including Kingsnorth (Kent), Europe's largest mixed-fuel
station burning either coal or oil, while Britain's biggest power station is at
Longannet (Fife), a 2,400-MW station. However, the Drax coal-fired station
(North Yorkshire) will become the largest coal-fired station in Europe in June
1986, when its 2,000-MW extension is completed, raising the station's capacity
to 4,000 MW. The larger units have a higher thermal efficiency (the ratio of the
net electrical energy output to the heat energy input) than earlier units and their
introduction, coupled with the closure of less efficient plant, has resulted in a
gradual rise in overall thermal efficiency, leading to substantial savings in fuel
consumption. Average thermal efficiency of conventional steam stations in
England and Wales rose from 20-91 per cent in 1947-48 to 34-28 per cent in
1984-85.
’ The pumped-storage station at Dinorwig (Gwynedd), the largest of its type in
Europe, was fully commissioned in 1984 and has an average generated output of
1,680 MW. (In pumped-storage schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods
is used to pump water to high-level reservoirs from which it descends to drive
turbines, rapidly providing a large supply of electricity at peak periods or to meet
sudden increases in demand.)
The CEGB, together with Electricite de France, is constructing a 2,000-MW
cross-Channel cable link, which will increase the capacity for the transmission
of electricity between the two countries. The first of two cables will be completed
in the autumn of 1985.
The Government is keen to encourage combined heat and power (CHP)
schemes. As part of a programme to study the potential for CHP/district heating
in particular locations in Britain, the Government has offered financial
assistance to consortia from Belfast, Edinburgh and Leicester for the prepara¬
tion of a prospectus for a combined CHP/district heating scheme.
Britain has been developing nuclear power for several decades and in 1956 the
world's first large-scale nuclear power station, at Calder Hall (Cumbria), began to
supply electricity to the national grid. The Government believes that nuclear
power has a vital role in helping to meet Britain's long-term energy require-

ments. There are 14 nuclear power stations in operation controlled by the
electricity authorities, while four other stations also feed electricity to the
national grid: the two original Magnox stations (both with a net capacity of
about 200 MW) operated by British Nuclear Fuels pic at Calder Hall and
Chapelcross (Dumfries and Galloway); and two experimental or prototype
stations run by the UKAEA, at Winfrith (Dorset) and Dounreay (the site of the
Prototype Fast Reactor).
Under the first commercial programme, nine Magnox stations with a total gross
capacity of about 4,000 MW were commissioned between 1962 and 1971, the
largest being Wylfa (Gwynedd), which has a capacity of 840 MW. The second
main programme was based on the Advanced Gas-eooled Reactor (AGR). Hinkley
Point B (Somerset) and Hunterston B (Strathclyde) were operating in 1976,
while three more AGRs began operating in 1985: Dungehess B (Kent),
Hartlepool (Cleveland) and Heysham (Lancashire). All the AGRs are 1.320-MW
units except Dungeness B (1,200 MW). Construction is in progress on two
further AGRs. a second 1,320-MW station at Heysham and a 1,320-MW station
at Torness (Lothian), and these should be completed by 1988. The CEGB has
also applied for the consent of the Secretary of State for Energy to build a
1,200-MW pressurised water reactor at Sizewell (Suffolk). This application is
subject to the results of a public inquiry (completed in 1985) and to the
necessary consents and safety clearances being obtained.
British Nuclear Fuels pic provides nuclear fuel services covering the whole fuel
cycle: uranium conversion, uranium enrichment (through its shareholding in
Urenco Ltd), fuel element fabrication, transport and reprocessing of spent fuel,
and the manufacture of specialised fuel element components. All of its shares
are held by the Government. The company is organised into four divisions,
covering uranium enrichment, based at Capenhurst (Cheshire): fuel manufac¬
ture at Springfields (Lancashire): reprocessing (operations) at Sellafield (Cum¬
bria) where valuable unused uranium and plutonium are recovered from the
spent fuel; and reprocessing (engineering) at the headquarters at Risley
(Cheshire). There is a large-scale investment programme costing some £3,500
million (at 1984 prices) over the next ten years. The major part of this
expenditure relates to the Sellafield site and comprises the refurbishment of
facilities for treating spent fuel from Magnox power stations, the construction of
a thermal oxide reprocessing plant (THORP) which will take spent fuel from
Britain's AGRs and overseas reactors, and the construction of facilities to
process and package radioactive waste. The remainder of the programme
involves the construction of further centrifuge enrichment plant at Capenhurst,
and refurbishment and construction of new plant at Springfields.
The UKAEA carries out the research and development necessary to ensure that
nuclear power is economic, safe and environmentally acceptable. Its work is
undertaken by research establishments at Harwell (Oxfordshire), Risley, Win-
frith, Springfields, Windseale (Cumbria), Dounreay and Culham (Oxfordshire).
In addition, safety research is carried out at the Safety and Reliability
Directorate at Culeheth (Cheshire). Work connected with the development of the
fast reactor and its fuel cycle takes place principally at Dounreay and represents
a major programme for the UKAEA.
Co-operation in nuclear energy between Britain and other countries takes
place within a framework of intergovernmental agreements and membership of
bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, and through direct
links on research between the UKAEA and equivalent organisations overseas. In

1984 Britain signed a memorandum of understanding on fast reactor develop¬
ment with Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy. A series
of more detailed agreements, which are needed to cover specific arrangements in
particular areas (such as research and development, design and commercial
use), is being negotiated.
Britain takes part in the co-operative research programmes of the European
Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), including one on establishing the
feasibility of achieving controlled thermonuclear fusion. A major component of
this programme is the Joint European Torus (JET) project at Culham, which
has operated successfully since 1983.
Following a review undertaken by the Secretary of State for Energy, legislation
will be introduced to enable the UKAEA to operate as a trading fund, which will
allow it to function on a commercial basis.
The Electricity Council draws up a general programme of research, some of it
direct research carried out by the Council and electricity boards and some of it
in co-operation with selected industrial research associations and through
research contracts placed with universities and other organisations. Some of
the work is done in collaboration with the two Scottish electricity boards and the
Northern Ireland Electricity Service which contribute towards its cost (£123
million in 1984—85). Collaboration on research between the supply industry and
the plant manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power Engineering Research
Steering Committee. The research establishments run by the CEGB comprise
the Central Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead (Surrey), the
Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories in Gloucestershire and the Marchwood Engineer¬
ing Laboratories on Southampton Water. Research on distribution technology
and electricity utilisation is undertaken at the Electricity Council Research
Centre at Capenhurst (Cheshire) and by the area boards.
Research is in progress on assessing the potential contribution of alternative
sources of energy and the ways in which they may be harnessed. These include
wind energy, geothermal energy (from hot dry rocks), and tidal energy for
electricity generation; the use of passive solar design measures to reduce energy
costs; and the conversion of biomass (plant tissue or animal waste) to fuels.
Renewable energy sources, however, are not expected to make a major
contribution to energy supplies this century, although they may have a greater
role in the long term. The Department of Energy's estimate is that some £14
million was spent in 1984-85 in support of its renewable energy programme; it
is giving priority to supporting the development of wind power and geothermal
hot dry rock energy.
Wind power constitutes a resource of considerable national significance. The
Department’s work is concentrated on two major projects; a 60 m (200 ft)
diameter horizontal-axis wind turbine generator of 3 MW on Orkney and a new
medium-scale vertical-axis machine of 160 kW at Carmarthen Bay (Dyfed). Four
other medium-size horizontal-axis machines have recently been brought into
operation. Three were built by private sector companies (two on Orkney and one
at Ilfracombe, Devon) and the fourth was built by the Central Electricity
Generating Board at Carmarthen Bay. The Board has also made measurements
of wind speed at several sites prior to the selection of a site at Richborough.
Kent, with a view to erecting a larger generator which could be the forerunner of
a cluster of ten machines. The Department of Trade and Industry is supporting,
through its National Engineering Laboratory at East Kilbride, the development
of a test site for small-scale and medium-scale wind turbines at Eaglesham, near
Glasgow.

Under its geothermal hot dry rock programme, the Department is investi¬
gating the economic possibilities of extracting heat from rocks at great depth.
Research is mainly carried out by the Camborne School of Mines in Cornwall,
where a project is being conducted to establish the technology for creating a
suitable deep underground heat exchange zone from which the heat could be
withdrawn.
The Department and an industrial consortium are jointly funding a study of
the technical and financial viability of a tidal energy barrage in the Severn
estuary, which would be financed, built and operated by the private sector.
The Department's work on passive solar design has shown that this could
meet a significant proportion of the demand for space heating in buildings, and
the adoption of effective passive design features is being encouraged.
Biofuels offer possibly the largest contribution from the renewable energy
resources in the medium term. The main work of the Department's programme
is on the demonstration of the various technologies involved.
Non-fuel Minerals
Although much of Britain's requirements of industrial raw materials is met by
imports, non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make an important contribution
to the economy. Output of non-fuel minerals in 1983 totalled 307 million
tonnes, valued at £1,293 million. The total number of employees in the
extraction industry was 35,000 in 1983. The geographical locations of some of
the more important minerals produced in Britain are shown on the maps on
p 282.
Exploring for and exploiting indigenous mineral resources to meet the needs of
industry are being encouraged by the Government to enhance security of
supplies. The British Geological Survey is carrying out a long-term programme
for the Department of Trade and Industry aimed at identifying areas with the
potential for economic extraction of minerals.
The tonnage extracted of some of the main non-fuel minerals produced in
Britain is given in Table 23. In terms of value, production of common sand and
gravel was estimated at £378 million in 1983, limestone and dolomite £332
million, clays £211 million, igneous rock £131 million, salt £44 million,
sandstone £53 million, potash £32 million, tin £27 million, gypsum and
anhydrite £15 million, fluorspar £13 million and chalk £11 million. Britain is a
major world producer of several important industrial minerals including china
clay, ball clay, fuller's earth, celestite and gypsum, and also produces significant
amounts of limestone, dolomite, chalk, fluorspar, potash, salt, industrial sands,
fireclay, common clay and shale, barytes and talc, mostly for home consump¬
tion. Small amounts of diatomite, slate, calcspar, chert and flint, anhydrite and
china stone are also produced. In 1983 the production of metal from non-ferrous
ores totalled 17,000 tonnes, mainly lead mostly from northern England, and
zinc and tin from Cornwall—the Cornish mines satisfying about half of Britain's
demand for primary tin. Small amounts of copper and silver are produced in
association with tin and zinc. Planning permission is being sought to develop a
large opencast tungsten mine at Hemerdon (near Plymouth).
Production of sand, gravel and crushed rock (from limestone, igneous rock
and sandstone) as aggregates for use in construction constitutes over half, by
value, of Britain's output of non-fuel minerals. Britain is the world's second
largest producer of marine-dredged sand and gravel (15-8 million tonnes in
1983).

"Great Britain only.
Water
Britain's water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial
requirements. Supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as
mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds and river
intakes (one-third comes from rivers), and partly from underground sources by
means of wells, adits and boreholes. Water consumption in Britain amounted to
about 19,300 megalitres (Ml) a day in 1983 and average daily consumption per
head was nearly 345 litres. About 99 per cent of the population in Great Britain
and over 96 per cent in Northern Ireland are connected to the public water
supply system.
In general, householders pay for their domestic water supply, sewerage and
sewage disposal services through charges based on the rateable value of their
property, whereas industrial users are charged for their water supply according
to actual metered consumption. Since 1983 optional metering for domestic
users has been available throughout England and Wales.
In England and Wales the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales
are jointly responsible for policy in relation to the conservation, augmentation,
distribution and proper use of water resources and provision of water supplies:
the provision of sewerage and sewage disposal services: the restoration and
maintenance of the wholesomeness of rivers and other inland waters: and the
use of inland waters for navigation and recreation. The Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales are responsible for policy
relating to land drainage, and the protection and development of fisheries.
Nine regional water authorities in England and the Welsh Water Authority in
Wales are responsible for the management of water services: the development of
water resources; water distribution and supply; the prevention of pollution;
sewerage; sewage treatment: river management; land drainage: sea defences;
recreation; and freshwater fisheries. The Government is considering plans for

the privatisation of the water authorities. District councils usually act as agents
of water authorities for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of
public sewers in their areas.
There are 29 statutory water supply companies, accounting for about
one-quarter of total supplies, operating under the Water Act 1973.
Special arrangements govern the relationship of these companies to the water
authorities.
Some 30,300 Ml a day were abstracted in England and Wales in 1983, of which
public water supplies accounted for 16,350 Ml a day. The Central Electricity
Generating Board took 8,250 Ml a day primarily for cooling in connection with
electricity generation, other industry 4,450 Ml a day and the remainder was
used in agriculture. Water authorities' estimated revenue for 1985—86 is some
£2,450 million.
Water authorities have powers to restrict consumption when there are severe
water shortages. Under the Drought Act 1976 they can limit or prohibit the use
of water and, if necessary, restrict domestic water supplies.
In Scotland responsibility for public water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal
rests with the nine regional and three islands councils. In addition, the Central
Scotland Water Development Board is primarily responsible for developing large
water sources and supplying water in bulk to its five constituent member
authorities, the regional councils in central Scotland.
Scotland has a relative abundance of unpolluted water from upland sources.
About 815 million cubic metres of water were abstracted in Scotland in 1983 for
public water supplies. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for the
promotion of the conservation of water resources and the provision by water
authorities of adequate water supplies, and also has a duty to promote the
cleanliness of rivers and other inland waters and the tidal waters of Scotland.
The Water Service of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland is
responsible for water supply and sewerage throughout Northern Ireland. The
Department is also responsible for the conservation, cleanliness and planned
development of Northern Ireland's water resources. Northern Ireland has
abundant potential supplies of water for both domestic and industrial use. An
average of 682 Ml of water a day was supplied in 1984.
Investment is taking place to ensure that there is an adequate water supply to
meet future demand. Recent projects have included the Kielder Reservoir in
Northumberland, officially opened in 1982, one of the largest man-made
reservoirs in Europe. In 1984—85 capital expenditure on water supply, sewerage
and sewage disposal amounted to some £740 million in England and Wales, £96
million in Scotland and £26 million in Northern Ireland.
The central research organisation for the water industry in Britain is the Water
Research Centre. Its membership includes water undertakings, consulting
engineers, manufacturers and overseas organisations. It has three laboratories:
at Stevenage (Hertfordshire), which deals with water and waste water treatment;
at Medmenham (Buckinghamshire), which is concerned with environmental
protection (including water quality and pollution); and at Swindon (Wiltshire),
which is concerned with instrumentation, water mains and sewers. Other
organisations conducting research include Hydraulics Research Limited, uni¬
versities, the Meteorological Office and the Natural Environment Research
Council.

Fisheries
and Forestry
Agriculture
British agriculture is noted for its high level of efficiency and productivity.
Employing less than 3 per cent of the working population, the industry produces
nearly two-thirds of Britain's food requirements compared with just under a half
in 1960, and four-fifths of that which can be grown in a temperate climate
compared with nearly two-thirds in 1960. The food share of Britain's total
imports has fallen from about a quarter in the 1960s to around 10 per cent in
1984. Gross output in 1984 was £12.349 million, about 4-5 per cent of gross
domestic product. Britain is also a major exporter of agricultural produce and
food products, agro-chemicals and agricultural machinery.
The Government aims to foster an efficient and competitive agriculture
industry through the provision and sponsorship of research, development and
advisory services, the provision of financial support where appropriate,
measures to control disease, pests and pollution, and improved marketing
arrangements for food and food products. It also encourages the industry to
adopt high standards on animal welfare and on the protection of wildlife
and the countryside, and assists it in contributing to the rural economy.
Land Use Just over three-quarters of the land area is used for agriculture, the rest being
mountain, forest or put to urban and other uses. The area of agricultural land
has been declining, although there has been a net reduction in the rate of loss in
recent years. For England, the average annual loss of agricultural land to
development or other uses in the five years to June 1983 was an estimated
14,000 hectares (35,000 acres). The land in urban use is about 15 per cent of the
agricultural land. There are 12 million hectares (30 million acres) under crops
and grass. In hill country, where the area of cultivated land is often small, some
6 million hectares (over 15 million acres) are also used for rough grazing. Soils
vary from the thin poor ones of highland Britain to the rich fertile soils of
low-lying areas such as the fenlands of eastern England. The cool temperate
climate and the even distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season:
streams rarely dry up and grassland is green throughout the year.
Farming The average area (including rough grazing) of full-time businesses of 250
standard man-days1 or more is 122 hectares (300 acres). In 1984 there were
some 239.000 farm holdings and it is estimated that some 90 per cent of total
output came from full-time businesses capable of providing full-time

employment for at least one person and that these represent just under half the
total number of holdings. Large businesses of 1.000 standard man-days or
more, although accounting for only 13 per cent of holdings, provided about half
the total output. In Wales and Northern Ireland, output from smaller farms is
more significant than in the rest of Britain.
In England, Scotland and Wales, 69 per cent of holdings are wholly or mainly
owner-occupied. Virtually all the farms in Northern Ireland are owner-occupied.
The number of people engaged in agriculture is just over 690,000. The labour
force continues to decline slightly, and the level of mechanisation to increase.
Labour productivity rose by 65 per cent between 1974 and 1984. Investment has
increased the level of capital per person employed in the industry which is now
about the same as in manufacturing industry compared with 80 per cent in
1960. Total farming income in 1984 was an estimated £1,826 million.
There are over half a million tractors and some 57,000 combine harvesters in
use. A wide variety of other machines for harvesting and preservation of grass
are also employed. Horticultural crops such as blackcurrants and brussels
sprouts are frequently harvested by machine, and milking machines are used on
the vast majority of dairy farms. The majority of farms have a direct electricity
supply, the remainder having their own generators.
Although dairy herd monitoring and account analysis have been computer¬
ised for many years, the recent introduction of the microcomputer has produced
major changes in farm business management. Budgeting and the monitoring of
cash-flow and performance are now frequently computerised, while computer
models of typical farms allow a wide range of crops and livestock to be
considered, along with demands for labour, land, capital and buildings. The
Government provides a topical information service to farmers and growers
through the Prestel viewdata service.
Home production of the principal foods is shown as a percentage by weight of
total supplies (that is, output plus imports minus exports) in Table 24.

About three-fifths of full-time farms are devoted mainly to dairying or beef cattle
and sheep. The majority of sheep and cattle are reared in the hill and moorland
areas of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and northern and south-western
England. Beef fattening occurs partly in better grassland areas, as does
dairying, and partly in yards on arable farms. British livestock breeders have
developed many of the cattle, sheep and pig breeds with world-wide reputations,
for example, the Hereford and Aberdeen Angus beef breeds, the Jersey, Guernsey

and Ayrshire dairy breeds. Large White pigs and a number of sheep breeds.
Because of developments in artificial insemination and embryo transfer, Britain
is able to export semen and embryos from high-quality donor animals.
Table 25 shows the number of livestock and output of livestock products.
Most dairy cattle in England and Wales and a significant proportion in Scotland
and Northern Ireland are bred by artificial insemination. The average size of
dairy herds in Britain was 58 in 1984 while the average yield of milk per dairy
cow has increased from 3,352 litres (737 gallons) in 1964 to 4,748 litres (1,044
gallons) in 1984, a rise of 42 per cent. Average household consumption of milk
per head in 1984 was 2 litres (3-5 pints) per week.
About two-thirds of home-fed beef production derives from the national dairy
herd, in which the Friesian breed is predominant. Although Friesians make up a
large part ol Britain's beef supplies, small numbers of other dairy breeds and
some breeds recently introduced from Europe are also used for beef production.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep production with more than 40 breeds and
many crosses between them. Research has provided vaccine and serum
protection against nearly all the epidemic diseases. Although lamb production is
the main source of income for sheep farmers, wool is also important.
Grass supplies 60 to 80 per cent of the feed for cattle and sheep; grass
production has been enhanced by the increased use of fertilisers, irrigation and
methods of grazing control, and improved herbage conservation for winter feed.
Rough grazings are used for extensively grazed sheep and cattle, producing
young animals for fattening elsewhere.

Pig production occurs in most areas but is particularly important in eastern and
northern England. There is an increasing concentration into specialist units
and larger herds. Artificial insemination is available throughout Britain.
Output of poultry meat and eggs has continued to benefit from better
husbandry and genetic improvements. Since 1974 poultry meat production has
increased by almost a third and reached about 855,000 tonnes in 1984.
Production of broilers from holdings of over 100,000 birds accounts for just over
a half of total production. In 1984, egg production was over 1,000 million dozen.
About two-thirds of laying birds are in flocks of 20,000 or more. Britain remains
broadly self-sufficient in poultry meat and eggs.

Animal
Crops
Welfare It is an offence to cause unnecessary pain or distress to livestock on commercial
farms. Regulations control such operations as castration and tail docking, and
require owners of intensive units to arrange for the daily inspection of their
stock and the equipment on which it depends. There are advisory codes and
recommendations for the welfare of all major species of farm animals and
compliance with them is monitored by the State Veterinary Service. The welfare
of farm animals is also protected by regulations.
The Farm Animal Welfare Council, an independent body set up by the
Government, keeps under review the welfare of farm animals on agricultural
land, at markets, in transit and at the place of slaughter.
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops are found mainly in eastern
and central southern England and eastern Scotland. Large-scale potato and
vegetable production is undertaken in the fens (in Cambridgeshire and south
Lincolnshire), the alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and Humber and the
peaty lands in south Lancashire. Early potatoes are an important crop in
south-west Wales, Kent and south-west England. High-grade seed potatoes are
grown in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

About a quarter of the wheat crop is normally used for flour milling, and about
one-third for animal feed. Between 15 and 20 per cent of the barley crop is used
for malting and distilling and just over 40 per cent for animal feed. Exports of
wheat and barley are increasing substantially and account for about a quarter of
total production. There has been a rapid increase in the oilseed rape crop; the
seed is crushed to obtain vegetable oil and the solid matter left is used for animal
feed.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet provides about 50 per cent of requirements,
most of the remainder being refined from raw sugar imported from developing
countries under the Lome Convention.
In 1984 the land utilised for horticulture was about 245,320 hectares (606,200
acres), of which vegetables grown in the open (excluding potatoes) accounted for
176,610 hectares (436,420 acres), orchards for 35,990 hectares (88,930 acres),
small fruit for 16,840 hectares (41.610 acres), bulbs and flowers grown in the
open for 5,120 hectares (12,640 acres) and hardy nursery stock for 7,010
hectares (17,315 acres). Crops grown in glasshouses accounted for 3,760
hectares (9,280 acres).
Field vegetables account for some 43 per cent of the value of horticultural
output and are widely grown throughout the country. Most horticultural
enterprises are increasing output per unit area with the help of improved
planting material, new techniques and the widespread use of machinery. Some
field vegetables, for example, are raised in blocks of compressed peat or
loose-filled cells, a technique which reduces root damage and allows plants to
establish themselves more reliably and evenly.
Glasshouses are used for growing tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, flowers, pot
plants and nursery stock. Widespread use is being made of automatic control of
heating and ventilation, and semi-automatic control of watering. Energy-
efficient glasshouses use thermal screens and other methods, while low-cost
plastic tunnels extend the season for certain crops previously grown in the open.
Under the European Community’s Common Agricultural Policy (see p 290). a
wide range of horticultural produce is subject to common quality standards.
The Government is keen to encourage the growth of exports related to
agriculture and their value is increasing in real terms; they amounted to £5,487
million in 1984, of which exports of food and drink accounted for £4,456
million, with the main markets being Western Europe, North America and the
Middle East. Exports include speciality products such as fresh salmon, Scotch
whisky, biscuits, jams and conserves, as well as beef and lamb carcasses and
cheese. Food from Britain, a national marketing organisation responsible for
improving the marketing of British produce in home and overseas markets, was
set up in 1983. The British Food Export Council represents its export arm for
fresh and processed food and drink, and identifies suppliers for customers,
organises programmes of visits and meetings for overseas customers, and, with
the British Overseas Trade Board, co-ordinates British pavilions at the world's
major agricultural exhibitions. The British Agricultural Export Council provides
a similar service for the agricultural and horticultural supply industries;
products and services offered by its members include all types of machinery,
seeds, fertilisers, chemicals, feedingstuffs, livestock and semen, veterinary
preparations and equipment, and consultancy. In 1984-85, Britain exported
nearly 95,500 wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors, maintaining its
position as the world's largest exporter.
One of the world's largest agricultural events, the annual Royal International
Agricultural Show, held at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, provides an opportunity

for overseas visitors to see what British agriculture has to offer. A typical
attendance for the four open days is 200,000 including 1 1,000 from overseas.
Virtually every British agricultural machinery manufacturer is represented at
the show, which is also the most important pedigree livestock event in the
country. The show's specialised sections cover livestock improvement, farm
mechanisation including working demonstrations of agricultural equipment,
electronics, arable cropping, horticulture, forestry, new technology and re¬
search, tropical agricultural applications and a food hall. Other major agricul¬
tural displays include the annual Royal Smithfield Show, held in London, which
exhibits agricultural machinery, livestock and carcasses, and the annual Royal
Highland Show held in June at Ingliston near Edinburgh. There are also several
important regional shows.
Agricultural products are marketed by private traders, producers' co-operatives
and marketing boards, the latter being producers' organisations (each including
a minority of independent members appointed by agriculture ministers) with
certain statutory powers to regulate the marketing of milk, wool and potatoes.
Most boards buy from producers or control contracts between first buyers; the
Potato Marketing Board, however, maintains only a broad control over
marketing conditions leaving producers free to deal individually with buyers.
For home-grown cereals, meat and livestock, apples and pears, and eggs, there
are marketing organisations representing producer, distributor and indepen¬
dent interests.
Food from Britain is responsible for improving the marketing of food and
agricultural products, both at home and abroad.
Substantial investment—in 1984-85 new fixed assets totalled £12-2 million—is
being made by agricultural and horticultural co-operatives concerned with
marketing and storing products. A number of central co-operative grain stores
have been established, and new vegetable groups have been formed to meet the
demand from retailers for a continuous supply of fresh, quality produce: fruit
marketing co-operatives are also expanding. Food from Britain provides a full
range of advisory services for co-operatives and the Government assists their
development with grants.
Four government departments are responsible for agricultural policy—the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries for Scotland, the Welsh Office and the Department of Agriculture for
Northern Ireland.
The stated aims of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy,
which accounts for about two-thirds of the Community's budget, are to increase
agricultural productivity and thereby to ensure that farmers have a fair standard
of living, to stabilise the agricultural market, to guarantee regular supplies of
food and to provide these supplies at a reasonable price.
Decisions on the level of price support are taken annually by the Council of
Ministers on the basis of proposals presented by the European Commission. For
many commodities these measures consist of a minimum intervention price at
which agencies of the member states will purchase production, thereby putting
a floor in the market, and levies made on imports to prevent internal support
prices from being undermined. Schemes may be introduced for subsidised
disposal of stocks to consumers within the Community where this can be done
without disrupting internal markets. The export of surpluses is subsidised
through export refunds to enable Community exporters to sell on world markets
at the going price. There is also provision for certain direct payments, including
beef and sheepmeat premiums, to producers.

The support price levels, as well as rates of levy and subsidy, are set in
European Currency Units and are converted into the currencies of the member
states at fixed rates of exchange (commonly called ‘green rates') which do not
vary automatically in line with changes in market exchange rates. The green
rates can thus be out of line with the market rate of exchange between each
currency and the European Currency Unit, giving rise to different real support
price levels in the different member states. Monetary compensatory amounts,
based on the percentage difference between the green and market rates of each
currency, are applied to prevent distortions in trade. They operate as import
subsidies and export levies for countries whose currencies' market rates are
below the green rates, and as import levies and export subsidies in the opposite
case.
The British Government has sought to obtain improvements in the operation
of the Common Agricultural Policy and, following considerable discussion
among its member states, the Community agreed to control agricultural
spending from 1986 to ensure that expenditure on market support will grow at a
slower rate than the Community's own resource base. Progress was also made in
containing the costs of the Policy in 1984 when real prices in the Community
were reduced, new guarantee thresholds fixed for a number of commodities, and
milk quotas introduced. The British Government pressed for realistic prices to
be agreed in 1985 and the cost of the compromise price package was within the
Community's financial guidelines. In recent years the percentage increase in
guaranteed agricultural spending has been reduced from 28-3 per cent in 1983
to 8-4 per cent for 1985, the rise in the provisional draft budget for 1986 being
2-5 per cent.
The Community’s agricultural expenditure is channelled through the Euro¬
pean Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. The Fund's guarantee section
finances market support arrangements, while the guidance section provides
funds for structural reform, for example, farm modernisation and investment,
and payments to assist certain farmers to change to alternative enterprises.
Expenditures in Britain in 1984—85 on price guarantees, grants and subsidies
and on Common Agricultural Policy market regulations were estimated to be
£356 million and £1,424 million respectively. About £1,140 million was
reimbursed from the Community budget.
Potatoes and wool are not covered by the Common Agricultural Policy; price
guarantees for potatoes are operated through the Potato Marketing Board and
the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, and a price stabilisation
fund for wool is administered by the British Wool Marketing Board.
Producers also receive support through certain capital and production grants,
some based on Community decisions. Grants are available to assist farmers and
horticulturists with their development plans and capital investment, and there
is special financial help for hill and upland farmers in the form of headage
payments on cattle and sheep (known as compensatory allowances). Community
assistance may also be made to help to improve facilities for the marketing and
processing oi agricultural products and to provide a premium payment to
specialised beel producers, while launching aid is available to production and
marketing groups in the horticultural sector.
Local authorities provide some 6,785 statutory smallholdings in England and
958 in Wales. They make loans of up to 75 per cent of required working capital to
their tenants. Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the
Government, which, while now seeking to dispose of holdings to sitting tenants,
still owns and maintains about 124,000 hectares (306,000 acres) of land
settlement estates, comprising some 1,660 crofts and holdings.

Within the crofting areas of Scotland (in Strathclyde, Highland, Western Isles,
Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands) much of the land is held by tenants known
as crofters. Crofting is administered by the Crofters Commission, and benefits
from government grants for land improvements and some other agricultural
work.
The agricultural holdings legislation protects the interests and rights of
landlords and tenants. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and
tenant and may be varied by agreement or, failing agreement, by arbitration.
Most agricultural tenants have the right to contest a notice to quit, which is
then ineffective unless the landlord obtains consent to its operation from an
independent body (in England and Wales the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in
Scotland the Scottish Land Court). On termination of tenancy, the tenant is
entitled to compensation in accordance with a special code. There are provisions
for succession of a close relative on the death of a tenant but this does not apply
in England and Wales to new tenancies coming into effect on or after 12 July
1984.
Practically all farms in Northern Ireland are owner-occupied, but, under a
system known as ‘conacre', farmers not wishing to farm all their land let it
annually to others. About one-fifth of agricultural land is so let, and is used
mainly for grazing.
Agriculture ministers have a general duty to have regard to the desirability of
conserving the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside, and a specific
duty under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act to further conservation in
exercising certain of their functions relating to agricultural drainage grants.
The Agricultural Development and Advisory Service in England and Wales
advises farmers on, and actively promotes, aspects of conservation such as
wildlife habitats, landscape features and farm buildings, and encourages the
industry to adopt high standards of pollution control. In addition, research
programmes include studies on the ecological impact of pesticides and on
biological methods of pest control and other aspects of environmental protec¬
tion. A countrywide survey of environmental data on farms was initiated in April
1985. Representatives of farming and conservation interests have developed a
network of farming and wildlife advisory groups to provide a forum for
integrating agriculture and conservation.
The Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive is responsible
for enforcing regulations relating to the health and safety of workers in
agriculture. These cover such matters as the guarding of field and stationary
machinery, workplaces, the fitting of safety cabs to tractors, and the use of
chemicals.
In England and Wales the Government's Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) provides a wide range of professional, scientific, technical and
veterinary services for agriculture and its ancillary industries. Most of the
services are free but a charge is made for a proportion of them. Similar services
are provided in Scotland by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and
three regional agricultural colleges and a section of the State Veterinary Service,
which, in England and Wales, is a constituent part of ADAS. In Northern Ireland
these services are available from the Department of Agriculture's advisory
service and specialist divisions, together with agricultural colleges.
ADAS provides information and advice to farmers and growers on such
matters as dairy husbandry, livestock, horticulture, farm management, mecha¬
nisation and agronomy. It identifies problems requiring further investigation

and carries out the necessary research and development. It also advises the
Government on the scientific, technical and business implications of policy
proposals and assists in implementing policies concerning animal and plant
health, disease and pest eradication, land drainage and other capital grant
schemes, and safeguarding agricultural land in relation to other land uses. The
Service runs 19 experimental husbandry farms and horticulture stations, ten
agricultural science laboratories with six sub-centres, two veterinary labora¬
tories and 23 veterinary investigation centres.
The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has endorsed the conclusions
of a 1984 review which recommended that ADAS should concentrate more of its
research and development activities on development, be committed to the use of
computer-based information technology as a means of providing information
and advice to the industry, and give more emphasis to conservation and animal
welfare work; and that the industry should contribute more to the cost of the
advisory and other services from which it benefits.
England, Scotland and Wales are free from many serious animal diseases. If they
were to occur, diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and swine vesicular
disease would be combated by a slaughter policy applied to all infected animals
and those exposed to infection, and by control over animal movements during
the outbreaks. Rigorous measures are being taken to eradicate sheep scab and
warble fly. The incidence of bovine tuberculosis is very low; cattle (except for
certain categories) are tested at regular intervals, and reactors to the test are
slaughtered, compensation being paid to the owners. Because of compulsory
measures to eradicate brucellosis, begun on an area basis in 1972, England and
Wales were declared free of the disease for all practical purposes in 1981,
following a similar declaration for Scotland in 1980. In September 1984
vaccination replaced slaughter as the means of controlling Newcastle disease in
poultry.
Strict controls are exercised on the import of animals, meat and meat
products, live poultry and other captive birds, and poultry meat, so as to prevent
the introduction of animal or poultry diseases. Special measures apply to
prevent the introduction of rabies, and most animals are subject to import
licence and six months’ quarantine; exceptions to this rule include such farm
animals as pigs, cattle, sheep and goats. There are severe penalties for breaking
the law. There have been no cases of rabies outside quarantine in Britain since
1970.
Northern Ireland has been kept free from the major animal diseases, including
rabies, foot-and-mouth disease and swine vesicular disease, and in 1971 was
declared brucellosis-free.
Professional advice and action on the control of animal disease and the welfare
of farm livestock is the responsibility of the government veterinary services
which have laboratory facilities and investigation centres performing specialist
research work and advising private practitioners responsible for treating
animals on the farm.
The agricultural departments are responsible for limiting the spread of plant
pests and diseases and for preventing the introduction of new ones. They also
issue the health certificates required by other countries to accompany plant
material exported from Britain. Certification schemes are operated to encourage
the development of healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks.
The Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 has given the Government
powers to control the supply and use of pesticides in Britain, these replacing the
previous non-statutory arrangement under the Pesticide Safety Precautions
294

Scheme. The Act provides for the creation of a statutory scheme for the approval
of pesticides on the basis of their safety, efficacy and, where necessary,
humaneness in use. It also provides for controls on the import, sale, supply,
storage, distribution, advertisement and use of pesticides, and for the release of
information to the public about pesticides. The measures will come into force
during 1986 and future years.
The manufacture, sale and supply of veterinary medicinal products is prohibited
except under licence. Licences are issued by the agriculture ministers, who are
advised on safety, quality and efficacy by the Veterinary Products Committee
comprising independent experts.
The Agricultural and Food Research Council, the Government and private
industry are responsible for the research effort. There is a network of institutes
financed by the Council and seven Scottish agricultural research institutes
supported by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and advised by the
Council. Known as the Agricultural and Food Research Service, this network
currently conducts work valued at £120 million annually.
The Council, an autonomous body, receives funds from the science budget,
through the Department of Education and Science, and income from work
commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Some funds
are also received from industry and other outside bodies. The Council is
responsible for research in its own institutes, two of which are in Scotland, and
in the grant-aided independent institutes in England and Wales. The pro¬
grammes of these 22 institutes cover the areas of animal breeding, animal
disease, animal nutrition and production, plant breeding and genetics, crop
protection, soils and crop nutrition, crop production, food science and
engineering; there is also a computing centre which controls a network linking
all institutes. Broadly similar areas are covered by the seven Scottish research
institutes controlled by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries but the
research is directed particularly to the needs of northern Britain. Research in
Northern Ireland is carried out by the Department of Agriculture in association
with the Queen’s University of Belfast: three agricultural colleges also cover
applied research in agricultural science and food technology.
The Council also has a number of units and groups associated with
universities, and through its research grant schemes, supports projects in
universities, polytechnics and colleges.
Genetic manipulation is a high priority in the Council programme and, apart
from contributing to a basic understanding of plant processes at the molecular
level, is applied in a variety of scientific areas, from animal vaccine production to
the development of new plant varieties. Other research within the Council's
institutes has led to the development of embryo cleavage and transplantation in
commercial animal husbandry, so that animals with desirable characteristics
can be multiplied much more rapidly than by conventional means. Some of the
techniques can also be applied to transport embryos between countries, thereby
avoiding the risk of carrying disease which may occur when live adult farm
animals are moved. An international vaccine bank for emergency control of
foot-and-mouth disease is held at one of the Council’s institutes.
Some 80 per cent of the British wheat acreage and about half the potato
acreage are planted with varieties bred by the publicly financed research
programme. Investigations into the relationship of chemical structure to
insecticidal activity of some naturally occurring insecticides have led to the
development of a completely new class of insecticides, the pyrethroids, which are
used world-wide. A combination of research in plant breeding, physiology.

University and other degree and postgraduate courses provide training in the
scientific and technological aspects of agriculture and horticulture, the empha¬
sis being on science and economics. There are also degree and postgraduate
courses in veterinary medicine. Science-based sandwich courses, leading to a
Business and Technician Education Council (BTEC) Higher National Diploma
and available at agricultural colleges, are designed for students wishing to enter
farming or horticulture with a good knowledge of the managerial and
technological aspects of the industry. The three-year BTEC National Diploma,
also organised on a sandwich basis, is a general course in agriculture with some
colleges offering special subjects such as arable farming, livestock production,
dairy farming and farm mechanisation. Both diploma courses, validated by the
BTEC, normally require 12 months' previous practical experience. In addition,
there are one-year full-time National Certificate courses providing a basic
education in agriculture or horticulture, and a one- or two-year part-time
practical course in the basic principles of agriculture, horticulture or forestry
followed by more specialised study. In Scotland new and restructured courses
have replaced the Higher and Ordinary National Diplomas.
In Great Britain the Agricultural Training Board runs the Agricultural and
Horticultural Training Scheme, which can lead to the issue of craft certificates
or to a full apprenticeship. The scheme is flexible to allow mature workers to
participate as well as young people entering agriculture and horticulture
through youth training schemes. In Northern Ireland agricultural training
courses are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture.
Fisheries
Britain is one of Europe's most important fishing nations. The fishing industry
provides about 66 per cent of British fish supplies, and is an important source of
employment and income in a number of ports. In 1984 there were 16,150
fishermen in regular employment and nearly 5,800 occasionally employed. The
Government aims to encourage the development of a viable, efficient and
market-orientated fisheries industry within the framework of the European
Community's Common Fisheries Policy. The main concerns of government
fisheries policy are conservation and exploitation of sea fish stocks, financial
support for fleet modernisation and other measures, the improvement of the
industry's technical and economic performance, the development of a viable fish
farming industry, and protection of the aquatic environment.
In 1984 demersal fish caught on or near the bottom of the sea accounted for
about 54 per cent by weight of total British landings, pelagic fish caught near
the surface for 36 per cent and shellfish for 10 per cent. Landings of all types of
fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British fishing vessels totalled 734,000
tonnes. Cod and haddock each accounted for 27 per cent of the total value of
demersal and pelagic fish landed, while whiting (10 per cent), mackerel (8 per
cent) and plaice (6 per cent) were the other most important sources of earnings
to the industry.
The British fish farming industry is a substantial and expanding business
mainly concerned with the production of salmon and trout although shellfish
and eel farming are growing. Estimated production in 1984 was 12,000 tonnes
of trout and 4,000 tonnes of salmon.
Imports of fresh, frozen, cured and canned fish and shellfish in 1984 totalled
361,527 tonnes, those of fish meal 173,348 tonnes and those of fish oils

230,667 tonnes. Exports and re-exports of fish and fish products amounted to
295,170 tonnes. Following a British initiative, member states of the European
Community banned from January 1982 the import of primary whale products in
order to help to conserve whale populations.
Some 75 per cent of the British catch is taken by the 6.920 vessels of the inshore
fleet employing a variety of catching methods. The deep-sea fleet, comprising
220 larger vessels, has been reduced in number as fishing opportunities and the
profitability of operations in distant waters have declined. Recently the mackerel
and herring stock off the west coast have provided alternative fisheries for the
larger vessels.
The fisheries departments are responsible for the administration of legislation
concerning the fishing industry and for fisheries research. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels and other matters common to shipping
generally are provided for under legislation administered by the Department of
Transport.
The Sea Fish Industry Authority provides financial aid for the purchase of new
fishing vessels, vessel improvements, the provision and improvement of
processing plants, cold stores and ice plants and towards the formation of
fishermen's eo-operatives. Other functions include research and development,
training, dissemination of information, publicity and promotion.
Community countries, and certain non-Community countries having fishery
agreements with the Community, may fish up to Britain’s 12-mile limit.
Designated Community countries may also fish in specified areas of Britain's
6-to-12-mile zone. No foreign vessels may fish within Britain’s 6-mile limit.
With the extension of fishery limits to 200 miles in the mid-1970s, new
arrangements became necessary to control Community fishing in the greatly
extended area. Britain has a particularly strong interest in such control, since a
sizeable proportion of the total catch within the 200-mile limits of member
states is taken in British waters, while the loss of fishing opportunities in
distant waters (such as Iceland) has reduced the British industry's total catch
more than that of other Community states.
In January 1983 member states reached an agreement on a common fisheries
policy providing for new arrangements on access to coastal waters applicable for
a period of at least 20 years. Its other features include a revised marketing
regime, regulations covering technical conservation measures such as mesh
sizes for nets, the allocation of catch quotas among member states within each
year's total allowable catch, effective enforcement of the rules and financial aid to
promote the adaptation and development of the Community fishing fleet and the
fish farming industry.
Fishery relations between the European Community and other countries are
governed by long-term framework agreements. Reciprocal agreements are in
force with Norway, the Faroe Islands, Sweden and Spain. Non-reciprocal
agreements are in force with Canada, the United States, Senegal, Guinea-
Bissau, Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe and the Seychelles.
Quotas have also been established in international waters in the north-west
Atlantic.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a research directorate
comprising laboratories dealing with marine and freshwater fisheries, shellfish,
marine pollution, fish farming and diseases. Work on the utilisation of fish is

undertaken by a research station at Torry. Aberdeen. There are also two
seagoing research vessels. In Scotland the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries maintains laboratories on marine and freshwater fisheries research as
well as three seagoing vessels. The two research programmes are co-ordinated.
Department of Agriculture laboratories in Northern Ireland monitor marine and
freshwater fisheries.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout. Sea fishing for
salmon is prohibited in waters outside a limit of six miles from the coasts of the
British Isles. In Scotland, salmon fishing is a private right. In England and
Wales, water authority licences are required for coastal and estuary netting.
Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 2-1 million hectares (5-2 million acres): about 7-3
per cent of England, 12-6 per cent of Scotland and 11-6 per cent of Wales. The
Government supports the continued expansion of forestry in order to reduce
dependence on imports of timber and to provide employment in forestry and
related industries.
The area of productive forest in Great Britain is 2 million hectares (4-94
million acres), just under half of which is managed by the Forestry Commission
and the rest by private owners. The rate of new planting in 1984 was 8,400
hectares (20,750 acres) by the Commission and some 16,900 hectares (41,740
acres) by private woodland owners mainly in Scotland. Most planting is of
conifers in upland areas though the planting of broadleaved trees is encouraged
on suitable sites. An increasing proportion of new planting is being done by
private owners.
Total employment in state and private forests in Great Britain was estimated
at about 26,000 in 1984.
British woodlands meet only 10 per cent of the nation's consumption of wood
and wood products. At present only just over half of the Commission's
woodlands are in production. Home timber production, however, is expected to
double over the next 20 years.
The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority in Great Britain. The
Commissioners give advice on forestry matters and are responsible to the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for
Scotland and Wales. In pursuing timber production, forestry policy also takes
into account amenity, environmental and employment criteria, and the
Commission's activities include wildlife conservation, the landscaping of
plantations and the provision of facilities for recreation. The Commission has
also encouraged the setting up of new timber-using industries.
The Government has asked the Commission to sell some of its land and
plantations in order to rationalise its holdings with a view to improving the
Commission’s efficiency and the commercial effectiveness of the forestry
enterprise. Holdings have been reduced by 78,000 hectares (192,700 acres) as a
result of sales. The Commission is financed partly by the Government and partly
by receipts from sales of timber and other produce and from rents.
A substantial number of private woods are in ownerships of under 100 hectares
(250 acres) in extent. The Government encourages private forestry through
appropriate tax reliefs. There is also a forestry grant scheme under which the
Commission aids planting by private owners.

Degree courses in forestry and associated studies are provided at three
universities and there are supervisory, craft and managerial level courses. The
Forestry Training Council, set up by the Forestry Commission, assists the
development of systematic training and the co-ordination of training in the state
and private sectors. The Furniture and Timber Industry Training Board is
concerned with training for private sector employees in the home timber trade.
Forestry research is carried out by the Commission at two research stations.
Aid is also given for research work in universities and other institutions,
including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute in Oxford.
The Department of Agriculture may acquire land for afforestation and give
financial and technical assistance for private planting. Financial provision is
made annually by Parliament.
The state forest area has grown steadily since 1945. By 1984, 73,000 hectares
(180,000 acres) of plantable land had been acquired, of which 55,000 hectares
(135,900 acres) were planted. There were about 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres)
of privately owned forest. Some 450 people work in state forests.
15 Transport and
Communications
ROADS
Major improvements in the movement of passengers and freight have resulted
from the construction of a network of motorways, the extension of fast inter-city
rail services (such as those operated by high-speed trains), the modernisation of
many ports, the increased use of containers and other modern methods in
shipping, the use by airlines of more efficient and quieter aircraft and expansion
schemes at many airports. Communications are benefiting from developments
in microelectronics, computer and satellite technology, and advances in
materials, for example, the application of optical fibres in telecommunications.
While major sectors of transport and communications operations are publicly
owned, the Government is arranging for the introduction of private capital into
a number of them as part of its policy of reducing state involvement as much as
possible.
Inland Transport
Passenger and freight traffic is carried mainly by road. At the end of 1984 there
were 20-8 million vehicles licensed for use on the roads of Great Britain, of
which 17-7 million were private cars and light goods vehicles, 06 million heavy
goods vehicles, 1-2 million motor cycles, scooters and mopeds, and 116,000
public road passenger vehicles (including taxis). Private ownership of cars has
been growing rapidly for many years and the car is the most popular form of
transport. Buses and coaches account for about 8 per cent of passenger mileage
within Great Britain, rail for 7 per cent and air 0-6 per cent. Road haulage has a
dominant position in the movement of inland freight, accounting for about 82
per cent of tonnage carried and for nearly three-fifths of tonne-km. Railways,
inland waterways, coastal shipping and pipelines are important in carrying
certain types of freight, particularly bulk goods.
Transport policy rests on the fundamental aims of promoting economic
growth and higher national prosperity, and ensuring a reasonable level of
personal mobility, while improving safety (particularly on the roads), minimis¬
ing damage to the environment and using energy economically. Britain is taking
an active part in the development of a common transport policy by the European
Community.
Motor vehicle traffic in Great Britain is continuing to grow, having risen by 4 per
cent in 1984 to some 274,500 million vehicle-km, of which cars and taxis
accounted for 81 per cent. Improvements are continually being made in the
network of trunk roads (which form a basic network linking major centres of
population, industrial areas and ports) to accommodate the growth in traffic. A
number of motorways (roads specially designed for long-distance traffic) have
been built, while other improvements, such as the construction of bypasses,
have helped to make travelling easier and faster, particularly over long distances
and between cities, and have relieved many towns and villages of heavy through

traffic. Although motorways account for less than 1 per cent of road mileage,
they carry nearly 13 per cent of traffic including 28 per cent of heavy goods
vehicle traffic. Motorways have attracted a greater volume of traffic (particularly
heavy lorries) than originally expected, necessitating the structural renewal of a
number of the older sections.
In 1984 the road network totalled some 370,700 km (230,300 miles), of which
2,907 km (1,806 miles) were motorways (see Table 27).

a In addition, there were 79 km (49 miles) of local authority motorway in England and 24 km (15 miles) in
Scotland. In April 1985 some 132 km (82 miles) of trunk motorway were under construction in England and 8 km
<5 miles) in Scotland.
The main aims of the Government's programme to improve trunk roads are to
meet the needs of industry, to keep heavy lorry traffic away from towns and
villages, and to improve road safety. In England the main priorities are the final
stages of the M25 London orbital route (which will be completed in 1986) and
routes to serve industry and improve access to ports on the east and south
coasts. In Wales the priorities are to reconstruct the coast road in north Wales
and improve roads which are important for industrial redevelopment. Although
most of the motorway and dual carriageway network in central Scotland has
been completed, an extension to the southern end of the M74 is under
construction. Other priorities are the improvement of strategic routes such as
those to the north and north-east (which are important for North Sea oil-related
activities), some of the west-coast routes, and the construction of more
bypasses. In Northern Ireland the emphasis is on building new links to the
motorway network, constructing more bypasses, and improving roads in the
Belfast area and other urban areas. Priority for new roads in urban areas of
Great Britain is being given to those designed to meet the needs of industry and
commerce, serve new industrial or housing estates, provide links to the national
trunk road network or to complement traffic management schemes.
Responsibility for trunk road motorways and other trunk roads in Great Britain
rests in England with the Secretary of State for Transport, in Scotland with the
Secretary of State for Scotland and in Wales with the Secretary of State for Wales.
The costs of construction, improvement and maintenance are paid for by central
government. The highway authority for non-trunk roads in England and Wales
is, in general, the county council in whose area the roads lie, and in Scotland the
regional or islands council. In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Depart¬
ment of the Environment is responsible for public roads and their maintenance
and construction.

Research into all aspects of road construction, traffic engineering and
safety, and into problems associated with transport is carried out by the Trans¬
port and Road Research Laboratory, the research arm of the Department of
Transport.
Great Britain's accident record is considerably better than that of most other
countries even though it has one of the highest densities of road traffic in the
world. In 1984, 5,500 people were killed on the roads, about 72,400 seriously
injured and 240,100 slightly injured. A comprehensive framework of legislation
embodied in recent Road Traffic and Transport Acts and summarised in the
Highway Code (which sets out the standard of conduct for road users) has
contributed to the decline in casualty rates. Other factors have been better road
design and construction, segregating vehicles from pedestrians, and campaigns
conducted nationally by government departments and the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents and locally by local authorities to persuade people to
take greater care on the roads.
Comprehensive regulations govern the design of vehicles, their use on the
roads, and the maintenance and testing of their mechanical condition. Under a
national type approval' scheme in Great Britain, all new cars must be of a type
that has been certified as meeting the required standards. Private cars and light
vans which are three or more years old must be tested annually at private
garages authorised as test stations. (In Northern Ireland private cars seven or
more years old are tested at official vehicle inspection centres.) A compulsory
type approval scheme applies to virtually all goods vehicles in Great Britain
manufactured from 1 October 1982 and first used on or after 1 April 1983.
Heavy goods vehicles are subject to annual tests carried out at special testing
stations.
Minimum ages are laid down for driving: 16 for riders of mopeds and disabled
drivers of specially adapted vehicles: 17 for driving cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats (including that of the driver), motor cycles and
goods vehicles not over 3-5 tonnes gross laden weight; 18 for goods vehicles over
3-5 but not over 7-5 tonnes: and 21 for passenger vehicles with over nine seats
and goods vehicles over 7-5 tonnes. All drivers of motor vehicles, except new
residents holding certain non-British licences, are required to pass the driving
test before being granted a full licence to drive. Learners must display 'L' plates
on their vehicle and be accompanied while driving (with certain exceptions) by a
qualified driver. There are national speed limits of 60 mph (97 km/h) on single
carriageway roads and 70 mph (113 km/h) on dual carriageway roads (including
motorways), unless a lower limit is indicated. In built-up areas there is a general
limit of 30 mph (48 km/h).
Other measures directed primarily towards road safety include legislation and
publicity to discourage drinking and driving, computer-controlled warning
signals on most busy motorways to inform motorists of advisory speed limits in
adverse conditions and of lane closures, and regulations governing the carriage
of dangerous goods by road. Several provisions designed to improve road safety
have been implemented under the Transport Act 1981. Breath testing has
become the main means of determining a driver's alcohol level: the statutory
limit of breath alcohol concentration for drivers is 35 microgrammes of alcohol
in 100 millilitres of breath. Provisions to improve the safety of motor cyclists
include the restriction of learner drivers to the less powerful machines, a new
two-part motor-cycle driving test and a limit on the duration of the motor-cycle
provisional licence. Regulations governing the compulsory wearing of seat belts
in the front seats of cars and light vans took effect on 31 January 1983. In the
first 20 months of operation there was a decline of 22 per cent in deaths and
serious injuries among front-seat occupants of these vehicles.

HAULAGE
Structure of
the Industry
Traffic management schemes are being operated in many urban areas to
minimise congestion, create a better environment and improve road safety. They
may include computerised traffic control systems, one-way systems, bus priority
measures, parking controls and limited road construction. Many towns have
shopping precincts which are specially designed for pedestrians and from which
motor vehicles are excluded for all or part of the day. In most town centres
parking is restricted and waiting limits apply. City centres often have controlled
parking zones, where payment is required for on-street parking. An experiment
in central London involving the use of wheel clamps to immobilise illegally
parked vehicles began in 1983 and will continue until 1987 to enable its effects
to be fully assessed.
Urban traffic control systems, with traffic signals controlled by a central
computer, are in operation in 42 cities in Britain. Systems developed by the
Department of Transport and British firms have achieved international repute
and are the most commonly used in the world. The most modern of these
systems, which continuously measures and responds to the flow of traffic, is
already in operation or about to be installed in 13 towns including Coventry,
Maidstone, Southampton, Cambridge and Worcester. It is also in operation in
central London in the first stage of converting the present system covering 1,200
sets of traffic signals.
Road haulage traffic amounted to 96,575 million tonne-km in 1984. There has
been a move towards larger and more efficient vehicles carrying heavier
loads—about 71 per cent of the traffic, in terms of tonne-km, is carried in
vehicles of over 25 tonnes gross laden weight. Much of the traffic is moved over
short distances, with 77'per cent of the tonnage being carried on hauls of
100 km (62 miles) or less. Public haulage (private road hauliers carrying other
firms' goods) accounts for 65 per cent of freight carried in Great Britain in terms
of tonne-km. The growth in road haulage has been concentrated on long¬
distance traffic, particularly international road haulage.
The environmental problems caused by lorries have become a matter of public
concern. The Government has introduced a number of measures to bring
economic benefits and increased protection to the environment and the public.
In 1983 the maximum permitted weight of articulated lorries was increased
from 32-5 to 38 tonnes, subject to the lorries having five axles. Safeguards on
the design of lorries include restrictions on their dimensions, while a number of
measures have been taken to improve the enforcement of lorry weights and
safety. More bypasses are being built to keep lorries away from residential areas.
There is a programme of research and development, involving vehicle and engine
manufacturers, to reduce the noise from heavy lorries to less than half the 1981
level and produce a quiet heavy vehicle for the 1990s. To encourage the use of
railways and inland waterways for the carriage of freight, grants of up to 60 per
cent are available towards the cost of construction or modernisation of privately
owned facilities where there are significant environmental benefits by the
removal of heavy goods vehicle traffic from the roads.
Road haulage is predominantly an industry of small, privately owned
businesses. Many of the 128,400 holders of an operator's licence in 1984 had
only one vehicle and the average size of a vehicle fleet is only about four. The
biggest operator in Great Britain is the National Freight Consortium set up by a
consortium of managers and employees to acquire the National Freight
Company from the Government.
Licensing and Those operating goods vehicles over 3-5 tonnes gross weight (with certain
Other Controls special exemptions) require an operator's licence, obtained on showing good
repute and ability to maintain vehicles properly and control loading and drivers'

hours. Licences are divided into restricted licences for firms carrying their own
goods and standard licences, subdivided into national only’ and 'international',
for hauliers operating for hire or reward. (In Northern Ireland operators carrying
their own goods do not require a licence.) Proof of professional competence is
required to obtain a standard licence. Regulations lay down limits on the hours
worked by drivers of goods vehicles, and there are also minimum rest periods.
Tachographs (which automatically record speed and distance covered, driving
time and stopping periods) must be fitted and used in most goods vehicles
over 3-5 tonnes gross weight in Great Britain. International road haulage is
governed mainly by bilateral agreements which are in force with 26 other
countries.
There has been a long-term decline in the use of local bus services, mainly
because of the growth in ownership of private cars. In 1984 buses or coaches
carried some 5,566 million passengers on local services in Great Britain, 28 per
cent fewer than in 1974. Bus operators have taken action to contain costs and to
improve productivity by increasing the proportion of bus services operated by
one-person vehicles and reducing or rationalising services, particularly in rural
areas. As an alternative to uneconomic bus services, encouragement has been
given to the promotion of unconventional services in rural areas, such as
community buses operated by voluntary drivers, postbuses (Post Office vehicles
carrying mail and passengers) and social car-sharing schemes. However, the
industry's decline has continued, and the Transport Bill (see p 304) contains a
number of measures to stimulate competition in local bus services and increase
private sector participation in the industry.
These measures follow the reforms enacted in the Transport Act 1980, which
removed regulatory restrictions on operating long-distance express coach
services and excursions and tours, allowing free competition between operators.
This had a noticeable effect on long-distance express coach services, bringing
about reductions in fares, the provision of more services and an increase of 40
per cent in the number of passengers carried.
The largest single public sector bus and coach operator in Britain is the National
Bus Company, which operates in England and Wales through more than 50
subsidiaries and has a network of long-distance coach services; it has a fleet of
some 14,000 vehicles. The Scottish Transport Group operates the main bus
services in Scotland outside the major cities and also runs ferries to the islands
off the west coast of Scotland; it has 3.100 vehicles. In Northern Ireland almost
all road passenger services are provided by subsidiaries of the Northern Ireland
Transport Holding Company. Citybus Ltd operates services in the city of Belfast
and Ulsterbus Ltd operates most of the services in the rest of Northern Ireland.
These companies have some 300 and 990 vehicles respectively.
Under the London Regional Transport Act 1984 control of the London
Transport Executive was transferred from the Greater London Council to the
Secretary of State for Transport and the Executive reconstituted as London
Regional Transport (LRT) with its members appointed by the Secretary of State.
LRT has two main subsidiaries responsible for London's bus and underground
railway services; it operates some 5,700 buses. Its aims include the improve¬
ment of transport services in London, a reduction in costs, greater efficiency and
the involvement of the private sector in the provision of services. Closer
co-operation is planned with British Rail to avoid unnecessary duplication of
services. Seven passenger transport executives are responsible for the day-to-day
management and operations of local transport in Strathclyde and the metropoli¬
tan counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West Midlands, Tyne and Wear,
South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. The Local Government Act 1985 provides
304
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Taxis
Transport
Bill
for the abolition of the metropolitan county councils in April 1986, with most of
their powers being transferred to district councils; the executives would
continue to operate but would report to joint boards appointed by the districts.
The executives operate 9,200 vehicles, while some 5,300 vehicles are operated by
other local authority undertakings.
There are some 5,700 privately owned undertakings (of which the majority
have fewer than five vehicles) comprising about 31,900 vehicles; only a small
proportion of these operators provide scheduled local bus services.
Double-deck buses are the main type of vehicle used for urban road passenger
transport in Britain and there are some 25,300 in operation. In addition, there
are 44,800 single-deck buses and coaches, and 79 trams (at Blackpool and
Llandudno which have Britain's only remaining tramway systems).
There are about 35,000 licensed taxis and 70,000 licensed taxi drivers in Great
Britain, mainly in urban areas; London has some 13,500 and 18,500
respectively. In London and a number of other cities taxis must be purpose-built
to conform to very strict requirements and drivers must have passed a test of
their knowledge of the area. Hire cars with drivers may be booked only through
the operator and not hired on the street; in most areas outside London hire ears
are licensed.
Major changes in the control and organisation of the bus industry are planned
in the Transport Bill, which is intended to encourage competition in the
industry, making it more responsive to passenger needs. The Bill would provide
for the abolition in Great Britain (except in London) of road service licensing
(under which a local bus operator needs a road service licence before starting
operations) and the establishment of a new system of registration of local bus
services with the traffic commissioners (one for each of the nine traffic areas of
Great Britain). The Bill contains provisions which would strengthen quality
controls as applied through operator licensing (also administered by the
commissioners).
The National Bus Company would be required to submit to the Secretary of
State for Transport plans for the transfer of its operations to the private sector
and to implement the agreed plans within three years. Passenger transport
executives and local authorities running municipal bus undertakings would be
required to form public transport companies, operating under the Companies
Acts, to which their passenger transport undertakings would be transferred.
This is intended to lead to the establishment of a number of separate competing
companies except in London.
Under the Bill local authorities would be obliged when subsidising unecono¬
mic public transport services to invite applications for operating these services
by open competitive tender; this is designed to enable local authorities to obtain
better value for money from their expenditure. Local authorities might also fund
concessionary fare schemes for elderly, blind and physically disabled people, and
children.
The Bill would provide for new arrangements for the operation of taxis and
hire ears with the intention of increasing their role in public transport.
Operators of licensed taxis would become able to run regular local services,
providing shared-ride services at separate fares.
Transport services in rural areas are expected to benefit in a number of ways,
primarily through greater competition. In addition, two new grants would be
introduced: a rural innovation grant, to be administered in England by the
Development Commission and in Scotland and Wales by the appropriate
Secretary of State; and a transitional grant, payable on a sliding scale for four
years to bus operators.

RAILWAYS
Operations
Passenger
Services
Railways were pioneered in Britain, and the Stockton and Darlington Railway,
opened in 1825, was the first passenger public railway in the world to be worked
by steam power. Under the Transport Act 1947 the four large railway companies
in Great Britain were brought under public ownership and in 1962 the British
Railways Board was set up to manage railway affairs and subsidiary activities. In
Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd, a subsidiary of
the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company, operates the railway service
on some 320 km (200 miles) of track.
In the 15 months ended March 1985 the Board’s turnover, including financial
support and income from other activities but excluding internal transactions,
was £3,558 million. Over the same period, British Rail received £1,210 million
as payments towards its operations, including £1,173 million as compensation
for the financial burden of operating as a public service those parts of the rail
passenger system which would not otherwise cover their costs. The rest
comprised research grants and grants for level crossings. Following a report,
published in 1983, which reviewed the finances of British Rail and identified a
number of opportunities for improved efficiency and reductions in costs, the
Government has set the Board new objectives including a reduction in its public
service obligation grant from the Government to £635 million (at 1983 prices) in
1986.
At the end of March 1985 the Board employed some 180,700 people. Statistics
of British Rail's railway assets are given in Table 28.

a In addition, a number of privately owned wagons are operated on the railway network lor customers of British
Rail: 14,842 were authorised for working on the network at the end of March 1985.
In the 15 months ended March 1985 some 857 million passenger journeys were
made on the British Rail network, covering some 36,400 million passenger-km
(22,600 million miles). The passenger network (see map. p 306) comprises a fast
inter-city network, linking the main centres of Great Britain: local stopping
services; and commuter services in and around the large conurbations,
especially London and south-east England. British Rail runs about 1,400
inter-city expresses each weekday, serving about 150 business and leisure
centres. Journey times on inter-city routes have been reduced substantially as
more track has been made suitable for high-speed operations and as a result of
faster trains, notably the InterCity 125s, operated by High Speed Trains (HSTs),
the world's fastest diesel trains, which travel at maximum sustained speeds of
125 mph (201 km/h). InterCity 125 services (which represent nearly half of
inter-city train mileage) operate on the London-Bristol-south Wales route, the
London-Edinburgh-Aberdeen route, the London-Plymouth-Penzance route.

the London—Sheffield route and the route linking Edinburgh, Newcastle upon
Tyne, Birmingham and south-west England or south Wales.
Electrification is continuing and eight electrification schemes, involving a
total of 945 route km (587 miles), are in progress. The most significant is a £306
million scheme to electrify the east-coast main line between London and
Edinburgh (including the branch from Doncaster to Leeds). Initial work on the
scheme, which will involve electrification of some 636 km (395 miles), began in
February 1985. The first main stage, involving electrification from Hitchin to
Peterborough, is due to be completed by 1987, while the section to Leeds will be
electrified by 1989, and the sections to Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh
should be electrified by 1991. The London—Glasgow west-coast main line,
British Rail's busiest inter-city route, is already electrified, electrification having
been completed in 1974.
British Rail has developed ways of reducing costs on its local passenger
services including the installation of additional automatic level crossings and
radio signalling. It has begun to replace the fleet of diesel multiple-unit trains by
two new types of vehicle with greater reliability and low maintenance costs: a
lightweight railbus (with a bus-type body) and a medium-weight diesel
multiple-unit.
The most important freight commodities handled are coal and coke, iron and
steel, building materials and petroleum. Over 90 per cent of rail-freight revenue
is obtained from traffic in bulk commodities, most of it in trainloads.
Greater efficiency is being obtained with the introduction of new types of
wagon with larger capacities and capable of higher speeds, and of new, more
powerful locomotives, the latest of which can haul loads of 1,000 tonnes at
speeds of up to 130 km/h (81 mph). A network of some 150 scheduled
‘Speedlink' high-speed freight services has been established between the major
industrial centres. Other developments, such as the concentration of freight
traffic at fewer but better-equipped terminals and a computer-based total
operations processing system, which monitors all consignments and freight
train and wagon movements in Great Britain, have contributed to a significant
increase in productivity.
British Rail has a group of other subsidiary businesses, of which British Rail
Engineering Ltd (BREL) has the largest number of employees, about 25,400 at
the end of March 1985. BREL constructs locomotives and rolling stock as well as
undertaking heavy maintenance and overhauls for British Rail: it also manufac¬
tures rolling stock for overseas railways. The Railway Technical Centre at Derby
is the largest of its type in the world. Transmark provides consultancy services
overseas on railway and associated operations. Travellers-Fare is responsible for
catering facilities at 162 stations and on 840 trains each weekday.
Under the Transport Act 1981 the British Railways Board was given powers to
dispose of its interests in its non-railway businesses and has already privatised
its hotels, shipping and hovercraft businesses and disposed of considerable
amounts of property. It has also adopted a policy of competitive tendering for its
rolling stock needs, and plans to extend this to other areas including catering.
There are underground railway services in three British cities: London, Glasgow
and Liverpool. London Regional Transport has 3,875 railway cars and serves
272 stations, while its trains operate over 404 km (251 miles) of railway, of
which about 164 km (102 miles) are underground. A new light rapid transit
system, 55 km (34 miles) long with over 40 stations, is in operation on Tyneside.
The project, the largest provincial urban transport scheme in Britain in the
twentieth century, involved the electrification of two suburban .railway lines.

linked by new tunnels under Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, and a new
bridge over the Tyne. A 12-km (7-5-mile) light railway is being built in London's
Docklands and should be completed by 1987.
There are over 40 small privately owned passenger-carrying railways in Great
Britain, mostly operated on a voluntary basis and providing limited services for
tourists and railway enthusiasts. The main aim of most of these railways, such
as the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex, is the preservation of steam traction.
Various types of road and railway schemes for a cross-Channel fixed link have
been proposed: tunnels, bridges and combined schemes. A number of reports
have looked at financial and other aspects of a fixed link. In April 1985
guidelines to potential promoters of a fixed link were issued by the British and
French governments, and promoters were asked to submit proposals by 31
October 1985. Both governments have stated that any project would have to be
financed privately, without support from public funds.
The inland waterways of Great Britain are popular for recreation, make a
valuable contribution to the environment and play an important part in land
drainage and water supply. They are also used to a limited extent for
freight-carrying. An official survey of inland waterway freight traffic reported,
that in 1983, 65 million tonnes of freight were carried on inland waterways and
estuaries, covering some 2,400 million tonne-km (1-3 per cent of freight traffic
by tonne-km in Great Britain). Nearly 60 per cent of internal freight (in
tonne-km) was carried in the South East, mainly on the River Thames. Of the
3,200 km (2,000 miles) of canal and river navigations controlled by the publicly
owned British Waterways Board, some 550 km (340 miles) are maintained as
commercial waterways. The Board also operates docks, warehouses and inland
freight terminals, and has a barge fleet, although most of the traffic on its
waterways is conveyed by independent carriers. In the 15 months ended March
1985 the Board's turnover amounted to £21-3 million and it received govern¬
ment grants of £49-7 million to maintain its waterways to statutory standards.
Ports
There are over 300 ports in Great Britain, but a substantial number are small
harbours of only local significance and many do not handle cargo regularly. Most
port authorities operate with statutory powers and responsibilities under
private Acts of Parliament. They are of three broad types: trusts, local authorities
and statutory companies.
Major ports controlled by trusts include London, Milford Haven, Tees and
Hartlepool, Medway, Forth and Clyde. Local authorities control a considerable
number of small ports but also the much larger ports of Bristol, Portsmouth and
the new oil ports in Orkney and Shetland.
The Transport Act 1981 provided for the introduction of private capital into
Britain's main nationalised port undertaking, the British Transport Docks
Board, which has become a private sector company, Associated British Ports. It
owns and operates 19 ports including Southampton, Grimsby and Immingham,
Hull, Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. Other port undertakings owned by
statutory companies include Felixstowe, Manchester and Liverpool. The Act also
provided powers for the British Railways Board to introduce private capital into
its ports (which included Folkestone, Newhaven and Parkeston Quay at
Harwich) and in 1984 its harbour installations were sold, together with the rest
of the Sealink business (see p 310).

Port Traffic
Development
In 1984 traffic through the ports of Great Britain amounted to 446 million
tonnes comprising 142 million tonnes of exports, 144 million tonnes of imports
and 160 million tonnes of domestic traffic (including ‘one-porf traffic which
comprised offshore traffic, landings of sea-dredged aggregates and material
shipped for dumping at sea). About 63 per cent of the traffic was in fuels, mainly
petroleum and petroleum products. Some 65 per cent of the 12-2 million tonnes
of traffic (9-8 million tonnes of imports and 2-4 million tonnes of exports) which
entered or left Northern Ireland by sea in 1984 represented traffic with the rest of
Britain.
Britain's main ports, in terms of total tonnage handled, are given in Table 29.
Offshore oil developments have had a substantial effect on port traffic by greatly
increasing the flow through certain North Sea ports, such as Tees and
Hartlepool and the Forth ports, creating new oil ports at Flotta in Orkney and
Sullom Voe in Shetland, and reducing oil traffic at many traditional oil¬
importing terminals. Two other significant changes have affected traffic at
British ports in the last 20 years. First, traditional major ports, such as London,
Liverpool and Manchester, have lost general (non-bulk) cargo traffic to ports like
Dover and Felixstowe which have developed specialised facilities to meet a
world-wide switch from conventional handling methods to container and roll-on
modes. While non-fuel traffic has been growing only slowly, container and roll-on
traffic has more than doubled since 1972 to 55 million tonnes in 1984 and now
accounts for about 40 per cent of non-fuel foreign and coastal traffic. The
leading ports for container traffic are Felixstowe, London and Southampton and
for roll-on traffic are Dover (Britain's leading seaport in terms of the value of
trade handled), Grimsby and Immingham, Felixstowe and Harwich. Secondly,
with Britain's accession to the European Community in 1973, ports on the
south and east coasts have increasingly gained traffic at the expense of those on
the west coast as the emphasis of Britain's trade has switched towards the
continent of Europe.

a Belfast and Larne are the main ports in Northern Ireland and handled 5 million tonnes and 4 million tonnes
respectively in 1984.
Modernisation of Britain's ports has been carried out primarily to accommodate
the growth in container and roll-on traffic, to speed the handling of bulk
commodities, and as a result of the changing nature and direction of Britain's

trade. Many ports have modernised facilities and improved productivity by
changing port layout, introducing new handling equipment and reducing
manning levels. Most major new developments have been at east- and
south-coast ports. For example, at Felixstowe a £40 million container terminal
under construction will, when completed at the end of 1986, raise the port's
annual throughput of containers to 800,000.
Purpose-built terminals for oil from the British sector of the North Sea have
been built at Hound Point on the Forth, on the Tees, at Flotta and at Sullom Voe
(one of the largest oil terminals in the world). Three of the four jetties at Sullom
Voe can handle oil tankers of up to 350,000 deadweight tons, and the fourth
jetty handles the export of liquefied petroleum gases and can accommodate
vessels with a capacity of up to 75,000 cubic metres. A £54 million terminal has
been built at Braefoot Bay in the Firth of Forth to handle tankers carrying
natural gas liquids brought by pipeline from the plant at Mossmorran (Fife).
Supply bases for offshore vessels have been built at a number of ports, mostly on
the east coast.
Shipping
Britain remains a leading maritime nation, but in common with the fleets of
other developed countries, the British fleet has been adversely affected by the
world recession in shipping and increasing international competition. It has
declined substantially from a peak of 53-4 million deadweight tons1 (33-2
million gross tons) in 1975 to 24-1 million deadweight tons (15-9 million gross
tons) in 1984. A large tonnage of ships, particularly of tankers, has been
scrapped or sold.
In July 1984, 20-8 million deadweight tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons
and over were both owned and registered in Britain: 12-6 million tons usually
employed as tankers, 5-5 million tons as tramps and 2-7 million tons as cargo or
passenger liners or cellular container ships. The merchant fleet figure of 24-1
million deadweight tons also includes non-trading vessels, such as fishing
vessels, tugs and dredgers, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in
other Commonwealth countries.
Virtually all of the British merchant fleet is privately owned following the sale of
Sealink UK Ltd by the British Railways Board to British Ferries, a subsidiary of
Sea Containers, in 1984. Nearly two-thirds of the tanker fleet belongs to the oil
companies, although there are a few independent tanker operators. British
cargo liner tonnage is dominated by a relatively small number of large groups
and container consortia. Some shipowners have delegated the management of
their fleets to specialist ship management companies. Several companies are
participating in consortia, particularly where heavy investment is required, as
with container vessels. Chartering of ships of all nationalities takes place on the
Baltic Exchange, the largest market of its type in the world. The representative
body for shipowners (excluding owners of fishing vessels) is the General Council
of British Shipping.
About 94 per cent of Britain's overseas trade by weight, about 80 per cent by
value, is carried by sea, while the proportion of passengers travelling to or from
Britain by sea is more than one-third, compared with about one-half in the early
1960s.
1 One gross ton = 100 cubic feet (2-83 cubie metres). One deadweight ton = 1 tonne (1.000 kg or 2.205 lb). Gross
tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed space on a ship. Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum
load which a vessel can carry before submerging the load-line.

ROLE OF THE
GOVERNMENT
In 1984 British seaborne trade amounted to 273 million tonnes (valued at
£116,000 million) or 1 million million tonne-km (586.000 million tonne-miles).
Ships registered in Britain carried 23 per cent by weight, 19 per cent in terms of
tonne-mileage and 36 per cent by value. Tanker cargoes accounted for nearly
half this trade by weight, but only 20 per cent by value, and foodstuffs and
manufactured goods accounted for three-quarters by value.
Container and roll-on/roll-off vessels are responsible for a growing proportion
of general cargo trade. Many of the deep-sea liner services from Britain are
operated by container ships. Roll-on services, accommodating passengers and
their cars and, in some cases, commercial vehicles, are increasing in number,
particularly between Britain and the continent of Europe. Several freight-only
roll-on services operate to the Irish Republic, the continent of Europe, and to
more distant countries.
British shipping companies operating liner services have associated with each
other and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in
a series of ‘conferences' designed to secure standardisation and stability of
rates, and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential
principle of a conference is a common tariff of freight rates and other conditions
of service to be applied by each member line. Conferences serve all the major
trades to and from Britain. In 1985 Britain acceded to the United Nations
Convention for Liner Conferences, a wide-ranging code of conduct governing
relations among shipping companies that are members of conferences.
Almost all of the 26-2 million passengers who arrived at or departed from British
ports in 1984 travelled to or from the continent of Europe or the Irish Republic,
services on other routes having been withdrawn as a result of the growth of air
services. Remaining long-distance passenger ships are used for cruising and in
1984 some 62,000 passengers embarked on pleasure cruises from British ports.
Traffic from the southern and south-eastern ports accounts for a substantial
proportion of traffic to the continent of Europe. The main British operators are
Sealink UK Ltd and Townsend Thoresen (which in 1985 took over the
cross-Channel operations of P & O Ferries). Sealink UK Ltd and its continental
partners (Soeiete Nationale des Chemins de Fer Franyais, Regie des Transports
Maritimes Beiges and Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland of the Netherlands)
operate about 30 ships on continental routes.
Cross-Channel hovercraft services are provided by Hoverspeed Ltd, with
routes between Dover and Boulogne, and Dover and Calais. A hovercraft
crossing takes about one-third of the time taken by ships, and hovercraft carry
about one-fifth of the traffic on the short-sea crossings to France. Hoverspeed
operates six hovercraft including two British Hovercraft Corporation SR.N
Super 4s which have been structurally enlarged so that each accommodates 418
passengers and 55 cars, making them the largest hovercraft in the world.
Passenger and freight ferry services are also operated to many of the offshore
islands, such as the Isle of Wight, Orkney, Shetland and a number of other
Scottish islands.
The Department of Transport is the government department responsible for
most matters connected with merchant shipping, including Britain’s relations
with other governments and international organisations on shipping matters.
The general policy is one of minimum intervention by the Government and the
encouragement of free and fair competition. Under the Merchant Shipping Acts
the Department does, however, administer many regulations for marine safety
and welfare, and for preventing and cleaning up pollution from ships. For
instance, it certifies the load-line (or Plimsoll line) that shows that a ship is not
overloaded; ensures that standards of safety are observed in ship construction:
312
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SAFETY AT
SEA
ensures the provision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment;
and deals with the discipline, professional standards, health and accommoda¬
tion of seamen. The Acts also contain certain reserve powers for protecting
shipping and trading interests from measures adopted or proposed by overseas
governments.
Outside London the Department's responsibilities for the enforcement of
marine safety are carried out from marine offices located at various ports. In the
offices of the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen, at Cardiff, a record is
kept of all ships registered in Britain and its dependencies.
Britain's merchant fleet is one of the safest in the world with a lower record of
ship losses than the world average.
The Coastguard Service, administered by the Department of Transport, is
responsible for initiating and co-ordinating civil marine search and rescue
action in the United Kingdom Search and Rescue Region (SRR). This is divided
into six coastguard SRRs, each controlled by a maritime rescue co-ordination
centre supported by sub-centres, all of which maintain continuous telecom¬
munications watch on marine distress frequencies. In addition, there are over
380 stations which have a wide range of rescue equipment and carry out routine
patrol and surveillance duties around the coast. The Coastguard Service is able
to call upon the lifeboats of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (a voluntary
body which operates 256 lifeboats), Ministry of Defence aircraft (including
helicopters from 11 airfields around the coast), a long-range civilian helicopter
based at Sumburgh (Shetland), and any other ships or aircraft available to assist
in search or rescue action. In 1984 the Coastguard Service took action in 4,879
incidents (including cliff rescues) in which over 8,500 people were assisted.
The lighthouse authorities (for England and Wales the Corporation of Trinity
House, for Scotland the Northern Lighthouse Board and for Ireland the
Commissioners of Irish Lights) control about 370 lighthouses, many minor
lights and buoys, and a number of lightships, some of which are being replaced
by unattended sea marks or by light towers. In Britain there are 50 pilotage
authorities for the 93 pilotage districts and about 1,425 licensed pilots. Trinity
House is the largest pilotage authority, licensing some 570 pilots in 40 districts
in England and Wales. In some cases the harbour authority or local council is
the pilotage authority. The Government plans a major reorganisation of
pilotage, under which the pilotage authorities would be abolished and local
harbour authorities would become responsible for determining their pilotage
requirements.
Compliance with traffic separation schemes around the shores of Britain is
mandatory for all vessels of countries party to the 1972 International Collision
Regulations. The most important scheme affecting British waters is in the Dover
Strait, the world's busiest seaway. It consists of traffic lanes for shipping
passing through the strait and inshore traffic zones for use by local shipping.
Britain and France operate radar surveillance of the strait to keep watch on
ships not conforming to the scheme and, through the Channel Navigation
Information Service, broadcast navigational information to ships in the strait.
The Service, which operates from Dover, has a radar-linked, automatic
data-processing system for detecting and tracking vessels, making it one of the
most advanced centres in the world.
Civil Aviation
Britain’s substantial civil air transport industry is continuing to develop to meet
the generally increasing demand for air travel, particularly international travel.
Airline services are operated by British Airways and by a number of independent

airlines. The airlines are re-equipping their fleets with the most modern aircraft,
while many airports are being substantially modernised and extended.
The Secretary of State for Transport is responsible for international matters
(including negotiation of air service agreements with more than 100 other
countries, the licensing and control of public transport operations into Britain
by overseas operators and British participation in the activities of international
aviation bodies), airports policy, amenity matters (such as aircraft noise),
aviation security policy and investigation of accidents.
The Government’s civil aviation policy aims to encourage a sound and
competitive multi-airline industry in Britain, to promote competition in
international and internal services, and to maintain high standards of safety. It
has liberalised airline services within Britain, and in its negotiations with other
countries on bilateral air service agreements it is proposing the adoption of more
liberal measures. Negotiations with some other members of the European
Community have already resulted in greater competition, leading to increased
traffic and lower fares. Further relaxations on controls over internal services are
planned; controls on internal air fares will be abolished in September 1985.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an independent statutory body, respon¬
sible for the economic, technical and operational regulation of the industry. It is
also responsible for the aerodrome navigation services at certain British airports
and. jointly with the Ministry of Defence, for the provision by the National Air
Traffic Services of air navigation services. Members of the CAA are appointed by
the Secretary of State for Transport.
Under the Civil Aviation Act 1982 its primary objectives are to ensure that
British airlines provide air services to satisfy all substantial categories of public
demand at the lowest charges consistent with a high standard of safety and an
economic return for efficient operators, and to further the reasonable interests
of air transport users. Other duties are to ensure that British airlines compete
effectively on international routes, to secure the most effective use of airports in
Britain and to have regard to the need to minimise the adverse effects of civil
aviation on the environment.
In 1984 a total of some 51-2 million passengers travelled by air (international
terminal passengers) to or from Britain, 10-4 per cent more than in 1983. Total
capacity offered on all services by British airlines amounted to 13,155 million
available-tonne-km in 1984: 9,854 million tonne-km on scheduled services and
3,301 million tonne-km on non-scheduled services. British Airways accounts for
some 72 per cent of scheduled services flown by British airlines, whereas the
charter market is dominated by the independent companies.
In 1984 the value of Britain's overseas trade carried by air was some £26,500
million and the proportions carried by air amounted to approximately 18 per
cent of the value of exports and 17 per cent of imports. Air freight is important
for the carriage of goods with a high value-to-weight ratio, especially where
speed of movement is essential. Precious stones, live animals, medicinal and
pharmaceutical products, clothing, leather and skins, and scientific instru¬
ments are major categories where a relatively high proportion of exports is sent
by air.
British Airways is one of the world’s leading airlines, and in terms of
international passengers carried and of international passenger-km flown it is
the largest in the world. During 1984—85 British Airways' turnover was £2,929
million (including £2,254 million from airline operations) and it recorded a net
profit of £209-5 million. British Airways ceased to be a statutory body in 1984

when it was re-established under the Civil Aviation Act 1980 as British Airways
PLC, a public limited company under government ownership. The Government
intends to sell its shareholding in the company to private investors as soon as
practicable.
British Airways' route network, covering some 543,000 km (337,000 miles) of
unduplicated route, is among the largest in the world. The airline serves 148
destinations in 72 countries and in 1984 carried 18-2 million passengers.
International scheduled services are operated to the rest of Europe, the Middle
East, the Far East, Australasia, East and South Africa, North America, South
America and the Caribbean. Within Britain it runs 1,050 services a week to 16
towns and cities. Scheduled Concorde supersonic services are operated from
London (Heathrow) to New York and to Miami via Washington, crossing the
North Atlantic in about half the time taken by subsonic aircraft. Other activities
carried out include helicopter services, engine overhaul work and investments
in a number of hotel companies and air companies in other countries.
British Airways operated 163 aircraft and 31 helicopters in June 1985 (see
diagram on p 315). A large investment programme is under way to replace the
older aircraft, and orders for new aircraft include a further five Boeing 757s.
The independent airlines carry 6-8 million passengers a year on scheduled
services and 15-1 million on charter flights. The main independent scheduled
airline is British Caledonian Airways, which operates a fleet of 27 aircraft and
carried 2-2 million scheduled service passengers in 1984. Its scheduled services
are primarily to the continent of Europe; North, West and Central Africa; the
United States: and the Middle East and Hong Kong. Other operators of
scheduled passenger services include British Midland Airways, Air UK and
Dan-Air Services. Britannia Airways, Dan-Air Services, Air Europe and Monarch
Airlines are the leading independent airlines operating charter passenger
services.
Helicopters are engaged on a variety of work, but are mainly employed on the
large-scale operations connected with the development of Britain's offshore oil
and gas resources. Bristow Helicopters, which operates a fleet of more than 60
helicopters in Britain, is the world's largest helicopter contracting business.
Light aircraft and helicopters are also involved in other activities, such as
charter operations, search and rescue services, crop-spraying, and aerial survey
and photography.
The CAA is responsible for air safety, both airworthiness and operational safety.
Its Operations Division deals with the preparation and application of safety
requirements eoneerning airline and private aviation operations, flight crew
licensing and training, aerodromes, and fire and rescue services. The Airworthi¬
ness Division is responsible for the airworthiness standards of aircraft
registered in Britain, the licensing of aircraft maintenance engineers and the
approval of work schedules to which British transport aircraft are maintained.
Every company operating aircraft used for public transport must possess an
Air Operator’s Certificate which is granted by the CAA when it is satisfied that
the operator is competent to secure the safe operation of its aircraft. The CAA's
flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline pilots) check that
satisfactory operating standards are maintained.
Each member of the flight crew of a British registered aircraft must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA. Except for pilots with acceptable
military or other qualifying experience, all applicants for a first professional

Responsibility for civil and military air traffic control over Britain and the
surrounding seas rests with the National Air Traffic Services (NATS). The
Controller of the NATS reports to both the CAA and the Ministry of Defence. The
function of the NATS is to secure the safe, orderly and expeditious How of air
traffic within British airspace. It also provides air traffic services for aircraft
Hying over the north-eastern quarter of the North Atlantic. At some 19 civil
aerodromes, including most of the major British airports, the NATS provides the
navigation services necessary for the operation of aircraft taking off and landing,
and integrates them into the How of traffic within British airspace. To provide
its services, the NATS uses radar, some 100 navigational beacons, landing aids,
air/ground communications and an extensive telecommunications network.
Of the 135 licensed civil aerodromes in Britain, about one-fifth each handles
more than 100,000 passengers a year. In 1984 Britain’s civil airports handled a
total of 68-8 million passengers (67-6 million terminal passengers and 1-3
million in transit), and 860,600 tonnes of freight. London's Heathrow airport is
the world's busiest airport for international travel and is Britain's most
important airport for passengers and air freight, handling 29-5 million
passengers and 541,300 tonnes of freight in 1984. Gatwick, the second major
airport in the London area and the world’s fourth busiest international air¬
port, handled 14-2 million passengers in 1984. Other leading airports are
Manchester, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Luton, Birmingham, Belfast (Aldergrove),
Edinburgh. Newcastle upon Tyne and East Midlands.

Ownership and

Development
The British Airports Authority (BAA), a statutory body, owns and manages seven
airports—Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in south-east England, and
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Prestwick and Aberdeen in Scotland—which handle
about 75 per cent of air passengers and 89 per cent of air cargo traffic in
Britain. In 1984-85 the BAA's income was £362 million and it recorded a pre¬
tax operating profit of £69-5 million. The Government intends to seek powers to
privatise the BAA as a single entity as soon as possible.
Belfast's airport is managed by Northern Ireland Airports Ltd, a subsidiary of
the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Sumburgh airport and seven
aerodromes in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland are owned and managed by
the CAA. Most of the other public airports are controlled by local authorities.
Except for those controlled by the CAA, all airports used for public transport and
training flights must be licensed by the CAA. Stringent requirements, such as
the provision of adequate fire-fighting, medical and rescue services, suitable
physical characteristics and visual aids, must be satisfied before a licence is
granted. Strict aviation security measures are in force.
The Government's policy is to promote a strong and competitive British airline
industry by providing airport capacity where it is needed and by making full use
of existing resources, especially at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. It is also
encouraging the maximum use of regional airports.
A fourth major terminal at Heathrow is due to become operational early in
1986, raising the airport's capacity from 30 million to 38 million passengers a
year. Gatwick's current capacity is some 16 million passengers a year, but the
second terminal, the first phase of which is due to open in 1987, will eventually
raise this to 25 million passengers. Following a public inquiry, planning
permission has been granted for the expansion of Stansted airport to an
eventual 15 million passengers a year; the first phase would provide capacity of
some 7 million to 8 million passengers a year.
Traffic at regional airports has grown by 25 per cent during the 1980s and is
expected to increase by more than 4 per cent a year for the rest of the twentieth
century. Accordingly, facilities have been improved, with major terminal or
runway improvements undertaken at Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds/Bradford
and Newcastle upon Tyne airports. The Government intends to assist in
developing further opportunities for new routes and services, and will encourage
the development of Manchester as a 'regional hub" airport.
Communications
Telecommunications is one of the most rapidly growing sectors of the economy.
The Government has introduced two major Acts to establish a new framework
for telecommunications in Britain.
The British Telecommunications Act 1981 separated the Post Office into two
corporations, one for postal and banking services and the other for telecom¬
munications (British Telecom, formally known as British Telecommunications),
and provided for a limited relaxation of the statutory monopoly in telecom¬
munications. The Telecommunications Act 1984 strengthened the measures
taken to promote competition in a number of ways including removing British
Telecom's exclusive privilege of running public telecommunications systems
and instituting new arrangements requiring those running telecommunica¬
tions systems (including British Telecom), with certain limited exceptions, to be
licensed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry or, under delegated
authority, by the Director General of Telecommunications. There is provision for
licences to contain certain conditions including obligations to provide services
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
317
BRITISH
TELECOM
Telephone
Services
Exchanges
and requirements to connect with other systems. In British Telecom's case the
obligations to provide services ensure the continued existence of a universal
telecommunications service throughout the country and that certain essential
services, such as public emergency services, public call box services, maritime
emergency services and services in rural areas, are maintained. Mercury
Communications Ltd has been licensed as the second major public telecom¬
munications network to provide a full range of services.
In 1982 a general licence for value added network services' was issued,
permitting a wide variety of commercial services (other than the basic service of
conveying or switching a message) to be run in competition with British
Telecom over the public telecommunications networks. The licence was the first
of its kind and has placed the British system among the most liberal in the
world. Some 140 operators have registered under the general licence proposals
for over 500 different services, such as viewdata, conference calls, electronic
mail, and message storage and retrieval systems.
Private sector firms are now able to supply, install and maintain most types of
subscribers' apparatus attached to the telecommunications network. British
Telecom's monopoly over the supply and maintenance of a customer's first
telephone instrument connected to its network ceased at the end of 1984, and
maintenance of newly installed call-routing apparatus will be fully open for
competition by November 1986.
The Director General of Telecommunications (head of the new Office of
Telecommunications, a small government department with independent re¬
sponsibility for supervising telecommunications activities in Britain) has a wide
range of functions, being required, among other things, to ensure that licensees
comply with the conditions of their licences: to investigate complaints: and to
monitor telecommunications activities in Britain. In carrying out these
functions the Director General is bound by a number of general duties including
the promotion of the interests of telecommunications users and the promotion
of effective competition in telecommunications.
The 1984 Act also provided for the reconstitution of British Telecom as a
public limited company, operating under the Companies Acts, with all its shares
held by the Government. A majority of the ordinary voting shares in the new
company were sold to private investors in November 1984 in the world's
largest-ever company flotation.
British Telecom's main activity is the provision of voice telephony, sup¬
plemented by data services over a single nationwide public network, while it also
operates a range of more specialised services in telecommunications and
information technology.
British Telecom operates about 76,500 public call boxes and rents 293,500
payphones to customers in premises such as hotels, restaurants and shops. A
new type of payphone, which incorporates press-button dialling and a credit
display, automatically alerts the repair service when a fault occurs, while
cardphones (which take special cards rather than coins) are being installed in a
number of busy locations. British Telecom also manages the inland telephone
operator service, the directory inquiries service,, the ‘999’ emergency service and
the Freefone' service by which the cost of the call is met by the called customer.
Its recorded services include the Speaking Clock and a number of new services,
such as ‘Sportsline’ (a sports headline service updated every hour).
The most recent development in exchange technology has been the introduction
of digital switching equipment incorporating stored program control; the
software programs are run on processors similar to data-processing computers.

Digital switching equipment contains very few moving parts and so requires less
maintenance and is more reliable than electro-mechanical exchanges. Develop¬
ment work on a new series of digital exchanges, known as System X, began in
the 1970s. The first prototype exchange was inaugurated in London in 1980 and
the first of a version with improved performance was opened in Coventry in
1983. When System X becomes more widely available, it will offer a wide range
of facilities from the public exchange without customers needing special
apparatus, while the modular nature of the design allows improvements to be
introduced. For its smallest local exchanges the UXD5 has been developed by
British Telecom from its Monarch electronic private automatic branch ex¬
change.
Digital transmission, in which telephone speech signals flow as a stream of
on/off electrical impulses, is being increasingly used instead of traditional
analog transmission because of its many advantages, such as improved speech
quality, reliability and the ability to combine voice and data transmission over
the same links. British Telecom is extending digital transmission through
Britain's cable and microwave transmission links and already has one of the
world's most extensive digital transmission networks.
Optical fibres (very thin strands of glass capable of carrying large numbers of
telephone calls simultaneously) are helping to improve transmission; they are
smaller than conventional cables and require less amplifying equipment to boost
long-distance calls. Another development in transmission is cellular radio
which, through the use of radio waves of higher frequency and a large number of
low-power transmitters, can provide mobile telephone services with greater
capacity than is available for the existing radiophone services.
The demand for international calls has increased substantially in recent years
and British Telecom International (responsible for British Telecom's interna¬
tional links) has increased the amount of equipment in its international
exchanges. In March 1985 there were some 37.600 cable and satellite circuits
linking Britain with other countries compared with nearly 3,000 in 1970. A
substantial proportion of the intercontinental telephone traffic to or from
Britain is carried by satellite, and satellites are also increasingly used for data,
facsimile and broadcasting transmission. British Telecom operates satellite
earth stations at Goonhilly in Cornwall and Madley near Hereford. Between them
the earth stations operate via five satellite paths to over 100 countries. Britain
has the second largest interest in the International Telecommunications
Satellite Organisation (INTELSAT) and is the second largest shareholder in the
International Maritime Satellite Organisation (INMARSAT). British Telecom
International is also the joint largest shareholder in Eutelsat, a European
organisation with over 20 members established to manage the European
Communications Satellite Project, which became fully operational in 1984.
There are 25 submarine cables from Britain to the continent of Europe, the
Channel Islands and the Faroe Islands, and four cables from Britain to North
America. Work on laying the first international submarine optical fibre cable,
between Britain and Belgium, is due to start later in 1985.
‘PresteF, the world's first public viewdata service, was inaugurated in 1979. It
enables information and messages to be transmitted through the telephone
network from a computer for display on a suitably equipped television set in
words, figures and simple graphics. Some 337,000 ‘pages' of information are
available from over 1,200 sources on a wide range of subjects. Prestel has some
59,000 sets attached to its network and is the largest information service of its
kind in the world. Its ‘Gateway’ facility connects private computer databases to
the Prestel database and allows a wide range of services (such as booking

Society and the Bank of Scotland for an electronic home banking service, was
inaugurated in 1983, and the Bank of Scotland launched an enhanced service
on Prestel in January 1985. Prestel also provides access to a home shopping
service in the West Midlands known as ‘Club 403’. Other services include
‘Skytrack’, an airline reservation system for travel agents, and ‘Mieronet 800’, a
telesoftware service whereby microcomputer users can obtain access to a library
of programs held on Prestel.
Prestel software has been sold to telecommunications authorities in a number
of countries. In 1981 British Telecom opened Prestel to overseas access as the
first international public viewdata service. Direct access is available from
anywhere in the world and the service is being used in many countries.
British Telecom has a range of digital transmission services known as
X-Stream’ to meet business needs. Packet SwitchStream’ is the public data
network and is a commercial packet switching service for computer data. It
covers all the main centres of Britain and an international service provides
access to 50 networks in 30 countries. Other X-Stream services include
‘MegaStream’ (a private circuit service for wideband voice and data communica¬
tions), ‘KiloStream’ (a private circuit service with additional facilities), and
‘SatStream’, a service offering private digital communications using small-dish
earth terminals located on or near customers' premises to provide satellite
access. In addition, there is a range of ‘Datel’ modems, which enable
transmission of data over the public telephone network as well as on private
circuits; speeds from 300 up to 9,600 bits a second are possible. ‘Baseband’
modems are also available for local communications at speeds of up to 19,200
bits a second.
The telex service is fully automatic. Customers can dial direct to nearly 200
countries, and over 99 per cent of all international calls are dialled direct. The
first telex stored program control exchange in Britain was opened in 1984, and
by 1987 nearly three-quarters of telex customers will be served by these
advanced exchanges.
Teletex is an internationally agreed standard for transmitting text at high speed.
The service became available in Britain in April 1985 and messages can be sent
and received at up to 2,000 words a minute (as against 67 for telex) on any
electronic text equipment with a memory and a suitable teletex interface, while
teletex terminals can also work with the national and international telex service.
International telegrams are transmitted through a computer-controlled Tele¬
gram Retransmission Centre in London. It is one of the largest in the world, and
has direct access via satellite and cable circuits to 97 terminals in 81 countries.
Cable and Wireless pie provides or manages a wide range of telecommunications
activities, mostly overseas in over 60 countries. The company used to be in the
public sector, but the Government has reduced its shareholding to 23 per cent.
Mercury Communications Ltd, a subsidiary ot Cable and Wireless, operates
under licence as the second telecommunications carrier in Britain. Initially it is
concentrating on domestic business communications and its optical fibre and
satellite trunk system should be completed later in 1985. It is developing satellite
links, using earth stations in London's Docklands and at Taekley (Oxlordshire).

Securicor) have been licensed by the Government to run competing national
cellular radio systems: both services started in January 1985 and now cover
wide areas of Britain, while other services, such as emergency call facilities, are
expected to be introduced.
In April 1985 the Government granted a licence under the Telecommunications
Act 1984 for the establishment of a broadband cable system (supplying
television and telecommunications services) in Westminster (Greater London)
by Westminster Cable Co Ltd and Broadband Ventures Ltd (a subsidiary of
British Telecom). Licences were also granted in 1985 for similar telecommunica¬
tions systems in a number of other areas.
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered postal services and was the first to
issue adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance payment for mail. The Royal
Mail provides deliveries to 23 million addresses and handles 42 million letters
and parcels each working day (10,500 million items a year). Mail is collected
from over 100,000 posting boxes, as well as from post offices and large postal
users. The Post Office has a monopoly on the conveyance of letters, but under
the British Telecommunications Act 1981 the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry has the power to suspend the monopoly in certain areas or for certain
categories of mail and to license others to provide competing services. The
Secretary of State has relaxed the monopoly on letters subject to a minimum fee
of £1, and has issued general licences enabling mail to be transferred between
document exchanges and allowing charitable organisations to carry Christmas
and New Year cards.
Mechanisation of mail handling is in progress at 68 of the 80 offices planned
to take over the work of hundreds of sorting offices handling letters manually. All
addresses in Britain have a postcode and the British system is the most
sophisticated in the world, allowing mechanised sorting down to part of a street
on a postman's round and, in some cases, to an individual address. Some 34
large parcel centres, each serving a group of counties, have taken over the work
of 1,200 offices which handled parcels manually.
As well as postal and National Girobank services, post offices handle a wide
range of transactions. In much of its counter service the Post Office acts as agent
for government departments and local authorities. In 1984 the Post Office
adopted a scheme for introducing new technology into its counter services
which will reduce costs and raise productivity, while providing an improved
range of services to customers. There are 22,000 post offices, of which some
1,550 are operated directly by the Post Office and the remainder on an agency
basis by sub-postmasters.
The Post Office provides a range of specialist services. ‘Datapost International', a
door-to-door delivery service, has overnight links throughout Britain and
international services to 65 countries including most of Europe and North
America. ‘Datapost Sameday' provides a rapid delivery within or between some
84 main cities and towns in Britain. ‘Intelpost’, the world's first international
public facsimile transmission service sending letters and other documents by
satellite, provides high-speed electronic mail links between 112 towns and cities
in Britain as well as to and from the United States and a number of other
countries. The Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh handles about one-third of the
Post Office's philatelic business, much of it involving sales to overseas collectors
or dealers. The British Postal Consultancy Service offers advice and assistance
on all aspects of postal business to overseas postal administrations, and over 35
countries have used its services since 1965.
16 Employment
TRENDS IN
EMPLOYMENT
UNEMPLOY¬
MENT
As a major industrial country, Britain has a labour force with high levels oi
technical and commercial skill. However, in common with other industrialised
countries, it has suffered in recent years from high levels of unemployment. The
long-term solution to this lies in economic growth, which in turn depends upon
low inflation, financial stability and efficient, competitive industries. Improving
the operation of the labour market should help to create the most suitable
economic climate in which business can flourish and create more jobs. The
Government is helping to achieve this in a number of ways, including making
training more relevant to the economy's needs and removing a number of
obstacles to the market's efficient operation.
The total workforce in June 1984 was 27 million (60 per cent of the total
population aged 16 and over) of whom 21-2 million (over 11-8 million men and
9-3 million women) were classed as employees in employment (see Table 30).
Britain has a higher proportion of people of working age in jobs or seeking work
than in many other Western European countries, and the workforce is
continuing to grow as the population of working age increases and as more
women look for work. Recent trends have included the continuing growth in the
proportion of women in employment (although at a lower rate than in previous
years), as more married women have sought work, especially in part-time
employment: and a substantial increase in self-employment, although the great
majority of the working population continue to work for a wage or salary.
Between 1979 and 1984 the number of self-employed people rose by 31 per cent
to 2-5 million, representing 9-2 per cent of the working population (the highest
proportion since 1921).
There have been substantial changes in the nature and location of employ¬
ment, with a marked shift, as in other countries, from manufacturing to service
industries. Between 1955 and 1984 the proportion of employees in employment
engaged in service industries rose from 45 per cent to 65 per cent as higher
living standards and technological developments stimulated the growth of many
service industries. During the period 1976 to 1984 the number of employees in
service industries rose by nearly 800,000 (6-2 percent) to 13-7 million (see Table
31). Employment in most service industries, with some exceptions (such as
public administration, transport, postal services and communications), has
grown considerably. The largest rise in this period was in the banking, finance
and insurance sector (by 26 per cent to 1-9 million), while other sectors with
significant increases included hotels and catering (17 per cent), medical and
other health services (14 per cent) and wholesale distribution and repairs (13
per cent). Manufacturing industry accounted for 40 per cent of employees in
employment in 1955, but by 1984 the proportion had fallen to 26 per cent.
Between 1976 and 1984 employment in manufacturing fell by 24 per cent to 5-5
million. Nearly all manufacturing industries have experienced a decline in
employment as markets for manufactured goods have changed and as new
technology has brought greater efficiency and, in some cases, reduced the
demand for labour.
As in nearly all the major industrialised nations, unemployment in Britain has
increased rapidly (see Table 30) and in July 1985 some 3-2 million people. 13-4
per cent of the working population, were unemployed. While unemployment has
322
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Help for the
Unemployed
increased in all regions, it is higher in areas with the greatest dependence on
traditional manufacturing industries.
The Government’s strategy towards employment is to maintain an economic,
financial and industrial climate in which businesses can operate successfully
and create jobs. It is also taking action to improve the labour market by
encouraging better training, removing regulatory barriers which hinder recruit¬
ment by firms, and providing an extensive range of special employment and
training measures for those most affected by unemployment (particularly the
long-term unemployed and the young) to help them into productive work.
Measures announced in 1985 include an extension of the Youth Training
Scheme (see p 325), an increase in the number of places on the Community
Programme for the long-term unemployed (see below), a review of vocational
qualifications, and changes in the operation of wages councils (see p 334).

In 1984-85 over £2,000 million was spent on the Government’s employment
and training measures and nearly 700,000 people were directly helped. Several
special schemes, as well as the Youth Training Scheme and adult training
measures, are in operation.
The Enterprise Allowance Scheme, introduced for an experimental period in
1982 and extended to the whole of Great Britain in 1983, helps unemployed
people wishing to start their own business but who would be deterred by the
prospect of losing social security benefit once they began. Entrants, who must
have at least £1,000 to invest in the business, can claim an allowance of £40 a
week for a year while they start the business. Over 65,000 people have benefited
from the scheme, funds for which were increased from April 1985 so that up to
1,250 people a week can enter the scheme (25 per cent more than previously).
The Community Programme provides up to a year’s employment for the
long-term unemployed on projects of benefit to local communities (such as
environmental improvements) put forward by sponsoring bodies which are
EMPLOYMENT
323
primarily local authorities or voluntary organisations. Expenditure on the
scheme totalled some £525 million in 1984—85. The programme’s expansion will
cost an extra £140 million in 1985-86 and £460 million in 1986-87, and
increase the number of places available from 130,000 to 230,000.
The Job Release Scheme enables older workers (disabled men aged 60 to 64,
men aged 64 and women aged 59) to retire early with an allowance provided that
their employer replaces them with an unemployed person. Since its establish¬
ment in 1977 some 280,000 workers have taken early retirement under the
scheme. The Part-Time Job Release Scheme (which enables older workers to
share their job with an unemployed person) and the Job Splitting Scheme are
designed to increase opportunities for part-time work.
Other schemes include the Voluntary Projects Programme, which allows
unemployed people to take voluntary work without losing entitlement to state
benefits; the Community Industry Scheme, which provides temporary job
opportunities for personally and socially disadvantaged young unemployed
people aged 16 to 19; and the Young Workers' Scheme (due to cease in March
1986 with the extension of the Youth Training Scheme), which encourages
employers to recruit more young people at wage rates reflecting their lack of
training and relative inexperience.

BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Great Britain the Department of Employment is generally responsible for
employment policy and for the payment of unemployment benefit, while the
Manpower Services Commission (MSC) advises the Government on manpower
policy issues.
The MSC, on which employers, trade unions, local authorities and education¬
al interests are represented, is separate from the Government but accountable to
the Secretaries of State for Employment, Scotland and Wales. Scottish and
Welsh committees of the MSC consider special Scottish and Welsh aspects of
manpower issues. Most of the MSC's activities are financed from public funds. It
is advised by a network of area manpower boards on which employers,
employees and other local interests are represented.
The MSC s main duty is to help people to select, train for, obtain and retain
jobs, and to assist employers to obtain employees. The services in Northern
Ireland are run on similar lines by the Department of Economic Development.
The main public employment services (other than the careers service) are
provided in Great Britain by the MSC's Employment Division, which offers a
comprehensive service for employers needing staff and for people, whether or
not already in employment, seeking jobs. It operates through a network of about
1,000 local jobcentres' which handle all occupations except professional,
scientific, technical and managerial, for which the MSC's Professional and
Executive Recruitment is responsible. The jobcentre network is being reorga¬
nised, with fewer large jobcentres and more small jobcentres; a number of
jobcentres now display only vacancies and information. Some new small
jobcentres are being located in libraries and other local authority establish¬
ments. Self-service facilities for job-seekers are being increased.
Registration for employment is voluntary for all unemployed people, whether
or not they wish to claim benefits. In the year to March 1985, 2-4 million
vacancies were notified and 1-8 million people were placed in employment
(including job-seekers who were placed in a job more than once during the year).
The public employment service provides a resettlement service to disabled
people. Specially trained Disablement Resettlement Officers advise on rehabili¬
tation and training courses and on the comprehensive range of special schemes
and facilities available. In 1984-85 the MSC found jobs for some 72.000
disabled people. The Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944 requires
employers who employ 20 or more people to include 3 per cent registered
disabled people within their workforce. As part of its 'Fit for Work' campaign to
improve the employment prospects of disabled people, the MSC runs a scheme of
annual awards for firms which excel in carrying out constructive policies on the
employment of disabled people.
The MSC's Employment Division runs a network of 27 Employment Rehabili¬
tation Centres, which provide facilities for those who have been ill or injured or
are handicapped to return to working fitness (some 15.000 a year). The Division
also supports a number of agency centres run by local authorities and voluntary
bodies specialising in the employment rehabilitation of the blind, the mentally ill
and people with cerebral palsy.
Sheltered employment is provided for the severely disabled in Great Britain
by Remploy Ltd and in Northern Ireland by Ulster Sheltered Employment Ltd.
both non-profit-making companies, and by local authorities and voluntary
organisations.
In order to help to till vacancies which cannot be filled locally, the MSC can
provide grants, allowances and other financial help under the Job Search and
Employment Transfer Schemes to assist people who are unemployed, or under

threat of redundancy, to look for and move to jobs in other areas. The help
available includes the cost of attending interviews, visiting new areas to look for
work, and living away from home and moving home to the new area. The
National Mobility Scheme makes movement easier for public sector housing
tenants in England and Wales. Similar aims in Scotland are promoted by
provisions in the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980.
Professional and Executive Recruitment is a specialist branch of the MSC which
helps employers looking for professional, managerial, scientific or technical staff
and assists people seeking employment at this level. It operates nationally,
through a network of offices, and offers a comprehensive recruitment service
based on a weekly jobs newspaper which is issued to all enrolled job-seekers, for
whom the service is free.
Under the Employment and Training Act 1973 local education authorities must
provide a careers service to include vocational guidance for people attending all
educational institutions (except universities, which have their own careers
service) and an employment service for those leaving them. Authorities may also
provide an employment service for other people, mainly young people in their
early post-school years. The employment service provided by the MSC’s
Employment Division is also available to young people.
The careers services in Wales and Scotland are the responsibility of the
respective Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland it is an integral part of the
Department of Economic Development.
The MSC Careers and Occupational Information Centre publishes material to
help people looking for jobs to make an informed choice, and distributes careers
literature to some 15,000 schools, careers offices and other centres.
Most occupational training in Britain is carried out and funded by employers.
Statutory industrial training boards operate in some industries to ensure
adequate training by raising a levy from employers and disbursing grants for
approved training. The majority of boards may exempt employers whose
training is satisfactory from payment of most of the levy. In other industries,
non-statutory training bodies, membership of which is voluntary, take responsi¬
bility for the development and encouragement of training.
The Government funds training through the MSC. In recent years the MSC
has evolved a comprehensive strategy to help to improve the supply of trained
manpower needed by the economy, to provide opportunities for people to acquire
new skills, and to improve the effectiveness of training generally. In 1981 the
Government announced a new initiative on training based on three important
objectives for the 1980s and beyond: better arrangements for skill training to
agreed standards: improving the vocational education and training of all young
people: and opening up more opportunities for adults to train.
The Youth Training Scheme, introduced in 1983, guarantees a full year’s
vocational training to 16-year-old school-leavers and unemployed 17-year-old
school-leavers in Great Britain. Most entrants take up places offered by
employers providing a planned programme of work experience and on-the-job
training. About one-quarter of trainees are involved in schemes which are not
employer-based: they train at information technology centres, training work¬
shops or on community-based schemes and receive a planned programme of
work experience and, where possible, on-the-job training at employers’
premises. By early 1986 over 1 million young school-leavers will have entered the
scheme. In Northern Ireland a broadly comparable Youth Training Programme is
in operation, providing some 8,700 full-time training places in 1985-86.

Adult
Training
In 1985 the Government introduced a number of measures with the aim of
producing a larger flow ol qualified workers with the skill requirements of an
advanced economy. These involve a major extension of the Youth Training
Scheme, the development of initiatives in full-time education and the establish¬
ment of a working group to review vocational qualifications in England and
Wales. From 1 April 1986 the extended Youth Training Scheme (which will be
primarily employer-based and open to both employed and unemployed young
people) will provide those aged 16 and 17 who do not enter full-time education
with job-related training leading to a recognised vocational qualification: it will
offer two years of training to those leaving school at 16 and one year to those
leaving at 17. The Government is prepared to make available additional
resources to the scheme, increasing its contribution to £925 million in 1986-87
and £1,100 million in 1987-88.
The main purpose of the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative,
administered by the MSG in Great Britain in co-operation with local education
authorities and making use of existing schools and colleges, is to stimulate the
provision of technical and vocational education for 14- to 18-year-olds. By 1986
most local education authorities will be participating in the initiative. Projects
provide an integrated course of full-time education leading to nationally
recognised qualifications. Additional resources are being allocated to in-service
teacher training related to the initiative under a two-year programme which
began in June 1985 and is administered by the MSG.
In 1984-85 over 100.000 adults participated in the MSC's adult training
programmes and the number is forecast to increase to 300.000 by 1986—87. The
programmes have been considerably restructured under the new adult training
strategy launched in 1984. I raining is being more closely directed towards the
skills needed by employers, while training for the unemployed in basic
work-related skills is being expanded under the Wider Opportunities Training
Programme, and greater emphasis is being placed on training for those running
or hoping to start small businesses. The MSG supports a number of courses for
people starting their own business, while Training for Enterprise- will offer
training for people to become self-employed, or to start up businesses of various
sizes, and will encourage the local development of training arrangements for
small firms. Increased use of open learning methods and materials is being
supported through the Open Tech programme, with the aim of making training
at technical and supervisory levels available to all adults who can benefit from it
in a form which can be adapted to meet their own study circumstances. The
MSG has initiated an adult training campaign to raise awareness of adult
training and the need for such training, and to stimulate further action,
particularly by employers.
The MSC's largest programme is the Job Training Scheme, which comple¬
ments the training given in industry and commerce by providing people aged 18
and over with the opportunity to acquire new skills and improve existing skills.
Training is carried out in a nationwide network of skillcentres- under the
control of the MSC's Skillcentre Training Agency and at many colleges and
employers establishments. About 500 different courses are available in a wide
range of occupations.
The Skillcentre Training Agency provides training services to employers in a
wide range of trades designed to equip selected employees with new or improved
skills of direct and immediate benefit to their companies. This training,
specially tailored to the employer's needs, is carried out either at the local
skillcentre or, using the Agency's expanded mobile training service, in the
company s own workshop. Although skillcentres have mainly concentrated on

concerned with all aspects of the application of new technology to industry and
commerce.
Britain has been a pioneer in the introduction of protective legislation for the
safety, health and welfare of employees. The Employment Protection (Consolida¬
tion) Act 1978 provides a number of safeguards for employees. For example,
most employees are entitled to receive from their employers written information
on their terms and conditions of employment, disciplinary rules and the
procedure available to employees wishing to raise complaints; minimum periods
of notice when employment is to be terminated are also laid down for both
employers and employees. Employees with a minimum period of service of two
years are entitled to lump-sum redundancy payments if their jobs cease to exist
(tor example, because of technological improvements or a fall in demand) and
their employers cannot offer suitable alternative work, the cost being partly met
from a fund subscribed to by both sides of industry. Protection against unfair
dismissal is provided by machinery under which an employee who has been in
continuous employment for two years or more may complain against an
employer of unfair dismissal, and, if successful, obtain reinstatement, re¬
engagement or compensation. Legal support is given to the right to trade union
organisation (with certain exceptions) by making it unfair to dismiss a person
because of membership or participation in the activities of an independent trade
union; rights of employees are also protected in regard to penalisation short of
dismissal because of trade union membership or activities. Other rights include
limited payment when work is not available for reasons other than as a result of
a strike, lock-out or other industrial action, and maternity rights for female
employees.
In general, people coming to Britain for employment need a work permit issued
by the Department of Employment. Among other conditions, work permits are
issued only for work requiring a recognised professional qualification, or a high
degree of skill or experience, where the Department of Employment is satisfied
that the worker is necessary and there is no suitable worker in Britain or in
other European Community countries to fill the post. In general, the age limits
for permits in most categories are 23—54 years.
People coming for certain kinds of specialist employment (for example,
ministers of religion and representatives of the overseas media) and the
self-employed do not require work permits but may require entry clearances
issued by a British Consulate or High Commission.
Permits are also issued under the Training and Work Experience Scheme for
nationals of countries outside the European Community who are undertaking
limited periods of training or work experience leading to the acquisition of a
particular occupational skill or qualification and to young people from outside
the European Community to undertake short periods of employment to broaden
their work experience and, if appropriate, to improve their knowledge of
English.
European Community workers entering another member state have the same
rights as nationals of that state as regards facilities of the national employment
services, pay and working conditions, trade union rights, vocational training
and retraining facilities, access to housing and property, and social security and
industrial injury benefits.
Discrimination The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it unlawful to discriminate on grounds of
colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin, in
employment, training and related matters. The Department of Employment
328
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Employment of

operates a Race Relations Employment Advisory Service with advisers based in
the main areas where ethnic minorities have settled. Its general aim is to
promote equal opportunity in employment and its advisers offer help and
guidance to employers and unions on a wide range of issues which arise in the
employment of a multiracial workforce. The Commission for Racial Equality's
code of practice, which came into operation in 1984, is intended to give
practical guidance to employers and others on the best arrangements for
implementing policies to eliminate racial discrimination and to enhance
equality of opportunity.
Legislation forbids any employment of children under 14 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of children who have not reached the
statutory minimum schooMeaving age (16); of women and young people
underground in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations (for
example, certain processes connected with lead manufacture); and of women in
factories and workshops within four weeks after childbirth. It also limits and
defines the permissible hours of employment for women and young people.
The employment provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act make it unlawful to
discriminate on the grounds of sex or marital status in employment, training
and related matters. The Equal Pay Act 1970, as amended in 1984, requires that
a woman doing the same or broadly similar work as a man, or work which has an
equal value, should receive equal pay and conditions of employment.
Pay rates lor manual occupations, and increasingly for non-manual occupa¬
tions, are normally set by collective bargaining (see p 333). Basic rates of pay
vary widely, and in private industry rates paid locally often exceed the rates
specified in national agreements. Higher rates are usually paid for overtime and
shift work, and weekly earnings may be further increased by incentive bonus
schemes.
According to the latest available information from the Department of
Employment s New Earnings Survey, the average weekly earnings (including
overtime payments) in April 1984 of full-time employees on adult rates were
£159-30 (£178-80 for men and £117-20 for women). Women's earnings are thus
markedly lower than those of men, partly because on average they work shorter
hours, with less overtime paid at premium rates, and partly because they tend to
be concentrated in the less well-paid jobs.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally
by annual salary paid monthly, often on a scale carrying annual increments.
Starting salaries may be in the range of £4,000 to £4,500 (lower for young
trainees and higher for some graduates). Most of the senior posts in business,
the professions and the Civil Service command salaries in the range of £15,000
to £30,000 a year gross before tax. The posts with salaries in the range of
£30,000 to £75,000 a year include those of Cabinet ministers, top-ranking
judicial appointments, the highest positions in government departments and
the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily newspapers, leading members
of professions and the higher managerial posts in industry, commerce and
banking. Salaries of chairmen of major companies often exceed £75,000 a year,
and other people such as star entertainers often receive more through fees or
fixed contracts.
The basic working week in Great Britain is in the range 37-5 to 40 hours for
manual work and 35 to 38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually
worked. Actual hours worked differ from basic hours; in 1984 they were 41-7 for
men compared with 37-2 for women. Men and women in non-manual
occupations generally work less overtime than manual workers.

National legislation limits and defines permissible hours of work for women
and young people in industrial work—the maximum, with limited exceptions,
being 48 hours a week and 10 hours a day (9 hours a day for 6-day-week
workers) in premises covered by the Factories Act for adult women over 18 and
young people between 16 and 18. The employment of women and young people
at night is in principle prohibited in industrial undertakings, except for young
men over 16 working in some continuous-process industries (subject to certain
conditions). The Health and Safety Executive can make exemptions from these
restrictions to maintain or increase efficiency. In general, the hours of work of
adult men, or of people not working in factories, are not restricted by statute.
Apart trom industries where conditions are controlled by wages councils (see
p 334), there are no general statutory entitlements to holidays, and holiday
entitlements are normally determined by collective agreements. These generally
provide for at least four weeks' paid holiday a year, and some 80 per cent of
manual workers covered by national collective agreements have entitlements of
more than four weeks. Non-manual workers tend to have longer holidays than
manual workers. Holiday entitlements may also be dependent upon length of
service.
Additional benefits exist in varying degrees. About half of employees in
employment are covered by pension schemes provided by their employers. Many
employees are also covered by occupational sick pay schemes which are
additional or complementary to the state schemes, and by schemes to provide
private medical treatment. A smaller number are covered by schemes for
redundancy payments above the statutory minimum. Such benefits are more
usual among clerical and professional employees receiving a standard salary
than among manual workers. Employees may have use of a company car and
some firms provide profit-sharing and share-saving schemes. In accord with its
view that share ownership and profit-sharing can help in developing employees'
understanding of, and commitment to, business and industry, the Government
has extended fiscal measures designed to encourage profit-sharing. Share
option schemes, to enable employees to buy shares in the firms in which they
work, have increased from about 30 in 1979 to about 900 in 1985, and involve
about 750,000 workers. The provision of low-priced meals at the place of
employment is usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones.
Many offices and shops which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their
staff have adopted luncheon voucher schemes. Among the other executive fringe
benefits sometimes available are life assurance, telephone allowances and
low-interest loans.
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers (and in some industries
nearly all workers) are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over many years and, consequently, their form and
organisation vary considerably, as do their traditions. During the 1970s trade
unionism increased particularly among clerical, supervisory, technical and
administrative workers, but rising unemployment has led to a decline in union
membership, especially in unions representing manual workers. Trade unions
may be organised either by occupation (for example, they may recruit clerks or
fitters wherever employed) or by industry. Some are based on a combination of
both principles. In some companies membership of the relevant trade union is
required by agreement between the employer and union (‘closed shops’). At the
end of 1983 the total membership of British trade unions was about 11-3
million, of whom 80 per cent were in the 23 largest unions with over 100,000
members. There were 442 trade unions on the list maintained by the
330
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Trades Union
Congress
Certification Officer under the Employment Protection Act 1975, but by the end
of 1984 the number had fallen to 413. To be eligible for entry on the list a trade
union must show that it consists wholly or mainly of workers and that its
principal purposes include the regulation of relations between workers and
employers, or between workers and employers' associations. Certain rights and
privileges are reserved for independent trade unions.
Among the largest unions are the Transport and General Workers Union (1 -5
million members), the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers (1 -2 million)
and the General, Municipal. Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union (875,000); of
the non-manual workers' unions, the largest are the National and Local
Government Officers' Association (780,000 members) and the National Union of
Public Employees (689,000).
The central organisation of most large unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by and responsible to the annual conference of delegates
from local branches. Between conferences, councils are the highest authority of
unions, and carry out policy decisions made by the conference delegates. Most
unions also have regional and district organisations. At the level of the
individual member there are local branches, covering one or more workplaces.
Members may attend branch meetings, make suggestions about terms and
conditions’of employment, discuss the work of the union, and take part in the
election of the union's officers. The branch takes action on certain matters
considered to be entirely, or mainly, of local interest and forwards its views on
wider issues for action by the union's national or regional bodies.
The organising of members in individual places of work, and the negotiation
of local pay agreements with managements at the factory or plant, may be done
by full-time district officials of the union, or, in many cases, by ‘shop stewards',
who are chosen by their fellow members in the place of work to represent them.
Trade unions vary in the degree to which shop stewards are integrated into their
organisation. Where two or more unions have members in the same workplace,
shop stewards' committees may be formed to discuss matters of common
concern.
Many unions provide ‘strike pay' for members involved in official industrial
action which may vary from an amount equal to full net pay to a largely nominal
sum. They also provide legal advice for members who suffer injury or contract
diseases at work, or have been unfairly dismissed, and may pay members' legal
costs where a case for compensation goes to court. Some unions pay benefits in
case of illness, accident, death and retirement (additional to those payable under
the National Insurance scheme) financed out of membership contributions.
Many trade unions are affiliated to the Labour Party. Any trade union wishing
to use money for political purposes must set up a separate fund, subject to
special rules, one of which must allow any member who objects to contributing
to the fund to opt out. Following consultation about the working of this system
of ‘contracting out’, the Government reached an agreement with the Trades
Union Congress in 1984 that trade union members should be kept fully
informed of their right to contract out of the political levy and be able to exercise
that right effectively.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the Trades Union
Congress (TUC), which was founded in 1868. The TUC's objects are to promote
the interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and
social conditions of working people. Its affiliated membership comprises 93
trade unions which together represent 10 million people, or some 90 per cent of
all trade unionists in Britain, and it exercises power through influence rather
than through sanctions. The TUC deals with all general questions which
concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and gives assistance

Framework
on questions relating to particular trades or industries. It is consulted by the
Secretary of State for Employment before the appointment of employee
representatives on the Manpower Services Commission, the Advisory, Concilia¬
tion and Arbitration Service and certain other official bodies with an interest in
employment matters. There are eight TUC regional councils for England, and a
Wales Trades Union Council.
The annual Congress convenes in September to discuss matters of concern to
trade unionists and to employees generally. A General Council represents it
between Congresses and is responsible for carrying out Congress decisions,
watching economic and social developments, providing educational and
advisory services to unions, and presenting to the Government the trade union
viewpoint on economic, social and industrial issues. The TUC is also empowered
to mediate in inter-union disputes in certain circumstances, and uses its
authority to try to resolve such difficulties.
The TUC, as well as many individual unions, conducts extensive educational
services for members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade union¬
ism and the principles and practice of industrial relations.
The TUC plays an active part in international trade union activity, through its
alliliation to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the
European Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates the British workers'
delegation to the annual International Labour Conference.
Trade unions in Scotland also have their own national central body, the Scottish
Trades Union Congress, which in many respects is similar in constitution and
function to the TUC. I rade unions in Northern Ireland are represented by the
Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU),
although the majority of trade unionists in Northern Ireland belong to unions
based in Great Britain. About 85 per cent of Northern Ireland trade unionists are
members of organisations affiliated to the ICTU, while the majority belong to
unions which are also affiliated to the TUC. The Northern Ireland Committee of
the ICTU has no political affiliations and enjoys a high degree of autonomy.
The beginnings of the present law on industrial relations were established a
century ago, when trade union members were freed from charges of criminal
conspiracy; at the same time trade unions were granted certain immunities,
including immunity from liability to damages for the economic effects of strike
action. Peaceful picketing during strikes was also made legal. At the beginning
of the present century unions were given a wide degree of immunity from legal
action under the civil law, and the immunities of those organising industrial
action were also strengthened.
The Employment Acts 1980 and 1982 were designed to obtain a better balance
between rights and responsibilities in industrial relations. The 1980 Act
enabled the Government to make funds available to encourage the wider use of
secret union ballots and to produce codes of practice to promote good industrial
relations. It limited lawful picketing to the picket’s own place of work and
restricted the scope for secondary action such as blacking and sympathetic
strikes. It provided greater protection for the individual in relation to the closed
shop and removed legal protection from any new closed shop which had not been
approved in a secret ballot by 80 per cent of the employees affected. As provided
for in the Act, the Government has published codes of practice on the conduct of
picketing and the closed shop. Illegal activities such as violence on picket lines
are subject to the criminal law, which is enforced by the police, but unlawful
picketing is a matter for employers to restrain by means of civil law.
The 1982 Act was designed to carry the process further. It increased the
compensation for employees unfairly dismissed for non-membership or
332
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
EMPLOYERS’
ORGANI¬
SATIONS
membership of a union and introduced compensation (from government funds)
for certain employees dismissed because of non-membership of a union in a
closed shop between 1974 and 1980. when they had no protection. The Act also
removed legal protection from all closed shops (not only from new ones, as in the
1980 Act) where within two years of the legislation taking effect the closed shop
had not been supported in a secret ballot held in the previous five years by 80 per
cent of the employees affected or by 85 per cent of those voting in the ballot.
Where legal protection is removed, any dismissal for non-membership of a union
is unfair. Terms in commercial contracts specifying the use of union labour only
were made unenforceable and discrimination on the basis of union membership
in the awarding of contracts was made unlawful. Industrial action which seeks
to persuade employers to discriminate in this way or to interfere with the supply
of goods or services on grounds of union membership is unlawful. The Act also
ended the position which gave trade unions almost complete immunity from all
civil actions by bringing their position into line with that of their individual
officials and members. This means that trade unions now have immunity only
for action taken in furtherance or contemplation of a lawful trade dispute. There
were also changes to the definition of a trade dispute upon which immunity for
civil actions depends. Disputes between employer and employees (that is, most
industrial action) continue to qualify as lawful trade disputes, but disputes
which have become unlawful are those where there is no disagreement between
an employer and his or her employees, or those which have little to do with the
normal subject of a trade dispute (such as terms and conditions of work) or
concern matters wholly outside Britain, and other such disputes which do not
involve employers.
The Trade Union Act 1984 was introduced by the Government to increase
democracy in trade unions. It requires that all voting members of the principal
executive committee of unions should be elected by a secret ballot of the
members (normally a postal ballot) at least once every five years, and requires
unions to compile and maintain a register of members' names and addresses. It
also removes legal immunity from trade unions which call a strike or take other
industrial action without first holding a secret ballot of members concerned and
securing a majority vote for this action. In addition, the Act requires trade
unions with political funds to ballot their members at regular intervals to decide
whether the funds should be retained. All trade unions with political funds (53
at the end of 1984) are required to hold a ballot by 31 March 1986 unless
members have been balloted in the previous ten years.
Northern Ireland has a broadly similar but separate system of industrial
relations legislation.
Many employers in Britain are members of employers' organisations, some of
which are wholly concerned with labour matters although others are also
concerned with commercial matters or trade associations. The primary aims of
such organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and conditions of
employment, including a sound wage structure and proper standards of safety,
health and welfare; to promote good relations with employees and the efficient
use of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes which may
arise. Combined employers' organisations and trade associations may also
represent members' points of view as manufacturers or traders to the
Government on commercial matters.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis, for example, the Engineering Employers' Federation. A few
are purely local in character or deal with a section of an industry or, for example,
with small businesses; most are national and are concerned with the whole
of an industry. In some of the main industries there are local or regional

organisations combined into national federations, while in others, within which
different firms are engaged in making different principal products, there is a
complex structure with national and regional federations for parts of an
industry as well as for the industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 360
employers' associations known to the Certification Officer. Those which are
national organisations negotiate the national collective agreements for their
industry with the trade unions concerned: most of these national organisations
belong to the Confederation of British Industry.
The Confederation of British Industry (CB1) is the largest central employers'
organisation in Britain, representing directly or indirectly some 250,000
businesses which together employ about half the working population. It exists
primarily to ensure that Government, national and international institutions
and the public understand the needs, intentions and problems of business.
Membership ranges from the smallest to the largest companies, private sector
and nationalised, and covers a broad spectrum which includes manufacturing,
agriculture, construction, distribution, mining, finance, retailing and insur¬
ance. Most national employers' organisations, trade associations and some
chambers of commerce are members. Policy is determined by a council of 400
members, and there is a permanent staff of 340. while there are 13 regional
offices and an office in Brussels. The CBI is the British member of the Union of
Industries of the European Community. The CBI nominates the employers'
representatives on a number of bodies including the National Economic
Development Council, the Manpower Services Commission, the Health and
Safety Commission and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.
The structure of industrial relations in Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis. The system is based chiefly on the organisation of employees
and employers into trade unions and employers' associations, and on freely
conducted negotiations at all levels. The government-funded, but independent.
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) provides its services
where the usual methods of resolving disagreements have failed. Because of the
publicity they receive, strikes are commonly thought to occur much more
frequently in Britain than in other countries. International comparisons show,
however, that Britain's record on industrial disputes is better than those of a
number of other major industrial countries. In an analysis of industrial disputes
in 20 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development between 1974 and 1983, Britain ranked about half-way. In 1984
some 26-6 million working days were lost in Britain through industrial
stoppages, over 80 per cent being accounted for by a major dispute in the coal
industry.
In most industries terms and conditions of employment and procedures for the
conduct of industrial relations are settled by negotiation and agreement between
employers or employers' associations and trade unions. Agreements may be
industry-wide, often supplemented by local agreements in companies or
factories (plant bargaining). In the public sector, agreements are generally
reached at industry level. In some industries, companies and factories,
negotiations are conducted by meetings held when necessary, while in others,
joint negotiating councils or committees have been established on a permanent
basis. The scope of the various bodies (from national joint industrial councils for
whole industries to works councils and committees in individual workplaces)
varies widely, and can cover such additional matters as production plans,
absenteeism, training, education, welfare and safety. Normally these arrange¬
ments for collective bargaining suffice to settle all questions which are raised,

but there is often provision for matters not so settled to be referred for
settlement to independent conciliation or arbitration. The Employment Protec¬
tion Act 1975 as amended by the Employment Act 1980 makes provision for
information needed for collective bargaining purposes to be disclosed by
employers to trade unions, subject to certain safeguards.
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service has the general duty of
promoting the improvement of industrial relations, and in particular of
encouraging collective bargaining and the development and (where necessary)
reform of collective bargaining machinery. ACAS is an independent organisation
controlled by a council consisting of a full-time chairman and nine part-time
members experienced in industrial relations, of whom three are nominated after
consultation with the CBI, three after consultation with the TUC, and three are
independent. The Service conciliates in industrial disputes in both the public
and private sectors on a voluntary basis. ACAS assistance is sought in some
1,600 disputes each year. In addition, there are some 200 further requests a
year for ACAS to provide arbitration, which it may do either by appointing single
arbitrators or boards of arbitration or by referring cases to the Central
Arbitration Committee (see below). Although ACAS has prime responsibility for
helping to resolve disputes, and has also set up major committees of inquiry, the
Secretary of State for Employment retains powers to appoint a court of inquiry
or committee of investigation into a dispute, but these are rarely used.
The Service gives advice on all aspects of industrial relations and employment
policies to employers, managers, trade unions, employee representatives and
individuals, and it handles nearly 280,000 inquiries a year. Specialist staff make
nearly 10,000 advisory visits a year, and the involvement of both employers and
employees in diagnosing problems and finding remedies is encouraged. It
carries particular responsibility for attempting conciliation on complaints of
infringement of individual employee rights (such as individual complaints of
unfair dismissal, complaints under the Equal Pay Act 1970, including claims for
equal pay for work of equal value, and complaints on employment matters under
the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Race Relations Act 1976). There are
nearly 43,000 such cases each year. In 1985 the Work Research Unit, whose task
is to promote, jointly through trade unions and employers, the improvement of
job satisfaction and the quality of working life, was incorporated within ACAS.
The Central Arbitration Committee is an independent standing arbitration
body. It provides boards of arbitration for the settlement of trade disputes
referred to it with the consent of the parties concerned and adjudicates on
claims, including those made under the disclosure of information provisions of
the Employment Protection Act and under the Equal Pay Act.
The Office of Manpower Economics is an independent non-statutory organisa¬
tion responsible for servicing independent review bodies which advise on the
pay of various public-sector groups. These are the Top Salaries Review Body,
the Armed Forces’ Pay Review Body, the Doctors’ and Dentists' Review Body, and
the Review Body for Nurses and other National Health Service professions. The
Office also provides services for the Pharmacists’ Review Panel, the Police
Negotiating Board and the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal. It is responsible
for research into pay and associated matters as requested by the Government.
In a small number of industries and trades where the organisation of employers
or employees or both is not strong enough to provide a basis for successful
voluntary arrangements, there are statutory wage-regulating bodies, known as
wages councils. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of
employers and employees in the respective sectors of industry, with three

independent members. There are 26 wages councils which lay down minimum
rates of pay and detailed conditions of employment for about 2-75 million
workers, primarily in service industries such as retailing, catering and
hairdressing. The system has been criticised as an obstacle to the creation of
jobs, and the Government has therefore reviewed the system. As a result,
legislation is planned which would remove young people under 2 1 from any
regulation by wages councils and would confine the councils to setting only a
single minimum hourly rate and a single overtime rate.
Employers have a duty at civil and criminal law to take reasonable care of their
employees, and others affected by their work activities, and to provide a safe
system of working, while employees have a duty of care towards each other and
also to take care of their own safety. The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. Its purpose is to secure the health, safety and
welfare of people at work and to provide for the protection of the public whose
health and safety might be affected by work activities. The Act places general
duties on everyone concerned with work activities, including employers, the
self-employed, employees, manufacturers and suppliers.
The 1974 Act is superimposed on earlier health and safety legislation, such as
the Mines and Quarries Act 1954, the Factories Act 1961 and the Offices, Shops
and Railway Premises Act 1963 and the various regulations made under them.
The earlier legislation imposes specific obligations and standards on, for
example, occupiers of particular types of premises or employers engaged in
particular activities and covers such matters as the fencing of machinery,
precautions against the exposure of people to toxic dusts and gases, precautions
against fire, dangerous substances and special risks, the safe condition of
premises, and cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventilation.
Some of the earlier legislation was replaced immediately by the 1974 Act, but
the remainder continues in force pending its progressive replacement by
regulations and codes of practice. Regulations made under the Act govern the
establishment of first-aid facilities, the control of work with lead and the control
of major accident hazards in industry, each set being supported by either an
approved code of practice or other guidance material, and there are others in the
course of development.
The Health and Safety Commission, established by the 1974 Act and account¬
able to Parliament through the Secretary of State for Employment, has
responsibility for developing policies, including guidance, codes of practice, or
proposals for regulations. In the case of proposals for changes in legislation, the
Commission consults the people who will be affected by them and makes
recommendations to the Secretary of State concerned. The Commission has an
independent chairman, three members appointed after consultation with the
CBI, three after consultation with the TUC, and two after consultation with local
authority associations. The Commission has six subject advisory committees
(on toxic substances, on dangerous substances, on dangerous pathogens, on
genetic manipulation, on the safety of nuclear installations, and on medical
matters), and 11 industry advisory committees, for agriculture, ceramics,
construction, education, foundries, health services, oil, paper and board,
printing, railways and rubber.
The 1974 Act also set up the Health and Safety Executive, which includes
government inspectorates covering a range of work activities: the Factory
Inspectorate (which also deals with a large number of activities outside factories
such as hospitals and educational establishments) and inspectorates for mines
and quarries, agriculture, major sources of industrial air pollution, nuclear
336

installations, and explosives. It also includes the Medical Division and the
Research and Laboratory Services Division. The inspectors, who have powers of
entry and enforcement, seek compliance with health and safety legislation in
individual workplaces and give advice. The Medical Division, through the
Employment Medical Advisory Service, provides a nationwide service of advice
on the medical aspects of employment problems to employers, employees, trade
unions, doctors and others.
The Research and Laboratory Services Division provides scientific and
medical support and testing services, and carries out research both in its own
laboratories and through universities and other institutions on a contract basis,
often jointly funded by industry. Areas of study include explosion risks, fires,
protective equipment, methods for monitoring airborne contaminants, occupa¬
tional medicine and hygiene, and the safety of engineering systems.
In some premises, mostly offices, shops, warehouses, restaurants and hotels,
health and safety legislation is enforced by inspectors appointed by local
authorities, working under guidance from the Health and Safety Commission.
Some other official bodies work under agency agreement with the Health and
Safety Commission, for example, the Railway Inspectorate (concerned with
worker safety on railways), the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate for Scotland
(concerned with the control of emissions to the atmosphere) and the Depart¬
ment of Energy (concerned with health and safety in the oil industry).
A basic principle underlying the Health and Safety at Work Act is that
employers, in consultation with their employees, should have the responsibility
of working out health and safety arrangements, within the broad obligations of
the law, to suit their own workplaces. Employers with five or more employees
must draw up a written policy for safety and health, and must inform their
employees of the policy and of the arrangements for its implementation. In
workplaces where negotiations take place with a trade union, the union
may appoint safety representatives to be the employees’ official channel for
representation and consultation over safety matters.
Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, the Health and Safety Agency, roughly corresponding to the
Health and Safety Commission, and an Employment Medical Advisory Service,
were set up by the Health and Safety at Work (NI) Order 1978. The Northern
Ireland Department of Economic Development, through its Health and Safety
Inspectorate, is responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety
legislation, which is broadly similar to that for Great Britain.
17 Public Finance
Public finance is concerned with taxation, expenditure and borrowing by central
and local government. Central government raises money from individuals and
companies by direct and indirect taxation and from National Insurance
contributions. It spends money on goods and services, such as health and
defence, and in payments to people, such as social security and pensions. Local
government receives substantial grants from central government and raises
revenue mainly through rates (local property taxes). From these resources it
provides services such as education, police and fire services and refuse
collection. The external finance of the nationalised industries and other public
corporations also has to be financed by government—from taxation or borrow¬
ing.
The government department responsible for broad control of public finance
and expenditure is the Treasury. The Bank of England (the central bank) advises
the Government on financial matters, executes monetary policy and acts as
banker to the Government.
PLANNING The background to the present Government's planning of public finance is the
PUBLIC medium-term financial strategy introduced in 1980. The Government's aim is to
FINANCE maintain a firm financial framework, with a progressive reduction in monetary
growth and public borrowing as a proportion of national output, in order to
secure further reduction in inflation and create the conditions for sustainable
growth. With commitments also to reducing taxation and curbing the role of the
state, the Government has therefore sought to reduce public expenditure as a
proportion of national output as well. The objective is to hold public expenditure
broadly level in real terms so that economic growth will lead to the reduction
sought.
Table 32, showing projections for the public sector borrowing requirement,
indicates a planned total for public expenditure rising from £134,200 million in
1985—86 to £148,000 million in 1988—89.
The Planning Each year the Government conducts a review (the public expenditure survey ) of
Cycle its expenditure plans for the forthcoming three years and publishes the
resulting totals for the following year, together with any changes in National
Insurance, in the Autumn Statement around November. Details of the plans for
all three years and of the aims of government expenditure and the output
obtained are given in the annual public expenditure White Paper which appears
early in the following year, before the Budget.
The Government's updating of the medium-term financial strategy and
consequent plans for financing expenditure over the following year, including
any tax changes, are set out in the Financial Statement and Budget Report,
published with the Budget around the end of the financial year (31 March).
Details are announced subsequently in the Finance Bill, which is presented to
Parliament shortly after the Budget and becomes law during the summer.
PUBLIC The public expenditure planning total of £134,200 million for 1985—86
EXPENDITURE comprises £132,100 million as set out in the January 1985 public expenditure
White Paper, £2,000 million added to the reserve (see p 338) at the time of the

1985 Budget and a further sum of about £100 million resulting from Budget
measures.
Analysed by spending authority, the figure of £132,100 million comprises
£96,500 million by central government departments, over £33,000 million by
local authorities, and just over £2,000 million by public corporations. The
planning total takes into account income of some £2,500 million resulting from
sales of public sector assets.
Central government spending is largely voted by Parliament through the
annual Supply Estimates (see p 340). The rest consists mainly of social security
payments which are made out of the National Insurance Fund. The largest
departmental programmes are those on social security payments (38-5 per cent
of the total), defence (18-7 per cent) and health and personal social services (14-6
per cent). See Table 33.
About half of local authority spending is financed by grants from central
government. The rest is met from rates and from borrowing. Education
accounts for over 40 per cent of local authority spending.
The greater part of public expenditure by the public corporations consists of
the external finance of the nationalised industries, which is planned to be
£1,300 million in 1985—86.
About 38 per cent of the planning total of £132,100 million takes the form of
cash payments to the private sector—mainly pensions and other social security
payments: 30 per cent is allocated for pay; 26 per cent will be spent on other
goods and services from the private sector; and 4 per cent will go on subsidies.
The priorities between capital and current spending, or between procurement
and pay costs, vary greatly between different programmes. Planned capital
spending by central and local government in 1985-86 is some £13,500 million,
which is forecast to rise to £14,000 million in 1987-88, implying a small
reduction in real terms. Capital spending by public corporations is put at
£5,500 million in 1985—86.
Planned expenditure includes an unallocated reserve to cover all contingencies
including revisions to the estimated size of demand-determined programmes,

policy changes and new initiatives taken during the course of the year. This
underlines the Government's intention to treat the planning total itself as a
control total. The reserve for 1985-86 is £5,000 million, having been increased
at the time of the 1985 Budget from an original allocation of £3,000 million.
Some 40 per cent of public expenditure is subject to control by cash limits
(external financing limits in the case of nationalised industries). Another 40 per
cent consists of ‘demand-determined’ services (for example, social security
benefits) on which, once policy and rates of payment have been determined,
expenditure in the short run depends on the number of eligible recipients. The
remaining 20 per cent is current expenditure of local authorities, which central
government does not directly control; however, the major part of the contribu¬
tion by central government to such expenditure, the rate support grant, is
subject to cash limits.
Once fixed, cash limits are not usually revised during the course of the year
unless a decision is taken to alter the level of provision for the service concerned.
There is, however, a limited facility for carrying forward underspending on the
capital components of cash limits. If any overspending of cash limits occurs, the
general policy is that a corresponding deduction is made from the limits for the
following year.

The annual public expenditure survey conducted by the Treasury provides the
basis lor the Estimates which each government department submits to the
Treasury in December, giving details of cash requirements for the financial year
beginning in the following April. After approval by the Treasury, these Supply
Estimates are presented to Parliament in March, at the same time as the Budget
(see p 341). Parliament approves them in July as part of the Annual Appropria¬
tion Act, expenditure between 1 April and this date being covered by Votes on
Account approved before the start of the financial year. Supplementary
Estimates may also be presented to Parliament during the course of the year. If
any Supply Estimate is overspent, the Public Accounts Committee (see below)
will investigate fully before Parliament is asked to approve any Excess Vote to
balance the account. In each parliamentary session up to three ‘Estimates days'
are available for debates on the Supply Estimates, following scrutiny by select
committees of the House of Commons.
Some items of expenditure, for example, the salaries and pensions of judges,
are paid directly out ol the Consolidated Fund (see below) as standing services
and are not subject to annual approval by Parliament.
A cheek of public spending additional to control inherent in parliamentary
approval of the Estimates and the system of cash limits is exercised through the
functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Examination of public
expe ndit ure is carried out by select committees of the House of Commons, which
study in detail the activities of particular government departments and require
the attendance of ministers and officials for cross-examination, and by the
Public Accounts Committee.
The Comptroller and Auditor General, an officer of the House of Commons
appointed by the Crown, has two distinct functions. As Comptroller General he
has the duty to ensure that all revenue and other public money payable to the
Consolidated Fund and the National Loans Fund (see below) is duly paid and
that all payments out of these funds are authorised by statute. As Auditor
General, his duties are to certify the accounts of all government departments
and those of a wide range of other public sector bodies; to examine revenue
accounts and inventories; and to report the results of his examinations to
Parliament. He also has wide statutory powers to carry out, and report to
Parliament on. examinations of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use
of resources by those bodies he audits or to which he has right of access.
The Public Accounts Committee considers the appropriation and other accounts
of each government department and the Comptroller and Auditor General s
report of them and on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of departmental
resources. The Committee takes evidence from the official heads of departments
and relevant public sector bodies and submits to Parliament reports which carry
considerable weight, and its recommendations are taken very seriously by the
departments and organisations that it examines. The Government's formal reply
to the reports is presented to Parliament by the Treasury in the form of a
Treasury minute and the reports and minute are usually debated annually in the
House of Commons.
The Government's sterling expenditure is largely met out of the Consolidated
Fund, an account at the Bank of England, into which tax receipts and other
revenues are paid. This is also known as the Exchequer. Any excess of
expenditure over receipts is met by the National Loans Fund, which is another
official sterling account at the Bank of England and is the repository for funds

borrowed by the Government. The National Insurance Fund, into which
contributions are paid by all employers and employed people, is used mainly to
pay lor social security benefits; a small proportion of the Fund is used to help
finance the National Health Service.
The Budget—usually in March or April—sets out the Government's proposals for
changes in taxation and is the main occasion for an annual review of economic
policy. The proposals are announced to the House of Commons by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget statement and are published in the
Financial Statement and Budget Report. This report also contains a review of
recent developments in the economy, together with an economic forecast—one
of the two which the Government is required to publish each year under the
Industrial Development Act 1982 (the other being contained in the Autumn
Statement)—and sets out the fiscal and monetary framework within which
economic policy operates. This is the medium-term financial strategy (see
p 337).
The Budget statement is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means (or
Budget) resolutions in which the proposals are embodied. When passed by the
House of Commons, these resolutions give temporary effect, under the
Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968, to certain of the tax proposals; they are
the foundation of the Finance Bill, in which the proposals are set out for detailed
consideration by Parliament, becoming law as the Finance Act, usually in
the following July. The effect of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act is
thus to enable the Government to collect certain taxes provisionally, at the
levels provided by the Budget proposals, pending enactment of the Finance
Bill.
The bulk of the tax proposals are concerned with changes in the rates or
coverage of taxes, the introduction of new taxes or the abolition of existing ones
and changes in the administrative machinery. These changes are made not only
with regard to the revenue required but also with regard to their effect on the
way the economy performs.
For two taxes—income tax and corporation tax—annual Ways and Means
resolutions followed by Finance Act clauses are required to maintain their
existence, since they are annual rather than permanent taxes. Thus, a Budget
and a Finance Act are necessary at or about the beginning of each financial year.
Tax changes can be made at other times of the year, however, either by specific
legislation or by the use of the regulator, which permits limited changes between
Budgets in value added tax (by up to 25 per cent) and the main excise duties (by
up to 10 per cent).
The March 1985 Budget contained measures aimed at increasing employment
through a restructuring of National Insurance contributions for both employers
and employees, and through extensions of schemes offering temporary work of
benefit to the community for the longer-term unemployed and work-related
training for jobless school-leavers aged 16 or 17. Substantial increases in the
main income tax personal allowances were made in order to improve incentives
and take some people out of tax altogether. The process of shifting the burden of
personal taxation from earnings to spending was continued and a radical
re-examination of the system of personal income tax was announced.
The three principal sources of tax revenue are: taxes on income, which include
income tax and corporation tax; taxes on capital, which include capital transfer
tax and capital gains tax; and indirect taxes, which include customs and excise
duties, value added tax (VAT), rates (which are set and collected by local
authorities to help meet their expenditure), stamp duties and licence duties (for
example, on motor vehicles).

Fable 34 shows the provisional revenue ol central government from taxation
and other sources in 1984-85 and the forecasts for 1985-86.
Taxes on individual incomes are progressive in that larger incomes bear a
proportionately higher rate of tax. Thresholds and rate bands for income tax,
capital transfer tax and capital gains tax are raised automatically each year in
line with the rise in retail prices over the previous calendar year unless the
Government proposes otherwise and Parliament approves. The Inland Revenue
assesses and collects the taxes on income and capital and the stamp duties. The
Customs and Excise collects the most important taxes on expenditure (the
customs and excise duties and VAT).
Taxes on
Income
Income Tax
Corpora tion
Tax
Income tax is imposed for the year of assessment beginning on 6 April. For
1985-86 the basic rate of 30 per cent applies to the first £16,200 of taxable
income. A rate of 40 per cent applies to the £16,201-£ 19,200 band, 45 per cent
to the £19,201—£24,400 band, 50 per cent to the £24,401-£32,300 band and
55 per cent to the £32,301-£40,200 band, ending with a maximum rate of 60
per cent on taxable income over £40,200. These rates apply to both earned and
investment incomes.
A number of personal allowances and reliefs reduce the amount of a person's
taxable income compared with gross income. The main allowances are £2,205
for the income of a single person or the earned income of a wife and £3,455 for
the income of a married man. Among the most important of the reliefs is that for
mortgage interest payments on borrowing for house purchase. Relief at the
basic rate is usually given ‘at source' (that is, passed directly by the tax
authorities to the building society or bank making the loan rather than to the
individual taxpayer). Another relief is that under the business expansion
scheme, whereby certain investors in trading companies without a Stock
Exchange quotation (usually small companies) are able to obtain relief on up to
£40,000 invested in any one year.
Assuming only the basic personal allowances, a single person with an income
of £10,000 a year in 1985—86 pays £2,339 in income tax while a married man
with the same income pays £1,964. The amount of tax payable by a single
person varies from, for example, £839 on an annual income of £5,000 to
£18,252 on one of £45,000.
The income of married couples is usually taxed as one but a husband and wife
may choose to have the wife's earnings charged separately for tax on condition
that the husband receives the single instead of the married personal allowance.
Any investment income is taxed jointly.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a Pay As You Earn
(PAYE) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in Britain
and on all income arising abroad of people resident in Britain. Interest on
certain British government securities belonging to people not ordinarily
resident in Britain is exempt. Britain has entered into agreements with many
countries providing for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are
not in force unilateral relief is often allowed. British residents working abroad
for the whole year benefit from 100 per cent tax relief.
Companies pay corporation tax on their profits, but the amount of taxable profit
is that remaining after deduction of allowances for investment in qualifying
assets used for the business and certain other costs. Only a proportion of any
capital gains is included in total profits, with the result that chargeable gains as
a whole are subject to a lower effective rate of tax. A company which distributes

entitled to a tax credit, which satisfies his or her liability to income tax at the
basic rate.
The main rate of corporation tax fixed in the Finance Act 1984 for the
financial year 1 April 1984-31 March 1985 was 45 per cent, with a reduced rate
of 30 per cent for small companies. The main rate is to fall to 40 per cent in
1985—86 and 35 per cent in 1986—87 (the small company rate staying at 30 per
cent). This is a significantly lower rate than applies in other industrialised
countries. The previously high initial and first-year allowances for various
forms of capital investment are being phased out, leaving a 4 per cent
annual writing-down allowance for buildings and a 25 per cent writing-down
allowance for machinery and plant; short-life assets may be wholly written
off over their useful life, however. Relief for stock appreciation has also been
abolished.
Petroleum revenue tax (deductible in computing profits for corporation tax) is
charged on profits from the production, as opposed to the refining or other
forms of processing, of oil and gas under licence in Britain and on its
continental shelf. The rate of tax is 75 per cent. Each licensee of an oilfield is
charged on the profits from that field after deduction of certain allowances and
reliefs which, among other things, encourage exploration, appraisal and future
Meld development. The tax is computed at half-yearly intervals. Advance
payments of petroleum revenue tax can be made in the early years of production
from a field. These payments can be credited against petroleum revenue
tax subsequently due with any balance repaid five years after the first
payment. However, this system of advance petroleum revenue tax is to be
phased out by the end of 1986. The bulk of both taxes is collected in monthly
instalments.
Capital transfer tax applies to transfers of personal wealth in three main areas:
lifetime gifts; transfers on death; and transfers relating to settled property
(property held in trust). The tax is chargeable on a cumulative basis in respect of
lifetime transfers as they occur and on death as if the deceased had given away
the whole of his or her estate immediately before death. In both cases the tax on
a particular transfer is arrived at by adding to it the value of the chargeable
transfers made within 10 years up to the date of the transfer in question. The
rates of tax applicable are progressively higher on successive slices of the
cumulative total of chargeable transfers, with a lower scale of tax for lifetime
transfers than for transfers on death. The higher scale applies to transfers made
on death or up to three years before the transferor’s death. Under both scales the
first £67,000 of transfers is exempt. The rates on amounts over this figure rise
from 30 per cent (higher scale) and 15 per cent (lower scale) on the slice between
£67,000 and £89,000 to 60 per cent (higher scale) and 30 per cent (lower scale)
on the excess over £299,000.
Capital gains realised on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax or,
in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax is 30 per cent but
individuals are exempt from tax in respect of total net gains of up to £5,900 in
any one year and most trusts on gains of up to £2,950. The effects of inflation
since April 1982 are allowed for when measuring gains. The tax on gifts and
certain deemed disposals of assets may be deferred until the assets are sold.
Certain assets, including the principal private residence, chattels worth less
than £3,000 (and any chattels with a predictable life of less than 50 years except
those on which the expenditure qualifies for a capital allowance), private motor

on government securities and corporate bonds are exempt from the tax if they
have been held for more than 12 months.
Value added tax (VAT) is a broadly based tax, chargeable at 15 per cent. It is
collected at each stage in the production and distribution of goods and services
by taxable persons (generally those whose business has a turnover of more than
£19,500 a year). The final tax is borne by the consumer. When a taxable person
purchases taxable goods or services, the supplier charges VAT (the taxable
person’s input tax). When the taxable person supplies taxable goods or services
to customers, then they in turn are charged VAT (the taxable person's output
tax). The difference between the output tax and the input tax is paid to Customs
and Excise.
There are two methods by which certain goods and services are relieved from
VAT: one is by charging VAT at a zero rate (a taxable person does not charge tax
to a customer but reclaims any input tax paid to suppliers); the other is by
exemption (a taxable person does not charge a customer any output tax and is
not entitled to deduct or reclaim the input tax). Zero-rating applies to most food:
books, newspapers and periodicals: fuel (except for petrol and other fuels for
road use) and power; construction of new buildings: exports; certain interna¬
tional services; public transport fares; caravans and houseboats; young
children’s clothing and footwear; drugs and medicines supplied on prescription:
and certain supplies by or to charities. Exemption applies to land (including
rents), insurance, postal services, betting, gaming (other than by gaming
machines and lotteries), finance, education, health, burial and cremation, and
supplies by trade unions and professional bodies to their members.
Oils used for road fuel bear duty at the basic rate. Heavy oil not used for road fuel
and light oil used for furnace fuel bear a lower duty and, except for lubricating
oil, are zero-rated for VAT. Oil used as chemical feedstocks or otherwise than as
a fuel or lubricant in manufacturing is relieved from duty. There are duties on
spirits, beer, wine, made-wine, cider and perry, mainly related to alcoholic
strength. The cigarette duty is based partly on a charge per 1,000 cigarettes and
partly on a percentage of retail price. Duty on other tobacco products is based on
the weight of the finished product. The principal betting duties are the general
betting duty, which is charged at a rate of 8 per cent of the stake money, except
for on-course betting, which is charged at 4 per cent; pool betting duty (which
applies to football pools), charged at a rate of 42-5 per cent of the stake money:
and bingo duty, charged at 10 per cent. Revenue is also raised from licences on
the operation of gaming machines and casinos.
The licence duty on a private motor car or light van is £100 a year; for motor
cycles it is £10, £20 or £40 a year according to engine capacity. The licence duty
on goods vehicles is charged on the basis of gross weight and, if over 12 tonnes,
according to the number of axles; the duty is designed to ensure that such
vehicles cover at least their road costs through the tax paid (licence duty and fuel
duty). Taxis and buses are taxed according to seating capacity.
New cars, motor cycles, scooters, mopeds and some motor caravans, whether
British made or imported, are chargeable with car tax at 10 per cent on the
wholesale value. VAT is charged on the price including car tax.
Transfers or sales of property (other than of stocks and shares) above a value of
£30,000 are subject to stamp duty of 1 per cent on the whole of the purchase
price. Transfers or sales of stocks and shares (but not share exchanges on a

takeover) are subject to stamp duty regardless of the amount. Transfers by gift
are subject to a fixed 50p duty. Transfers to charities are exempt.
Customs duties are chargeable in accordance with the Common Customs Tariff
of the European Community (no such duties are chargeable on goods which
qualify as Community goods). Special customs import and export procedures
are operated under the Common Agricultural Policy and Community levies are
chargeable on a wide range of agricultural products from non-Community
countries.
A continuing reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) as a
percentage of gross domestic product is an important part of the Government's
medium-term financial strategy; the percentage is projected to fall from 3-25 per
cent in 1984-85 to 2 per cent in 1985-86 and to 1-75 per cent by 1988-89 (see
Table 32 on p 338). As part of the policy of controlling the rate of growth of the
money stock, the Government seeks to finance its borrowing requirement (the
excess of expenditure over tax revenue and other receipts) by sales of long-term
debt to the public outside the banking system. The estimated outturn for the
PSBR in 1984—85 was £10,000 million compared with a forecast of £7,200
million at the time of the 1984 Budget. The outturn was greatly affected by the
costs of a lengthy dispute in the coal industry. Central government debt sales to
the non-bank private sector totalled £12,900 million in 1984-85, of which
£9,200 million was government stock (known as gilt-edged stock as there is no
risk of default) and £3,100 million national savings instruments. Gilt-edged
stock is marketable and is traded on The Stock Exchange. Individuals may also
make transactions through post offices in stocks included on the National
Savings Stock Register. Pension funds and insurance companies have the
largest holdings. The Government issues both conventional and indexed stock
(on which principal and interest are linked to the movement in the retail prices
index).
National savings instruments are non-marketable and are designed to attract
personal savings. Their importance relative to gilt-edged stock as a source of
funds has increased in recent years. The chief instruments are National Savings
Certificates, Income Bonds, Deposit Bonds, National Savings Investment and
Ordinary Accounts, Premium Savings Bonds and Yearly Plan. In 1984-85 the
main contributors to funding were fixed-interest Savings Certificates (net
receipts of £1,288 million) and Income Bonds (£831 million). The contribution
made by net accrued interest from National Savings as a whole (that is, interest
added less that paid out) amounted to £1,452 million in 1984-85.
The other principal debt instruments of central government are Treasury bills
and certificates of tax deposit. Treasury bills are 91-day bills sold at a weekly
auction to the discount houses, which guarantee to take up the whole of the
offer; certificates of tax deposit are non-marketable and may be purchased by
individuals or corporate bodies to be tendered in settlement of a range of taxes.
The bulk of public corporations' borrowing is met by central government
through the National Loans Fund although their temporary borrowing needs are
met largely from the market, often under Treasury guarantee. That part of local
authority borrowing met by central government is supplied by authorisation of
Parliament through the Public Works Loan Board from the National Loans
Fund. (The Board remains an independent body even though it is merged for
administrative purposes with the former National Debt Office, forming the
National Investment and Loans Office.) The local authorities also borrow directly
from the market, both short-term and long-term, through a range of
instruments. Some public corporations and local authorities also borrow on

occasion, under special statutory power and with Treasury consent, in foreign
currencies.
Net central government borrowing each year represents an addition to the
National Debt. At the end of March 1985 the National Debt amounted to some
£159,000 million of which about £3,000 million was in currencies other than
sterling. Of the £156,000 million sterling debt, £121,000 million consisted of
gilt-edged stock; of this, 35 per cent had a maturity of up to five years. 39 per
cent a maturity of over five years and up to 15 years and 26 per cent a maturity of
over 15 years or undated. The remaining sterling debt was made up mainly
of national savings (£22,000 million), certificates of tax deposits. Treasury
bills, and Ways and Means advances (very short-term internal government
borrowing).
18 Banking
and Financial
Institutions
Britain’s position as a major financial centre reflects the wide range of
specialised financial services provided. The City of London has the greatest
concentration of banks in the world (responsible for about a quarter of total
international bank lending), the world’s biggest insurance market (with about
one-fifth of the international market) and a Stock Exchange with a larger listing
of securities than any other exchange, and remains the principal international
centre for transactions in a large number of commodities. Its tradition of
informal dealing and its position between the time zones of the United States
and the Far East enable it to complete large-scale transactions with economy
and speed.
The financial services sector accounts for 5 to 6 per cent of the total output of
the British economy and for 4 to 5 per cent of employment. The net overseas
earnings of British financial institutions in 1984 were £6,100 million.
Development of With increasing international competition in financial services and with
Financial developments in modern technology, the pace of change since the 1960s has
Services been rapid. Among the major developments have been the growth in the
representation of overseas banks in London, the establishment of new futures
markets and proposals for change in the organisation of The Stock Exchange
(see p 358) which have begun to stimulate the formation of new alliances
between different types of financial institution.
In order to help the financial services industry to adapt, while maintaining
adequate safeguards for the investing public, the Government proposes to
establish a new regulatory framework and associated institutional structure for
much of the industry. The framework will be based on new definitions of
‘investment’ and ‘investment business’. The former will include all types of
securities, life assurance, financial and commodity futures, options contracts,
and certain other instruments. Investment businesses will include those
effecting transactions in, managing or giving advice on, investments, and will
require authorisation under legislation which is to be introduced. Authorised
businesses will have to obey rules of conduct which will be based on principles to
be set out in legislation. The Government has proposed that two regulatory
bodies should be set up—a securities and investments board’ and a ‘marketing
of investments board’ (covering the marketing of life assurance and unit trusts,
in particular)—although a single body might be acceptable if the industry’s
practitioners and customers conclude that this would be more advantageous.
The board(s) will be empowered to recognise membership of existing self-
regulatory bodies (such as The Stock Exchange) as providing the authorisation
required for an investment business. The members of the board(s) will comprise
350
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE BANK
OF ENGLAND
practitioners, customers and lay people, and will be appointed by the Secretary
of State and the Governor of the Bank of England.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal
Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. The Bank's main functions
are to execute monetary policy, to act as banker to the Government, to act as a
note-issuing authority and to exercise prudential supervision over and provide
central banking facilities for the banking system. It also manages the Exchange
Equalisation Account on behalf of the Treasury. More generally the Bank has a
responsibility for overseeing the soundness of the financial system as a whole.
The Government's economic policy is based on the medium-term financial
strategy, which aims to achieve a continued fall in the rate of inflation by means
of successive reductions in the rate of growth in the money supply over a
medium-term period. On behalf of the Government the Bank conducts
operations in the financial markets (see p 358) designed to influence the trend
rate of monetary growth and of interest rates. Monetary targets are reviewed
regularly; those for 1985-86 and illustrative ranges for each year up to 1988-89
were announced in the Financial Statement and Budget Report 1985-86 which
accompanied the 1985 Budget statement. In reviewing the targets the Govern¬
ment takes account of structural and institutional changes which may affect the
economic significance of the different monetary indicators.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England is responsible for
arranging government borrowing and for managing the National Debt.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
banknotes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by
gold but by government and other securities. The Scottish and Northern Ireland
banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart from an amount
specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered by holdings of Bank
of England notes. Responsibility for the provision of coin for circulation lies with
the Royal Mint, a government department.
The Bank is able to influence money market conditions through its dealings
with the discount houses (see p 354), which developed in the nineteenth
century as bill brokers for industrialists. The discount houses hold mainly
Treasury, local authority and commercial bills financed by short-term loans
from the banks. If on any given day there is a shortage of cash in the banking
system as a result, for example, of large tax payments or heavy sales of
government securities, the Bank relieves the shortage either by buying bills from
the discount houses or by lending directly to them. This permits the banks to
replenish their cash balances at the Bank by recalling some of their short-term
loans to the discount houses.
The methods by which the Bank operates in the money markets, however,
have undergone some change. Until August 1981 the Bank was ready to lend
directly to the discount houses at rates at or near its announced Minimum
Lending Rate, in addition to its open-market dealings with the discount houses
in bills. Under subsequent arrangements, the Bank no longer undertakes to
announce continuously the rate at which it will supply cash to the market, but
conducts its operations in such a way as to keep short-term interest rates within
an unpublished band. More emphasis is now put on open-market operations in
bills than on direct lending to the discount houses.
Under the Banking Act 1979 deposit-taking businesses require authorisation
from the Bank of England unless they are specifically exempted from the
authorisation provisions of the Act. Institutions may be authorised either as
recognised banks or as licensed deposit-takers and are subject to the Bank of
England's supervision.
BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

INSTITUTIONS
The Banks
On behalf of the Treasury, the Bank manages the Exchange Equalisation
Account (EEA), which holds Britain's official reserves of gold, foreign exchange.
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) on the International Monetary Fund and
European Currency Units (ECUs). Using the resources of the EEA, the Bank may
intervene in the foreign exchange markets to check undue fluctuations in the
exchange value of sterling.
Deposit-taking institutions may be broadly divided into the ‘monetary sector',
which includes the banks and is supervised by the Bank of England, and those
institutions outside the monetary sector, of which the most important are the
building societies and the National Savings Bank. Within the monetary sector a
further distinction is drawn by the Bank of England, under the Banking Act
1979, between recognised banks and licensed deposit-taking institutions. The
latter include smaller banking institutions providing a range of services too
narrow to qualify them for recognised status, and the majority of the finance
houses (see p 357). At the end of February 1985 there were 290 recognised
banks, the main types being clearing banks, merchant banks, discount houses
and foreign banks. The monetary sector also includes the National Girobank
(see p 353), certain banks in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, the
Trustee Savings Banks (see p 353) and the Banking Department of the Bank of
England.
Another useful distinction is that between ‘retail' banking and ‘wholesale'
banking. Retail banking is mainly concerned with the cash withdrawal and
transmission of deposited funds—the main reason why people keep bank
accounts. Competition between the banks and the building societies in the
provision of money transmission services increased during the 1970s and is
expected to increase further. Wholesale business involves the taking of large
deposits at high rates of interest, the deployment of funds in money market
instruments (see p 359) and the making of large loans and investments. Nearly
all the commercial banks in Britain engage in some wholesale activities and
some, like the merchant and overseas banks, centre their business on them.
Many of such wholesale dealings are conducted on the inter-bank market, that
is, among the banks themselves.
Britain's nine clearing banks—those that daily exchange cheques among
themselves and settle the resulting balances—are organised into two co¬
ordinating committees. The Committee of London Clearing Banks comprises
the ‘big four’ British banks—Barclays, Lloyds, Midland and National
Westminster—and two smaller banks, Coutts and Williams and Glyn’s. The
Committee of Scottish Clearing Banks comprises the Bank of Scotland,
Clydesdale Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Williams and Glyn's is
scheduled to merge with the Royal Bank of Scotland in September 1985 under
the name Royal Bank of Scotland Group. Other important banks are the
Yorkshire Bank, the Co-operative Bank, four branch banks in Northern Ireland,
the Trustee Savings Bank Group and the National Girobank.
The primary business of the banks is receiving, transferring and paying
deposits, together with providing overdraft and other loan facilities to personal
and commercial customers, who may deposit money in two main types of
account, current accounts and deposit accounts. Nearly two-thirds of all adults
have a current account and over one-third a deposit account. Although interest
is not usually paid on current accounts, withdrawals may be made on demand
and amounts transferred by cheque. Interest is paid on deposit accounts but
seven days' notice is required for withdrawals. Bank profits arise from the
difference between the interest earned from lending plus fees charged for the
provision of payment services and the costs incurred, including the interest paid
352
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to depositors. (Bank lending rates are determined by base rate, which may differ
between banks. The greater the creditworthiness of a borrower the smaller is the
premium charged above base rate.)
The bank giro, a credit transfer scheme, and direct debiting, by which a
creditor, with the prior approval of the debtor, may claim money due direct from
the latter's bank account, have greatly speeded the money transmission
services. An increasing number of banks have automatic cash dispensing
machines and many are also introducing more automated teller machines.
Cheque cards entitle holders to cash a cheque up to the value of £50 at any office
of major British and Irish banks and are also generally acceptable as a guarantee
for payments by cheque up' to that amount. Credit cards (Access and
Barclaycard) associated with the clearing banks are also a widely used method of
payment; Access operates within the international Mastercard system and
Barclaycard within the VISA system. Three clearing banks (Midland, National
Westminster and Clydesdale) issue uniform eurocheques; these are high-
security printed cheques which may be used to obtain cash or make payments at
home or abroad, supported by the uniform eurocheque card. Uniform euro¬
cheques are made out in the currency of the country in which they are being
used. The other clearing banks issue eurocheque encashment cards. These are
not valid in Britain but enable travellers overseas to cash domestic cheques,
made out in sterling, at designated banks. Thomas Cook, the travel subsidiary
of Midland Bank, is to issue travellers' cheques denominated in ECUs (see
p 351).
The banks provide loan facilities to companies and, since the 1970s, have
provided more medium- and long-term loans than they did formerly. They have
also become important providers of finance for small firms: they have supported
the loan guarantee scheme under which 70 per cent of the value of loans to small
companies is guaranteed by the Government, and some banks have set up
special subsidiaries to provide equity finance for small companies.
With the growth of the financial services sector since the 1970s, and with a
relaxation of restrictions on competition among financial institutions, the
major banks have increasingly diversified the services they provide. They have
lent more money for house purchases, and have established or acquired
substantial interests in finance houses, leasing and factoring companies,
merchant banks and unit trust companies. In view of proposed reforms in the
securities industry, some banks have in the 1980s established links with
traders in stocks and shares.
The clearing banks also conduct extensive international operations which
account for a substantial proportion of their assets and profits.
The big four’ banks operate through some 10,650 branches and sub¬
branches. National Westminster has the largest number (3,200), followed by
Barclays (2,900), Midland (2,290) and Lloyds (2,260).
The sterling deposits of the retail banks (those with extensive branch
networks or participating directly in a British clearing system) were £97,000
million at the end of 1984. The total deposits of the main groups in June 1985
were National Westminster £57,009 million, Barclays £42,128 million, Lloyds
£32,754 million and Midland £31,119 million. The banks' main liquid assets
consist of balances at the Bank of England, money at call (mainly loans to
discount houses), their holdings of Treasury and some other bills, and
short-dated British government securities. They also hold a proportion of their
assets as portfolio investments (mainly longer-dated British government securi¬
ties) or trade investments.
Under a reorganisation begun in 1985 the system for the settlement of most
transactions between banks in Britain is to be overseen by a new umbrella
organisation representing the clearing banks and other financial institutions

involved in the clearing of cheques and drafts. Three companies are to be set up.
each of which will cover a certain type of clearing (paper bulk clearing,
high-value clearing and electronic bulk clearing). Membership of each company
will be open to clearing institutions which meet certain criteria, such as
maintaining settlement facilities at the Bank of England, meeting a minimum
volume requirement for clearings and complying with various technical and
operational rules. In 1984 cheques and drafts worth £7,614,000 million passed
through the London clearing system.
National Girobank, part of the Post Office, provides a wide range of banking and
money transmission services for personal and corporate customers, operating
through more than 20,000 post offices. It became a clearing bank in 1983 but is
exempt from the Banking Act 1979. Accounts and transactions are maintained
by a central computer at Bootle, Merseyside, which is linked to a network of
regional offices. In March 1985 Girobank had 1-8 million personal customers,
with balances of some £930 million. There were about 410 million transactions
in the year ended March 1985.
The Trustee Savings Banks (TSBs), originally founded as small local banks in
the nineteenth century, have operated for much of their history under the
supervision of government agencies as an arm of national savings. Legislation
was introduced in 1984 which will enable TSBs and other members of the TSB
Group to reorganise under the Companies Act as a public limited company and
to issue shares.
TSBs provide a wide range of banking services including cheque accounts and
credit services for businesses as well as individuals. The Group has its own
credit card, Trusteard, which operates within the VISA system, and TSB Trust
Company provides a wide range of savings, insurance, life assurance and unit
trust facilities.
Following amalgamations, there were four individual banks in the Group by
1984 (compared with over 70 in 1975) with about 1,600 branches, 13 million
accounts and total deposits of £9,000 million.
Merchant banks have traditionally been primarily concerned with the accepting
(or guaranteeing) of commercial bills and with the sponsoring of capital issues
on behalf of their customers. Today they have a widely diversified and complex
range of activities with an important role in international finance and the
short-term capital markets, the provision of expert advice and financial services
to British industrial companies, especially where mergers, takeovers and other
forms of corporate reorganisation are involved, and in the management of
investment holdings, including trusts, pensions and other funds. A number of
merchant banks have formed alliances with firms dealing in stocks and shares.
Some 540 overseas banks and financial institutions were represented in Britain
in 1985 through branches, subsidiaries, representative offices and consortia. A
total of 470 were directly represented while 70 were represented only through a
stake in a consortium. Of those directly represented. 60 were from the United
States, 41 from Japan and 141 from Europe. They provide a comprehensive
banking service in many parts of the world and engage in the financing of trade
not only between Britain and other countries but also between third countries.
Citibank of the United States is expanding its activities in the retail banking
market in Britain and is to join the high-value clearing system (see above).
A number of banking institutions have their head offices in Britain but operate
mainly abroad, often specialising in particular regions such as Latin America or
354

East Asia through extensive branch networks. The major independent banks in
this sector are Standard Chartered and Grindlays.
The discount houses represent an institution unique to the City of London.
They promote an orderly flow of short-term funds by borrowing ‘at calf or at
short notice from the banks and lending to the Government by guaranteeing to
buy up the whole of the weekly offer of Treasury bills (which are 91-day
instruments). In return for meeting the Government s borrowing needs the
discount houses have privileged access to the Bank of England as 'lender of last
resort'. The houses act as intermediaries between the Bank of England and the
rest of the banking sector. Assets of the discount houses consist mainly of
Treasury and commercial bills, government and local authority securities and
negotiable certificates of deposit denominated in both sterling and United States
dollars.
Building societies are mutual institutions which borrow mainly short-term from
individual savers, who are generally able to withdraw their money on demand or
at short notice, and provide long-term loans at variable rates of interest on the
security of property—usually private dwellings purchased for owner-occupation.
Building societies have grown very rapidly since 1918, reflecting a continued
high growth of owner-occupation. They account for most lending for house
purchase in Britain and in recent years they have overtaken the banks as the
principal repository for the personal sector's liquid assets; over a half of all
adults have building society accounts. The societies have expanded the range of
services to investors, a variety of saving schemes have been established, a
growing number of societies provide cheque facilities for their customers and
automated cash withdrawal systems are being developed.
Competition among the building societies has increased in the 1980s and a
system of agreed rates of interest for investments and deposits with the societies
has operated with less and less rigidity. The mortgage lending activities of the
banks and issues of National Savings instruments (see p 355) have also provided
strong competition for the building societies.
The industry is dominated by a few large societies, the five largest (the Halifax,
Abbey National, Nationwide, Leeds Permanent and Woolwich Equitable)
accounting for 55 per cent of the total assets of the movement and the 16 largest
accounting for some 84 per cent. Mergers between building societies are a
continuing trend; in July 1985 the Nationwide and Woolwich Equitable
societies announced a plan to merge. At the end of 1984 there were 190
registered building societies with total assets of £102,000 million and in the
course of the year nearly £24,000 million was advanced in new mortgages.
Building societies are supervised by the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies
under the Building Societies Act 1962.
The Government has published proposals for new legislation which would
relax some of the restrictions in this Act, allowing the societies to diversify their
financial and housing services. Among these are that up to 10 per cent of a
society's commercial assets could be used for purposes other than loans for a
first mortgage, with up to 5 per cent placed in new types of asset such as
unsecured loans and equity. Societies might also be allowed to offer a full range
of banking and money transmission services (including reciprocal encashment
and paying arrangements with other financial institutions) as well as insurance
broking, share dealing apd other facilities. There would also be changes to the
arrangements for the priHdential supervision of building societies. The legisla¬
tion is expected to be introduced in the 1985—86 session of Parliament.

The National Savings Bank is run by the Department for National Savings and
provides a system for depositing and withdrawing savings at 20,000 post offices
around the country or by post. There are about 18 million active accounts.
Ordinary Accounts earn interest at 3 or 6 per cent a year (depending on the
balance maintained): the first £70 of annual interest is tax free. Investment
Accounts earn a higher variable rate of interest, which is taxable. At the end of
June 1985 the sum of the two accounts totalled £7,000 million. The National
Savings Bank does not offer lending facilities. As with other National Savings
instruments, its deposits are employed to finance the Government’s public
sector borrowing requirement. The other instruments include tax-free savings
certificates, which either pay fixed rates of interest or are index-linked; and
taxable Income Bonds and Deposit Bonds, where interest continues to be paid
without deduction of tax at source. At the end of June 1985 the total amount of
money invested in National Savings was £29,664 million.
The investing institutions are those which collect savings and invest them in the
securities market and other long-term assets. The main investing institutions
are the insurance companies, the pension funds, the unit trusts and investment
trusts.
The British insurance industry provides a comprehensive and competitive
service domestically and internationally. It has been estimated that British
insurers handle some 20 per cent of general insurance business placed on the
international market. The London market is the world's leading centre for
insurance where, in addition to most British companies and Lloyd's, a large
number of overseas companies are also represented. It is the world centre for the
placement of international reinsurance and, partly as a consequence, many
British companies have formed close relationships with overseas companies.
Some British insurance companies confine their activities to domestic business
but most large companies undertaking general business transact a substantial
amount overseas through branches, agencies or affiliated local companies. Over
a half of the non-life premium income of British insurance companies and
Lloyd's is derived from overseas. Insurance companies carrying on business in
Britain are supervised by the Department of Trade and Industry under the
Insurance Companies Act 1982. About 850 companies are authorised to carry
on one or more classes of insurance business in Britain, of which some 170 are
from overseas. The total assets of these companies were £114,554 million at the
end of 1983.
Around 400 companies belong to the Association of British Insurers and these
account for about 90 per cent of the world-wide business of the British
insurance companies market.
Long-term insurance is handled by some 290 authorised insurance com¬
panies and is also available through certain friendly societies. Some 90 per cent
of this business is transacted through the members of the Association of British
Insurers. Lloyd's underwriters also write short-term life business.
Lloyd's, established in the seventeenth century, is an incorporated society of
private insurers in London. Although its activities were originally confined to
the conduct of marine insurance business, a very considerable world-wide
market for the transaction of other classes of insurance business in non-marine,
aviation and motor markets has been built up. Long-term life and financial
guarantee business is not covered. Lloyd's, which does not accept insurance
itself, is regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament, dating from 1871 to
1982.

Lloyd's is not a company but a market for insurance administered by the
Council of Lloyd's, where business is carried out for individual underwriting
members for their own account and risk and in competition with each other and
with insurance companies. Insurance may only be placed through Lloyd's
brokers who negotiate with Lloyd's underwriting agents on behalf of the
insured. Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd's, for whom insurance is
transacted with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent
financial regulations laid down by the Council, are permitted to be represented
at Lloyd's; these safeguards give security to a Lloyd's policy. A consultative
document proposing some changes to the membership rules was published by a
Lloyd's working-party in 1985.
In January 1985 there were some 26,000 underwriting members of Lloyd's
grouped into about 380 syndicates and represented at Lloyd's by underwriting
agents who accept risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
Insurance brokers, acting on behalf of the insured, are an essential part of the
Lloyd s market and a valuable part of the company market. Many brokers
specialise in reinsurance business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of
contracts between companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as
London representatives of the latter. The Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act
1977 provides for the registration of insurance brokers with the Insurance
Brokers Registration Council and makes Britain the first country to introduce
self-regulation of insurance brokers. In October 1984, 16,471 individuals and
4,992 businesses were registered with the Council. The British Insurance
Brokers'Association, which sponsored the Act, has about 3,700 members. They
produce some £12.000 million annually in premiums for Lloyd's and insurance
companies.
In accordance with the Treaty of Rome, insurance and reinsurance in the
European Community are regulated by directives addressed to the governments
of member states and intended to harmonise the legislation of the various
member countries. Directives cover reinsurance, compulsory motor insurance,
freedom of establishment for life and non-life insurers. Community co-
insurance and insurance intermediaries. These directives have been im¬
plemented in British legislation. Britain strongly supports the removal of
national regulations and exchange controls that restrict the creation of a full
common market in services, particularly financial services, within the European
Community.
Pension funds are administered by trustees in order to invest members' pension
contributions, either directly in the market or through intermediaries such as
insurance companies. The market value of assets held by pension funds rose
from £2,000 million in 1957 to about £127,678 million in 1984 when 19 per
cent was in British government securities and 63 per cent in company
securities. The growth of pension funds since 1960 has been reflected in a
marked decrease in the proportion of shares held by individual investors. Under
government proposals for the regulation of the financial services industry (see
p 349) personal pension schemes will be subject to the same sort of safeguards
as other investments, and pension scheme investment business will require
authorisation.
Investment and unit trusts enable investors to spread their risks and obtain the
benefit of skilled management. Investment trusts are companies which observe
certain requirements of The Stock Exchange and the tax authorities and invest
in securities for the benefit of their shareholders. At the end of 1984 their

investments totalled over £15,250 million, of which more than one-half was held
overseas.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company and
a trustee company which holds the assets. Normally, the managers sell units to
the public and also repurchase them on demand. The sums held must be
invested in securities. The costs of running the trust are met partly by an initial
charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a periodic service
charge which is usually taken out of the trust's income. Authorisation by the
Department of Trade and Industry is needed before units can be offered to the
public: this is granted only if the trust deed meets the Department's require¬
ments. Trusts are allowed to hold up to 20 per cent of their assets in shares
traded on the Unlisted Securities Market (see p 359), in addition to the 5 per
cent of assets that they were already allowed to hold in unlisted securities,
whether or not traded on this market. Under the Government's proposals for the
financial services industry (see p 349), authorised unit trusts will be able to
invest in a wider range of assets in order to allow a greater variety of investment
opportunities to be offered to the public. In April 1985 there were 2-4 million
unit holdings with a total value of £16,400 million.
The specialised institutions are agencies created to meet the needs of specific
groups of borrowers—mostly industrial and commercial—which were not
adequately covered by other institutions. They are to be found in both the public
and the private sectors. Some of the latter were set up with official support but
with financing from banks and other financial institutions. They may offer loan
finance or equity capital.
The main private sector institutions are described below. Among public sector
agencies are the British Technology Group, the Scottish and Welsh Development
Agencies, the Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland, the Co¬
operative Development Agency and the Export Credits Guarantee Department.
Finance houses are major suppliers of hire-purchase finance for the personal
sector and of short-term credit and leasing to the corporate sector. Some 80 per
cent of all their business is accounted for by the 42 firms which constitute the
Finance Houses Association (FHA). At the end of 1984 credit outstanding to the
members of the FHA was over £17,400 million. Many of the finance houses are
owned by banks, and most of them are licensed deposit-taking institutions.
Leasing companies buy and own plant or equipment required and chosen by
businesses and lease it at an agreed rental. This form of finance has grown
quickly in importance, partly because the leasing companies have been able to
take advantage of investment incentives to the benefit of customers whose tax
position would otherwise have made them unavailable. The restructuring of
capital allowances in the 1984 Budget, however, will reduce the advantage of
some forms of leasing after an interim period. In 1984 the 71 members of the
Equipment Leasing Association acquired assets in Britain valued at some
£4,000 million, which represented about 15 per cent of total private sector
investment in plant and machinery.
Factoring consists of making cash available to a company in exchange for the
sums owing to it. Since the early 1960s factoring has developed as a major
financial service, covering international activities as well as domestic trade. In
1984 member companies of the Association of British Factors handled business
of nearly £3,800 million and over 3,600 companies made use of the Association's
services.

FINANCIAL
MARKETS
The Stock

Finance corporations meet the need for medium- and long-term capital
(including venture capital) when such funds are not easily or directly available
from traditional sources such as The Stock Exchange or the banks.
Investors in Industry (known as 3i) supports investment programmes over the
whole range of industry. During the year ended 31 March 1985 the corporation
invested £350 million. Within the last lew years it has become increasingly
prominent in financing management ‘buy-outs’, which involve the purchase of
businesses by managing and other staff from their owners. The shares in
Investors in Industry are owned by the Bank of England (15 per cent) and the
individual London and Scottish clearing banks.
Other finance corporations include Equity Capital for Industry, the Agricul¬
tural Mortgage Corporation, the Commonwealth Development Finance Com¬
pany and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (the last two being no
longer confined to the Commonwealth in their activities).
A number of venture and development capital companies have been formed
since the late 1970s which take equity stakes in small and medium-sized firms.
Many of these companies are subsidiaries of the banks.
The main organised financial markets are the securities markets, of which The
Stock Exchange is the most important, and the money markets. Other
important markets in the City of London are the foreign exchange market, the
financial futures market, the Lloyd's insurance market (see p 355) and the gold
bullion and commodity markets.
The Stock Exchange has its main trading iloor and central administration in
London. There are also trading floors in Glasgow, Liverpool, Birmingham and
Dublin.
Transactions on The Stock Exchange are undertaken on behalf of individuals
and institutional investors (pension funds or insurance companies, for
example) by brokers who effect purchases or sales with dealers in securities
known as ‘jobbers'. The broking and jobbing functions have been kept separate
traditionally, in what is known as the ‘single-capacity’ system.
The number and variety of securities (stocks and shares) officially listed on
The Stock Exchange are greater than in any other market in the world and its
turnover of company securities is roughly equivalent to that of all the other
European exchanges combined. Some 7,000 securities are quoted on The Stock
Exchange; at the end of March 1985 these had a total market value of
£1,100,000 million. About 5,200 securities of companies were quoted including
a number of leading overseas securities. Company issues represent four-fifths of
the securities at market valuation, the remainder being British. Irish Republic
and other overseas government and corporation stocks as well as eurobonds (see
p 359). Institutional investors, such as pension funds, now own a higher
proportion of ordinary shares than individuals.
A market in traded options, in the shares of prominent British companies,
enables investors not only to buy options to purchase or sell shares in future at
pre-fixed prices but also to trade in the options themselves. In May 1984 trading
began in a stock index option and in May 1985 a currency options market came
into operation.
In recent years the largest market for new issues has been that for British
government securities (known as gilt-edged' stocks), which have accounted for
75 to 80 per cent of transactions by value. New issues are made on the
Government’s behalf by the Bank of England.
The Stock Exchange has agreed to certain changes which will make it more
competitive internationally. In particular, minimum scales of commission
charged to the investing public by brokers are to be abolished and relaxation of

certain membership rules is likely to take place. In 1984 The Stock Exchange
published a document which discussed possible alternatives to the single¬
capacity system and considered the conflicts of interest that might arise if
member firms combined the broking and dealing functions.
The securities industry is subject to a combination of statutory regulation,
under competition policy and company law, and non-statutory regulation by the
Council of The Stock Exchange and the Council for the Securities Industry. The
Government is proposing to create a new regulatory framework and associated
institutional structure for the financial services sector, which will affect The
Stock Exchange (see p 349).
The Unlisted Securities Market (USM), which deals generally in the securities of
small companies unable or unwilling to obtain a Stock Exchange listing, was
opened in 1980, since when the number of companies with shares traded has
risen from about a dozen to about 300. Trading in a number of securities, largely
those of small companies trying to raise risk capital, can also be carried out
directly with securities dealers in the 'over-the-counter' market. Limited trading
in listed securities takes place through a telephone-based dealing system,
ARIEL, owned mainly by the ‘accepting’ house merchant banks.
The London money markets channel wholesale funds (mainly short-term) from
lenders to borrowers. They consist of a series of integrated groups of financial
institutions conducting negotiations primarily by telephone and telex, there
being no physical market-place. The discount houses play an important role (see
p 354). Money transactions are negotiated through money broking firms. The
main financial instruments dealt in are bills, certificates of deposit (CDs) and
short-term deposits. The bill markets and the markets on which the discount
houses borrow from the rest of the banking system are often referred to as the
'traditional' markets. Newer markets, known as 'parallel' markets, emerged in
the 1960s, and include the inter-bank market and the market in CDs. Since a
large proportion of the latter are held by banks the CD market is effectively an
extension of the inter-bank market.
The London International Financial Futures Exchange trades on the floor of the
Royal Exchange. Some 220 banks and other financial institutions are members
of the market, which allows parties affected by movements in interest rates or
exchange rates to reduce their vulnerability. Trading takes place in financial
instruments of differing maturities and denominated in a number of currencies.
The eurocurrency market provides a network of bank deposits and loans
denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which the bank is
situated. London is the main world centre for the eurocurrency market.
The eurobond market performs a similar service in transferring funds from
lenders to borrowers but by means of bonds issued in currencies other than that
of the issuing country. Transactions in both markets tend to be in large
denominations. The markets developed in the late 1950s following the
restoration of convertibility between the major currencies, partly in order to
avoid incurring the costs of exchange control and other regulations.
The market consists of banks and several firms of foreign exchange brokers
which act as intermediaries between the banks. It provides those engaged in
international trade with foreign currencies for their transactions. The foreign
exchange banks are in close contact with financial centres abroad and are able
to quote buying and selling rates for both spot and future delivery. The forward
market enables traders who, at a given date in the future, are due to receive or

make a specific foreign currency payment, to contract in advance to sell or buy
the foreign currency involved for sterling at a precise fixed exchange rate.
Anyone may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely concentrated in the
hands of the five members of the London gold market, who meet twice daily to
establish a London fixing price for gold. This price provides a reference point for
world-wide dealings. Although much interest centres upon the fixings, active
dealing takes place throughout the day. London and Zurich are the main world
centres for gold dealings.
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities, although most of the sales negotiated in London relate
to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The need for
close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance services
often determined the location of these markets in the City of London. There are
also futures markets in cocoa, coffee, grains (wheat and barley), rubber, soya
bean meal and oil, sugar, pigmeat, wool, non-ferrous metals (aluminium,
copper, lead, nickel, silver, tin and zinc), potatoes, gas oil (heating oil) and crude
petroleum oil. The markets are collaborating in the development of new
arrangements to safeguard participants.
In ship brokerage, London's Baltic Exchange is responsible for about a half of
the world s tramp fixtures; some four-fifths of air-freight broking business is
also conducted there. A freight futures market came into operation in 1985.
Many of the commodities markets are also operated from the Baltic Exchange.
19 Overseas Trade
VISIBLE
TRADE
Commodity
Composition
Although small in area and accounting for only about 1 per cent of the world’s
population, Britain is the fifth largest trading nation in the world—and, as a
member of the European Community, part of the world's largest trading area,
which accounts for about one-third of all trade.
Overseas trade has been of vital importance to the economy for hundreds of
years, and especially since the mid-nineteenth century, when the rapid growth
of industry, commerce and shipping was accompanied by Britain's development
as an international trading centre. Exports of goods and services in 1984 were
equivalent to about one-third of gross domestic product at factor cost. Britain is
a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aerospace products, electrical and
electronic equipment and chemicals, and a significant oil exporter. It relies upon
imports for about one-third of total consumption of foodstuffs, and for many of
the raw materials needed for its industries. Trade in invisibles is also of great
significance to the economy: in 1984 overseas earnings from services were
equivalent to about 30 per cent of those from total visible exports.
In 1984 Britain’s exports of goods were valued at about £70,400 million and its
imports of goods at about £74,600 million on a balance of payments basis (see
Table 35). Between 1983 and 1984 the volume of exports rose by 8 per cent,
while import volume grew by 11 per cent. The value of exports and imports
increased by 16 and 20 per cent respectively during the same period.

Britain has traditionally been an importer of food and raw materials and an
exporter of manufactured goods. In recent years manufactured goods have
accounted for a growing proportion of imports but a declining proportion of
exports mainly owing to a rising oil surplus and a shift in Britain’s relative
362
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
competitiveness away from manufacturing towards non-manufacturing activi¬
ties (mainly services). Manufactured goods are still responsible, however, for a
large portion of exports (see Table 36). The most important group is machinery
and transport equipment, which in 1984 accounted for 30 per cent of total
exports. Machinery alone accounted for 22 per cent: mechanical machinery over
11 per cent and electrical machinery more than 10 per cent. Chemicals
accounted for 12 per cent. Sectors which have become relatively less important
include passenger motor cars and textiles, the latter accounting for 2 per cent of
exports in 1984 compared with 5 per cent in 1970.
The growth in importance of North Sea oil exports is reflected in the rapid rise
in the share of fuels in total exports, from 5 per cent in 1976 to 22 per cent in
1984.
Recent changes in Britain's import pattern are similar to those which have
affected other major industrialised countries, although to a lesser degree. There
has been a large rise in the share of finished manufactures and semi-finished
goods, particularly the former, which accounted for 42 per cent of imports in
1984, as against 23 per cent in 1970. Since 1962 imports of semi-manufactures
have formed a larger part of the total import bill than basic materials, reflecting

the tendency for producer countries to undertake processing of primary
products up to the semi-finished and occasionally finished stage. The decline in
the proportion of food imports (to about 10 per cent of total imports in 1984
compared with 40 per cent in the 1950s) reflects the increasing extent to which
demand for food has been met by domestic agriculture and the smaller share of
expenditure devoted to food.
About four-fifths of Britain's exports and imports are with developed countries
(see diagram below). In the last 30 years or so trade with Western Europe has
become increasingly important, representing about 60 per cent of Britain's
trade in 1984 compared with about 30 per cent in 1950.
European Community countries accounted for six of the top ten export
markets and for six of the ten leading suppliers of goods to Britain in 1984 (see
Table 37), with the Federal Republic of Germany being the largest single
supplier. The United States took 14 per cent of British exports, making it
Britain’s largest single market for the fourth year in succession. Recent features
of Britain's trade have been a decline in the proportion of trade with other
Commonwealth countries, the emergence of oil-exporting countries as a major
market for exports and an increase in the share of imports from Japan from 2-6
per cent in 1976 to 4-8 per cent in 1984.

Britain has nearly always earned a surplus from its invisible transactions and
there has not been a deficit since 1947. Transactions fall into three main
groups: services (receipts and payments arising from services, as distinct from
goods, supplied to and received from overseas residents); interest, profits and
dividends (income arising from outward and inward investment and other
capital transactions); and transfers between Britain and other countries. In

a On an overseas trade statistics basis. Exports are f.o.b., imports c.i.f.
1984 there was a surplus estimated at £5,036 million on invisible earnings (see
Table 38).
Earnings from services rose in value by 11 per cent in 1984 to £21,327
million: in volume terms this represented a rise of about 4 per cent. Debits, at
£17,342 million, were about 11 per cent higher by value and 3 per cent greater
in volume terms. The surplus on services increased to £3,985 million in 1984,
with improvements in civil aviation and financial and other services more than
offsetting deteriorations in the government, sea transport and travel accounts.
The surplus on interest, profits and dividends is estimated to have been
£3,304 million in 1984, substantially higher than in 1983. Earnings on
portfolio investment (investment in overseas securities) rose by about 36 per
cent to £3,520 million, reflecting the growth in overseas investment following
the abolition of exchange controls in 1979, the fall in the sterling exchange rate
(which has the effect of increasing the sterling value of earnings originally
expressed in foreign currency) and changes in the method of foreign currency
lending by banks located in Britain. British oil companies experienced a
substantial improvement in earnings from overseas investments in 1984, after
several years of declining returns, due in part to the strength of the United
States dollar.
The deficit on transfers in 1984 was £2,253 million, largely on government
transactions (mainly contributions to the European Community, contributions
and subscriptions to international organisations, and bilateral aid).

Britain remains committed to the open trading system, and to this end has
taken a leading part in the activities of such organisations as the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Since joining
the European Community in 1973, Britain has conducted its external commer¬
cial policy primarily through the Community. Britain has consistently sought
liberalisation of the Community's internal market and has been pressing for
action to be taken on the harmonisation of technical standards, the reduction of
frontier formalities, and the establishment of a free market in services. The
Community's common customs tariff is, on average, at a similar level to the
tariffs of other major industrial countries.
Tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade have been considerably reduced in the
seven rounds of multilateral trade negotiations held since 1947 under the
auspices of the GATT, the most recent being the ‘Tokyo Round’ (1973—79).
Britain has participated fully in these negotiations. The GATT met at ministerial
level in 1982 when a work programme designed to promote the liberalisation
and expansion of trade was agreed. GATT members also agreed to make
determined efforts to ensure that trade policies and measures were consistent
with the principles and rules of the GATT, and to resist protectionist policies in
formulating and implementing national trade policies. Britain has contributed
to the implementation of the GATT work programme, in particular to work on
trade in services, which is of great importance to Britain’s employment and
overseas earnings. A proposal to hold a new round of multilateral trade
negotiations under the auspices of the GATT, starting in 1986, is strongly
supported by Britain.

BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
By 1 January 1986 there will be duty-free trade between those member states
which joined the European Community prior to that date. The accession of
Spain and Portugal to the Community on 1 January 1986 will result in the
phasing-out of duties in their trade with Community countries over a period of
seven years. Britain applies the common customs tariff to all countries neither
belonging to, nor having any special arrangement with, the Community.
The Community has reciprocal preferential trading agreements with the
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries (Austria, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Portugal,1 Sweden and Switzerland), Cyprus, Israel, Malta, Spain1 and
Turkey, and non-reciprocal agreements with Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt,
Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yugoslavia, and a group of African, Caribbean and
Pacific countries. Tariff preference is also given to developing countries (under
the Generalised Scheme of Preferences), the Faroe Islands and the overseas
dependencies and territories of member states.
The third Lome Convention, signed in December 1984 and embracing 66
developing countries, is expected to enter into force during the second half of
1986 with the completion of the required ratification procedures; until then,
and since the expiry of the second Convention at the end of February 1985,
transitional arrangements are in operation.
Britain maintains few restrictions on its international trade. Most goods maybe
imported freely and only a narrow range of goods is subject to any sort of export
control.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and to the
European Community, Britain has progressively removed almost all quantita¬
tive restrictions imposed on economic grounds. Only about 7 per cent of
Britain's visible imports are subject to any form of non-tariff restraint and about
80 per cent of imports are admitted into Britain duty free. The few remaining
quantitative restrictions mainly affect textile goods (in view of the rapid
contraction of the domestic textile industry) and stem primarily from the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) under which there exists a series of agreements
covering international trade in textiles, designed to balance the interests of both
exporting and importing countries. The present MFA expires in 1986. All
quantitative restrictions have been removed from imports of goods of Commu¬
nity origin, but certain internationally recognised restrictions operated by the
Department of Trade and Industry on a few goods such as firearms, ammunition
and nuclear materials continue to apply. Other government departments
operate certain restrictions on non-economic grounds (on goods such as meat
and poultry, animals, birds and plants and some of their derivatives, controlled
drugs, explosives, certain ‘citizens' band' radios and indecent or obscene
articles) for reasons of health, safety, conservation or social policy.
The great majority of British exports are not subject to any government control
or direction. However, there are controls governing exports of military equip¬
ment and industrial goods of strategic significance as well as nuclear products
and certain metals, and metal scrap. There are also controls, for health
certification purposes, on cattle, swine and certain meat exported to another
member state of the European Community; endangered species of animals and
plants and some of their derivatives, in accordance with international agree¬
ments; photographic material over 60 years old and valued at £400 or more per
item and other articles over 50 years old (including works of art) valued at
£16,000 or more; controlled drugs; British spirits (beverages) in casks of less
than 40 litres; and Common Agricultural Policy products.
Until 1 January 1986.

BALANCE OF
PAYMENTS
The Government assists exporters by creating conditions favourable to the
export trade and by providing information and advice about opportunities tor
trade in other countries, services designed to help exporters and improve
exporting practices, and credit insurance facilities.
The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) directs Britain’s official export
promotion services, which include the provision of export intelligence, assist¬
ance to British exporters in appointing agents and researching potential
markets overseas, help at trade fairs and other promotional events overseas, and
support for firms participating in trade missions. It mainly comprises repre¬
sentatives of commerce and industry with personal involvement in exporting,
but also includes representatives of the Department of Trade and Industry, the
Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), and the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office; it operates under the general authority of the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry, who is the president.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the regional offices of
the BOTB throughout Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts
of the British Diplomatic Service overseas. The Scottish Export Office (Industry
Department for Scotland), the Welsh Office and the Industrial Development
Board for Northern Ireland (Department of Economic Development) also act as
BOTB regional offices.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department provides credit insurance for
about one-third of the country's export trade and insures exporters of both
goods and services against non-payment by overseas buyers. The main risks
covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer, governmental
action which stops the British exporter receiving payment, new import
restrictions, and war or civil disturbance in the buyer’s country. Cover may
commence from the date of shipment or from the date of contract (at higher
premiums).
This insurance may be supplemented by unconditional guarantees of
repayment given direct to banks financing exporters, whether in sterling or in
foreign currencies. Alternatively, for contracts over £1 million the ECGD will
guarantee loans direct to overseas buyers enabling them to pay on cash terms, or
lines of credit’ similarly covering an agreed buying programme of an overseas
country. The banks provide finance against these guarantees. The ECGD is also
prepared to support the issue of performance bonds in the commercial market
in respect of cash or near-cash contracts worth over £250,000.
Investment insurance is provided for new British investment overseas against
expropriation, war damage and restrictions on remittances.
The balance of payments statistics record transactions between residents of
Britain and non-residents. The transactions are classified into three groups:
current account (visibles and invisibles); investment and other capital trans¬
actions; and official financing. The balance on current account shows whether
Britain has had a surplus of income over expenditure.
Traditionally Britain has had a deficit on visible trade and a surplus on trade
in invisibles and this was again the case in 1984. However, in 1980, 1981 and
1982 visible trade was also in surplus (see Table 39); the current account
surpluses for 1980—82 averaged over 2 per cent of gross domestic product. In the
previous 20 years there was only one other year, 1971, in which a visible trade
surplus was recorded. In 1984 Britain had a surplus on current account
transactions for the fifth consecutive year. The deficit on visible trade in 1984
was £3,266 million higher than in the previous year, largely as a result of the
dispute in the coal industry. However, the surplus on trade in invisibles was
368

Capital Flows
£1,033 million more than the figure for 1983, mainly because of the rise in the
surplus on interest, profits and dividends. Total investment and other capital
transactions resulted in a net outflow of £3,291 million from Britain.
A description of visible trade and invisible transactions is given on pp 361—5.

Britain's exchange controls were abolished during 1979 and residents are free to
acquire foreign currency for any purpose including direct and portfolio
investment overseas. Controls on the lending of sterling abroad have also been
removed and non-residents may freely acquire sterling for any purpose. Gold
may be freely bought and sold. The abolition of exchange controls means that
Britain meets its full obligations on capital movements under the OECD Code on
Capital Movements and under European Community directives. The Govern¬
ment welcomes both inward and outward investment. Outward investment
helps to develop markets for British exports, while providing earnings in the
form of interest receipts, profits and dividends. Foreign investment in Britain
creates employment: introduces new technology, products, management styles
and attitudes; and provides an opportunity to increase exports and/or substitute
imports. The Department of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain Bureau
undertook a major promotion of inward investment into Britain in 1985.
In 1984 direct investment overseas by British non-oil companies and public
corporations was £1,894 million and oil companies' and miscellaneous direct
investment was £3,881 million. British residents' portfolio investment overseas
totalled £8,810 million, most of which was investment by banks located in
Britain, reflecting a change in their method of foreign currency lending. The
inflow of direct and portfolio investment into Britain amounted to £3,619
million. An analysis of investment and other capital transactions is given in

At the end of 1984 Britain's identified external assets exceeded identified
external liabilities by £73,500 million: private sector net assets were estimated
at £74,354 million and public sector net liabilities at £854 million.1
Direct private investment overseas by non-oil companies (investment in
branches, subsidiaries and associated companies) totalled £51,429 million at
the end of 1984, investment by oil companies £19,650 million and portfolio
investment £82,500 million. At the end of 1981 (the latest year for which data
are available) more than four-fifths of direct investment was in developed
countries. Over one-third of the total was in the United States and just under
one-fifth in the European Community. In terms of industries, manufacturing
accounted for 37 per cent of direct investment holdings, distribution for 28 per
cent, oil for 20 per cent and banking and insurance for the remaining 15 per
cent.
Direct investment in Britain by overseas non-oil companies amounted to
£24,484 million at the end of 1984 and investment by overseas oil companies
£10,950 million. Overseas portfolio holdings of British company securities
totalled £13,300 million. At the end of 1981 investment from developed
countries accounted for virtually all of overseas direct investment in Britain,
with 57 per cent originating in the United States and 23 per cent in the
European Community. Slightly under 50 per cent was in manufacturing
industry.
1 The significance of any inventory of Britain's aggregate external assets and liabilities is limited because a variety
of claims and obligations are included that are very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity and in method ol
valuation.
20 Promotion
of Science and
Technology
Britain has for centuries encouraged research and innovation, and its record of
achievement in relation to size of population is in many respects unsurpassed.
This record has been maintained throughout the twentieth century. For
example, fundamental contributions to modern molecular genetics were made
by the working out of the structure of the molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) by Professor Francis Crick, Professor Maurice Wilkins, and an American
colleague, James Watson, at Cambridge University in 1952. More recent
achievements include the research carried out by Mr Patrick Steptoe and Dr
Robert Edwards which made possible the birth of the world's first test-tube baby
in Britain in 1978, and work on brain and body scanners (based on
computerised X-ray readings, nuclear magnetic resonance or ultrasonics) and
on monoclonal antibodies (used to diagnose animal diseases and which have the
potential to combat human virus diseases). Other notable contributions in
recent years have been made by Professor Dennis Gabor on holography (the
production of three-dimensional images using lasers). Professor Stephen
Hawking on black holes (hypothetical regions of space) and Professor Frederick
Sanger on molecular biology. Nobel prizes for science have been won by 68
British citizens, a number exceeded only by the United States, and Table 41 lists
British citizens who have won Nobel prizes for science (excluding economic
science) since 1970.
Total expenditure in Britain on research and development in 1981 was some
£5,921 million, 2-3 per cent of the gross domestic product. About half was
provided by industrial enterprises, with a significant contribution also being
made by private endowments, trusts and charities. The other half was financed
by the Government, which carries out roughly a quarter of Britain's research
and development in its own establishments. Government finance for research
and development also went to industry and the universities. Considerable
expenditure is directed towards applied research and the development of new or
improved materials, products and processes. In many areas Britain participates
in European and other international projects.
Government Responsibility for basic civil science in Britain rests with the Secretary of State
and Scientific for Education and Science, and responsibility for technology mainly with the
Research Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, but in all cases the Prime Minister has
overall responsibility. Other government departments are concerned with
research and development related to their functions. Applied research and
development is undertaken in accordance with the ‘customer—contractor
principle' under which government departments, as customers, define their

ministers as appropriate and that scientific priorities reflect those of the
Government as a whole.
ACARD (whose members include senior industrialists and academies) pro¬
duces reports on applied research, design and development in Britain; the
application of research and technology, developed in Britain and elsewhere, for
the benefit of both the public and private sectors in accordance with national
economic needs; and the co-ordination (in collaboration with the Advisory Board
for the Research Councils) of these activities with research supported through
the Department of Education and Science. It also advises on Britain's role in
international collaboration in applied research, design and development related
to technology.
Total government expenditure on research and development in 1985-86 is
estimated to be some £4.488 million. The largest departmental research and
development budget is that of the Ministry of Defence. The main civil
departments involved are the Department of Education and Science, which
supports the research councils and the universities: the Department of Trade
and Industry: the Department of Energy: the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland: the
Department of the Environment: and the Department of Transport.
The Department of Education and Science discharges its responsibilities for
basic and applied civil science mainly through the five research councils, to
which it allocates funds from its science budget (£584 million in 1985—86). The
councils and their allocations are: the Science and Engineering Research
Council (£298 million), the Medical Research Council (£122-3 million), the
Natural Environment Research Council (£67-3 million), the Agricultural and
Food Research Council (£50-3 million) and the Economic and Social Research
Council (£23-6 million). Science budget grants are also made to the British
Museum (Natural History), the Royal Society and the Fellowship of Engineering.
The allocations provide support for research in the form of grants and contracts
to universities, polytechnics and elsewhere, research units and other establish¬
ments of the research councils, postgraduate support and subscriptions to
international scientific organisations. The Department is also responsible for
some aspects of international scientific relations and helps to co-ordinate
government policy regarding scientific and technical information.
The Department is also the main source of funding for the universities, whose
allocations are determined by the University Grants Committee. Although
individual universities decide upon the allocation of their resources between
teaching and research, the proportion committed to research is generally
believed to be between 25 and 30 per cent.
The Advisory Board for the Research Councils advises the Secretary of State on
civil science, particularly with regard to the research council system, on the
support of postgraduate students, on the proper balance between national and
international scientific activities, and on the allocation of the science budget
among research councils and other bodies. It also promotes close liaison
between the councils and users of their research. Its membership includes the
chairman or secretary of each of the research councils, the chairman of the
University Grants Committee, the Chief Scientists from departments with a
major interest in the work of the research councils, the Chief Scientific Adviser,
Cabinet Office, and independent members drawn from universities, industry
and the Royal Society.

Each ol the five research councils is an autonomous body established under
Royal Charter with membership drawn from the universities, professions,
industry and the Government. They conduct research through their own
research establishments and by supporting selected research in universities and
other higher education establishments. They also receive income for research
commissioned by departments under the customer—contractor principle and
from the private sector. Income from commissioned research is particularly
important for the Agricultural and Food Research Council and the Natural
Environment Research Council.
The Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) supports basic research
in astronomy, geophysics, the biological sciences, chemistry, mathematics,
physics, and engineering and applied sciences, to further its primary purpose of
sustaining standards of postgraduate education and research in the universi¬
ties and polytechnics. A large proportion of SERC's resources is devoted to the
provision of research grants to help academic staff to carry out fundamental
research, either in their own institutions or in the Council's research
establishments or elsewhere; the encouragement of active collaboration between
higher education establishments and industry, particularly in areas of national
importance; the award of studentships to suitable graduates for training in
methods of research or a specialised branch of science or engineering of
importance to British industry; and the award of fellowships to promising
scientists or engineers to enable them to carry out their own independent
research programmes.
SERC maintains four research establishments: the Daresbury Laboratory at
Warrington (Cheshire), the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux
(East Sussex), the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, and the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory at Chilton (Oxfordshire). The establishments are centres of special¬
ised research, and are also used for the development and operation of central
experimental facilities beyond the resources of an academic institution. They
provide support for scientists whose research needs access to facilities run by
international research organisations, such as the powerful particle accelerators
at the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva. Switzerland,
and the high-flux neutron source at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) at
Grenoble, France.
SERC provides national contributions to CERN and the European Incoherent
Scatter Facility, and part of Britain's contribution to the European Space
Agency (see p 381). It also contributes to the European Science Foundation, and
shares with its French and Federal German partners the control of the ILL
nuclear reactor at Grenoble. In addition, SERC encourages scientists and
engineers to initiate or extend collaborative projects with colleagues overseas by
using its fellowships, studentships and grant schemes.
Developments in engineering research and training related to the needs of
industry are major concerns of SERC. Some special programmes are being
supported within a general effort to develop research and postgraduate training
in university and polytechnic engineering departments. Among subjects receiv¬
ing major support are information technology (including software engineering,
intelligent knowledge-based systems and device fabrication), radio communica¬
tions, the application of computers to manufacturing, biotechnology, marine
technology, polymer engineering, materials, particulate technology, medical
engineering, combustion engines and coal technology. The Teaching Company

supports collaborative ventures between academic engineering departments
and industrial companies to improve their manufacturing methods and
performance. A network providing an interactive computing facility to universi¬
ties is serviced at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.
Britain has a leading position in most major branches of astronomy including
r^idio astronomy, infra-red astronomy. X-ray astronomy and theoretical re¬
search. In optical astronomy (carried out in university departments and, within
SERC, at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the Royal Observatory,
Edinburgh) it is expected to regain its leadership as a result of three optical
telescopes which form the basis of a new international observatory on the island
of La Palma in the Canary Islands. Two telescopes (the Isaac Newton Telescope,
2-5 m in diameter, and the 1-m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope) are in use, while the
4-2-m William Herschel Telescope comes into operation in 1987. On Mauna Kea,
Hawaii, SERC has a 3-8-m infra-red telescope, the largest telescope in the world
designed specifically to make infra-red observations, and a 15-m radio telescope
(which has been built in collaboration with the Netherlands and is scheduled to
open in 1986) for observing wavelengths of less than a millimetre. Much of the
observation will eventually be carried out under remote control from Britain and
the Netherlands using computer communications networks. Cambridge and
Manchester universities are the main centres for research in radio astronomy,
with substantial support from SERC.
The Starlink network of computer systems, centred at Chilton and located at
many centres of astronomical research in Britain, provides and co-ordinates
image processing and data reduction facilities for use by British astronomers.
SERC establishments concerned with the provision of facilities for university
research in nuclear physics are at Chilton, which supports university teams
engaged in experiments in particle physics at CERN and other overseas centres,
and the Daresbury Laboratory, where there is a 20-million-volt tandem
accelerator for research into nuclear structure. Projects using these and other
facilities are funded through research grants to universities.
Support is provided for high-quality research in biological and natural sciences,
and mathematics. Where experimental facilities are too expensive to be financed
by individual universities and polytechnics, central facilities have been pro¬
vided. For example, the Daresbury Laboratory operates a synchrotron storage
ring which provides high-intensity electromagnetic radiation used in a wide
range of experiments in materials science, surface physics, crystallography and
molecular biology. Other central facilities include a high-powered laser facility at
Chilton, which is used to study plasmas, and a spallation neutron source, also at
Chilton, to provide a pulsed beam of neutrons.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the main government agency for the
support of biomedical research. Its major research establishments are the
National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, which carries out
fundamental research relevant to medicine, the Clinical Research Centre at
Northwick Park Hospital, London, and the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at
Cambridge. The Council also has over 50 research units, mostly located in
university departments, medical schools and hospitals in Britain. In addition to
the work it supports in its own establishments, the Council provides further
support for research through grants to workers in universities, polytechnics and
other centres, and through awards granted for those undertaking research
training. Its primary objective is to advance knowledge that will improve the level
of health. Major areas of activity include neurosciences, molecular and cell
biology, reproduction and development, and cancer.

The MRC is assisted by four advisory boards: the Neurobiology and Mental
Health Board: the Cell Biology and Disorders Board; the Physiological Systems
and Disorders Board: and the Tropical Medicine Research Board.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) is responsible for encourag-
ing, planning and executing research in the physical and biological sciences
relating to the natural environment and its resources. The work is broadly
divided into groups defined as: the Solid Earth (its physical properties and
mineral resources); Seas and Oceans (their behaviour and living and mineral
resources): Inland Waters (their behaviour and living resources); Terrestrial
Environments (natural ecosystems and their resources): Atmosphere (its
structure and interactions): and a number of interdisciplinary studies including
pollution and the physical and biological properties of the Antarctic environ¬
ment. Research programmes being expanded include those on geological work
in connection with deep structures, which is important for future mineral and
energy exploration: new means of insect pest control using viruses harmless to
man; environmental biotechnology; the environmental consequences of modern
agricultural practices; research on aspects of tree biology relevant to forestry; the
environmental effects of acid rain; estuarine processes; atmospheric chemistry;
Antarctic research; the climate: remote sensing by satellite, for resource and
ecological surveys; and ocean modelling. NERC is also involved extensively in
contract research and is able to provide public authorities, industry and
commerce with experienced personnel and material facilities for such work
across the spectrum of environmental science. Much of the Council's work has
potential for practical application overseas and several applied projects are in
progress on, for example, biological pest control, regeneration of tropical
hardwoods and drip irrigation techniques for tropical crops.
The Council's research institutes are: the British Antarctic Survey, the British
Geological Survey, the Institute of Hydrology, the Institute of Marine Bio¬
chemistry, the Institute for Marine Environmental Research, the Institute of
Oceanographic Sciences, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, the Institute of
Virology and the Sea Mammal Research Unit. The Council also operates the
Research Vessel Services and maintains a central computing service in
support of all its institutes.
Research institutes aided by council grants are: the Freshwater Biological
Association, the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, the
Scottish Marine Biological Association and the Unit of Comparative Plant
Ecology at Sheffield University.
The Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC), together with the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, supports a network of
research institutes in Britain collectively known as the Agricultural and Food
Research Service. The Service is involved with research into a wide range of
topics relevant to the agricultural, horticultural and food industries: animals,
plants, soils, engineering and food. The results of this research are applied to
increase the efficiency of these industries and those that support them,
including the chemical and engineering industries. However, under the AFRCs
long-term strategy, greater emphasis is being given to those areas of science
related to agriculture and food, especially human food and nutrition research.
Several organisational changes are being implemented including consolidation
of related research programmes on a reduced number of sites.
The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) supports research and
training in the social sciences in British universities, polytechnics and research
institutes. The Council s activities cover a range of studies concerned with
economic life and social behaviour. Its budget is used to support research

centres, to provide funds for research programmes and projects conducted by
British academies, to identify and encourage research into topics of social and
economic concern, and to fund the research and training of postgraduate
students in the social sciences. Among the research interests of its standing
committees are the competitiveness of British industry, social change and
economic life, information technology and education, efficiency in government
and the changing urban and regional system. The Council acts as agent for the
Advisory Board for the Research Councils in preparing a programme of research
on science policy, and for the Department of Trade and Industry in commission¬
ing studies of public acceptance of new technologies.
Of the total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the
academic year 1983-84 (£600 million), the largest government contribution
(£340 million) was through the University Grants Committee.
Scientific research in the universities and other institutions of higher
education is also supported through the research councils. This support takes
two forms. First, almost half of the postgraduate students in science and
technology receive maintenance awards from the research councils, through
postgraduate studentships. These awards are in some cases for periods of up to
three years of training in research work and in others for shorter periods for
advanced studies. Secondly, grants and contracts are given to the universities
and other institutions by the research councils for specified projects, particu¬
larly in new or developing areas of research. The AFRC, MRC and ESRC main¬
tain a number of research units within universities. In addition, the research
councils provide central facilities in their own establishments for use by
university research workers. The other main channels of support for scientific
research in the universities are various government departments, the Royal
Society, industry and the independent foundations.
A number of universities in industrial centres have acquired outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale
close relationships are fostered between the universities, industry and the
Government in numerous joint projects.
Of special interest are science parks, sites containing science-based industries,
which have been designed to facilitate advanced technology through collabora¬
tion between university and industrial scientists and technologists. There are
about 12 university-based science parks in Britain, and a further 15 are in
various stages of planning. There are also more than 20 non-university high
technology developments similar to science parks.
Charitable foundations sponsoring research in Britain include: the Cancer
Research Campaign, the Chester Beatty Institute for Cancer Research, the Ciba
Foundation, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the Institute for Cancer
Research, the Leverhulme Foundation, the Nuffield Foundation, the Wellcome
Trust and the Wolfson Foundation.
There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
of which promote their own disciplines or are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members. The Council of Science and Tech¬
nology Institutes has 15 member institutes representing, among others,
biologists, chemists, mathematicians, metallurgists, physicists and geologists.
The Fellowship of Engineering, formed from distinguished engineers in the
Royal Society and the leading chartered engineering institutions, advises the
Government and other relevant bodies on all aspects of engineering. It also
378
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE LEARNED
SOCIETIES
Royal Society
arranges lectures, seminars and conferences on matters of national importance
in engineering. The Fellowship was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1983. Up
to 60 leading engineers from industry, the academic world and the public service
in Britain are elected each year and there were 607 Fellows in 1985.
More than 300 learned societies in Britain play an important part in the
promotion of science and technology. Through meetings, publications and
recognition by the scientific community, they help to maintain high academic
and professional standards and facilitate the spread of knowledge. The Royal
Society, the oldest of these societies, is also the national academy of science,
while the Royal Colleges in the various fields of medicine and the Fellowship of
Engineering have similar leading roles in their areas. In addition, the Royal
Society of Arts, the Royal Institution and the British Association for the
Advancement of Science are also broadly concerned with the promotion of
science and technology. In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh, founded in
1783, is concerned with the promotion of science and literature.
The Royal Society, or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for Improving
Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in Britain’s
scientific affairs and is equivalent to national academies of sciences in other
countries. It is the oldest such academy in the world to have enjoyed continuous
existence. There are today three main categories of Fellowship: Royal Fellows;
Foreign Members, of whom there are about 85; and the main body of Fellows
numbering about 1,000. Election to the Fellowship, which is for life, is
restricted to 40 people a year. The Royal Society is governed by a council of 21
members. The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appointments
to research councils (other than the Economic and Social Research Council) and
Fellows serve on most of the governmental advisory councils and committees
concerned with research.
The Royal Society recognises the highest standards of scientific and technolo¬
gical achievements through its elections to the Fellowship and the award of its
medals and endowed lectureships. It awards 14 medals (not all annually)
including the Copley Medal (its highest award) and three Royal Medals, while
there are seven endowed lectureships. The Society encourages research through
the award of grants and research appointments. It administers 18 research
professorships, of which four are supported from private funds and the
remainder from its parliamentary grant. A further 11 senior research fellow¬
ships and 120 other research fellowships are supported in British universities.
Grants for research are made from its private funds and from its parliamentary
grant, and particular funds are available for field research overseas, for travel by
individual scientists, for studies in the history of science and for scientific
publications. The dissemination of scientific knowledge is encouraged by a
programme of scientific discussion meetings and through its publications. It
has an extensive library of works relating to the history of science. The council
gives advice to the Government and other bodies on matters relating to science
and technology and their application, and study groups on particular aspects of
science are established at intervals to prepare reports which are widely
distributed to the scientific community. A number of committees of the council,
some of them jointly with other bodies, promote improvements in education in
science subjects and emphasise the importance of the applied sciences and
engineering in industry.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. As the national
academy of science, it represents Britain in all but two of the 19 international
unions comprising the International Council of Scientific Unions. It is a
member of the European Science Foundation and certain other organisations.

and also plays a leading part in international scientific programmes. It has
agreements for exchange visits by scientists and co-operative research with
many academies throughout the world, and maintains informal relations to
promote scientific eo-operation with many other countries; some 3,000 visits
abroad for periods ranging from a few days to two years are supported annually.
The largest formal scheme is the European Science Exchange Programme,
which provides for fellowships (usually of one year) and study visits (lasting
about two months) with 15 other countries in Western Europe.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement of
Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) is concerned with arts, architecture and
design, science and technology, industry and commerce, the environment and
education. Since its foundation in 1754, one of the Society's principal objects
has been to promote the progress of all branches of practical knowledge, chiefly
by means of lectures and conferences, and by the publication of a monthly
journal designed to enable leading authorities to report on developments of
public as well as specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating the
introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving arts
and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge'. Its
character, however, was largely determined by work in the early nineteenth
century by Sir Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition
of research. Today the Royal Institution has extensive laboratories which
undertake research on subjects including fast chemical kinetics, photo¬
synthesis and solar energy. Lectures are given on recent developments in science
and other branches of knowledge with particular emphasis on encouraging
young people to take an interest in science.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831 to
promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as well as by
eminent scientists. In addition, the Association plans special lectures, exhibi¬
tions, conferences and discussions, appoints study groups and publishes
pamphlets. The Association has 16 branches and five lectureships for young
scientists (dealing with the physical, biological and social sciences) to encourage
scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The British
Association has made an important contribution to the development of science
by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles to the discovery and
application of scientific knowledge.
The Zoological Society of London, whose main function is as a scientific
organisation, runs the world-famous London Zoo, opened to its members in
1827, which occupies 14 hectares (36 acres) of Regent's Park, London. In 1931
the Society opened Whipsnade Park Zoo near Dunstable (Bedfordshire) where
some 2,000 animals roam a 200-hectare (500-acre) park. The Society is
responsible for the Institute of Zoology, which carries out research in
conservation and comparative medicine. It also organises scientific meetings
and symposia for zoologists, publishes scientific journals and maintains one of
the largest zoological libraries in the world. Other well-known zoos include those
at Edinburgh. Bristol, Chester, Dudley, Chessington, Marwell (near Winchester)
and Jersey. There are also a number of safari parks’ containing wild animals:
the public can drive through the parks in closed motor cars.

The Royal Botanic Gardens (founded in 1759) cover 121 hectares (300 acres) at
Kew (west London) and a 187-hectare (462-acre) estate at Wakehurst Place,
Ardingly (West Sussex). They contain the largest collections of living and dried
plants in the world. The Herbarium is primarily concerned with research into
the classification of plants and the preparation of floras and plant lists as well as
the identification of about 50,000 specimens a year from overseas. A Conserva¬
tion Unit gathers and provides information on endangered species of plant on a
world-wide basis. The study of plant anatomy, plant biochemistry, cytology and
genetics is undertaken in the Jodrell Laboratory at Kew. The laboratory's plant
physiology section is based at Wakehurst Place where research is being carried
out into seed germination and storage and a seed bank of temperate and tropical
species is maintained. A wide range of living plants, comprising some 110,000
different kinds of plant representing most families, is displayed at Kew.
The Royal Botanic Garden at Edinburgh was founded in 1670. The Garden
has three outstations, at Benmore (near Dunoon), at Logan (near Stranraer) and
at Dawyck (near Peebles). The large collection of living plants, both out of doors
and in greenhouses, is used for taxonomic (plant classification) and related
research. An important botanical library with over 75,000 volumes is main¬
tained at Edinburgh.
The British Museum (Natural History) is one of the world’s principal centres for
the general study of natural history, particularly for specialised research into
taxonomy. It has five scientific departments: botany, entomology, mineralogy,
palaeontology and zoology. It possesses extensive collections of extant and fossil
animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and meteorites. The Science Museum
illustrates the development of pure and applied science in all countries, but
chiefly in Britain. The geology of Britain is probably known in more exact detail
than that of any other country in the world, and the British Geological Survey
has an outstanding collection of exhibits in the Geological Museum. These three
museums are in South Kensington, London. Other important collections
include the Museum of Science and Industry, in Birmingham, the Museum of
the History of Science, at Oxford, and the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh.
Britain is fully involved in the European Community committees concerned
with the co-ordination of national policies on scientific and technological
research and the implementation of joint projects of interest to the Community.
It is also an active member of the Committee for Scientific and Technological
Policy of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Other
intergovernmental organisations involved in scientific co-operation with which
Britain is concerned include: specialised agencies of the United Nations such as
the International Atomic Energy Agency; European Co-operation in Science and
Technology; the Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Energy Agency:
the European Centre for Nuclear Research; the European Space Agency: the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory; the International Agency for Research
on Cancer; the Institut Laue-Langevin; and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa¬
tion Science Committee. Among non-governmental organisations Britain is
represented in the international unions comprising the International Council of
Scientilic Unions (see p 378). The five research councils, the Royal Society and
the British Academy were founder members of the European Science Founda¬
tion set up in 1974. Since 1968 Britain has signed over 35 intergovernmental
agreements with other countries on co-operation in science and technology or
technical co-operation. These agreements are usually intended to promote
mutually beneficial exchanges and are administered by various government
departments.
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
381
Space
Activities
There are science and technology sections in the British Embassies in
Washington, Paris, Bonn, Tokyo and Moscow, while staff in other British
Embassies and High Commissions also promote contacts in science and
technology between Britain and the countries to which they are accredited. They
serve all central government departments concerned in overseas scientific
affairs, as well as research councils and the Royal Society, which is the main
representative of Britain in areas of non-governmental scientific collaboration.
Substantial use of their services is made by industrialists. Reports from the
embassies on overseas science and technology are disseminated to over 1,000
British companies. Administrative support for the overseas scientific network is
provided by the Department of Trade and Industry's Overseas Technical
Information Unit.
The British Council (which promotes an understanding of Britain overseas
through cultural, educational and technical co-operation) fosters co-operation
between British scientists and those of overseas countries to promote among
overseas specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its
scientific achievements, and, in the developing countries, to identify and
manage development projects in the technological, scientific and educational
sectors. The Council helps British scientists to visit other countries, makes its
own awards for postgraduate study in Britain by scientists from overseas and
supervises programmes for senior specialists and students who come to Britain
through United Nations agencies or bilateral technical co-operation schemes.
In January 1985 the Government announced its intention to establish a British
National Space Centre to improve the development of space technology in
Britain and co-ordinate policy more effectively. A number of government
departments have an interest in space activities, including the Department of
Trade and Industry, the Department of Education and Science (through the
research councils) and the Ministry of Defence. Expenditure on civil space
research in 1984—85 was about £86 million.
Britain is a member of the European Space Agency (ESA) together with
Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Irish
Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The Depart¬
ment of Trade and Industry is responsible for leading the British delegation to
the ESA and for British participation in its space applications programmes.
Within these, British industry has led the consortia which have developed all of
the ESA's communications satellites including the MARECS series leased to the
International Maritime Satellite Organisation and the European Communica¬
tions Satellite series leased to the European telecommunications satellite
authority (EUTELSAT). A much larger satellite, Olympus, is under development
and is expected to be launched in 1987. This series of developments has been
complemented by a national space programme administered by the Department
of Trade and Industry and has led to a British industry with advanced and
wide-ranging capabilities, particularly in telecommunications.
In the ESA's other applications programmes, Britain is developing the main
microwave instrument for an earth observation satellite, ERS-1, to be launched
in 1989. Britain is also participating in the Ariane 4 launcher programme, with
its first launch due in 1986, and in the Columbus preparatory programme. The
latter, started in 1985, is designed to define the European contribution to the
international space station proposed by the United States, and Britain is leading
the studies on astronaut-tended platforms.
The Department of Education and Science, through the Science and
Engineering Research Council, provides Britain's representatives and financial
contribution for the ESA's scientific programme, participation in which
provides the main space opportunities for British experimenter groups. Britain
382
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
has been selected to participate in all but one of the ESA's science missions. The
ESA mission to observe Halley's Comet, which is using the British-built Giotto
spacecraft, was launched in July 1985 and will intercept the comet in March
1986.
There are bilateral arrangements for space research with other countries,
notably the United States through its National Aeronautics and Space Adminis¬
tration (NASA). British experiments have already provided information which
has helped to increase scientific knowledge, especially in astronomy, astro¬
physics and geophysics, including climate research. Britain plans to put an
X-ray telescope on board the Federal Republic of Germany's X-ray satellite,
ROSAT, due to be launched in 1987. Other international satellite missions
are being planned.
21 Promotion
of the Arts
Artistic and cultural activity in Britain ranges from the highest standards of
professional performance to the enthusiastic support and participation of
amateurs. London is one of the leading world centres for drama, music, opera
and dance, and festivals held in towns and cities throughout the country attract
much interest. Many British playwrights, composers, film-makers, sculptors,
painters, writers, actors, singers, choreographers and dancers enjoy interna¬
tional reputations. Television and radio play an important role in bringing a
wide range of artistic events to a large audience. At an amateur level, activities
which make use of local talent and resources take many forms: choral,
orchestral, operatic, dramatic and other societies for the arts abound, and
increasing numbers of people take an interest in crafts such as pottery, weaving
and woodwork. Arts activities introduced by the ethnic minorities are also
flourishing, and range from Indian dance to Pakistani poetry and Caribbean
steel bands.
Policies The broad objectives of the Government's policies for the arts are to assist the
provision and development of the performing and visual arts: to maintain and
enhance the collections of the national museums and art galleries; to help
preserve objects of importance to the national heritage; and to sustain and
develop national collections of literary material, archive and information stores.
The general aim underlying these objectives is to meet the need for public access
to, and enjoyment and appreciation of, the nation's cultural heritage and
talents. The Government is maintaining existing levels of support for arts
activities at a time of economic constraint; encouraging private funding of the
arts by various means including sponsorship; and making the arts more
available to people in the regions. An important concept in its funding policy is
the arm’s length principle' by which government funds are distributed to arts
organisations indirectly, through bodies such as the Arts Councils and the
British Film Institute; this helps to safeguard against political interference in
arts activities.
Administration Promotion and patronage of the arts are the concern of both official and
unofficial bodies. The Government and local authorities play an active part, and
a substantial and increasing amount of help also comes from private sources,
including trusts and commercial concerns.
The Minister for the Arts, a Minister of State at the Privy Council Office, is
responsible for general arts policy and heads the Office of Arts and Libraries,
which administers government expenditure on national museums and art
galleries in England, the Arts Council, the British Library and other national
arts and heritage bodies. Responsibility for the upkeep of ancient monuments
and historic buildings is exercised by the Department of the Environment, and
the regulation of the film industry and of broadcasting is conducted by the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Home Office, respectively. The
384
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Finance
Arts Councils
Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are responsible for
the national museums, galleries and libraries in their countries, and for other
cultural matters.
Local authorities support a wide range of artistic and cultural activities. They
maintain more than 1.000 local museums and art galleries, and some 4,000
public libraries; provide grant aid for professional and voluntary organisations
including orchestras and theatre, opera and ballet companies; and undertake
direct promotions through local arts councils. They also contribute to the cost of
new or converted buildings for the arts.
Arts education in schools, colleges, polytechnics, evening institutes and
community centres is the responsibility of central government education
departments, in partnership with local education authorities and voluntary
bodies.
Planned government expenditure through the Office of Arts and Libraries
amounts to some £272 million in 1985—86. About one-third of current
expenditure is being spent on the nine national galleries and museums in
England, about a fifth on the British Library and over two-fifths (£105 million)
channelled through the Arts Council to support the performing and visual arts
throughout Britain. Grants are also made to bodies including the British Film
Institute, the Crafts Council, certain other museums, and to the National
Heritage Memorial Fund. The Fund provides assistance to organisations
wishing to acquire, for the public benefit, land, buildings, works of art and other
objects associated with the national heritage. Additional central government
expenditure on arts and libraries in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
amounts to some £112 million.
Proposed spending on the arts and libraries by local authorities in 1985-86 is
some £364 million; nearly 90 per cent of current expenditure by the authorities
in England is on the public library service, and the remainder on local museums
and art galleries. Following the proposed abolition of the upper tier of local
government in Greater London and the metropolitan counties in 1986, extra
central government funding totalling £34 million in 1986-87 (and £35 million
in the following year) is planned to be allocated in support of the performing
arts, films and museums to replace funding from these sources.
Industrial and commercial concerns offer a vital and growing source of
sponsorship and patronage to a wide range of arts, including exhibitions,
concerts and opera seasons, and are often advised by the Association for
Business Sponsorship of the Arts and the Arts Councils. An incentive scheme
was launched by the Office of Arts and Libraries in 1984 to provide grants
totalling up to £1 million in a full year to match new business sponsorships. The
value of business sponsorship is currently some £15 million a year.
Two of the most generous acts of private patronage in recent years were made
in 1985: an endowment of £20 million, to be followed by a further £30 million in
subsequent years, was made to the National Gallery by the American millionaire.
Mr J. Paul Getty Jr, and a gift to the nation of a new extension to the gallery
(which is likely to cost in the region of £20 million) was made by the Sainsbury
family.
The independent Arts Council of Great Britain, established by Royal Charter in
1946, is the main channel for government aid to the performing and visual arts.
Its main objects are to develop and improve the knowledge, understanding and
practice of the performing and visual arts, to increase their accessibility to the
public, and to advise and co-operate with government departments, local
authorities and other organisations. The Council gives financial help and advice
to organisations ranging Irom the major opera, dance and drama companies,

orchestras and festivals, to the smallest touring theatres and experimental
groups. It encourages such interests as contemporary dance, mime, jazz,
literature, photography and art films, and helps professional creative writers,
choreographers, composers, artists and photographers through a variety of
subsidy schemes. It also promotes art exhibitions and tours of opera, dance and
drama companies and of contemporary music groups, and provides funds for
specialist training courses in the arts.
Under a development programme for the next decade, launched in 1984, the
Council is increasing its funding of the arts in the regions and reducing its
support for activities in London. In the first five years support for new activities
is being concentrated in five main areas of the arts—art, dance, drama, music
and education—focusing on 13 main centres of population throughout
England. Increased funding and responsibilities are also being given to the
regional arts associations (see below).
Organisations in Scotland and Wales receive their subsidies through the
Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils, which are committees of the Arts Council of
Great Britain with a large measure of autonomy. Northern Ireland has an
independent Arts Council with aims and functions similar to those of the Arts
Council of Great Britain.
Regional co-operation in arts patronage is encouraged through 15 regional arts
associations in England and Wales, which bring together all those in a region,
ranging from local authorities and private companies to local artists, with an
interest in improving the artistic life of their area. Their aim is to ensure that the
arts are more widely available and that artists receive support at regional as well
as national level. They offer financial assistance to artists and arts organisa¬
tions, and advise on, and in some cases promote, activities. They are financed
mainly by the Arts Council, the British Film Institute, the Crafts Council and
local authorities, and these interests are represented on their governing bodies.
Business sponsorship is also an important source of funds.
About 220 arts centres in Britain provide opportunities for enjoyment of and
participation in a range of arts activities. Amateur activities are supported by
resident professional staff. The centres are supported mainly by regional arts
associations and local authorities with some help from the Arts Council and
other organisations. Many theatres and art galleries also provide a focal point for
the community by offering facilities for other arts.
Local arts councils in towns and communities throughout Britain, some of them
founded and supported by local authorities, seek to promote and co-ordinate
arts activities such as festivals in their localities.
The British Council promotes knowledge of British culture and literature
overseas and maintains libraries in most of the 80 or so countries in which it is
represented. The Council may initiate or support overseas tours by British
theatre companies, orchestras, choirs, and opera and dance companies, as well
as by individual actors, musicians and artists. It promotes fine arts and other
exhibitions overseas, organises British participation in international exhibi¬
tions and film festivals, maintains film libraries in most of the countries in
which it works, and encourages professional interchange in all cultural fields
between Britain and other countries.
Both BBC radio and television and the independent television companies
broadcast a wide variety of drama (including adaptations of novels and stage
plays), performances of opera, ballet, and orchestral and other music, and

general arts magazine programmes and documentaries. These have won many
international awards at festivals such as the Prix Italia and Montreux
International Television Festivals. Independent television companies also make
grants for the promotion of the arts in their regions.
The BBC has orchestras employing many of Britain's full-time professional
musicians, and each week it broadcasts nearly 100 hours of serious music (both
live and recorded) on its Radio 3 channel. It regularly commissions new music,
particularly by British composers, and sponsors concerts, competitions and
festivals.
Considerable interest and enthusiasm is shown for the 240 professional arts
festivals which take place in Britain each year. The Edinburgh International
Festival, featuring a wide range of different arts, is the largest of its kind in the
world. Well-known festivals concentrating on music include the Three Choirs
Festival, which has taken place annually for more than 250 years in Gloucester,
Worcester or Hereford: the Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted to contemporary
British music: and the Aldeburgh and Bath festivals. Among others catering for
a number of art forms are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, the Llangollen
International Musical Eisteddfod and the festivals in Belfast, Buxton, Malvern,
Chichester, Harrogate, Salisbury, Windsor and York.
Britain is probably the world's foremost country for theatre, and has a long and
rich dramatic tradition. As well as companies based in London and other major
cities and towns, numerous touring companies visit a wide range of theatres,
festivals and other venues throughout Britain including arts and sports centres
and working men's clubs. Contemporary British playwrights who have received
international recognition include Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Alan Ayck¬
bourn, Caryl Churchill and David Edgar. The musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber,
such as Cats and Evita, have enjoyed considerable success both in Britain and
overseas. Among the best-known directors are Sir Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn. Peter
Brook. John Schlesinger and Terry Hands, while the many British performers
who enjoy international reputations include Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Lord
(formerly Sir Laurence) Olivier. Sir John Gielgud, Sir Alec Guinness, Vanessa
Redgrave, Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi and Glenda Jackson. British designers
such as John Bury, Ralph Koltai and Carl Toms are internationally recognised.
Britain has some 300 theatres intended for professional use which can seat
between 200 and 2,300 people. Some are privately owned, but most are owned
either municipally or by non-profit-distributing organisations. Some 50 of these
house resident theatre companies which receive subsidies from the Arts
Council. London is the main focus with a hundred or so West End and suburban
theatres, 12 of which are permanently occupied by subsidised companies. These
include the National Theatre, which stages a wide range of modern and classical
plays in its three auditoria in the South Bank arts complex; the Royal
Shakespeare Company, which, while still performing in Stratford upon Avon,
also produces plays by Shakespeare and his contemporaries, as well as modern
work, in its two auditoria in the City's Barbican Centre: and the English Stage
Company at the Royal Court Theatre, which produces the work of the most
talented new playwrights.
Outside London most cities and many large towns have at least one theatre:
some, like the Palace Theatre, Manchester, and the Theatre Royal, Nottingham,
date from the nineteenth century and have been handsomely restored. Others,
like the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, and the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, have been
built to the latest designs. Some universities such as those in Aberystwyth,
Exeter and Newcastle upon Tyne have theatres which house professional
companies playing to the general public. Most regional repertory companies

mount about eight to ten productions a year; some also have studio theatres in
addition to the main auditorium, where they present new or experimental
drama and plays of specialist interest. Repertory theatres also frequently serve
the function of a social centre and meeting place by offering a wide range of
events such as concerts, poetry recitals and exhibitions, and by providing
restaurants, bars and theatre shops. Successful productions from regional
theatre companies often transfer to London's West End, while the largest
regional theatres receive visits from the National Theatre or the Royal
Shakespeare Company.
A number of companies provide theatre for young audiences. Unicorn Theatre
for Young People and Polka Children's Theatre, both in London, produce plays
specially written for children under 11 years old, and the Whirligig Theatre tours
throughout the country. The Young Vic Company in London and Contact
Theatre Company in Manchester produce plays for teenage audiences. There are
numerous Theatre-in-Edueation companies which perform in schools for all age
ranges and abilities. Some of these companies operate independently (such as
Theatre Centre, which plays in London and tours further afield), while others
are attached to regional repertory theatres such as the Belgrade in Coventry and
the Playhouse in Leeds. Most regional repertory theatres also mount occasional
productions aimed at younger audiences, and concessionary ticket prices for
those at school, college or university are generally available. There are also a
number of puppet companies.
Both the National Youth Theatre in London and the Scottish Youth Theatre in
Edinburgh offer early acting opportunities to young people.
Training for actors and stage managers is provided mainly in drama schools,
among which the best known are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the
Central School of Speech and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Drama,
and the Drama Centre (all in London), and the Bristol Old Vic School, the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (Glasgow) and the Manchester
Polytechnic School of Drama. There are a number of theatre design courses,
often based in art schools, which train designers for the stage. Several
universities, polytechnics and other colleges offer courses in drama.
There are several thousand amateur drama societies throughout Britain. Their
work is encouraged by a number of bodies, such as the British Theatre
Association, the Central Council for Amateur Theatre, the National Drama
Conference, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association of
Ulster Drama Festivals. Amateur companies sometimes receive financial sup¬
port from local government, regional arts associations and other bodies.
The widespread interest in classical music in Britain is reflected in the large
audiences at choral and orchestral concerts and at performances of opera, dance
and chamber music, while rock and pop music, folk music, jazz, light music and
brass bands all have substantial followings.
A wide range of events and activities took place in Britain in 1985 to celebrate
European Music Year, designated by the European Parliament and the Council
of Europe to coincide with the three-hundredth anniversary of the births of
Bach, Handel and Domenico Scarlatti. Among Britain’s most important
contributions was the creation of a permanent European Baroque Orchestra, to
be based in Oxford.

Seasons of orchestral and choral concerts are promoted every year in many of the
large towns and cities. The principal concert-halls in central London are the
Royal Festival Hall, next to which are the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell
Room accommodating smaller-scale performances; the Barbican Hall (part of the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences); the Royal Albert Hall, where the
world-famous seasons of BBC Promenade Concerts are given each summer; the
Wigmore Hall, a recital centre; and St John's, Smith Square.
The leading symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the London
Symphony (resident at the Barbican Centre), the Philharmonia, the Royal
Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle
(Manchester), the City of Birmingham Symphony, the Bournemouth Sym¬
phony, and the Ulster and the Scottish National Orchestras. The BBC’s six
orchestras provide broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There
are also specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the English
Chamber Orchestra, the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the Academy of
Ancient Music, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle
upon Tyne), the Scottish Baroque Ensemble and the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra. The London Sinfonietta specialises in performing contemporary
music. Groups playing authentic early instruments attract great interest
throughout the country.
British conductors such as Sir Colin Davis, Sir Neville Marriner and Simon
Rattle reach a wide audience through their recordings as well as by their
performances, and the works of composers such as Sir Michael Tippett and
Peter Maxwell Davies enjoy international acclaim. The Master of the Queen's
Music, Malcolm Williamson, holds an office within the Royal Household with
responsibility for organising and writing music for state occasions.
Among the principal choral societies are the Bach Choir, the Royal Choral
Society, the Cardiff Polyphonic Choir, the Edinburgh Choral Union and the
Belfast Philharmonic Society. Almost all the leading orchestras have close links
with particular choirs, such as the Philharmonia Chorus and the London
Symphony Chorus. The English tradition of church singing is represented by
choirs such as those of King's College Chapel, Cambridge, and Christ Church
Cathedral, Oxford. There are many male-voice choirs in Wales and in certain
parts of England.
Among the characteristics of modern pop and rock music are the diversity of
styles, the frequency with which new styles and stars emerge, and the short
lifespan of many groups. Electric guitars and drums usually provide the
instrumental basis, but there has been an increasing use of brass instruments,
while many new groups have abandoned traditional instruments for electronic
synthesisers. Pop music is an integral part of ‘youth culture’, and has been so
since the early 1960s when groups such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones,
and later The Who, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, achieved international success.
British groups have continued to appeal to audiences world-wide and often set
new trends in music; some of the more recent groups to have achieved renown
are Dire Straits, Culture Club, Duran Duran and Wham. Well-known performers
include David Bowie, Elton John and Joan Armatrading.
Jazz has an enthusiastic following in Britain and is played in numerous clubs
and public houses. A national jazz centre is due to be opened in London in 1986.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, London. The Royal Opera and Royal Ballet, which rank among the
world's finest companies, are supported by a permanent orchestra. Seasons of

opera in English are given by the English National Opera at the London
Coliseum. Sadler’s Wells Theatre is the home of Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet and
the New Sadler's Wells Opera Company, and stages many of the London
performances of visiting opera and dance companies. Scottish Opera has
regular winter seasons at the Theatre Royal in Glasgow, and tours mainly in
Scotland and northern England. Welsh National Opera has seasons in Cardiff
and other cities and, with Kent Opera and Opera 80, provides most of the
touring productions in England. Opera North, based in Leeds, undertakes tours
in the north of England. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted by Opera,
Northern Ireland.
An opera season for which international casts are specially assembled is held
every summer at Glyndebourne in Sussex; this is followed by an autumn tour by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera using different easts.
Dance companies also include: London Festival Ballet, which divides its
performances almost equally between London and the regions; Ballet Rambert
(Britain's oldest ballet company, which re-formed in 1966 as a leading modern
dance company); Scottish Ballet, based in Glasgow; London, Contemporary
Dance Theatre (which provides regular seasons of contemporary dance in
London besides touring extensively); and Northern Ballet Theatre, based in
Manchester, which also tours widely throughout England. Extemporary Dance
Company and Moving Picture Mime Show also provide programmes throughout
the year. A number of modern dance groups are supported by regional arts
associations and about 30 small dance and mime groups by the Arts Council.
Several dance groups such as Basic Space and Jumpers are supported by the
Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils. All three Councils also support individuals
and offer commissions to other small groups.
Professional training in music is given mainly at colleges of music. The leading
London colleges are the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity College of Music. Outside
London the main centres include the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama in Glasgow, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, the
Welsh College of Music and Drama, Cardiff, and the Birmingham School of
Music. The National Opera Studio provides advanced training courses. The
leading dance schools are the Royal Ballet School, the Rambert Academy and the
London School of Contemporary Dance which, with many private schools, have
helped in raising British dance to its present high standard. Dance is now a
subject for degree studies.
Youth and Music, an organisation affiliated to the international Jeunesses
Musicales, encourages attendance by young people at opera, dance and concert
performances. Special performances of orchestral music for children include the
Robert Mayer Concerts, held in London on Saturday mornings. Ludus Dance in
Education Company and Outreach (in the north of England) work mainly with
young people. Scottish Ballet Steps Out works in schools throughout Scotland.
Many children learn to play musical instruments at school, and some take the
examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. The
National Youth Orchestras of Great Britain, of Scotland and of Wales and other
youth orchestras are noted for their high standards. Nearly a third of the players
in the European Community Youth Orchestra come from Britain. There is also a
National Youth Jazz Orchestra.
The British film industry is widely acknowledged to have undergone a revival in
the early 1980s. British films, actors and the creative and technical services
which support them have been achieving notable successes in international film

festivals and other events. Besides feature films, including eo-productions
with other countries, the industry produces films for television as well as pro¬
motional, advertising and training films.
There are about 1,310 cinema screens in Britain, about half of which are
operated by three large commercial cinema chains, and estimated attendances
in 1984 amounted to some 70 million. Cinema attendance figures declined
rapidly between the mid-1950s and the early 1980s: in 1954 the average weekly
cinema audience was some 25 million, but by 1983 it was about 5 per cent of
that figure. Major reasons for the decline have been competition from television
viewing, the rapid rise in the use of home video-cassette recorders, and the effect
of the economic recession on the spending power of a predominantly young
cinema-going public. Attendances have started to rise again, however, since
1984. There has been a growth in recent years in the number of grant-aided
regional film theatres and film societies offering alternative programmes to
those of the commercial cinema chains.
Following an earlier decline, the number of new feature films being made by
British film companies (37 in 1984) is now increasing, due in part to the
growing involvement of television companies such as Channel 4 in film
production and to the success of certain low-budget films. A bank facility in
excess of £150 million for the production of feature films, believed to be the
largest of its kind ever arranged by a British company, was set up by Thorn-EMI
Screen Entertainment Ltd in March 1985.
British Film Year, a major initiative by the film industry, fully supported by the
Government, was launched in April 1985. Its main aims are to encourage
cinema-going as the best way to see films, to develop the use of films as a
medium of education, to highlight Britain's great national assets as a
film-making country and to promote British films and British film-making
ability overseas.
Important features of the year are a travelling exhibition visiting cities
throughout Britain, an education programme linked to schools and colleges, a
campaign by the cinema chains to modernise and refurbish equipment in their
cinemas, and a varied programme of overseas events.
Following a wide-ranging review of the film industry, measures were taken by
the Government in 1985 to remove certain statutory controls on cinemas which
had become outdated and which were no longer contributing to the industry's
development. The Eady levy, a statutory levy raised from exhibitors on revenues
received from cinema admissions, was abolished and future funding was
secured for the various bodies which had benefited from the proceeds of the levy
in recent years.
The National Film Finance Corporation, which had been funded from the
Eady levy, was replaced by a private body, the British Screen Finance
Consortium, whose members are drawn from the film, television and video
industries. The consortium, investing its own money together with contribu¬
tions from the Government amounting to £10 million over five years, will
part-finance the production of low- and medium-budget films involving largely
British talent and encourage the early stages of film project development and the
production of short films.
An annual government grant of some £8 million is also made to the British
Film Institute.
The development of film and television as an art form is promoted by the British
Film Institute, founded in 1933, and in Scotland by the Scottish Film Council.
The Institute offers direct financial and technical help through its Film

Production Board to new and experienced film-makers who cannot find support
elsewhere, and helps to fund film and video workshops in liaison with the
Channel Four Television Company. It administers the National Film Theatre in
London and the National Film Archive, and has a library from which films and
video-cassettes maybe hired. The Institute’s Information Division has extensive
international collections of books, periodicals, scripts, stills and posters, offers
an information service on all aspects of film and television, and produces a range
of publications, including the British National Film and Video Catalogue, which
records films and video-cassettes available in Britain, and a quarterly journal.
Sight and Sound. The Education Department produces study materials and
offers an advisory service to the growing number of teachers of film and
television at all levels of formal education and in adult education.
The National Film Archive contains over 75,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, and over 10,000 television programmes. The
National Film Theatre has two cinemas showing films of outstanding historical,
artistic or technical interest, and is unique in offering regular programmes
unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the
films. Each autumn it mounts the London Film Festival, at which some 150 of
the finest new films from all over the world are screened.
The British Film Institute has promoted and helps to fund the development of
some 40 regional film theatres, and is involved in establishing film and
television centres with a range of activities and facilities in a number of major
cities. It also co-operates with the regional arts associations and grant-aids their
film activities. In Wales, the Welsh Arts Council acts as the Institute’s agent. In
Scotland, the Scottish Film Council supports regional film theatres, administers
the Scottish Film Archive, and promotes the use of film and television in
education. Together with the Scottish Arts Council it makes grants towards film
production in Scotland through the Scottish Film Production Fund. Grants in
Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
The Children's Film and Television Foundation produces and distributes
entertainment films specially designed for children. In view of the rapid decline
of the children's matinee movement (only some 50 cinemas now provide
programmes for children on Saturday mornings) the Foundation's films are
increasingly shown through the medium of video and television.
An independent National Film and Television School, financed jointly by the
cinemas, the independent television companies and the BBC, offers courses for
writers, directors, producers and camera technicians. Training in film produc¬
tion is also given at the London International Film School, the Royal College of
Art, and at some polytechnics and other institutions.
Local authorities have powers to license cinemas and censor films. They have a
legal duty to prohibit the admission of children under 16 to unsuitable films,
and may censor films for adults. In considering the suitability of films the
authorities normally rely on the judgment of an independent body, the British
Board of Film Censors, to which most films for public showing are submitted.
The Board was set up on the initiative of the cinema industry to ensure that a
proper standard was maintained in films offered to the public. It does not use
any written code of censorship, but may require cuts to be made before granting
a certificate to a film; very rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the
Board are put into one of five categories: U meaning universal—suitable for all;
PG, meaning parental guidance, in which some scenes may be unsuitable for
young children; 15 and 18, for people of not less than 15 and 18 years of age
392

respectively; and Restricted 18, for restricted showing only at segregated
premises to which no one under 18 is admitted—for example, licensed cinema
clubs. In 1985 the certification of new video-cassettes was added to the Board's
responsibilities.
State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of maintenance
and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase grants
for municipal museums and galleries, funding for living artists channelled
through the Arts and Crafts Councils, and grants towards the cost of art
education. The Government also encourages high standards of industrial design
and craftsmanship through grants to the Design Council.
All national museums and galleries are financed mainly from government
funds. They are free to levy entrance charges to their permanent collections,
special exhibitions and outstations at their discretion; in most cases at present
there is no charge at the main collections. All the national collections in
England, Scotland and Wales are now administered by independent trustees.
Museums and art galleries maintained by local authorities, universities and
private benefactions may receive help in building up their collections through
annual government grants administered by the Museums and Galleries
Commission (for England and Wales) and the National Museums of Scotland.
Financial and practical assistance to both national and local museums and
galleries is also given by the Arts Council and by trusts and voluntary bodies
including the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the National Art-Collections
Fund, the Contemporary Art Society and the Association for Business Spon¬
sorship of the Arts. Pre-eminent works of art accepted by the Government in
place of capital transfer tax are allocated to public galleries. Financial help may
also be available from the government-financed National Heritage Memorial
Fund; in recent years, the Fund has made important contributions towards
pictures purchased by the Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester City Art
Galleries, and by the national galleries and museums.
The Arts Council maintains its own collection of contemporary British art,
and organises or offers grants or guarantees for a variety of exhibitions
throughout the country. It runs the Hayward and Serpentine galleries in London
and supports a number of art and photography galleries in London and the
regions, such as the Arnolfini in Bristol and the Museum of Modern Art in
Oxford. The Council also provides support for artists and photographers
through purchasing, and commissioning fellowships and residences. Grant aid
is also available to support art and photography books and magazines. Similar
support is given by the Scottish Arts Council to galleries in Scotland such as the
Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh. The Welsh and Northern Ireland Arts
Councils have galleries in Cardiff and Belfast respectively.
A number of modern British sculptors and painters have high international
reputations, and have received many international prizes and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. Among the best known are Henry Moore, Elisabeth
Frink, Francis Bacon and David Hockney.
Over 1,000 museums and art galleries are open to the public, including the
major national collections and a wide variety of municipally and independently
owned institutions. Some 17 million people visited the national galleries and
museums in England in 1984.
The Government is advised on policy matters by the Museums and Galleries
Commission, which also promotes co-operation between national and provincial
institutions. Nine area museum councils provide technical services and advice
on conservation, display, documentation and publicity.
DOMESDAY BOOK
The 900th anniversary of the Domesday Book, one of Britain’s national treasures,
is to be celebrated by a major exhibition in 1986. The Book, a statistical survey
of English life and landholding, was commissioned by William the Conqueror
and completed in 1086. Re-bound five times in their history, the original two
volumes are now being split into five to make them more accessible to scholars
and to reduce future wear and tear.

of their common musical heritage, increase public access to and participation in
music, and, above all, to help young people to discover music.

The independent Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries
and their staffs belong and which also has many overseas members, is a
focus for the collection of information and discussion of matters relating to
museum administration, and a training and examining body for professional
qualifications.
The national museums and art galleries in London contain some of the world's
most comprehensive collections of objects of artistic, archaeological, scientific,
historical and general interest. They are the British Museum (including the
Museum of Mankind), the British Museum (Natural History), the Victoria and
Albert Museum, the Science Museum, the National Crallery, the Tate Gallery, the
National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War Museum, the National Army
Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the National Maritime Museum, the
Wallace Collection and the Geological Museum. Some of these museums also
have branches outside London, examples being the National Railway Museum
(York) and the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television (Bradford)
which are part of the Science Museum.
New developments planned or in progress at the Tate Gallery include the
building of an extension to house the large collection of paintings bequeathed to
the nation by the nineteenth-century artist J. M. W. Turner, and the opening ol
an outstation in Liverpool, to be called Tate in the North. An extension to the
National Gallery, to be financed by private funds (see p 384), has also been
announced. A national Theatre Museum is to be opened in Govent Garden,
London.
In Scotland the national collections are the National Museums of Scotland
(formed by the bringing together in October 1985 of the Royal Scottish Museum
and the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, and embracing also the
Scottish United Services Museum in Edinburgh Castle) and the National
Galleries of Scotland (comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art). The
National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St Fagan s Castle where
the Welsh Folk Museum is housed, an Industrial and Maritime Museum in
Cardiffs dockland, the Museum of the Woollen Industry at Drefach Felindre, and
the North Wales Quarrying Museum at Llanberis. Northern Ireland has two
national museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum in County Down.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries in the Tower of
London, the Museum of London, Sir John Soane’s Museum, the Courtauld
collection and the London Transport Museum. The Queen's Gallery in Bucking¬
ham Palace has exhibitions of pictures from the extensive royal collections.
Most cities and towns have museums devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually administered by the local authorities but sometimes by local
learned societies or by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and Cambridge are
rich in museums, many of them associated with the universities, such as the
Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, the oldest in the world, and the
Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Many private art collections in historic
family mansions, including those owned by the National Trusts, are open to the
public, while an increasing number of open air museums depict the regional life
of an area or preserve early industrial remains (for example, the Weald and
Downland Museum in Sussex, the North of England Open Air Museum in
Durham, and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in Shropshire). Among the newest
museums to have been established are the National Horseracing Museum at
Newmarket, the Jorvik Viking Centre, a reconstruction of the Viking settlement
in York, and a new maritime museum in Portsmouth, housing the restored

wreck of the Mary Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII, which sank in 1545 and was
raised in 1982. The new Burrell gallery in Glasgow (Britain's Museum of the
Year in 1985) houses a world-famous collection of tapestries, paintings and
objets d art. A new Museum of the Moving Image, due to open on the South Bank
of the Thames in 1987, will feature exhibitions of moving images ranging from
ancient shadow plays, through television and video, to images produced using
optic fibres and lasers.
Apart Irom their permanent collections, most museums and galleries stage
temporary exhibitions on particular themes. There are also a number of national
art exhibiting societies, the most famous of which is the Royal Academy of Arts
at Burlington House. The Academy holds an annual Summer Exhibition, in
which the works of hundreds of professional and amateur artists are included,
and important exhibitions of foreign art. The Royal Scottish Academy holds
annual exhibitions in Edinburgh. There are also childrens exhibitions,
including the National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Government grants for the crafts, amounting to some £1-8 million in 1985—86,
are administered in England and Wales by the Crafts Council. The Council holds
regular exhibitions at its London gallery (which also houses a crafts resource
centre, including a slide library) and publishes Crafts magazine, books on crafts
subjects, and slides. It runs a number of grant, loan and bursary schemes to
help people at different stages in the development of their art and is involved in
promotional and marketing schemes. The Council runs activities in education
and manages a British crafts shop at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Funding
is given to the Welsh Arts Council and the regional arts associations in England
for the support of crafts activities, and also to the British Crafts Centre, a
membership organisation for craftsmen and craftswomen which holds exhibi¬
tions and sells work through its London gallery.
Scotland receives a separate government grant which is administered by the
Crafts Consultative Committee of the Scottish Development Agency.
Most practical education in art and design is provided in colleges of art (of which
the most famous are the Slade School and the Royal College of Art, both in
London), further education colleges and private art schools. Four art colleges in
London are to be merged from January 1986 with three other colleges to form a
new London Institute. Degrees at postgraduate level are awarded by the Royal
College of Art. Art is also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central
(Art) Institutions.
Courses at universities and polytechnics concentrate largely on academic
disciplines such as the history oi art. The leading institutions include the
Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the University of London and the
Department ol Classical Art and Archaeology at University College, London. Art
has a place in all school curricula, and the Society for Education through Art
encourages, among other activities, the purchase by schools of original works of
art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools exhibition.
London is a major centre for the international art market, and sales of works of
art take place in the main auction houses (two of the longest established being
Sotheby s and Christie's), and through private dealers. Certain items are
covered by export control. These are: works of art and collectors’ items over 50
years old and worth more than £8,000 (more than £2,000 in the case of British
historical portraits): photographic material over 60 years old and worth more
than £200: documentary material over 50 years old; and British archaeological
material over 50 years old. A licence is required before such items can be
exported, but this is granted automatically in the case of objects imported into

Britain within the last 50 years. The application for a licence is considered by
the Department of Trade and Industry, and, if the Department's expert advisers
recommend the withholding of a licence, the matter is referred to the Reviewing
Committee on the Export of Works of Art. If the Committee considers a work to
be of national importance it can advise the Government to withhold the export
licence for a specified time to give a public museum or art gallery an opportunity
to buy at a fair price.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools and of most
colleges and universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country,
private libraries and several private literary societies. Book reviews are featured
in the press and on television and radio and there are numerous periodicals
concerned with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary merit is provided
by a number of awards, including the Booker, W. H. Smith & Son, and
Whitbread prizes. Awards to encourage young writers include those of the
Somerset Maugham Trust Fund and the E. C. Gregory Trust Fund. Many
British writers are internationally recognised and in 1983 the Nobel prize for
literature was awarded to the novelist William Golding. Other well-known living
authors are Graham Greene, Anthony Burgess, Margaret Drabble and Iris
Murdoch, while distinguished British poets include Philip Larkin. Ted Hughes,
Seamus Heaney and Gavin Ewart. Ted Hughes is Poet Laureate, a member of the
Royal Household who writes verse to mark royal occasions in return for a small
stipend.
A public lending scheme, introduced in 1982, gives authors the right to
receive payment from a central fund (totalling £2-75 million in 1985—86) for the
use of their books borrowed from public libraries.
The author of any original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is
automatically protected by the Copyright Act 1956 and its related international
conventions' from the unauthorised reproduction of the work both before and
after publication. The author of the work is the first owner of the copyright, and
the normal term of copyright in published original works is the life of the author
and a period of 50 years after his or her death.
Societies to promote literature include the English Association and the Royal
Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of Historical,
Philosophical and Philological Studies (the British Academy) is the leading
society for humanistic studies.
Other specialist societies include the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors, the largest of which is the Dickens
Fellowship. A number of societies, such as the Poetry Society, sponsor poetry
readings and recitals. There are also a number of clubs and societies, such as
the Poetry Book Society, which distribute selected new books to their members.
The British Library is the national library for the United Kingdom and ranks
with the National Library of Congress in Washington and the Bibliotheque
Rationale in Paris as one of the world’s greatest libraries. The Library is
organised in three divisions. The Reference Division, which receives a copy of
each new book, pamphlet or newspaper published in Britain and acquires
significant literature from other countries under copyright legislation, includes
the Department of Printed Books, holding about 9 million titles; the Department

of Manuscripts: the Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books: the
Science Reference Library, which holds collections in modern science, tech-
nology, patents, trade marks and designs: the India Office Library and Records:
and a preservation service. The Lending Division at Boston Spa, West Yorkshire,
has nearly 4-5 million volumes, including some 56,000 current periodicals,
available on loan to other libraries. It also has access to many millions of books
in other libraries and is the national centre for inter-library lending within
Britain and between Britain and countries overseas. The Bibliographic Services
Division processes the material deposited with the British Library for inclusion
in its catalogues and publishes the British National Bibliography, which lists all
new books and new editions published in Britain, and other bibliographic
records. It also provides automated information services of bibliographic data
for libraries and their users throughout Britain. The National Sound Archive
became part of the Library in 1983. Its collections include nearly half a million
discs and over 35,000 hours of recorded tape, which are available to the public
through a free listening service. The Research and Development Department is a
major source of funding for the support of research and development in library
and information services. Construction of a new building for the British
Library's London services began in 1982.
Under copyright legislation, the National Libraries of Scotland and of Wales,
the Bodleian Library of Oxford University and the Cambridge University Library
can claim copies of all new British publications.
Some of the national museums and government departments have important
libraries. The Public Record Office contains the records of the superior courts of
law and of most government departments, as well as famous historical
documents. The Scottish Record Office in Edinburgh serves the same purpose.
Besides a number of great private collections, such as that of the London
Library, there are the rich resources of the learned societies and institutions.
Examples are the libraries of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the
Royal Commonwealth Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the British
Theatre Association, the Royal Academy of Music, the National Library for the
Blind and the National Book League.
The university libraries of Oxford and Cambridge are unmatched by those of the
more recent foundations, although the combined library resources of the
colleges and institutions of the University of London total some 9 million
volumes, the John Rylands University Library in Manchester contains some 3-4
million volumes, Edinburgh some 2 million, Leeds some 1-8 million, and
Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Aberdeen each have over 1 million
volumes. Many universities have important research collections in special
subjects; examples include the Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham and the
British Library of Political and Economic Science at the London School of
Economics.
Many associations and commercial and industrial organisations operate library
and information services. Although most of these are primarily intended for use
within the organisation, many special libraries can be used, by arrangement, by
people interested in the area covered, and the specialist publications held are
often available for inter-library lending.
Local library authorities have a duty to provide a free lending and reference
library service in their areas. Britain's network of libraries, consisting of 5,500
service points, has a total stock of some 137 million books. About one-third of
the total population are members of public libraries. Some areas are served by
mobile libraries, and domiciliary services cater for people unable to visit a

library. Many libraries have collections of records, audio- and video-cassettes,
and musical scores for loan to the public, while a number also lend from
collections of works of art, which may be originals or reproductions. Most
libraries hold documents on local history, and nearly all provide children's
departments, while reference and information sections and art, music, commer¬
cial and technical departments meet the growing and more specific demands in
these fields. The information role is one of increasing importance for many
libraries, and they are making greater use of information technology including
microcomputers and reference data bases.
The Government is advised on library and information matters by four Library
and Information Services Councils or Committees, representing England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively.
In 1984 British publishers issued over 51,000 separate titles. Of these over
40,000 were new titles and the remainder reprints and new editions. The British
publishing industry devotes much effort to the development of overseas
markets, and exports of British books in 1984 amounted to £350 million. The
industry is also distinguished for its interest in new technological develop¬
ments, including electronic publishing and the development of software for
educational and other purposes.
Among the leading organisations representing publishing and distribution
interests are the Publishers Association, which has 400 members, and the
Booksellers Association. The Publishers Association, through its associated
body the Book Development Council, has been active in promoting the export of
British books world-wide.
The British Council publicises British books overseas through its 112
libraries in over 60 countries, participation in international book fairs and a
programme of travelling exhibitions of which over 200 toured abroad in 1984.
The Council also publishes a monthly periodical, British Book News.
The National Book League, whose membership includes authors, publishers,
booksellers, librarians and readers, encourages an interest in books and
arranges exhibitions throughout Britain.
The Press
Newspaper
Ownership
More daily newspapers, national and regional, are sold per person in Britain
than in most other developed countries. On an average day nearly three out of
four people over the age of 15 read a national morning newspaper and about one
in three reads an evening newspaper. National papers have a total circulation of
over 15-5 million on weekdays and 18-3 million on Sundays though the total
readership is considerably greater.
There are over 120 daily (Monday to Saturday) and Sunday newspapers, about
1,300 weekly newspapers (including business, sporting and religious news¬
papers) and some 6,000 periodical publications.
The press eaters for a variety of political views, interests and levels of
education. There is no state control or censorship of the press, but it is subject
to the general laws on publication (see p 406). Newspapers are almost always
financially independent of any political party and are not obliged to follow any
specific line. Where they express pronounced views and have obvious political
leanings, these derive from traditional, proprietorial and other non-party
influences. In order to preserve their character and traditions, a few newspapers
and periodicals are governed by various trustee-type arrangements. Others have
management arrangements to ensure their editors' authority and indepen¬
dence.
Against this background of press freedom, Britain, in discussions on a new
world information order' and other communications questions, has opposed
measures designed to increase governmental regulation of the media or to limit
the free flow of information. At the same time, it has reaffirmed its willingness to
support efforts to improve communications systems in the developing world,
with the International Programme for the Development of Communications (set
up in 1980) acting, as originally conceived, as a clearing house through which
each country's communications needs can be assessed and funds sought from
all possible aid sources.
Unlike most of its European counterparts the British press receives no
subsidies and relatively few tax and postal concessions. Newspaper and
magazine sales (but not advertising receipts) are zero-rated for value added tax.
Registered newspapers receive a concession on postal rates, and there are
concessions on per-word' rates for international press telegrams and photo¬
telegrams. Like all postal customers, publishers can obtain reductions in
charges for regular bulk postings.
Newsprint, some 80 per cent of which is imported, forms roughly a quarter of
average national newspaper costs, while labour represents about 45 per cent.
Revenue from sales accounts for varying proportions of income; many news¬
papers and periodicals derive considerable earnings from their advertising.
Ownership of the national, London-evening and regional daily newspapers is
concentrated in the hands of a number of large press publishing groups (the
groups controlling the national press are listed in Table 42). There are, in
addition, some 200 independent regional and local newspaper publishers.
Although most enterprises are organised as limited liability companies,
individual and partner proprietorship survives. The large national newspaper
and periodical publishers are major corporations with interests ranging over the
whole field of publishing and communications; some have shares in indepen-
400
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
dent television and radio companies while others are involved in industrial and
commercial activities.
The law provides safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentra¬
tion of the means of communication. For instance, if it appears that newspaper
shareholdings in independent television or independent local radio companies
have led or are leading to results contrary to the public interest, the Independent
Broadcasting Authority can, with the consent of the Home Secretary, notify the
companies that their programmes may cease to be transmitted. There are
similar controls over newspaper interests in cable television services. In
addition, it is unlawful to transfer a newspaper or newspaper assets to a
proprietor whose newspapers have an average daily circulation amounting, with
that of the newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or more copies without the
written consent of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Except in
certain limited cases, consent may be given only after the Secretary of State has
referred the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and received its
report.

Ten morning daily papers and eight Sunday papers (see Table 42) circulate
throughout the country, and are known as national newspapers. They are
produced in London (where Fleet Street is the traditional centre for the press),
but six of the dailies and five of the Sundays also print northern editions in
Manchester (accounting for about a quarter of the total production of the
national press). An edition of the Financial Times is also printed in Frankfurt in
the Federal Republic of Germany. Several newspapers have had very long and
distinguished histories: for example. The Observer, first published in 1791, is
the oldest national Sunday newspaper in the world, and The Times, one of the
most influential of all newspapers and Britain's oldest daily national newspaper,
celebrated its two-hundredth anniversary in 1985. There are plans for the
launch, early in 1986, of a new national newspaper to be published seven days a
week in full colour. Several other proposals for new national newspapers were
under discussion during 1985.
The leading Scottish papers. The Scotsman and the Glasgow Herald, have a
considerable circulation outside Scotland.
National newspapers are often thought of as either'quality or popular papers
on the basis of differences in style, content and format (broadsheet or tabloid,
though this is not a rigid distinction). Four dailies and three Sundays are
usually described as quality newspapers. The three Sunday qualities and three
Sunday populars produce colour supplements as part of the paper.
The slow decline in newspaper circulations as a whole was reversed in 1983
and circulation totalled 33-7 million in 1984 (compared with 36 million in
1973). This figure conceals the fact that the circulation of some newspapers has
remained generally steady, while that of others has increased.
The regional newspapers of England (outside London, 98 morning or evening
dailies and Sundays and some 950 newspapers appearing once or twice a week)
provide mainly regional and local news. The daily newspapers also give coverage
of national and international affairs. Generally, regional evening newspapers are
non-political, while the morning newspapers adopt a more positive political
stance and tend to be independent or conservative in outlook.
Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post (Leeds) and the Northern Echo
(Darlington) have circulations of over 87,400 and 89,900 respectively, and two
provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and the
Sunday Mercury (Birmingham)—sell nearly 124,000 and 172,000 copies,
respectively. Circulation figures of evening papers start at about 11,000 and
most are in the 20,000 to 90,000 range: those with much larger sales include the
Manchester Evening News and the Birmingham Evening Mail (both over
275,000), the Wolverhampton Express and Star (over 243,700), and the
Liverpool Echo (over 200,000). Weekly papers are of mainly local appeal and are
also a valuable medium for local advertising. Most have circulations in the 5,000
to 30,000 range.
There is currently one London evening newspaper. The London Standard,
with a circulation of some 503,900: plans have been announced lor the launch
of a new evening paper, to be called The London Post. A number ot evening
newspapers are published in the outer metropolitan area. The hundred or so
local weeklies include papers for every district in Greater London, often in the
form of local editions of an individual paper.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in Cardiil:
its circulation of just over 77,000 is mainly in south Wales. In north Wales the
Daily Post, published in Liverpool, gives wide coverage to events in the area.
Evening papers published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff; the South
Wales Argus, Newport: the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea: and the Evening

Leader, Wrexham. Their circulation range is between 43.000 and 99,000. North
Wales is also served by the Liverpool Echo, while the Shropshire Star covers
parts of north and mid-Wales, and there is coverage to a smaller extent by the
Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (some 60 publications) includes English-language papers,
some of which carry articles in Welsh, bilingual papers, and Welsh-language
papers. Welsh community newspapers receive an annual grant as part of the
Government's wider financial support for the Welsh language.
Scotland has seven morning, five evening and three Sunday newspapers. The
morning papers, with circulations of between about 94,000 and over 765,000,
are The Scotsman, published in Edinburgh; the Glasgow Herald-, the Daily
Record (sister paper to The Mirror)-, the Dundee Courier and Advertiser: the
Aberdeen Press and Journal: the Paisley Daily Express: and the Scottish Daily
Express (printed in Manchester). The evening papers have circulations in the
range of about 12,000 to over 176,000 and are the Evening News of Edinburgh,
Glasgows Evening Times, Dundee's Evening Telegraph & Post, Aberdeen's
Evening Express and the Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the
Sunday Mail, the Sunday Post and the Scottish Sunday Express (printed in
Manchester).
Weekly and local newspapers number about 130, with the Hamilton Advertiser
and the Falkirk Herald having the largest circulations.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening and one Sunday
paper, all published in Belfast with circulations ranging from 44,000 to
147,000. They are the News Letter (unionist) and the Irish News (nationalist),
the evening Belfast Telegraph and the Sunday News. There are 42 weeklies.
More than 70 newspapers and magazines are produced by members of the
ethnic minorities, over 40 of which are printed in Asian languages and the rest
in English. Most are published weekly or monthly. They include the Asian
newspapers New Life and Asian Times, The Weekly Gleaner—a local edition of
the Jamaican Gleaner, and West Indian World. The Voice and Caribbean Times
are aimed at the black population in general as is the magazine Root. An Arabic
daily, Al-Arab, is also produced in Britain.
Some 730 free distribution newspapers (mostly weekly and financed largely by
advertising) are now published in Britain, just over half of them produced by
established newspaper publishers. They have enjoyed rapid growth in recent
years and now have an estimated total weekly circulation of some 30 million.
Europe's first daily free distribution paper, the Daily News, was launched in
Birmingham in 1984.
The 6,000 periodical publications are classified as 'general', ‘specialised', ‘trade',
‘technical' and ‘professional’. There are also about 500 house magazines'
produced by industrial undertakings, business houses or public services for the
benefit of their employees and/or clients. The ‘alternative' press probably
includes several hundred further titles, most of them devoted to radical polities,
community matters, religion, the occult, science or ecology.
General and specialised periodicals include magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals; fiction
magazines; magazines dealing with sport, motoring, gardening, pop music,
hobbies and humour; computer magazines; journals specialising in a wide
range of subjects; and the publications of learned societies, trade unions,
regiments, universities and other organisations.

News Agencies
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Radio Times and TV Times
Magazine, which carry details of the week s television and radio programmes on
BBC and independent television, respectively, each of which has a circulation of
about 3-3 million, and Woman's Weekly, Woman's Own, Woman, Weekly News
(which sells mainly in Scotland) and My Weekly, with circulations in the 750,000
to 1-5 million range. The leading journals of opinion are The Economist, a
politically independent publication covering a wider range of topics than its title
implies; the New Statesman, which reviews politics, literature and the arts from
an independent socialist point of view; the Spectator, which covers much the
same subjects from an independent conservative standpoint; Tribune, which
represents certain left-wing views within the Labour Party; New Society,
covering the sociological aspects of current affairs; and New Scientist, which
reports on science and technology in terms which the non-speeialist can
understand. Articles and features relating largely to BBC television and radio
programmes appear in The Listener. Punch, traditionally the leading humorous
periodical, and Private Eye, a satirical fortnightly, also cover public affairs.
Financial Weekly and Investors Chronicle are periodicals for people with
business and investment interests.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, generally appeal to the
more serious reader.
Trade, technical, business, scientific and professional journals are an
important aspect of British publishing, many having a considerable circulation
overseas. Their publication ranges in frequency from twice weekly to quarterly.
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout Britain. In Wales there
are also several monthly and quarterly journals published in both Welsh and
English; in Scotland there are three monthly illustrated periodicals, a weekly
paper devoted to farming interests, a number of literary journals and numerous
popular magazines; and Northern Ireland has weekly, monthly and quarterly
publications covering business, professional and leisure interests.
The heavy labour costs of newspapers and periodicals continue to encourage
publishers to look for ways of increasing productivity, often by using computer
systems to control editing and production processes. The ‘front end' or single
stroking' system, for example, allows journalists or advertising staff to input
‘copy’ directly into a video terminal, and then by pressing a button to transform
it automatically into computer-set columns of type. These columns can then be
assembled electronically on a page-sized screen, turned into a full page, and
made automatically into a plate ready for transfer to the printing press. Such
systems present opportunities for reorganisation which have implications
throughout a newspaper office and often give rise to disputes over manning
levels and other industrial relations problems.
Approximately half of the national Sunday newspapers and two dailies now
use some computer technology, while its use in the provincial press, which has
generally led the way in adopting new techniques, is more widespread.
Other technological developments include the planned introduction by some
newspaper publishers of full-colour printing, and a switch from traditional
letterpress printing to the web-offset litho process.
The three principal news agencies in Britain are: Reuters, an international news
organisation registered in London, The Press Association and The Exchange
Telegraph Company.
Following the sale of shares in the company in mid-1984, Reuters is now a
publicly owned company, employing some 4,100 full-time stafl in 78 countries.

in 158 countries including news agencies, newspapers, radio and television
stations, governments, financial institutions, stock and commodity brokerage
houses, and industry.
In January 1985 Reuters launched its own world service of news pictures,
having in the previous year acquired the news pictures business outside the
United States of United Press International, the American news agency.
The Press Association Ltd, the British national news agency, is co-operatively
owned by the principal newspapers of the United Kingdom outside London, and
of the Irish Republic. It provides to national and regional newspapers
and broadcasting services a complete service of home news, including general
and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all types of financial, commercial and
sports news, and includes in its services to regional papers the world news of
Reuters and Associated Press. News is teleprinted from London, certain items
being available in teletypesetting form. Its ‘Newsfile’ service provides general
home news on screen to non-media as well as media clients by means of
telephone and viewdata terminals. The photographic department provides
newspapers and broadcasters with a daily service of pictures from Britain and
overseas; these are wired to the regional press. The Special Reporting Service
supplies reports of local or special interest. Press Association Features provides
exclusive rights to syndicated articles and visual features.
The Exchange Telegraph Company supplies financial and sporting news
services and transmits specialist racing services by telephone and video
terminals from offices throughout Britain.
The British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by Associ¬
ated Press Ltd and United Press International, which are British subsidiaries of
United States news agencies.
A number of other British, Commonwealth and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are minor agencies in other cities,
mostly specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in Britain as in some
countries, but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which represents
the principal press organisations, sets and conducts examinations, and
organises short training courses for journalists.
The two methods of entry into newspaper journalism are selection for a
one-year NCTJ pre-entry course at a college of further education or direct
recruitment by a regional or local newspaper. Both categories of entrant take
part in an apprenticeship scheme consisting of ‘on-the-job" training, and
block-release courses are provided for those who have not attended a pre-entry
course. There are similar courses for press photographers. Postgraduate courses
in journalism are provided at University College, Cardiff, and at the City
University (London), and courses are provided by the Newspaper Society
Training Service for regional newspapers in such subjects as circulation,
advertising, industrial relations and management.
Training courses for senior journalists from over 90 countries are run by the
Thomson Foundation in London, which also provides consultants to assist
newspapers in every facet of their operations, including the introduction and
operation of new technology.

Courses in periodical journalism are becoming increasingly popular. The
postgraduate courses in journalism at Cardiff and the City University now offer
periodical journalism options, and courses for graduates and school leavers with
the General Certificate of Education at Advanced level are also offered by the
London College of Printing. In addition, all the larger publishing houses provide
in-company training in which formal lectures supplement work experience. A
training scheme in operation throughout the periodical publishing industry is
administered by the Periodical Training Trust.
Under the Harry Brittain Memorial Fellowship Scheme, administered by the
Commonwealth Press Union, several young Commonwealth journalists each
year spend three months working and studying in Britain, while the Reuter
Foundation, established in 1982, awards several fellowships each year to
journalists from developing countries to study information technology at Oxford
University.
Annual Student Media Awards are presented jointly by The Guardian
newspaper and the National Union of Students to students in higher education
who have excelled in college press, television and radio journalism.
The most important employers' organisations are the Newspaper Publishers
Association, whose members publish national newspapers in London and
Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which represents the regional, local and
London suburban press; the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society, which repre¬
sents the interests of daily and Sunday newspapers in Scotland; the Scottish
Newspaper Proprietors' Association, which represents the owners of weekly
newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers, whose
members are the proprietors of weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland; and the
Periodical Publishers Association, whose membership embraces the majority of
independent publishers of business, professional and consumer journals.
Organisations representing journalists are the National Union of Journalists,
with nearly 33,000 members, and the Institute of Journalists, with over 2,000
members. All practising journalists (including those engaged in radio, tele¬
vision, public relations, freelance journalism and book publishing editorial
work) are eligible for membership of either, but not both. Two main printing
unions are concerned with the press: the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades
(SOGAT) '82, with over 225,000 members, and the National Graphical Associa¬
tion 1982, with some 131,000 members, about 45,000 of whom work on
newspapers.
The Guild of British Newspaper Editors is the officially recognised profes¬
sional body for newspaper editors. It has approximately 450 members and aims
to maintain the professional status and independence of editors, defend the
freedom of the press, and improve the education and training of journalists. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong. A new body, the Association of
British Editors, representing the whole range of media including radio,
television, newspapers and magazines, was founded in 1984.
The main aim of the Foreign Press Association, founded in 1888, is to help the
correspondents of overseas newspapers in their work by arranging press
conferences, tours, briefings and a range of other facilities.
The Press Council is a voluntary and non-statutory body founded by the
newspaper industry in 1953 to safeguard the freedom of the press and to ensure
that it conducts itself responsibly. It comprises equal numbers of press and
non-press members, including members of the public, with an independent
chairman. Its full aims are: to preserve the established freedom of the press; to
maintain the character of the press in accordance with the highest professional
406

and commercial standards; to keep under review any developments likely to
restrict the supply of information of public interest and importance; to deal with
complaints about the conduct of the press or the conduct of individuals and
organisations towards the press; to report on developments in the press which
may tend towards greater concentration or monopoly; to make representations
on appropriate occasions to the Government, the United Nations and press
organisations abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodic reports record¬
ing its work; and to review from time to time developments in the press and the
factors affecting them.
Dealing with complaints from the public about the content and conduct of the
press is the Council s best-known function. It has no power to impose penalties
on publications which it has found guilty of malpractice, but relies on the
sanction of adverse publicity. It can censure newspapers, magazines, editors
and journalists, and issues adjudications which the editor of the newspaper or
magazine criticised by the Council has a moral obligation to publish in full. The
Council sometimes initiates inquiries into aspects of press conduct without first
receiving public complaints. Its annual reports include press statistics and
articles on the structure of leading press groups.
Advertising practice in the press (and in the cinema and on posters) is regulated
and controlled by the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body
which aims to promote and enforce the highest standards of advertising in the
interests of the public and the industry, in particular through the British Code
of Advertising Practice. The aims of the code are to ensure that advertisements
are legal, decent, honest and truthful; that they are prepared with a sense of
responsibility to the consumer; that they conform to the principles of fair
competition as generally accepted in business; and that no advertisement brings
advertising into disrepute or reduces confidence in advertising as a service to
industry and the public.
The Authority's main activities are to monitor advertisements for their
compliance with the code; to initiate or improve modifications to the code; and
to deal with complaints received direct from members of the public. Its main
sanction is the recommendation to media that advertisements considered to be
in breach of the code should not be published. It also publishes regular reports
on the results of its investigations, naming the companies involved.
The press has generally the same freedom as the individual to comment on
matters of public interest.
Apart from legal requirements to register newspapers and periodicals and to
reproduce ‘the printer's imprint' (the printer's name and place of publication),
there are no specific press laws, but certain statutes include sections which
apply to the press. These relate to such matters as the extent of newspaper
ownership in television and radio companies; the transfer of newspaper assets;
restrictions on the reporting of certain types of court proceedings; the right of
press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local authorities; restrictions
on the publication of advertisement and investment circulars (which are
governed by Acts dealing with the publication of false or misleading descriptions
of goods and services and with fraud) and of advertisements for remedies for
certain diseases, which are covered by public health legislation; agreements
between British Telecom and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic communica¬
tions, which must comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions on certain
types of prize competition; and copyrights, which come under copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the press are laws such as those on contempt of
court, official secrets, libel and defamation. A newspaper may not publish
comments on the conduct of judicial proceedings which are likely to prejudice
THE PRESS

the courts’ reputation for fairness before or during the actual proceedings, nor
may it publish before or during a trial anything which might tend to influence
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and publication of information of a
confidential or security nature from state and official sources is an offence under
the Official Secrets Act 1911. Newspapers are also liable to proceedings for
seditious libel and incitement to disaffection. The majority of legal proceedings
against the press are libel actions brought by private individuals. In such cases,
the editor, proprietor, publishers, printer and distributor of the newspaper, as
well as the author, may all be held responsible.
In certain circumstances, where the defence authorities and press representa¬
tives in the Defence, Press and Broadcasting Committee1 agree that publication
of information on particular topics would harm the national interest, defence
notices (‘D’ notices) are circulated to the news media requesting that such
information should not be published. Compliance with these requests is
expected, but they have no legal force; the final responsibility for the decision
whether to publish lies solely with the editor or publisher concerned.

senior civil servant), composed jointly of officials from government departments concerned with
national security and representatives of the press and broadcasting organisations.
23 Television
and Radio
Broadcasting is based on the tradition that it is a public service accountable to
the people through Parliament. Two public bodies—the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA)—provide
television and radio services throughout the country. In Wales the Welsh Fourth
Channel Authority is responsible for programmes on one channel. The
authorities work to broad requirements and objectives defined by Parliament,
but are otherwise independent in the day-to-day conduct of business.
This independence carries with it certain obligations over programmes and
programme content. Programmes must display, as far as possible, a proper
balance and wide range of subject matter, impartiality in matters of controversy
and accuracy in news coverage, and must not offend against good taste. Codes oi
guidance on violence in television programmes, particularly during hours when
large numbers of children are likely to be viewing, are operated by both
authorities. A code of advertising standards and practice is also operated by the
IBA. (The BBC does not broadcast advertisements.) A complaints commission
deals with allegations of unfair treatment or infringement of privacy in
programmes. Publicly available video recordings are classified according to their
suitability for different audiences.
The Home Secretary regulates broadcasting generally, is answerable to
Parliament on broad policy questions, and may issue directions on a number of
technical and other matters.
Television viewing is by far the most popular leisure pastime in Britain,
average viewing time per person being about 21 hours a week. Virtually everyone
has access to television. Some 35 per cent of households have two or more
receivers. The growth in use of video-cassette recorders and equipment
(including home computers) for playing television games has for many people
increased the choice of entertainment available in the home. (About 25 per cent
of households rent or own a video-cassette recorder.) Practically every home also
has a radio set, and car radios and portable sets have made radio a major
daytime diversion.
Households with television must buy an annual licence costing £18 for black
and white or £58 for colour. Over 18-6 million licences were current in February
1985, about 15-7 million for colour.
The British The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by Royal Charter and by
Broadcasting a Licence and Agreement. The Corporation of 12 governors including the
Corporation Chairman (each appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Government and
including separate governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) is finally
responsible for all aspects of broadcasting. Committees advise them on a wide
range of matters including the social effects of television, religious broadcasting,
music, agriculture, schools broadcasting, further education, programmes for
ethnic minorities, science and engineering, and charitable appeals. The
governors appoint the Director-General, the Corporation's chief executive
officer, who heads the BBC’s board of management, which is in charge of the
daily operation of the services.

The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
control the policy and content of television and radio programmes intended
primarily for reception in their areas. Local radio councils, representative of the
local community, advise on the development and operation of the BBC's local
radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally from the sale of
television licences. This is supplemented by profits from trading activities,
including television programme exports, sale of recordings and publications
connected with BBC programmes, hire and sale of educational films, film library
sales, and exhibitions based on programmes. Nearly three-quarters of expendi¬
ture on domestic services relates to television. The BBC meets the cost of its local
radio stations while some local education authorities help to make educational
programmes. The desirability of financing some or all of the BBC’s domestic
services through advertising or by means other than the present licence fee is
the subject of an inquiry set up in early 1985.
The BBC's External Services are financed by a grant-in-aid from the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office, determined each year by the Government.
The IBA's constitution and finances are governed by statute. Its 12 members
(three of whom have responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) are
appointed by the Home Secretary. The IBA does not produce radio or television
programmes; these are provided by independent programme companies and by
the Channel Four Television Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of the IBA) for
Channel 4 (see p 411). The IBA's main functions are to appoint the companies,
supervise programme arrangements, control advertising and build, own and
operate transmitting stations. Its chief executive officer, the Director-General, is
supported by a headquarters and regional office staff covering all technical and
administrative services.
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broadcasting,
religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist panel
advises on advertisements of a medical nature. Local committees advise on local
radio services.
The IBA's finance comes from annual rental payments made by the television
and radio programme companies. The television and independent local radio
programme companies are also liable to pay to the IBA, for transfer to
government funds, a levy related to their profits.
Fifteen television programme companies hold contracts to provide television
programmes in the 14 independent television regions (two companies share the
contract for London, one providing programmes during the week and the other
at the weekend). A contract to provide a national early morning television
service, transmitted on the ITV network, is held by an additional company. The
companies operate on a commercial basis, deriving most of their revenue from
the sale of advertising time. The financial resources, advertising revenue and
programme production of the companies vary considerably, depending largely
on the size of population in the areas in which they operate. Although
newspapers can acquire an interest in programme companies, there are
safeguards to protect the public interest.
In consultation with the IBA, each company plans the content of the
programmes to be broadcast in its area. These are produced by the company
itself and by other programme companies or bought from elsewhere. The five
largest companies, serving London, north-west England, East Midlands, West
Midlands and Yorkshire, provide more programmes for broadcast elsewhere on
the national network than do the smaller ones. A common news service is
TELEVISION AND RADIO
411
Television
provided by Independent Television News Ltd, a non-profit-making company in
which all the programme companies are shareholders. Negotiations tor the
supply, exchange and purchase of programmes and their co-ordinated transmis¬
sion through the independent television network take place largely on the
Network Programme Committee, which consists of representatives oi all the
programme companies and of the IBA.
Similar principles apply to independent local radio. The programme com¬
panies are under contract to the IBA, operate under its control and are financed
by advertising revenue. News coverage is supplied as a common service by
Independent Radio News.
Four television channels are in operation. BBC 1 and BBC 2 are owned by the
BBC; ITV (Independent Television) is controlled by, and Channel 4 is owned by,
the IBA; all four channels broadcast on 625 lines ultra-high frequency (uhl).
About 99 per cent of the population (over 97 per cent for Channel 4) live within
range of transmission.
Apart from a break during the second world war the BBC has been providing
regular television broadcasts since 1936. All BBC 2 programmes and the vast
majority of those on BBC 1 are broadcast on the national network. Approxi¬
mately 70 per cent of the BBC's network programmes for 1984-85 were pro¬
duced in London and 30 per cent elsewhere in Britain.
Through co-ordinated planning on its two services the BBC caters simul¬
taneously for people of different interests. While both services cover the whole
range of television output, BBC 1 presents more programmes ol general
interest, such as light entertainment, sport, current affairs, children s program¬
mes and outside broadcasts, while BBC 2 places greater emphasis on minority
interests, but also provides documentaries, travel programmes, serious drama,
music, programmes on pastimes and international lilms. An early morning
television service on BBC 1 provides about 2’/2 hours ol news, information and
light entertainment. The service runs from Monday to Friday.
The first regular independent television programmes began in London in
1955. On average each of the 14 ITV areas transmitted over 100 hours of
television programmes a week in 1984—85, nearly two-fifths of them comprising
informative programmes—including news, documentaries, and programmes on
current affairs, education and religion. Almost three-quarters of the program¬
mes are produced by the programme companies. A national early morning
television service on ITV provides three hours of news, information, current
affairs and light entertainment daily.
Channel 4, which began broadcasting in November 1982, provides a national
television service throughout Britain, except in Wales which has a correspond¬
ing service (Sianel 4 Cymru—S4C—see below). The IBA must ensure that
programmes on Channel 4 are complementary to those of ITV, catering lor
tastes and interests not normally provided for by the original independent
service. It must provide a suitable proportion (about 15 per cent) of educational
programmes, encourage innovation and experiment, and include a substantial
proportion of programmes from independent producers. Channel 4 broadcasts
for over 70 hours a week, about half of which is devoted to informative
programmes. The service, both nationally and in Wales, is financed by
subscriptions from the programme companies in return lor advertising time in
Channel 4 programmes broadcast in their own regions. In Wales, programmes
on the fourth channel are run and controlled by the Welsh Fourth Channel
Authority appointed by the Home Secretary. The Authority is required to ensuu
that a substantial proportion (some 22 hours a week) ol the programmes are in
Welsh and that programmes broadcast between 18.30 and 22.00 hours arc

mainly in Welsh. At other times the Welsh fourth channel shows national
Channel 4 programmes.
Britain is one ol the world s foremost exporters of television productions,
exporting in 1983 programmes worth roughly £77-5 million; many of these have
won international awards. In 1984 these included the first prizes in all five
programme categories in the International Emmy Awards in the United States,
the top award for comedy at the Montreux International Television Festival, first
and second prizes in both the drama and music categories at the Prix Italia
Television Festival, and blue ribbons in three subject categories at the American
Film Festival in New York.
Until recently, about 12-3 per cent of households with television sets have
received their television services by cable. The vast majority of cable systems
have been used solely to relay broadcast television and radio services in order to
improve reception quality, to avoid ‘screening’ by buildings or the local
topography, or because external aerials are not allowed on some residential
buildings.
Legislation has been passed to allow a much more general expansion of cable
television. It is intended that cable investment should be privately financed; that
regulation should be as light as possible to allow the development of a wide range
of services and facilities, and flexible enough to adapt to changing technology;
and that there should be certain safeguards for existing broadcasting services. A
new national Cable Authority has been established to issue licences, supervise
programme services and promote cable development. Licences have been
awarded to 11 cable systems which will serve as pilot projects, and some of the
existing cable operators, formerly relaying broadcast services, have been
licensed to offer additional services on their existing systems. In early 1985 the
Cable Authority invited a further five applications for cable franchises, and
invitations for a further ten are expected shortly.
By mid-1985 the number of homes capable of receiving non-broadcast cable
services was 872,965. The number of homes receiving such services was
132,454. Cable operators are represented by the Cable Television Association.
BBC Radio has four national channels. Radio 1 broadcasts rock and pop music,
while Radio 2 provides music and light entertainment as well as being the
principal channel for the coverage of sport. Radio 3 broadcasts mainly serious
music as well as drama, poetry and short stories, talks and documentaries, and
Test Match cricket (on medium wave only). Radio 4 is the main speech network,
providing the principal news and information service, as well as drama, comedy
shows and panel games; it also carries parliamentary coverage and live relays of
major public events. At present, there is no independent national radio service,
but legislation passed in 1984 has given the IBA the power to start building a
transmitter network for a service which should be in operation by 1990.
There are 31 BBC local radio stations serving England and the Channel
Islands, and regional radio services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as
well as 48 ILR (independent local radio) stations distributed throughout Britain.
Further BBC and ILR stations are planned. About 90 per cent of the population
is served by BBC or independent local radio stations. Broadcasts provide a
comprehensive service of local news and information, music and other
entertainment, education, consumer advice and coverage of local events, and
offer listeners a chance to air their views, often by using the phone-in technique.
There are also some 200 hospital and some 20 university closed-circuit radio
stations.
Educational
Broadcasting
Both the BBC and the IBA broadcast educational programmes for children and
students in schools of all kinds, as well as for pre-school children, and for adults

in colleges and other institutions and in their homes. Broadcasts to schools
cover most subjects of the curriculum, while education programmes for adults
cover many fields of learning, vocational training and recreation. Supporting
material in the form of books, pamphlets, filmstrips, computer software, and
audio and video cassettes, is available to supplement the programmes. The BBC
broadcasts television and radio programmes made especially for students of the
Open University, most of whose 130 undergraduate courses contain video and
audio components, some of them available on cassette tor use with correspon
dence texts. The BBC Open University Centre also produces educational and
training audio-visual materials in collaboration with external agencies such as
the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of Education and
Science and the Engineering Industry Training Board.
The BBC External Services broadcast by radio world-wide, using English and 36
other languages, for over 720 hours a week. The main objectives are to give
unbiased news, reflect British opinion and project British life, culture and
developments in science and industry. News bulletins, current affairs program¬
mes, political commentaries and topical magazine programmes form the main
part of the output, with a full sports service, music, drama and general
entertainment.
The languages in which the External Services broadcast and the length of time
each is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart from this the BBC
has full responsibility and is completely independent in determining the content
of news and other programmes. A plan to improve audibility is in progress.
The BBC World Service broadcasts for 24 hours a day in English and is
supplemented at peak listening times by programmes of special interest to
Africa, South Asia and the Falkland Islands.
BBC news bulletins and other programmes are re-broadcast by the radio
services of many countries. Re-broadcasting involves direct relays from BBC
transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through the BBC
Transcription Service. There are some 3,000 re-broadcasts weekly of World
Service programmes in about 150 countries. The Transcription Service offers
programmes to over 100 countries.
The BBC's English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive
language teaching undertaking in the world. English lessons are broadcast
weekly by radio with explanations in 30 other languages, and recorded lessons
are supplied to 300 stations in 90 countries free of charge. English by Television
programmes are shown in more than 80 countries. There is a wide range of
printed and audio material accompanying these programmes.
Another part of the External Services, the Monitoring Service, listens to and
reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news and
comment from overseas to the BBC, the press and the Government.
Radio for overseas is also produced by the radio services of the Central Office of
Information (COI). A wide range of recorded material is sent to radio stations in
95 countries. COI television services provide material such as documentary and
magazine programmes for distribution to overseas stations.
The BBC does not give publicity to any firm or organised interest except when it
is necessary to provide effective and inlormative programmes. It must not
broadcast any commercial advertisement or any sponsored programme.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television but advertisers can
have no influence on programme content or editorial control. Advertisements
must be clearly distinguishable and separate from programmes, and the time
given to them must not be so great as to detract from the value oi the pro¬
grammes as a medium of information, education or entertainment. Adveitising

is normally limited to seven minutes in any one hour of broadcasting time, and
averaged over the day s programmes must not exceed six minutes per hour. The
independent local radio stations are normally limited to a maximum of nine
minutes of advertising each hour. The IBA has a code governing standards and
practice in advertising on television and radio and giving guidance on the types
and methods of advertisement which are prohibited; this includes advertising
with a political or religious object or on behalf of cigarettes or betting.
Advertisements may not be inserted in certain types of programme, such as
broadcasts to schools. A comparable code will be adopted by the Cable Authority,
which will be responsible for advertising control and policy on cable television.
The IBA has endorsed the Principles for Advertising by Direct Satellite
Broadcasting which have been drawn up by the European Broadcasting Union.
The Government has no general privileged access to radio or television but
government publicity material to support non-political campaigns may be
broadcast on independent radio and television. This is prepared through
the COI and broadcast and paid for on a normal commercial basis. Short
public service items, concerning health, safety and welfare, are also produced by
the COI for free transmission by the BBC and independent television and
radio.
Parliamentary reporting includes a daily factual and impartial account of
proceedings in Parliament. Proceedings, including those of committees, are
broadcast on radio, some live and others in recorded form in radio and television
news and current affairs programmes. Parliament is not normally televised:
however, following a vote in the House of Lords in favour of televising some of its
proceedings, a six-month broadcasting experiment was introduced in the Lords
in January 1985 and later extended.
Ministerial and party political broadcasts are transmitted periodically on radio
and television, under rules agreed between the major political parties, the BBC
and the IBA, and there are special arrangements for the period following the
announcement of a general election.
Both the BBC and the IBA are required to keep themselves informed on the state
of public opinion about the programmes (and, in the case of the IBA, the
advertising) they broadcast. This is done through the continuous measurement
of the size and composition of audiences and their opinions of programmes. For
television, this work is undertaken through the Broadcasters' Audience
Research Board, which is owned jointly by the BBC and the IBA. Information is
collected from a panel of about 3,000 homes throughout the country designed to
be representative of all private households in Britain with a television set. Meters
attached to each television set and linked to a central computer are used to
record times of viewing, numbers of viewers and programmes watched. Regular
surveys and questionnaires are conducted by both the BBC and the IBA to gauge
audience opinion on television and radio services, and public opinion is further
assessed by both bodies through the work of their many advisory committees,
councils and panels whose members are drawn from a wide cross-section of the
public; through the regular holding of public meetings to debate the services
provided; and through the careful consideration of correspondence and
telephone calls from listeners and viewers.
One of the most important recent developments has been the introduction of
smaller, lighter cameras and video recorders for use on location. Electronic
news-gathering equipment, whereby pictures can be transmitted directly to a
studio or recorded on video tape on location, reduces significantly the time
before an item can be broadcast. Other developments include the use of new
TELEVISION AND RADIO
415
International
Relations
types of video tape recorders, the increasing use of computers to generate
graphical shapes such as captions and credits, and the improvement of the
quality of video tape pictures.
Recent developments by the BBC include the ACE digital television standards
converter, probably the most advanced in the world, which is used to convert
pictures between the European and American standards. Another BBC develop¬
ment is the NICAM system used to carry high-quality sound programme signals
across the country. Both of these systems have been licensed to commercial
manufacturers. The BBC has also developed a data-labelling system for sound
programmes which will make programme and station selection much easier.
Research includes investigations into stereo sound for television, digital
transmission of signals over fibre-optic cables, improved picture displays, and
many aspects of satellite broadcasting. IBA engineers were the first in the world
to introduce a fully digital field rate standards converter to improve the
interchange of programmes between areas using the 525-line system and those
using the 625-line system. Current IBA research projects include the further
development of digital techniques for studio applications and inter-city links,
and a study of the future use of satellites for broadcasting which has included
the development of a new C-MAC transmission system for use on future direct
broadcast satellites. C-MAC has been accepted by the Government as the United
Kingdom satellite transmission standard, and during 1983 was recommended
by the European Broadcasting Union as the standard for Europe.
A further IBA development has been an enhanced C-MAC system for satellite
transmission capable of providing wide-screen pictures at a subjective definition
of about 1,000 lines, fully compatible with C-MAC transmissions and capable of
being transmitted in a single 27-MHz satellite channel.
By the late 1980s direct broadcasting by satellite, by which television pictures
are transmitted directly from space into people’s homes, could be available
throughout Britain. The Government has paved the way for a consortium to be
set up involving the BBC, the IBA and other commercial interests. This would
start services on three of the five satellite channels allocated to the United
Kingdom by international agreement.
The BBC and IBA have co-operated in the development of a teletext system,
known by the BBC as CEEFAX and the IBA as ORACLE. The use of teletext
allows the television signal to carry additional information which can be selected
and displayed as pages’ of text and graphics on receivers equipped with the
necessary decoders. The system is also used to provide programme subtitles,
which are of great benefit to the deaf and hard of hearing. Over 2 million
teletext-equipped sets are in use in Britain. Over 95 per cent of teletext sets
throughout the world are based on the British system, and working services
operating to the British standard are in use or on trial in 13 countries, including
Australia, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States. British
Telecom’s public viewdata service, ‘Prestel’, offers a wide range of information
which is transmitted via the telephone and viewed on the screen of a television
receiver.
The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union. This body
manages Eurovision, the international network of television news and program¬
me exchange, and is responsible for the technical and administrative arrange¬
ments for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes and news over the
Eurovision network and intercontinental satellite links: it also maintains a
technical monitoring station where frequency measurements and other observa¬
tions on broadcasting stations are carried out. The Union also provides a forum
linking the major public services and national broadcasters of Western Europe
416
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and other parts of the world and co-ordinates co-operation in radio and
television.
The BBC is a shareholder in Visnews, which supplies world newsfilm to 425
television stations in 100 countries and is the most widely used newsfilm agency
in the world. Worldwide Television News is owned by Independent Television
News, the American Broadcasting Company and Channel 9 in Australia, and
supplies services to over 500 broadcasters in 75 countries via the Eurovision
network, and by satellite.
The BBC and the IBA are associate members of the Asian Pacific Broadcasting
Union, and the BBC also belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Associa¬
tion (CBA), whose members extend to one another such facilities as the use of
studios, recording channels and programme contributions. The Director-
General of the BBC was elected President of the CBA in 1984. The BBC also
provides technical aid, particularly in training the staff of other broadcasting
organisations throughout the world; members of the BBC’s staff are seconded
for service overseas.
The Government finances a number of overseas students on broadcasting
training courses at the BBC, the British Council (which aims to promote a wider
knowledge of Britain and the English language abroad and to develop closer
cultural relations between Britain and other countries) and the Thomson
Foundation Television College in Glasgow, which sends lecturers and arranges
courses overseas.
The BBC and the IBA participate in the work of the International Telecom¬
munications Union, the United Nations agency responsible for regulating and
controlling all international telecommunications services (including radio and
television), for allocating and registering all radio frequencies and for promoting
and co-ordinating the international study of technical problems in broadcast-
ing. The BBC and the IBA are also represented on the United Kingdom
Committee of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference. The
BBC maintains a number of offices overseas.
24 Sport and
Recreation
ORGANISATION
AND
PROMOTION
The British invented and codified the rules of many of the sports and games
which are now played all over the world, and there is widespread interest in most
kinds of sport throughout the country. Large crowds attend occasions such as
the association football Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, the international rugby
matches at Twickenham, Murrayfield and Cardiff Arms Park, the Wimbledon
lawn tennis championships, the classic horse races. Grand Prix motor racing
and the cricket Test matches. Extensive coverage of sport on television has
helped to generate interest in a wide variety of sports including basketball,
darts, snooker, ice skating, skiing and athletics.
Levels of participation in sport have been rising due mainly to the increases in
leisure time and facilities, greater mobility and rising living standards. A
growing awareness of the importance to good health of regular exercise has been
reflected in the upsurge of interest in jogging and marathon running. It has
been estimated that about one-third of the adult population regularly takes part
in outdoor sport, and about a quarter in indoor sport. Men greatly outnumber
women in active sport.
The Government has long recognised the importance of physical recreation for
the general welfare of the community; the social role that sport can play has
become more important at a time of high unemployment and rapid change in
work and leisure patterns. The ten-year strategy for the development of sport in
England drawn up by the Sports Council in 1982 is to encourage further
increases in participation, especially among young people and those nearing
retirement; to provide adequate facilities for the whole community, especially in
the inner cities and in deprived rural areas; and to continue to encourage high
standards of performance. Similar strategies are being followed by the Sports
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A recent priority has been to
increase the community use of schools and other sports facilities previously
closed to the public.
In accordance with the statement on apartheid in sport, agreed by the
Commonwealth heads of Government at Gleneagles in Scotland in 1977, the
Government seeks to discourage sporting contacts with South Africa and
withholds any form of support for such contacts; in a free society, however, it
cannot prevent these contacts if an individual sportsman or the governing body
of the sport concerned chooses to ignore its advice.
Government policy on sport, active recreation and children's play is co-ordinated
by the Minister for Sport (a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the
Department of the Environment). The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland have similar responsibilities in their countries. Responsi¬
bility for the organisation and promotion of sport is largely decentralised, and
most sports and recreation facilities are provided by local authorities.
The Government provides financial and other assistance through a number of
official bodies and schemes. This ‘arm's length' principle of funding safeguards

the long-established independence of sports organisations in Britain. Some of
these bodies, such as the Sports Councils and the Countryside Commissions,
have specific responsibilities for sport and recreation, and help other public and
private bodies to provide facilities. Others, like the Forestry Commission, the
British Waterways Board, the Nature Conservancy Council and the regional
water authorities, provide recreational amenities in addition to their main
functions.
Individual sports are run by over 200 independent governing bodies whose
functions usually include drawing up rules, holding events, regulating mem¬
bership, selecting and training national teams and promoting international
links. There are also organisations representing people who take part in more
informal physical recreation, such as walking and cycling.
Government assistance for the development of sport in Great Britain is
channelled through three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England
and for general matters affecting Britain as a whole), the Sports Council for
Wales and the Scottish Sports Council. (In Northern Ireland the Department of
Education makes direct grants towards the capital cost of facilities to local
authorities and voluntary sports bodies. The Sports Council has limited
grant-making powers.) The Councils allocate government funds amounting to
some £37-5 million in 1985—86. They make grants for sports development,
coaching and administration to the governing bodies of sports and other
national organisations, and administer the national sports centres. Grants and
loans are also made to voluntary organisations and local authorities (and, in
some cases, to commercial organisations), to assist the provision of sports
facilities. In all, the Councils supported over 1,000 projects in 1984—85. The
Councils assist British representatives at international sports meetings and
encourage links with international and overseas organisations. They also have
information centres providing data on a wide range of sports topics. The Sports
Council consults with the Central Council of Physical Recreation, comprising
members of the national governing and representative bodies of sport and
physical recreation in England; the equivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are the Scottish and Welsh Sports Associations and the
Northern Ireland Council of Physical Recreation.
Ten regional councils for sport and recreation in England, on each of which
sporting, countryside and local authority interests are represented, advise on
investment in and the planning of sporting facilities.
The growing problem of drug abuse in sport in order to achieve unfair
improvements in performance has been a cause of concern both to the Sports
Councils and to the governing bodies of sport. A campaign to tackle the problem,
launched by the Sports Council, has included a programme of research and the
introduction in 25 sports of random drug-testing procedures which can lead to a
life ban for offending competitors. In 1985 the Council announced its intention
to impose financial and other sanctions against those governing bodies
unwilling to adopt effective measures against drug misuse by December 1985.
Increasing numbers of sports receive financial sponsorship from commercial
organisations, and its importance as a source of funding is recognised by the
Government and the Sports Council. The estimated value of commercial
sponsorship was some £100 million in 1984. Sponsorship may take the form of
financing specific events, or of grants to individual sports organisations or
sportsmen and sportswomen. The Sports Aid Foundation and Sports Aid Trust
raise and distribute funds from industry, commerce and private sponsors in
order to assist the training of talented individual sportsmen; grants are awarded

on the recommendation of the governing bodies of sport. The Scottish and
Welsh Sports Aid Foundations and the Ulster Sports and Recreation Trust fulfil
similar functions. Sponsorship advisory services are also run by the Sports
Councils and the Central Council of Physical Recreation.
To encourage private sector investment in sporting projects and facilities, the
Sports Council runs a scheme which matches contributions from the private
and voluntary sectors to provide facilities in designated areas. Following the
success of the scheme in Merseyside and Bristol, it is to be extended to London,
the West Midlands, and Tyne and Wear.
Successive governments have negotiated voluntary agreements with the
tobacco industry to regulate tobacco companies' sponsorship of sport.
Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities for
community recreation; their total planned expenditure on sport and recreation
amounts to some £900 million in Britain in 1983—84. Provision of facilities was
substantially increased in the 1970s to meet the increasing demand and to
encourage further expansion of participation. The facilities provided include
parks, lakes, playing fields, sports halls, tennis courts, golf courses, swimming
pools (of which there are nearly 950 throughout Britain) and sports centres
catering for a wide range of activities.
Increased emphasis is being placed on the need to improve facilities for sport
in areas of urban stress. In 1984—85, sports projects valued at some £33 million
were supported under the Government's urban programme. In recognition of
the special problems of Merseyside the Government granted £2-5 million over
the three years to 1984—85 for sporting projects in that area. The Government's
Derelict Land Scheme also provides funds towards sports and recreation
facilities on reclaimed sites; approved expenditure under the scheme amounted
to £3-5 million in 1984—85.
In addition to the recreational facilities provided by public authorities, many
facilities are made available by local sports clubs. Some cater for indoor
recreation, but more common are those providing sports grounds, particularly
for games such as cricket, association and rugby football, hockey, tennis and
golf. Clubs linked to business firms often cater for a wide range of activities.
Commercial facilities include tenpin bowling centres, ice and roller-skating
rinks, squash courts, golf courses and driving ranges, curling rinks and riding
stables.
Publicly maintained schools must provide for the physical education of their
pupils. All (except those solely for infants) are expected to have a playing field or
the use of one, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium. Some have other
amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and halls designed for dance
and movement. Sports and recreation facilities are also provided at institutions
of higher and further education (some of which have departments of physical
education), and there are ‘centres of sporting excellence', often at universities
and other colleges, which enable selected young athletes to develop their talents
and which provide, where appropriate, for their educational needs.
In order to achieve the maximum use of existing sports facilities, the
Government is encouraging greater community use of sports centres and other
facilities owned by businesses and public sector bodies. In 1985, together with
the Sports Council, it launched an initiative under the title ‘Open Door' to
encourage the shared use of school and other publicly owned sports facilities at
times when they would otherwise lie empty.
Six national sports centres, five in England and one in Wales, are run by the
Sports Council, and provide a range of competition and training facilities. As

well as offering residential courses for national teams, coaches and enthusiasts
from all over Britain, the centres are used extensively by local sports clubs and
the local community. Combined facilities for a range of sports are provided at
three of the centres: Crystal Palace in south-east London, Bisham Abbey in
Buckinghamshire and Lilleshall in Shropshire. Crystal Palace provides major
competition venues for athletics and swimming and a variety of indoor sports,
and Lilleshall houses the training school of the Football Association. The other
three are specialist centres: the National Sailing Centre, Cowes, Isle of Wight;
the National Water Sports Centre at Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire, which
caters for rowing, canoeing and water-skiing: and the Plas-y-Brenin National
Centre for Mountain Activities in north Wales. The Sports Council for Wales
runs the National Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff and the National Outdoor
Pursuits Centre at Plas Menai in north Wales.
The Scottish Sports Council operates three national sports training centres:
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore for outdoor pursuits, Inverclyde at Largs for
general sports, and a national water sports training centre on Great Cumbrae
Isle in the Firth of Clyde. The Sports Council for Northern Ireland operates one
national facility, the Northern Ireland Mountain Centre at Tollymore in County
Down.
Some 600 purpose-built indoor sports centres and 1,000 sports halls serve
local rather than national needs; in Northern Ireland there has been a major
development of multi-purpose centres. Several privately run centres cater for
specialised interests, such as the National Equestrian Centre, run by the British
Equestrian Federation, and the Ludwig Guttmann Sports Centre for the
Disabled, Stoke Mandeville.
The Minister for Sport has responsibility for co-ordinating policy on children's
play. 1 he Department of Education and Science is concerned with play in
schools, and the Department of Health and Social Security with play for the
under-fives. Play Board—the Association for Children's Play and Recreation
Ltd—is an independent national organisation, funded by the Department of the
Environment, which promotes facilities and opportunities for children's play in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The National Playing Fields Association, a national charity, has for many years
encouraged the provision of playing fields and recreational facilities, specialis¬
ing in the needs of children and young people, including the young disabled.
There are affiliated associations in Scotland and Northern Ireland and in the
counties of England and Wales.
The British Olympic Association, founded in 1905, organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games. The Association's committee consists of
representatives of the 26 sports in the programme of the Olympic Games
(summer and winter). It determines the size of the British teams, raises funds,
makes all the arrangements and provides a headquarters staff for the
management of the teams.
The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, encourages
greater sporting and recreational opportunities for disabled people. The
Association, which receives an annual Sports Council grant, provides advice on
physical recreation, arranges sports meetings, and encourages the provision of
facilities throughout the country. It co-ordinates and develops the activities of
its 31 member associations representing all categories of handicap—physical,
mental and sensory. The United Kingdom Sport Association for People with
Mental Handicap was established in 1981.

The first sports stadium in the world designed for the disabled was opened at
Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, in 1969, and is owned and maintained by
the British Paraplegic Sports Society. Annual national games organised by
several of the associations for the disabled take place at Stoke Mandeville,
Crystal Palace in London and at other locations; the Seventh World Wheelchair
Games (or Paralympics) were held at Stoke Mandeville in 1984. As part of the
International Year of Disabled People in 1981, several initiatives were launched
by the Sports Councils and other bodies to increase the participation of disabled
people in sport, and there are growing opportunities in virtually every sport at
both competitive and non-competitive levels.
Some of the major sports and recreations in Britain are described below. The
increased provision of sports centres has improved opportunities for participa¬
tion in indoor sports such as basketball, volleyball, fencing, judo, the martial
arts (karate, aikido and kendo), gymnastics, squash, table tennis and shooting.
Almost all outdoor sports have continued to gain in popularity, including the
high-risk’ activities such as rock-climbing and sub-aqua diving. The number of
people enjoying the recreational amenities of the countryside, rivers and
coastline is similarly growing. Two sports introduced from overseas in the 1970s
which have gained rapidly in popularity are windsurfing and hang-gliding; the
flying of microlight aircraft is one of the newest sports to achieve a keen
following.
Sportsmen may be professionals (paid players) or amateurs. Some sports,
such as Rugby Union, hockey and rowing, are amateur but in others the
distinction between amateur and professional status is less strictly defined, or
does not exist.
The largest spectator sport and one of the most popular participation sports,
association football was first developed and codified in England during the
nineteenth century, and is controlled by separate football associations in
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England over 350 clubs are
affiliated to the English Football Association (FA) and some 40,000 clubs to
regional or district associations. The full-time professional clubs in England and
Wales belong to the Football League (92 clubs) and in Scotland to the Scottish
Football League (38 clubs); the clubs play in four divisions in England and Wales
and three in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, 14 semi-professional clubs play in
the Irish Football League. During the season, which lasts from August until
May, attendances at Canon League (that is, English league matches) total about
19 million. The Football Association, founded in 1863, and the Football League,
founded in 1888, were both the first of their kind in the world.
The annual competitions for the FA Challenge Cup, the Milk Cup (formerly the
League Cup), the Scottish FA Cup, the Skol Cup (formerly the Scottish League
Cup), the Irish Cup and the Welsh FA Cup are organised on a knock-out basis,
and the finals are played at Wembley Stadium, London, at Hampden Park,
Glasgow, at Windsor Park, Belfast, and on a two-leg home and away basis in
Wales. British clubs were European club champions (Liverpool three times,
Nottingham Forest twice and Aston Villa once) for six consecutive years between
1977 and 1982, and Liverpool became champions again in 1984. Aberdeen won
the European Cup-Winners Cup in 1983, as did Everton in 1985; Ipswich Town
and Tottenham Hotspur won the Union of European Football Associations
(EUFA) cup competition in 1981 and 1984 respectively.
Spectator violence associated with football both in Britain and overseas has
been a subject of growing concern, and the Government has worked closely with
the football authorities and the governments of other European countries to
combat the problem. After serious disturbances involving British supporters at
422
BRITAIN 1986: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

Games

the European Cup Final in Brussels in May 1985 which led to the deaths of 38
spectators, English clubs were withdrawn from European competitions for the
1985-86 season by the Football Association; an indefinite ban on the clubs was
subsequently imposed by UEFA and, on a world-wide basis, by FIFA (the
International Federation of Football Associations), though the latter was later
modified to allow teams to play friendly and exhibition matches outside Europe.
Britain has signed a Council of Europe Convention, adopted in August 1985,
which is designed to eliminate spectator violence at all sporting events,
including football. The Government has banned alcohol from football grounds
and on transport to matches (such a ban already existed in Scotland), and
proposes to give the police additional powers to prevent disorder at matches.
Greater use is being made of closed-circuit television at football grounds, and
the introduction of club membership schemes for supporters is under discus¬
sion.
The Sports Council, using specially allocated funds, has made grants to a
number ol clubs and local authorities to enable them to modernise or expand
football facilities in areas of urban deprivation. Grants for various improve¬
ments such as all-weather pitches are also made by the Football Trust, a body
financed by the football pools (see p 430) companies; its sister body, the Football
Grounds Improvement Trust, is specifically concerned with ground safety.
Amateur athletics is governed in England by the Amateur Athletic Association
(which, formed in 1880, was the first national governing body for athletics) and
by the Women's Amateur Athletic Association. Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland have their own associations. International athletics and the selection of
British teams are the concern of the British Amateur Athletic Board, which also
administers coaching schemes. For the Olympic Games and the world and
European championships one team represents the United Kingdom.
Athletics is attracting increasing numbers of participants, both men and
women, in part because of the success of British competitors and the wide
coverage of athletics events on television.
Many British athletes, especially middle-distance runners, have enjoyed
distinguished reputations: in 1954, for example. Dr Roger Bannister became
the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. More recently Britons won 16
athletics medals at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, including gold
medals in the decathlon (Daley Thompson), the 1,500 metres (Sebastian Coe)
and the javelin (Tessa Sanderson). Five world records were held by Britons in
August 1985: the 800 metres and the 1,000 metres by Sebastian Coe; the mile
and the 2,000 metres by Steve Cram; and the women's 5,000 metres by Zola
Budd. Daley Thompson (decathlon) and Steve Cram (1,500 metres) were both
gold medallists at the 1983 world athletics championships in Helsinki.
The thirteenth Commonwealth Games will be held in Scotland in 1986, at
venues in Edinburgh and elsewhere. Edinburgh also played host to the Games
in 1970.
Scottish Highland Games, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting
the weight and throwing the hammer), dancing and piping competitions take
place, attract large numbers of spectators from all over the world. Among
better-known Highland Games are the annual Braemar Gathering, which is
traditionally attended by the royal family, the Argyllshire and Cowal Gatherings
and the meeting at Aboyne.
The origins of badminton are not clear, but the Badminton Association of
England, which together with the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Badminton Unions
today organises the sport in Britain, was formed in 1893 and the first

tournament was promoted five years later. By 1914 the game had spread to
many other Commonwealth countries and is now played throughout the world.
Badminton expanded rapidly in the 1970s and is played in a variety of locations
from sports centres to village halls; some 2 million people are estimated to play
the game in Britain, about 1 million of them regularly. British women players
have done particularly well in the sport: Nora Perry and Jane Webster of England
were world champions in 1982. The England women’s team won a silver medal,
and the men's a bronze, at the 1984 world team championships. The English
team (men and women) are reigning European and Commonwealth Games
champions.
Basketball is played in Britain both indoors and outdoors. There are over 1,100
senior clubs and the sport is played in most secondary schools and many other
institutions; in all, over 1 million people participate and its popularity has been
increasing rapidly. The English Basket Ball Association is the governing body of
the sport in England, and there are similar associations in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. The leading English clubs play in a national league and the
main events of the year are the National Championship Finals, held at Wembley
Arena in London, and the men's National Cup Final, staged at the Royal Albert
Hall.
The character of the present game of billiards was established in Britain at the
end of the seventeenth century. Snooker, a more varied game invented by the
British in India in 1875, has greatly increased in popularity and become a major
spectator sport as a result of widespread television coverage of the professional
tournaments. It is estimated that between 5 and 6 million people now play the
game. British players have an outstanding record in snooker and the major
professional championships have been largely dominated by them. The main
tournament is the annual Embassy World Professional Championship, held in
Sheffield; British winners of this event include Ray Reardon (six times), John
Spencer (three times), and more recently Dennis Taylor (1985), Alex Higgins
(1972 and 1982) and Steve Davis (1981, 1983 and 1984). Northern Ireland were
world team champions in 1984, as were England in 1981 and 1983.
The controlling body of both games is the Billiards and Snooker Control
Council, which holds the copyright of the rules. The Professional Players
Association organises professional championships.
Bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century. The game of lawn
bowls is played on a flat green; in the midlands and north of England and in
North Wales a variation called crown green bowls is played, so named because
the centre of the green is higher than its boundaries. Lawn and crown green
bowls are mainly summer games; in winter indoor bowls, played on synthetic
greens, is growing in popularity. At one time regarded as a pastime for the
elderly, bowls is increasingly played by adults of all ages. Over 2,600 lawn
bowling clubs are affiliated to the English Bowling Association, which, together
with the Bowling Associations of Scotland. Wales and Ireland and the English
Women's Bowling Association, play to the rules of the International Bowling
Board. Other associations, including the English Bowling Federation, are not
under the Board's control. The British Crown Green Bowling Association is the
governing body of crown green bowls, and has nearly 2,000 affiliated clubs.
Boxing as a British sport is one of the oldest, probably originating in Saxon
times. Its modern form, also adopted in many overseas countries, dates from
1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules eliminating
much of the brutality that had characterised prize-fighting and making skill the

basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur and professional, and in both strict
medical regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England, including schoolboy, club and association
boxing, and boxing in the armed services, is controlled by the Amateur Boxing
Association. There are separate associations in Scotland and Wales; Northern
Ireland forms part of the Irish Boxing Association. The associations organise
various amateur boxing competitions, and teams from England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland take part in international competitions such as
the European and world championships; a British team competes in the
Olympic Games.
Professional boxing is controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control. The
Board appoints inspectors, medical officers and representatives to ensure that
regulations are observed and to guard against overmatching and exploitation.
British boxing has a distinguished record and at various times British boxers
have held European, Commonwealth and world championship titles. Recent
holders of European or world titles include Barry McGuigan (who won the world
featherweight title in June 1985), Colin Jones, Charlie Magri and Tony Sibson.
Chess has increased greatly in popularity over the past ten years and England
now ranks among the top five chess-playing nations (Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are separately represented). There are local chess clubs and
leagues throughout the country and the game is widely played in schools and
colleges. Important domestic competitions include the annual Grieveson Grant
British Championships, the Leigh Grand Prix, a circuit of weekend tourna¬
ments, the Legal and General Championships (a tiered competition open to all
clubs), and The Times British Schools Chess Tournament, a knock-out
competition open to all schools. The best known international event is the
annual Hastings International tournament. The governing bodies of the game
are the British Chess Federation, the Scottish Chess Association (the oldest
such body in the world, which celebrated its centenary in 1984) and the Welsh
and Ulster Chess Unions.
The first British player to achieve the status of Grandmaster for over-the-
board chess was Tony Miles in 1976, and eight Britons now hold that title; Nigel
Short became the world’s youngest Grandmaster in 1984 at the age of 19.
John Nunn won the gold medal for best score at the 88-nation chess Olympics
in Greece in 1984, and England won the men's team silver medal.
Cricket is among the most popular of summer sports and is sometimes called
the English national game, having been played as early as the 1550s. Among the
many clubs founded in the eighteenth century was the Marylebone Cricket Club
(MCC), which reframed the laws of the game. The Club is based at Lord's cricket
ground in North London, the administrative centre of the world game. Cricket in
Britain is now governed by the Cricket Council, consisting of representatives of
the Test and County Cricket Board (representing first-class cricket), the
National Cricket Association (representing club and junior cricket) and the
MCC.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and universities, and in most towns and
villages amateur teams play weekly games from late April to the end of
September. In England there is a network of league cricket contested by teams of
Saturday afternoon players; in the midlands and the north of England these
teams include a full-time professional. The game is also played to a lesser extent
in Scotland and Wales.
The main competition in professional cricket is the First Class County
Championship of three-day games played by 17 county teams, which also take
part in three one-day competitions—two knock-out competitions and a Sunday

League. Some of the best supported games are the annual series of five-day Test
matches played between England and a touring team from Australia, New
Zealand, India, Pakistan, the West Indies or Sri Lanka. A team representing
England usually tours one or more of these countries in the British winter.
One-day international games also attract large crowds. A World Cup is played
every four years, with some of the smaller cricketing nations as well as the major
countries competing.
Cricket is also played by women and girls, the governing body being the
Women's Cricket Association, founded in 1926. Women's cricket clubs have
regular weekend fixtures, and junior sides play both eleven and six-a-side
competitions. Test match series are played against Australia, India, New
Zealand and the West Indies, and other international matches take place. A
women’s World Cup, in which England competes, is held every four years.
Darts, an indoor game which has its origins in medieval archery, is played
mainly in public houses as a casual recreation to accompany drinking. It has
gained in popularity as a result of widespread television coverage of the
professional game. As many as 9 million people at a time watch televised darts
contests and it is estimated that over 5 million people play the game regularly.
Darts is organised in Britain by the British Darts Organisation, which forms
part of the World Darts Federation; its rules have become the code for the world
sport. The Organisation arranges events in Britain which bring entrants from
as many as 45 countries. Every two years a World Cup tournament is held,
which England won in 1983 in Edinburgh. The main individual title in the
game is the Embassy World Professional Championship. British players have
dominated the event and in 1985 the title was won by Eric Bristow of England.
British field sports include hunting (on horseback and on foot), fishing,
shooting, stalking, falconry and hare coursing. The hunting seasons vary
depending on the quarry. The fox hunting and hare hunting season lasts from
November to April, while mink hunting takes place in the summer months. Fox
hunting on horseback with a pack of hounds is the most popular British
hunting sport, and there are over 400 packs of hounds of all kinds in Britain.
Game shooting as an organised sport probably originated in the early part of
the nineteenth century, and mainly takes place on the moorlands of Scotland
and northern England. Game consists of grouse, black-grouse, partridge,
pheasant and ptarmigan, species which are protected by law during a close
season when they are allowed to breed on numerous estates supervised by
gamekeepers. It is necessary to have a licence to kill game and a certificate
issued by the police to own a shot-gun. The Game Conservancy, formed by
landowners, farmers and others interested in game conservation, collects
information and studies factors controlling game population.
The most popular country sport is fishing, and there are about 4 million
anglers in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout, particularly in the rivers and
lochs of Scotland and in Wales, but in England and Wales the most widely
practised form of fishing is for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp, tench and
bream. Angling clubs in England affiliate to the National Federation of Anglers
(there are similar bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) and many
clubs organise angling competitions. Freshwater fishing usually has to be paid
for; most coarse fishing is let to angling clubs by private owners, while trout and
salmon fishermen may rent a stretch of river, join a club, or pay for the right to
fish by the day, week or month. Coastal and deep-sea fishing are free to all (apart
from salmon and sea trout fishing which is by licence only).
The British Field Sports Society looks after the interests of all field sports.

Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the Royal
and Ancient Game. The Royal Burgess Golfing Society of Edinburgh, the oldest
club in the world, celebrated its 250th anniversary in 1985. The Royal and
Ancient Golf Club, the ruling authority of the sport for most of the world, is
situated at St Andrews on the east coast. Golf is played throughout Britain and
there are golf courses in the vicinity of most towns, some of them owned by local
authorities. The main event of the British golfing year, and considered by many
to. be the worlds leading tournament, is the Open Golf Championship; other
important events include the Walker Cup match for amateurs and the Ryder Cup
match for professionals, which are played between Britain and the United States
and Europe and the United States respectively. Among the leading British
professional players are Sandy Lyle, Nick Faldo, Mark James, Brian Barnes,
Bernard Gallagher, Peter Oosterhuis and Sam Torrance.
Variants of hockey have been played in Britain for at least five centuries, and
some, like hurling in Ireland and shinty in Scotland, are still played. The modern
game was started in the nineteenth century by the Hockey Association (of
England), which was founded in 1886. There are similar associations in
Scotland, Wales and Ireland. There are some 1,000 men's hockey clubs
throughout Britain, many of which have men s, women's and junior sections,
and many boys' schools also play the game. Cup competitions and leagues are
played at national, division or district, and club levels both indoors (six-a-side)
and outdoors, and there are regular international matches.
The controlling body of women's hockey in England is the All-England
Women's Hockey Association (founded in 1895) to which are affiliated some
1,000 clubs and about 2,400 schools; there are similar associations in Scotland,
Wales and Ireland. County, club and school championships for both outdoor and
indoor hockey are played annually in England. The first international women's
hockey match took place in 1896: nowadays the main international match is
played annually at Wembley Stadium.
Men's and women's hockey are Olympic sports, and the British men's team
won a bronze medal at the 1984 Olympic Games.
The Hockey Association will host the sixth World Hockey Cup for men in
October 1986 at the new national hockey centre in Willesden, north London.
Ice skating became popular in Britain in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries and takes three main forms; ice dancing, figure skating and
speed-skating. The governing body for the sport is the National Skating
Association of Great Britain, founded in 1879. Participation in ice skating is
concentrated among the under-25s. There are some 40 ice rinks in Great
Britain, a small number compared with many other European countries. In
spite of this, British couples have won the world ice dance championship 17
times in its 32-year history, and Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean were world
ice dance champions for four successive years between 1981 and 1984,
European champions in 1981, 1982 and 1984, and gold medal winners at the
Sarajevo winter Olympic Games in 1984. John Curry and Robin Cousins were
Olympic gold medal winners for figure skating in 1976 and 1980 respectively.
The modern game of lawn tennis originated in England in 1872 and the first
championships were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The controlling body in
Great Britain, the Lawn Tennis Association, was founded in 1888; Northern
Ireland forms part of the Irish Lawn Tennis Association. The main event of the
season is the annual Wimbledon fortnight, widely regarded as the most
important tennis event in the world; this draws large crowds, with the ground at
the All England Club accommodating over 30,000 spectators. There are also
national and county championships and national competitions for boys' and

girls' schools. International events include the Davis Cup and Kings Cup for men
and the Federation Cup for women. Women from Britain and the United States
compete annually for the Wightman Cup.
Among the most popular spectator sports in Britain are motor racing and
rallying, and motor-cycle racing. The governing body for four-wheeled motor
sport is the RAC [Royal Automobile Club] Motor Sports Association. The
Association issues competition licences for a variety of motoring competitions
and organises both the RAC Rally, an event in the contest for the World Rally
Championship, and the British Grand Prix, held annually at either the
Silverstone or Brands Hatch racing circuits, which counts towards the Formula
One World Motor Racing Championship.
British car constructors including Lotus, McLaren and Williams have enjoyed
outstanding successes in Grand Prix racing, and Britain has had six world
champion motor racing drivers; Nigel Mansell and Derek Warwick are among the
most successful of current drivers. Other popular types of motor-car sport
include autocross, drag racing and karting.
Motor-cycle sport, governed by the Auto-Cycle Union, caters for all forms of
competition on two or three wheels, from speed trials to Grand Prix road racing.
The major events of the year are the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races, and the
British Grand Prix at Silverstone; there are also many world championship
events for trials, motocross, speedway and other sports.
The Project Thrust Team regained the world land speed record for Britain in
1983 when Richard Noble drove the jet-powered car Thrust 2 at an average
speed of 633-468 mph over one mile in Nevada, in the United States.
The popularity of mountaineering and rock-climbing has increased steadily.
Clubs in the British Mountaineering Council and the Mountaineering Council of
Scotland, the representative bodies of the sport, number 330, ranging from
national clubs such as the Alpine Club (founded in 1857, the oldest moun¬
taineering club in the world) and the Scottish Mountaineering Club, to small
regional clubs with 20 to 30 members. The National Centre for Mountain
Activities is at Plas-y-Brenin in north Wales, and climbing takes place at other
sports council centres at Plas Menai, north Wales, Aviemore in Scotland and
Tollymore in Northern Ireland. A number of local education authorities and
national bodies such as the Outward Bound Trust have also established
mountaineering training centres. The most popular areas in Britain lor
climbing include the Peak District of Derbyshire, and the mountains of the Lake
District, Snowdonia in north Wales and the Western Highlands of Scotland.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring mountain ranges
and climbing many of the great mountains of the world, achieving, lor example,
the first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865, of Everest in 1953, of Kangchenjunga
in 1955, of Everest by its south-west face in 1975, and of the south face of
Gosainthan (in the Himalayas) in 1982.
Horse-racing takes two forms—flat racing (from late March to early November)
and steeplechasing and hurdle racing (from late August to early June). The
Derby, run at Epsom, is the outstanding event in the flat racing calendar. Other
classic races are: the Two Thousand Guineas and the One Thousand Guineas,
both run at Newmarket; the Oaks, run at Epsom; and the St Leger, run at
Doncaster. The most important steeplechase and hurdle race meeting is the
National Hunt Festival Meeting held at Cheltenham in March. The Grand
National, run at Aintree near Liverpool, is the world's best-known steeplechase
and dates from 1837.
The Jockey Club administers all horse-racing in Britain. Its rules are the basis
of turf procedure and it also licenses racecourses. Racing takes place on most

days (excluding Sundays) throughout the year and about 12,500 horses are in
training. British thoroughbreds continue to be a source of the world’s best
bloodstock.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare (one of Britain's most
popular spectator sports) takes place at 98 tracks licensed by local authorities.
Meetings are usually held two or three times a week at each track, up to a
maximum oi 130 days a year. The rules for the sport are drawn up by the
National Greyhound Racing Club, the sport's judiciary body. The Stewards of
the Club are also responsible for overall administration and organisation and
the licensing of racecourses to race under their rules. The representative body is
the British Greyhound Racing Board.
Horse riding takes a number of forms ranging from recreational riding to show
jumping. The art of riding is promoted by the British Horse Society, which is
concerned with the welfare of horses, road safety, bridleways and training. It
also runs the British Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire where
activities take place throughout the year. With some 33,000 members the
Society is the parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club movements,
which hold rallies, meetings and competitions culminating in annual national
championships. Horse trials are held during the spring and autumn under the
auspices of the Society. Three-day events (comprising dressage, cross-country
riding and showjumping) held each year include those at Badminton (Avon) in
April; Windsor (Berkshire) in May; Braham (Yorkshire) in June; Burghley House
(Lincolnshire) in September; and Wylye (Wiltshire) in October.
Showjumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association, which
has over 14,000 members and some 1,650 shows affiliated to it. The major show
jumping events each year include the Royal International Horse Show at the
National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, the Horse of the Year Show at
Wembley in London, and the Olympia International Show Jumping Cham¬
pionships in London.
The authority responsible for equestrian activities (other than racing) at
international level is the British Equestrian Federation, which co-ordinates the
work of the British Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association.
British equestrian teams have an outstanding record in international competi¬
tions: a British team won the three-day event world championship held in West
Germany in 1982, and Lucinda Green won the individual gold medal. Silver
medals were won by both the three-day event and the showjumping teams at the
1984 Olympic Games, while Virginia Holgate won the bronze medal in the
three-day event individual competition. Well-known show jumpers include
David Broome, Malcolm Pyrah, Harvey Smith and Nick Skelton.
Oarsmanship is taught in many schools, colleges and rowing clubs (including
women s clubs) throughout Britain. The governing body of the sport in England
is the Amateur Rowing Association, and there are similar bodies in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. There are about 480 rowing clubs, and each year
about 250 regattas and head races are held in England. Wales and Scotland
under Association rules.
The University Boat Race (between eight-oared crews from Oxford and
Cambridge) originated in 1829 and has been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River Race in March (also on the Thames) is
the largest assembly of racing craft in the world, with more than 420 eights
racing in procession. At the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire, founded in 1839,
crews from all over the world compete each July in various kinds of race over a
straight course of 1 mile 550 yards (about 21 km).

The National Water Sports Centre at Holme Pierrepont, near Nottingham, has
a rowing course of Olympic 2,000-metre standard, as does Strathclyde Park in
west-central Scotland. Britain won the gold medal in the coxed fours event at the
1984 Olympic Games.
Rugby Football takes its name from Rugby School, in Warwickshire, where it
was first played in 1823. The game is played according to two different codes:
Rugby Union (a 15-a-side game) is played by amateurs while Rugby League (a
13-a-side game) is played by professionals as well as amateurs. Rugby Union is
played under the auspices of the Rugby Football Union in England and similar
bodies in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Important domestic competitions include
the County Championship in England, the national club knock-out competi¬
tions in England and Wales and the Scottish League Cup Championship. The
Five Nations Tournament between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and
France is played each year and there are overseas tours by the national sides and
by the British Lions, a team representing Great Britain and Ireland.
Rugby League is played mainly in the north of England. The governing body of
the professional game is the Rugby Football League, which sends touring teams
representing Great Britain to Australia and New Zealand: annual matches are
also played against France. The Challenge Cup Final, the major club match of
the season, is played at Wembley Stadium in London. The amateur game is
governed by the British Amateur Rugby League Association: annual matches are
played between England and France.
Sailing has always been popular in Britain, and the Royal Yachting Association
(RYA) has over 1,500 affiliated clubs. Over 800 practical or shore-based teaching
centres, including the National Sailing Centre at Cowes in the Isle of Wight and
the Scottish National Water Sports Training Centre in the Firth of Clyde, offer
RYA courses in all branches of the sport. One of the world’s principal regattas
takes place each summer at Cowes, and major events are held at other sailing
centres. British sailors have undertaken many notable voyages. Sir Francis
Chichester was the winner of the first single-handed transatlantic race in 1960
and made a solo circumnavigation of the world in 1966-67. The first non-stop
solo circumnavigation was achieved by Robin Knox-Johnston in 1968. In 1976
Clare Francis held the record for the fastest single-handed crossing of the
Atlantic, as did Naomi James in 1980. Rodney Pattison won gold medals in the
‘Flying Dutchman' class at the Olympic regattas of 1968 and 1972 with his crews
Ian McDonald-Smith and Christopher Davies, and in 1976 Reg White, crewed by
John Osborne, won the gold medal in the ‘Tornado’ catamaran class. Jo
Richards and his crew Peter Allam won a bronze medal in the ‘Flying Dutchman’
class in the 1984 Olympics.
When there is sufficient snow, skiing takes place in several parts of Britain. The
governing body of the sport is the British Ski Federation and there are separate
national councils. Skiing in Scotland has become very popular, especially at the
winter sports centres established in the Cairngorms, Deeside, Glencoe and
Glenshee, where ski-runs equal to those in other areas of Europe have been
developed. Ski-lifts, ski-tows and professional instruction of a high quality are
now available. There are also some 90 artificial ski-slopes throughout Great
Britain. Interest in cross-country skiing has been increasing. There are over 200
ski clubs in Britain, and it is estimated that about half a million people take part
in the sport.
Squash Rackets Squash rackets originated at Harrow School in the 1850s. The Squash Rackets
Association was formed in 1929 to promote and organise the game and there are

separate governing bodies for Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The governing body
of women’s squash in Britain is the Women's Squash Association, founded in
1934. Squash enjoyed a period of very rapid growth during the 1970s and
remains a fast-developing sport. There are over 8,000 squash courts in England,
and the estimated number of players in Britain, both professional and amateur,
is about 3 million. The main tournament is the British Open Championship.
Underwater activities are varied and include exploratory diving (for example,
wreck and reef diving), snorkel diving and underwater photography. The British
Sub-Aqua Club is the governing body for all underwater activities and promotes
underwater exploration, science and sport. The Club is the largest of its kind in
the world, with some 35,000 members and more than 1,000 clubs in Britain and
overseas. The Scottish Sub-Aqua Club governs the sport in Scotland.
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people in Britain, many of whom learn to
swim at public baths, schools or swimming clubs. Instruction and coaching are
provided by qualified teachers who hold certificates awarded by the Amateur
Swimming Association, to which over 1,700 clubs are affiliated. The Association
also controls swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo
championships and competitions in England. Separate associations control the
sport in Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland forms part of the Irish Amateur
Swimming Association. A number of British swimmers have had great success
and David Wilkie and Duncan Goodhew won gold medals at the 1976 and 1980
Olympics respectively. At the 1984 Olympics, Britons won a silver and four
bronze medals.
Windsurfing, or boardsailing, was introduced to Britain from the United States
in 1974 and is one of the fastest-growing sports, with an estimated 100,000
participants. The sport takes place on the sea and on lakes and reservoirs
throughout the country. Racing is increasingly popular, and regattas are
organised by the governing body of the sport, the Royal Yachting Association,
and by the United Kingdom Boardsailing Association, which controls racing for
certain classes of boards. There are some 170 windsurfing schools recognised by
the RYA. Windsurfing is now an Olympic sport.
Various forms of betting and commercial gaming are permitted under strict
regulations, and the total money staked in Britain in 1983-84 (excluding
gaming machines) was about £5,900 million. It has been estimated that over 90
per cent of adults gamble at some time or another, some 40 per cent regularly.
Gaming includes the playing of casino and card games, gaming machines and
licensed bingo, thought to be played by about 5 to 6 million people on a fairly
regular basis. Betting takes place mainly on horse or greyhound racing, and on
football matches (usually through football pools). Racing bets may be made at
racecourses and greyhound tracks, or through some 11,000 licensed off-course
betting offices which take nearly 90 per cent of the money staked. A form of pool
betting (totalisator betting) is organised on, and off, course by the Horserace
Totalisator Board (HTB). Bookmakers and the HTB contribute a levy to the
Horserace Betting Levy Board, which promotes the improvement of horse racing
and breeding and the advancement of veterinary science.
In addition, legislation allows local authorities and certain other bodies to
hold lotteries.
