1956 Edition
It is regretted that, in consequence of the recent dispute
in the printing industry, publication of this edition has
been delayed.
FUTURE EDITIONS
While much of this Handbook is concerned with the basic
institutions and pattern of life in Britain, each annual
edition also summarizes some recent trends in the develop¬
ment of the nation’s affairs. To make the book more
up-to-date and useful to those readers to whom this aspect
is important, it has been decided to alter the publication
date of future editions from the spring to the late autumn.
This change will make it possible to include material drawn
from current annual Government statements of policy,
economic and defence reviews, and accounts and estimates
which are published each spring around the end of the
financial year. The next edition will therefore be published
in the late autumn of 1957. It will include the National
Budget for 1957-58, and will be described as the “ 1958

Introductory Note
an official handbook on these lines appeared first in 1946 as part of the
British Information Services overseas. Experience had shown that there was in
existence no one book prepared primarily for the oversea reader and designed to
answer the questions about Britain which are most frequently asked in oversea
countries by their writers and teachers, their officials and administrators, their
economists and businessmen, and other leaders of their public life. In meeting
this need the handbook, which has a limited free distribution overseas, has proved
valuable; six revised or rewritten editions have been issued; and the book is now
established as a main foundation of the reference and library services provided by
the official British Information Services in oversea countries.
In 1954, Britain: An Official Handbook was for the first time placed on sale
throughout the world. The success of this venture has justified the decision to
revise the handbook each year and to publish it as an annual.
The handbook, which is prepared by the Reference Division of the Central
Office of Information with the co-operation of other Government Departments and
of many national organizations, contains factual and statistical information, com¬
piled from authoritative and official sources, about the United Kingdom, its people
and its institutions. It does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt to
describe the part played by Britain in Commonwealth and world affairs. Its princi¬
pal purpose is to provide basic data on the main aspects of national administration
and national economy and to give an account of the part played by the Government
in the life of the community.
In considering its contents, readers in the United Kingdom are asked to remem¬
ber the original purpose of the book—its oversea distribution. Should any readers
need additional or more detailed information they are referred to the Annual
Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics issued by the Central
Statistical Office, and to the standard works of reference and Government publi¬
cations, some of which are listed in the bibliography at the end of this handbook.
They are asked to note that the Central Office of Information reference papers
listed in the bibliography as obtainable free of charge are available only at United
Kingdom Information Offices overseas and for visitors to Britain.
In general, the contents of the handbook refer to the United Kingdom as a
whole, but where separate facts or figures are available for England, Wales,
Scotland, and Northern Ireland, these have, in some cases, been given.

I. THE BRITISH ISLES
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe with a
total area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest two islands are Great Britain
proper (comprising the greater parts of England, Wales and Scotland) and Ireland
(comprising Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland). Off the southern coast
of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the Isles of
Scilly; off North Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by numerous
islands and to the far north are the important groups of the Orkneys and Shetlands.
All these form administrative counties or parts of counties, but the Isle of Man in
the heart of the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and
France have a large measure of administrative autonomy and are not part of
England, Wales or Scotland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border), has a total
area (including inland water) of 50,329 square miles and is divided into 40 geo¬
graphical or 49 administrative counties; Wales (including Monmouth), with an
area of 8,016 square miles, has 13 counties. Scotland, including its 186 inhabited
islands, has a total area of 30,411 square miles and is divided into 33 counties.
Northern Ireland, consisting of six counties, has an area of 5,451 square miles.
Together, these countries constitute the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland with a total area of 94,207 square miles.
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they refer
to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together for many
administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom as a whole. The position is further
complicated by the fact that the county of Monmouth is sometimes included with
England. United Kingdom statistics and other data sometim includees the Isle of
Man, 227 square miles, and the Channel Islands, 75 square miles, which are
strictly not part of the United Kingdom, but are dependencies of the Crown. Since
southern Ireland became an independent republic, official statistics do not nor¬
mally refer to the British Isles as a whole.
The latitude of 50° North just cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet Head,
is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o° passes through the old Observatory
of Greenwich (London), while the easternmost point of England reaches nearly
i° 45' East and the westernmost point of Ireland is approximately io° 30' West.
It is thus rather under 600 miles in a straight line from the south coast of Britain
to the extreme north and rather over 300 miles across in the widest part. Owing to
the numerous bays and inlets no point in the British Isles is as much as 75 miles
from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less than
50 fathoms (300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental shelf. To the
north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly from 600 feet
to 3,000. These shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing
grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish. The North Atlantic Current, the
drift of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out
over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect
of tidal movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Geology
Despite their small area, the British Isles include rocks representing all the major
geological periods. It is largely because of their long and complicated geological
history that the British Isles have a range of scenery almost unrivalled in any other
area of comparable size.
In the main island of Great Britain the hilly and mountainous areas lie to the
north and west, so that it is possible to draw a broad distinction between Highland
Britain and Lowland Britain. An irregular line joining the mouth of the Tyne in
the north-east with the mouth of the Exe in the south-west marks the division
between these two contrasted parts of Britain.
Highland Britain thus includes the whole of Scotland; the broad upland running
from north to south through the north of England and known as the Pennines; the
well-known Lake District in the north-west of England; practically the whole of
Wales; and the south-western peninsula coinciding approximately with the counties
of Devon and Cornwall. Highland Britain is built up almost entirely of rocks older
in age than the Coal Measures and there are large tracts of the surface lying more
than i ,000 feet above sea level.1 Many parts of the surface have only thin, poor soils,
with the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of
Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in parts of
south-west England. In most areas the farmer has cultivated only the valley lands
and the plains where soils are deeper and richer, and villages and towns are often
separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
Lowland Britain, comprising south-east England and the Midlands, is built up
almost entirely of rocks younger than the Coal Measures, which are less resistant
to weathering and have broken down to form deep fertile soils. Scarcely any part
of Lowland Britain reaches 1,000 feet above sea level, so that practically the whole,
with the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, has been cultivated,
and farmland stretches over the whole area except where interrupted by urban and
industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage systems have been developed through
the centuries to bring under cultivation the fertile soil of the low-lying Fenland of
Lincolnshire and other nearby areas in East Anglia.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors of
present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age, and
at one period or another during this time the whole of Britain north of a line join¬
ing the Thames and the Bristol Channel was covered by ice caps and ice sheets.
The ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains
of Scotland, northern England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had previously
been formed, so that when the ice eventually disappeared the hills stood out as
barren rocky areas, while a thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders, boulder-clay,
sands and gravels—lay distributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had blocked
up previous drainage channels and left large lakes, which have since gradually dried
up, leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by ice
sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption of the pre¬
vious natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses of Ireland are irregularly
disposed round the fringes of the island, and in the higher parts the moorland cover
resembles that of the higher parts of Highland Britain.
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis 4,406 feet; in Wales, Snowdon 3,560
feet; and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District, Cumberland) 3,210 feet.

4 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Because of the complex geology and the varied relief which results, Britain enjoys
not only very attractive and contrasting scenery within short distances but a charac¬
teristic, ever different, coastline. The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach
the coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as along
much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are notable features
in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of Land s End; the limestone
masses or forbidding slates of the Pembrokeshire coast; the red sandstone of St. Bees
Head and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa. Even around
Lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft, white lime¬
stone—the chalk—gives rise to the world-famous white cliffs of Dover or the Needles
off the Isle of Wight. Near at hand are accumulations of sand and shingle, and such
tracts as Chesil Beach, Dungeness and the sandspits of the Norfolk coast have their
own peculiar beauty. The eastern coast of England between the Humber and the
Thames estuary is for the most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years some
stretches of it have been protected against the sea by embankments. These have
occasionally been breached, as in the flood disaster of January I953> which was
caused by the abnormal concurrence of violent gales and exceptionally high tides.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of the
sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the short
British rivers1 valuable as natural havens. In times past every little cove round the
rocky coasts afforded shelter to a fishing village from the waves of the North Sea or
the giant rollers of the Atlantic.
Situated for the most part on the border land between Highland and Lowland
Britain are the outcrops of the Coal Measures containing nearly all Britain’s coal.
The older coal workings and collieries are usually found where the coal seams are
at or near the surface and where the early miners followed them up the deep valleys
into the highlands, as in Yorkshire. The modem deep collieries seek the coal where
it lies beneath a cover of younger rocks and amid the farming lands of Lowland
Britain. This also is well seen in Yorkshire where the newer pits are ever moving
farther and farther east into farming country. Most of the coalfields of Britain,
including those of the great Central Lowlands of Scotland, have given rise to indus¬
trial regions, so that the old rural pattern of British settlement, based essentially on
the occurrence of good soils suitable for intensive farming, has been largely overlaid
by the newer urban industrial pattern which is still growing and spreading.
Climate
Britain enjoys a temperate and equable climate. It lies in middle latitudes to
the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but as the prevailing
winds are south-westerly the climate is largely determined by that of the eastern
Atlantic, although occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may bring
a cold, dry, continental type of weather which, once established, may persist for
many days or even weeks. The weather from day to day is controlled mainly by a
succession of depressions from the Atlantic which, moving in a generally easterly
or north-easterly direction, pass over or near the British Isles. During the summer
months the Azores high pressure system extends its influence north-eastwards to¬
wards north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course, often
passing entirely to the northwards.
Winds. In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from
the south-east and east the least; easterly winds occur about half as often as south-
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—are only 210 and 200
miles long respectively.
THE BRITISH ISLES
5
westerly ones. In hilly country wind direction may differ markedly from the
general direction owing to local effects. Winds are generally stronger in the north
than in the south of the British Isles, on the coasts than inland, and in the west than
in the east. The strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the average speed at
Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of London, varies from about 10-3
m.p.h. at 50 feet in January and February to a minimum in August of 7-5 m.p.h.
The stormiest region of the British Isles is along the north-west coast with about
40 gales a year; south-east England is the least stormy, with gales occurring on
about 18 days a year inland and 25 days on the Channel coast.
Temperature. At stations near sea level the mean annual temperature ranges from
450 F. in the Hebrides to 520 F. in the extreme south-west; it is slightly lower in
the eastern part of the country in the same latitude. The mean monthly temperature
in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetlands), ranges from 390 F. during the winter
to 530 F. during the summer: the corresponding figures for Jersey (Channel Islands),
in the extreme south, are 430 F. and 63° F. The average range of temperature between
winter and summer varies from 150 F. to 230 F., being greatest at inland stations in
the eastern part of the country. During a normal summer, temperature occasionally
rises above 8o° F. in the south, but temperatures of 90° F. and above are uncommon.
Extreme minimum temperatures depend to a large extent on the environment,
but 200 F. may occur on a still, clear winter’s night, io° F. is rare, and o° F. or
below has been recorded only during exceptionally severe winters.
Rainfall. The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches,
while England alone has just over 30 inches. The distribution of annual rainfall is
mainly determined by topography, the mountainous areas of the west and north
having far more than the plains of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches
of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon and Ben Nevis during the average year,
whereas some places in the south-east of England record less than 20 inches. Rain
is fairly well distributed throughout the year, but April, on the whole, is the driest
month, and December, with about twice as much, the wettest. A period of as long
as three weeks without rain is exceptional, and confined to limited areas.
Sunshine. The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a general
decrease from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease
with altitude. During the summer the mean daily duration of sunshine varies from
five hours in western Scotland to eight hours in the extreme south-east of England;
during the winter, sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of 0-5 hours per day
in the neighbourhood of Ben Nevis (Scotland) and the Peak District (Derbyshire)
and 1 -5 hours in the south of England.
Vegetation
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of natural
vegetation cover. When the islands were first settled, oak woodland doubtless
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to thin forests of Scots fir on
higher or sandy ground, interrupted by extensive marshlands and perhaps some
open moorland. In the course of the centuries nearly all the forests have been
cleared so that forest and woodland now occupy only about 6 per cent of the surface
of the country. Midland Britain appears to be well wooded because of the numerous
hedgerows and isolated trees. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the north
and east of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England and in Monmouthshire
on the Welsh border.
6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The hilly moorland with its heather (and cotton grass in the wetter parts),
with its numerous hill grasses and the bracken fern, is a semi-natural wild vegeta¬
tion. Most of Lowland Britain consists either of grass pastureland, representing
centuries of careful management, or ploughland. Because the rainfall varies little in
quantity from month to month, streams rarely dry up and grass remains green
throughout the year.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from the
people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession
of invaders and colonizers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were the
Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after settling
in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating the French
language and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in 1066.
It is neither possible nor suitable to attempt in this chapter to estimate the rela¬
tive importance of various early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons
and the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English,
Scots, Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over most of England and
the Lowlands of Scotland the language which soon came to predominate was
English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and Norman-French, while the us£
of Celtic languages persisted in Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, the Highlands
of Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not permit of any precise estimates of the size of popula¬
tion or of the extent or direction of population movement until the beginning of
the nineteenth century. It is believed that at the end of the eleventh century the
population of Great Britain was of the order of two million, while at the end of the
seventeenth a reasonable contemporary estimate put the population of England and
Wales at 5^ million and the population of Scotland at about one million. Natural
increase was the main factor in this slow growth, though it was kept down in
Britain, as in all countries before the development of medical science, by high death
rates and particularly by very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration
from the continent of Europe, e.g., of Flemish weavers, was an influence at certain
times.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the British
people, their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births, deaths, marriages,
occupations, language and family structure, is relatively plentiful and reliable. Most
of it is derived from two main sources: the periodic census of population which
gives a national snapshot at a particular moment of time, and the regular flow of
statistical information based on statutory registration of births, marriages and deaths.
The Census
Censuses of the people of Great Britain were taken regularly every ten years from
1801 to 1931. There was no census between 1931 and 1951, but a count of the popu¬
lation by age and sex was a by-product of the national registration which was
instituted at the outbreak of the second world war in September 1939.
Censuses were taken on 8th April 1951 by the appropriate authorities in the
United Kingdom, the islands of the British Seas and the Republic of Ireland.1 This
1 These authorities are: the General Register Office, Somerset House, London; the
General Registry Office, Edinburgh; the General Register Division of the Ministry of
Finance of the Government of Northern Ireland; the Governments of the Isle of Man, of
Jersey and of Guernsey and its associated islands; and the Central Statistical Office of the
Republic of Ireland.
THE BRITISH ISLES
7
was the first simultaneous population count covering all these areas since the
censuses of 1911. The co-operation of the Republic of Ireland in arranging a
simultaneous census was of particular value, owing to the considerable sea and
land traffic and the movement of population between that country and the United
Kingdom.
Preliminary reports of the censuses of England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern
Ireland were obtained, in advance of the main statistical operations, direct from
summaries supplied by the local census officers. They were, therefore, provisional,
though no material correction to their figures was expected to be necessary. They
related only to the numbers of the population by sex for each country and for
administrative areas within each country, except that in the Scottish report there
was a table indicating by counties the number and percentage of the population
returned as speaking Gaelic. A number of local reports giving final detailed informa¬
tion for major administrative areas (counties, county boroughs or, in Scotland, large
burghs) have since been published, as well as parts of the final reports for Scotland
and Northern Ireland, and special reports on the Welsh speaking population in Wales
and on the ecclesiastical areas in England. The main detailed final reports for
England and Wales, however, have not yet been published as they involve more
statistical work. To obtain advance information on the many matters covered by
the census, an analysis was made of a representative one per cent sample of the
returns for Great Britain.
The short demographic account of the United Kingdom given in this chapter is
based mainly on census reports (including the 1951 Census One Per Cent Sample
Tables) and on the regular returns of births, marriages and deaths, though some
use has been made of other special investigations.
Total Population
The enumerated population of the United Kingdom at the census taken on
8th April 1951 was, to the nearest thousand, 50,225,000, excluding 158,000 persons
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
8
in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, which are not strictly parts of the
United Kingdom. This represented a population density of about 533 persons per
square mile, which is one of the highest in the world and is still rising.
The population has increased by about 2! million since mid-1939, by about
4 million since 1931, by about 6 million since 1921 and by about 43 million or
about sevenfold—since 1700. The main causes of this increase were a progressive
reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates into the beginning
of the twentieth century. The population is still increasing, though relatively slowly,
and at the end of June 1955 the resident population of the United Kingdom was
estimated at 50,968,000.
Birth and Death Rates.1 During the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was
usually about 3! per cent. The annual death rate was just over 2 per cent. Both
birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the century, but the natural
BIRTH RATES AND DEATH RATES
increase of the population changed but little. It rose from 1 -2 per cent in 1851 to
1-4 per cent in 1881, and fell to i-i per cent in 1901.
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age groups,
produced a population of low average age and at each successive census the popula¬
tion of any age group exceeded the corresponding figure at the preceding census.
When, therefore, death rates in all age groups fell by an average of about 33 per
cent, as they did between 1880 and 1910, the result was first a very low crude death
rate which helped to maintain the population increase in spite of a fall in the birth
rate, and, secondly, a gradual increase in the average age of the population.
After the first world war the birth rate fell to less than half the nineteenth-century
rate. Even so, the population continued to increase slowly, though its average age
rose more rapidly (see diagram p. 7).
1 Birth and death rates are the ratios of live-births and deaths to the population or
population-group concerned. Strictly speaking, the ratios of total live-births and total
deaths to total population should be referred to as crude birth and death rates (in contrast
with age-specific or other specific rates, e.g., death rate among men aged 20 to 24, birth
rate among married women under 30). In common usage, however, the word ‘ crude ’ is
often omitted, particularly in reference to birth rates.
THE BRITISH ISLES

Owing to the changing age composition, the crude death rate remained nearly
stationary at around x -2 per cent though death rates continued to fall heavily in all
age groups, particularly among pre-school children, school children, and adults in
their thirties and forties. From 1932 onwards the birth rate steadied itself and
thereafter rose slowly up to the outbreak of the second world war, after which all
orderly movement was interrupted by the disturbed conditions of the war years. The
1947 birth rate (20-7 per thousand of the population) was the highest since 1921,
but the 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951 birth rates were progressively lower, though
higher than pre-war. Since 1951 the birth rate has been fairly steady at 15-8 per
thousand of the population, slightly higher than pre-war.
Mortality Causes. The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition,
rising standards of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical
facilities, improved health measures, better working conditions, education in per¬
sonal hygiene, public and private schemes to make the health services generally
available, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on mothers
and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis and infant and
maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main acute
infectious diseases of childhood is less than one-thirtieth, and mortality from
tuberculosis is less than one-tenth of the rate prevailing in the mid-nineteenth
century. Infant mortality has fallen by about 80 per cent since 1900, and between
1934 and 1942 maternal mortality was halved and has since continued to fall.
The reported mortality from many of the chronic diseases of middle and old age
has risen during the twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the
improvement in diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered
effective measures to combat some of these diseases, and improvement in positive
health does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
Fertility Trends. The fall in births during the twentieth century has taken place
in spite of an increase in the marriage rate and a drop in the usual age of marriage
for women. It is due mainly to a decline in the number of children born per married
couple (the average size of the family). Couples married in the mid-Victorian era
produced on the average five to six liveborn children. Among the couples married
in the years 1925-29 the figure may be estimated at 2-2.
At first the decline in family size was most marked among the professional and
salaried classes. Among couples married between 1900 and 1930 the families of
manual workers were about 40 per cent larger than those of non-manual workers,
but this class difference appears to have been diminishing. The decline in family
size has been considerably slower among Roman Catholics than in the rest of the
population, and slower in Scotland and Northern Ireland than in England and
Wales.
Changing social habits and the disturbing effects of war preclude any reliable
estimate of long-term trends in family size since 1939, though there is some
evidence of a slight increase.
Migration. Over the whole 150 years since the beginning of the nineteenth
century, net migration has been markedly outward. About 25 million persons born
in the British Isles are estimated to have gone overseas in this period to settle in
the United States and Commonwealth countries. On the other hand large numbers
of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles and Germans, have entered the British Isles
during the last 80 years. The net loss by migration since 1871 from the present
area of the United Kingdom is about 3 j million. During the inter-censal period
I93I-5I the net balance of migration to and from the United Kingdom was inward
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for the first time in the past century. The net gain to the United Kingdom rom
civilian migration was about half a million, a net gain of three-quarters of a million
to England and Wales being offset by net losses from Scotland and Northern
Ireland. This net gain was the balance of a large outward movement mainly of
British subjects emigrating, mostly since 1945,to Canada, Australia, New Zea an
and South Africa, and a larger inward movement mainly of aliens from Europe,
many of whom were refugees seeking sanctuary in Britain. Taking only the peno
1946-51 the balance of migration was outward owing to the high net outflow (some
65 000 a year) of British citizens to Commonwealth countries. In 1951 this net out¬
flow reached a peak of 85,000, but it has since been reduced, chiefly owing to in¬
creased immigration into Britain from other parts of the Commonwealth.
Age Distribution. The continuous fall in death rates and the low inter-war birth
rates are beginning to increase the proportion of elderly people, and thus to reduce
the proportion of the working population to the total population. The small age
groups born between the wars have been and are still coming to maturity. The size
of the age groups reaching retirement age increases yearly, as these groups were
born during a period of rapidly expanding population. The continuing fall °f death
rates in all age groups has still further increased the number of old persons. More¬
over, the higher birth rates since 1942 have arrested the compensating fall in the
number of dependent children. In June 1955 the age distribution of the United
Kingdom was estimated as follows:
Under 15 .. .. 22-5 per cent
65 and over . . . . 11 "3 Per cent
151064 .. .. 66-2 per cent.
During the present decade an unusually large proportion of the population of
Britain will be between 40 and 50 years of age. Assuming that mortality rates
continue to fall, and disregarding migration, it can therefore be shown that:
(1) over the next 15 years the population of working age will remain roughly
constant;
(2) the number of old people (over 65) will increase over the next 30 years by
about three million.
These predictions are independent of the future course of births.
Sex Ratio. Total births of boys usually exceed those of girls by about 5 per cent,
but owing to the higher stillbirth rate and infant mortality among boys, and the
higher male death rates in all age groups, women have for the past 100 years out¬
numbered men from adolescence onwards and in the total population. Their pre¬
dominance increases with age and is now nearly 50 per cent among persons over
70 years of age. . .
The fall in mortality has affected the sex ratio by increasing the proportion ot old
persons in both sexes, which has made female predominance in those age groups a
weightier factor in the sex ratio of the population as a whole. At the same time
there has been a slight rise in the proportion of boys among children under 15
years of age.
The proportion of females to males in the total population has not varied greatly,
however, as these two effects have counterbalanced each other. At present there are
between six and seven per cent more females than males.
Population Policy
If the future brings a further reduction in family size, the decline of annual births
will become rapid, with serious effects on the trend of population. Fear of this
THE BRITISH ISLES
II
eventuality was an important factor in a growing concern with population problems,
which led to the appointment in March 1944 of a Royal Commission on Population
to inquire into the facts concerning British population trends, their causes and prob¬
able consequences; and to ‘ consider what measures, if any, should be taken in the
national interest to influence the future trend of population’.
The Commission reported in March 1949. It found that the main cause, and
very probably the only cause, of the fall in family size was the spread of deliberate
family limitation. In the course of the nineteenth century powerful economic, social
and cultural forces combined to tell against the continued acceptance of an uncon¬
trolled birth rate. Changes in economic organization were reducing the importance
of the family as a productive unit, while the Factory and Education Acts were
extending the period during which children were an unrelieved expense to their
parents. The result was that, in all classes of society except the wealthiest, married
couples with young children to support were at an economic disadvantage compared
with childless couples; and parents with a family of several young children were at
a disadvantage as compared with those with only one or two.
The Commission’s recommendations aimed at reducing the economic disadvan¬
tages of parenthood. It proposed increased family allowances; reform of income
tax to reduce the disadvantages of parenthood for the well-to-do; the building of
more houses with more than three bedrooms; the further development of family
health and welfare services; and research and education in population questions.
Regional Distribution and Trends
The distribution of the population of the British Isles as enumerated at the 1951
Census and at certain previous censuses back to 1841, and so far as estimated at
June 1954, is shown in Table 1, overleaf.
The populations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and of each
of the principal regions of England were in every case greater in 1951 than in 1931,
whereas in the period i92i“3i the populations of Whies, Scotland and Northern
Ireland had declined. The greatest increases were in the eastern, southern, midland
and south-western districts of England, and in Northern Ireland. The smallest
increase was in Wales.
The population of the United Kingdom taken as a whole is predominantly urban
and suburban. During the nineteenth century, when the labour demands of newly
developing industry drew great numbers from the countryside to the towns, the
urban element continuously and rapidly outgrew the rural element. At the end of
the nineteenth century 75 per cent of the British population was living within the
boundaries of urban administrative areas and the large conurbation1 was already the
dominant type of British community. By 1911 the economic and social limits of
these conurbations extended far beyond the administrative boundaries of the cities
which formed their core, owing to the building of outer suburbs which linked up
neighbouring towns. Since 1921 nearly 40 per cent of the population has lived in
the seven great conurbations whose centres are the cities of London, Glasgow,
Birmingham and Wolverhampton, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Bradford,
and Newcastle upon Tyne (see Table 2, pp. 13-14)-
During the twentieth century the general character of urbanization changed, the
later increases in urban areas being relatively much smaller and much more due to
the natural growth of the towns than to the withdrawal of rural population.

other or become linked by such factors as a common industrial or business interest or a
common centre for shopping or education.

Moreover, two new and decided trends became apparent: first, the outer rings of
conurbations and the suburbs of large cities began to increase in population much
more rapidly than the large cities themselves; secondly, there was a considerable
migration, particularly of young adults, to the expanding new light industries and
suburban residential areas springing up in and around London and Birmingham.
This movement was intensified by the heavy unemployment of the inter-war years
which affected with particular severity the textile and heavy engineering industries
of Scotland, Northern England and South Wales.
The combined effect of these two trends was that the outer rings of the London
and Birmingham conurbations increased most in population while the remoter
country areas and some industrial towns of Scotland, Wales and Northern England
declined. In urban areas in England and Wales, the medium-sized towns of between
50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants increased most rapidly, while the populations of
very large or very small towns tended to decline.
The second world war halted suburban building and for a time reduced the
population of conurbations and large cities, but by the end of the war many people
had returned to the neighbourhood of their pre-war homes. In 1951 many large
cities and towns had larger populations than in 1939, but the populations of others,
notably London, were reduced. The decrease in the County of London was about
two-thirds of a million, and in spite of an increase in the population of the outer
ring, the population of Greater London in 1951 (8,346,000 to the nearest thousand)
was 382,000 less than in 1939. The populations of many urban and rural areas
surrounding Greater London have continued to increase very rapidly.
After 1939—and therefore probably at least in part as a result of the war there
was a marked change in the relative rates of growth of rural and urban areas as
a whole, and of small, medium-sized and large towns. For the first time in 100
years the population of administrative rural areas grew faster than that of urban
areas, while within urban areas the greatest growth occurred in towns of 40,000
to 75,000 inhabitants, and smaller towns appeared to be increasing almost as fast.
Table 2 shows the distribution of the population by urban and rural districts
and the populations of the standard administrative regions, of the seven major
conurbations and of 16 large cities.

Language
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language pre¬
dominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic, is the first
language of most of the population in some of the central and northern counties
and was spoken by 29 per cent of the population at the time of the 1951 census.
In Scotland nearly 100,000 persons, mainly in Ross and Cromarty, Inverness,
Argyll, and Lanark, speak the Scottish form of Gaelic,1 while a few scattered fami¬
lies in Northern Ireland speak the Irish form of Gaelic. The Manx and Cornish
varieties of Celtic are no longer effectively living languages, although Manx is used
in addition to English for certain official pronouncements in the Isle of Man.
French is still the official language of Jersey, but, in Guernsey, English is now
used for all official proceedings. English is generally spoken throughout the Channel
Islands, although a Norman French patois is still spoken there by some people.
Social Patterns
A general summary of trends in social organization, similar in scope to the fore¬
going summary of population trends, is not practicable. Human relations and
behaviour are too complex and too little susceptible to precise statistical treatment,
while sources of sociological information are incomplete and not always reliable. It
may be useful, however, to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of
British households and the extent and use of leisure in Britain in order to provide a
background to the information given in later chapters on such matters as town
planning, housing, and transport.
Number and Composition of Households
In Great Britain, as in other countries, most people live as members of private
households (usually families). Less than 5 per cent of the population was enumer¬
ated by the censuses of 1911, 1921, 1931 and 1951 in institutions such as hotels,
schools, and hospitals.
In 1911 there were about nine million private households2 in Great Britain. By
1951, according to the Census One Per Cent Sample Tables, there were about
14I million households, an increase of about 60 per cent. This expansion seems out
of proportion to the 19 per cent increase in the total population for the same period.
It was in fact comparable with the increase in the population of persons over 24
years old and the slightly larger increase in the number of married persons. In other
words, the increasing age of the population meant more but smaller families. The
average size of household in Great Britain fell from 4-5 persons in 1911 to 3-2 in
1951. In England and Wales the number of persons living in households of one or
two persons almost tripled between 1911 and 1951. At the end of this period such
households constituted about 40 per cent of private households and comprised
about 20 per cent of the population in private households. About two-thirds of the
persons living alone in 1951 were 60 years of age or over, while in 43 per cent of
families of two persons, the head of the household was 60 or over.
It has been difficult to increase the number of separate dwelling-places (houses
or flats) sufficiently rapidly to overtake the increasing number of private house¬
holds, and this difficulty was aggravated by the suspension of house-building and
the destruction of property during the second world war. There were in 1951 only
some 13-3 million structurally separate dwelling-places in Great Britain, so that
1 Most of the islands off the west coast of Scotland where Gaelic is spoken are included
in the counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness, and Argyll.
2 Counting persons living alone as one-person households.
i6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
over 2 million households had to share a home (see page 351). It is unofficially
estimated that about three-quarters of all dwellings in Great Britain are terraced or
semi-detached houses (usually of 4 to 6 dwelling-rooms including bedrooms) while
the remaining quarter consists of detached houses and flats in approximately equal
numbers. The proportion of flats is greatly above average in Scotland (estimated at
about 60 per cent) and considerably above average in London (estimated at 17
per cent).
Of the 14! million private households in Great Britain, iij million were esti¬
mated in the 1951 Census Sample to be of the simplest type, comprising married
couples or widowed persons with their children, if any, or persons living alone.
More specifically, they comprised 3-2 million married couples with no children,
900,000 widowed persons living alone, 6-9 million married couples or widowed
persons with children of any age, 600,000 single persons living alone. Over a third
of all married couples living alone were 60 years old or over; less than a quarter of
the married couples under 40 years of age in these simplest types of household had
no children; and the majority of the single persons living alone were over 40 years
old.
Nearly another million households were of these simple types except for the
inclusion of parents or non-married brothers or sisters of the head of the household.
Only 2 million households contained persons less closely related to the head than
parent or brother or sister, or contained non-relatives. There were nearly a million
families consisting of married couples, or married or widowed persons with
children, who were without their own homes, and the majority of these were living
in the homes of their parents. Apart from these satellite family groups, 1,102,700
‘households contained an aggregate of 1,240,000 other persons unrelated or distantly
related to the head of the household, the bulk of whom were presumably of the
status of boarders. Of these more than half a million constituted sole individual
additions to the more normal types of families with married heads. There were
nearly 300,000 households consisting of two persons who were distantly related or
were unrelated to one another.
Over 8 million households (57 per cent of all households) were estimated in the
1951 Census Sample Tables to be without children under 16, while another 3-1
million contained only one child.
In Great Britain as a whole it was estimated that, in 1951, 180,000 households
had resident domestic servants, who numbered, in all, 205,000. Of these, about
half were in households of one or two other persons, and over a quarter were in the
households of single or widowed or divorced persons, 40 years old or over, living
alone except for a servant. A sample analysis of 1931 census data covering only
England and Wales estimated 706,800 resident domestic servants in private house¬
holds, which compares with 178,000 in England and Wales in 1951.
Work and Leisure
The great majority of British males over 15 years of age are in full-time gainful
employment, and the majority of females are either housewives or in full-time
gainful employment (see p. 252). In many cases housewives also undertake part-
time or even full-time employment.
Agreed hours of full-time work for the majority of occupations are usually about
44 hours a week, with some variation on each side. Actual weekly hours worked by
men average a little longer owing to overtime working, and actual hours worked by
women and girls average a little less (see p. 274). To these hours must often be
added the time taken in travel to and from work. According to a sample survey
made in August 1943, over 75 per cent of wage earners in large towns spent half an
THE BRITISH ISLES
17
hour a day travelling to and from work, mainly by public transport, while over
30 per cent spent over an hour in such daily travel. Immediately after the war,
conditions may have improved slightly; the long-term trend, however, is for
journeys to and from work to take longer, in spite of increased public transport, as
more people live on the outskirts of urban areas and as traffic density increases. In
Greater London a sample survey made in 1949 showed that the average time taken
in travelling to and from work was 88 minutes a day.
In addition, there is often a long journey from home to the main shopping centre
in both urban and rural areas. According to a sample survey made in 1946 it
averaged about 18 minutes each way, and in many rural areas took much longer.
In most areas there are, of course, a few shops much closer at hand. Most house¬
wives in urban areas go to the shopping centre at least once a week.
One consequence of the distance from home to work and to shops is the growth
of the habit of eating away from home. Food rationing restrictions during the
second world war and the early post-war years tended to increase this habit, which
has also been encouraged by the establishment of factory and office canteens and
the provision of midday meals in schools. About half the total number of school
children and many adults take some meals regularly outside their homes.
According to a sample survey made in 1947, only 6 per cent of housewives
employ any paid help, and only 1 per cent1 have a resident servant. Housewives
appear, in general, to have rather less leisure and considerably fewer periods of
continuous leisure of over one hour than other persons in Britain.
Most employees, in addition to 1J or 2 days’ holiday each week and 6 statutory
public holidays a year, get at least one week’s continuous holiday in the year, and
an increasing proportion of employees are now entitled to two weeks’ holiday a
year (see page 274). In fact, about half the population take at least a week’s holiday
away from home every year, mostly in July and August. Some two-thirds of these
spend their holiday by the sea in Britain. A relatively small but rapidly increasing
number of holiday-makers go abroad: two million in 1954, including nearly half a
million to the Republic of Ireland.
At least a quarter of the adult population is interested in playing or going to
watch outdoor sports2; the most popular are Association football and cricket. In
England alone about 23,000 football clubs—mainly amateur clubs—are affiliated to
the English Football Association, excluding another 9,000 clubs in the armed forces,
universities and schools. Some 750>000 youths and men play in weekly football
matches during the winter months, apart from those playing in informal games;
spectators at professional football matches number between one and two million
weekly. Cricket is played by children, youths and men of every walk of life,
especially in England. Attendance at first-class cricket matches is somewhat
smaller than at professional football matches, but the ‘Test’ matches with the
cricket teams of Commonwealth countries have become of nation-wide interest.
Cricket is less popular in Scotland, where golf has pride of place. Race meetings
throughout the country draw large crowds, while many other sporting events, for
instance rugby football matches in the winter months and, in the summer, tennis
tournaments, especially the annual lawn tennis championships at Wimbledon, have
their smaller but devoted public. Amateur athletic associations flourish throughout
1 This estimate has been shown to be approximately correct by the analysis of house¬
holds employing servants made in the 1951 Census Sample Tables (see p. 16).
2 A social survey of Derby made in 1953 showed that half the adult population in that
town, including two-thirds of the men, were at least occasional spectators of sporting
events, and that over one-fifth, including over half those under 25 years of age, actually
participated, most of them regularly.
i8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the country, and every form of outdoor pursuit from swimming, hiking, cycling
and motoring1 to hunting, shooting and fishing has an enthusiastic following,
though many sports, such as sailing, gliding, and rock-climbing, are practised only
by relatively few keen amateurs. Climatic and physical conditions in Britain afford
few opportunities for ski-ing and mountaineering, but numbers of people go abroad
regularly for these pursuits.
The spread of television has added a vast new audience of indoor spectators to
the crowds who go to watch sporting events and great national occasions. By the
end of October 1955 one out of every three homes had a television set; viewers are
fairly evenly distributed among all sections of the population, irrespective of
income. The number of television licences is increasing rapidly; in the two years
from end-June 1953 to end-June 1955 the number rose by over 2| million (from
2,415,305 104,676,422); by October 1955 it had exceeded 5 million. Some districts,
however, are still outside the regular range of the transmitters (see pp. 403-4).
Television has caused a considerable fall in cinema attendances and has materially
affected leisure habits in many ways. The cinema remains, however, the most
popular form of indoor entertainment outside the home. A third of all adults,
including two-thirds of those under 25 years of age, and one out of two school
children go to the cinema, on average, at least once a week. Attendances at theatres
are much smaller, though most people visit them occasionally. There are only some
400 to 500 theatres in the country, compared with some 4,700 cinemas, yet the
Derby Survey showed that half of the adult population of that town went to the
theatre more than twice a year. About a quarter of the adult population of Derby
sometimes went to concerts, and in the country as a whole there is known to be
an enthusiastic and growing public for concerts, ballet and opera.
Dancing is popular especially with those under 25 years of age. There have been
estimated to be some 450 to 500 ballrooms in Great Britain, and dances and other
social gatherings are also often held in other halls or in club-rooms. The Derby
Survey showed that in that town nearly half the adult population, including 60 per
cent of the men, belonged to a social, sporting or cultural club and that over a third
of them visited such a club at least once a month.
One traditional social rendezvous, the public house, has maintained and even
increased its popularity, although there has been a marked decrease in drunkenness
and in consumption of alcohol per head since the nineteenth century. The public
house now attracts a very wide circle of casual customers (both men and women)
as well as many ‘regulars’, who meet for a drink and a chat, and perhaps to play
some traditional public house game such as darts. A new, and in some ways rival,
feature of urban life, especially in London, is the coffee bar. A characteristic of
many of these coffee bars, which stay open until late at night and are becoming
increasingly popular as a rendezvous for young people, is their modern ddcor. On
the other hand many people, especially the married and the elderly, spend much of
their leisure at home—reading, listening to the radio, viewing television, or pur¬
suing hobbies. The most widespread hobbies are practical, for example, knitting
and needlework for women and gardening for men. The standard of town and
country gardens is high.
A number of people, young and old, find their main free-time interest in some
form of group activity of a serious nature, connected, for example, with the
churches, trade unionism, politics, social welfare and reform, or with cultural
1 There are some six million motor vehicles licensed at the height of summer, of which
over three million are cars and over one million are motor cycles. Many of the cars,
however, are used partly, if not primarily, for business purposes.

pursuits such as amateur dramatics or music. People with such interests are, of
course, in a minority,1 * 3 but they constitute an important and characteristic feature
of British life and, indeed, an essential ingredient in the working of British
democracy.
1 The figures from the Derby Survey showed that 8 percent of adults in that town belonged
to intellectual or cultural clubs or societies, 11 per cent were members of some political
party, 13 per cent went to church every week (although 9 out of 10 homes had a bible), and
3 per cent held some church office.
II. GOVERNMENT AND
ADMINISTRATION
THE MONARCHY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical state, formed originally in the ninth
century by the unification of all England under a Saxon king, and later expanded
by the conquest of Wales and Ireland1 by kings of England and by the dynastic
union of the English and Scottish thrones in the person of James I of England and
VI of Scotland. The United Kingdom is also a member nation of the Common¬
wealth, of which the Queen is the head.
The form of the Royal title is varied for those member countries of the Common¬
wealth which owe allegiance to the Crown to suit the particular circumstances of
each. India, as a republic, owes no allegiance to the Crown, but accepts the Queen
as the symbol of the free association of the member nations and, as such, as the
head of the Commonwealth.2
Agreement was reached at a meeting of Commonwealth representatives in
December 1952 on the form of the Queen’s title in the various parts of the Com¬
monwealth, and legislation was passed by the Parliaments concerned to enable
the necessary changes to be made.3 The Royal Title in the United Kingdom is:
‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen,
Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the other member
nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, the Queen is
represented by a Governor-General appointed by the Crown on the advice of the
ministers of the country concerned. The function of the Governor-General is to act
in relation to the administration of public affairs according to the constitutional
practice obtaining in the country in which he holds office in regard to the exercise
of the powers of the Crown. As the Queen’s representative he is wholly independent
of the United Kingdom Government; and he is sometimes a national of the country in
which he holds office. In the Dependencies—the Colonies, the Protectorates and the
Trust Territories—the Queen is represented by Governors, High Commissioners or
Residents, who are appointed by the Crown and perform the constitutional func¬
tions of the Crown, but who have in addition varying executive and legislative
powers, and are responsible to the United Kingdom Government for the good
government of the countries concerned.
Each of the member nations of the Commonwealth has its own separate constitu¬
tion, governed by different laws and customs, and subject to different powers of
change. The scope of this chapter will be confined to a description of one of those
nations—namely the United Kingdom—and the machinery and processes through
which its constitution works.
1 In 1920 the United Kingdom was diminished by the separation of the 26 counties of
southern Ireland.
2 The position of Pakistan will be similar when its new republican constitution is
adopted.

20
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
21
Succession
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in spite of
interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle upon which it
was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II is a descendant of the
Saxon king Egbert, who united all England in 829.
The permanence of the monarchy has been ascribed to the fact that the constitu¬
tion of the United Kingdom is governed by conventions rather than by formal law.
Conventions are those parts of the rules and practices under which a system of
government works, which are not part of the law of the land in the sense that viola¬
tion of them may lead to proceedings in a court of law, but which are nevertheless
indispensable to the machinery of government. Since they are based upon usage,
they are not absolutely binding; and they may therefore be adapted to changing
conditions without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement, 1701, which laid it
down that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most excellent
Princess Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants ’. Subsequent Succes¬
sion to the Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration; and although succession is
not bound to continue in its present line, it cannot now be altered (under a provision
of the Statute of Westminster, 1931) except by common consent of the member
nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown.
The inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which provide that
the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the Throne according to their
seniority, or, if there are no sons, the daughters in order of seniority. When a daughter
succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant, and powers of the Crown or Royal Preroga¬
tives2 are vested in her as fully and effectively as though she were a king. By convention,
the consort of a king takes the rank and style of her husband; but the converse does
not apply, and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to
the husband of the Queen-Regnant.
Accession
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession of
another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new Sovereign is
proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of the Privy Council are
summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and
other leading citizens of the City of London, and the High Commissioners in
London of the member nations of the Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
Coronation
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval which
may last for a year or more. The ceremony, which has frequently been modified
in detail to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time, has remained
much the same in substance for nearly a thousand years. The service used at the
coronation of Queen Elizabeth II was derived from the service used at the corona¬
tion of King Edgar at Bath in the year 973.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of repre¬
sentatives of the peers, the Commons and all the great public interests in the United
Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other Common¬
wealth countries, and of representatives of foreign States.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Acts of Government
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the supreme
authority, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in England
and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-in-chief of all the
armed forces of the Crown and the temporal head of the established Church of
England. In practice, as a result of a long evolutionary process, during which many
restrictions on the Royal Prerogative have been imposed, these powers have changed
from being the weapon of the monarchy to being the means of giving effect to the
public will. Today, the Queen acts only on the advice of her ministers which she
cannot constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule. The United King¬
dom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation during
the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers without any
necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts of government which
require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; she opens the new
session with a speech from the throne; and she must give Royal Assent before a Bill
which has passed all its stages in both Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enact¬
ment. The Queen is ‘ the fountain of justice and in spite of the fact that the
judiciary is now completely independent of the executive ‘ all jurisdictions of the
courts are either indirectly or immediately derived from the Crown’. As ‘the foun¬
tain of honour’, the Queen makes appointments to peerages, knighthoods and
other honours; to all important State offices,1 including judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, and diplomats; and to all leading positions in the estab¬
lished Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are required before
a minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the realm of international
affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the State, the Queen has the
prerogative power to conclude treaties, to cede or accept territory, to declare war
and to make peace.
Other prerogative powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by
Royal Charter; the construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of in¬
fants and persons of unsound mind; the administration of charities; coinage; the grant
of franchises, e.g., markets, ferries and fisheries; the right to treasure trove (see
p. 77); and the sole right of printing or licensing others to print the Bible, the
Book of Common Prayer and State papers.
There is clear ministerial responsibility for all these acts of government, as is
shown in the three ways in which the royal will can be constitutionally expressed:
by Order-in-Council (see p. 35) made ‘ by and with the advice of the Privy Council ’;
by Order, Commission or Warrant under the sign manual, which generally bears
the signature of one or more responsible ministers; or by Proclamation, Writs,
Letters Patent, or other documents under the Great Seal affixed by the Lord
Chancellor in obedience to a Royal Warrant countersigned by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the smooth
working of government; for although the Queen has no personal authority and
must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be informed and con¬
sulted on every aspect of the national life to the widest possible extent. The Queen

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has been
made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the
Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or if the Heir Apparent or the Heir Presumptive
is under the age of eighteen on accession to the throne. In the event of the
Sovereign’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision is made for the appoint¬
ment of Counsellors of State to carry out those of the royal functions which are
delegated to them. The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act, 1953—laid down
that the first potential Regent should be the Duke of Edinburgh and thereafter
the Princess Margaret and then those in succession to the throne who are of age.
Ceremonial
Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the British
Isles, and in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered outlook of
both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages are the same today
as they were many centuries ago.
The formal ceremony of Presentation still takes place, although now at the After¬
noon Presentation Parties held by the Queen, which have superseded the former
Courts. Royal marriages, the birth of royal children and royal funerals are still
marked by ancient ceremonial, although to a lesser degree than in former days.
The birthday of the Sovereign, formerly the occasion of many royal and public
functions, is today officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on
the Horse Guards Parade.
State banquets still take place when a foreign monarch or head of State pays
a visit to the United Kingdom; investitures are still held at Buckingham Palace,
although today honours may be bestowed without the personal attendance of the
recipient upon the Sovereign. State processions are still an integral part of royal
ceremonial; they grace such social occasions as the Ascot Race Meeting, known as
Royal Ascot; and they add significance to the opening of Parliament, when the
Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating from
the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal ordinances,
ancient usage, established custom and the public will. The Queen’s presence at
the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial, and charitable works of national
importance ensures nation-wide interest and support.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the House
of Lords and the House of Commons—which together represent all the elements
in the nation.
The three sections of ‘ Parliament ’ in this sense are outwardly separate: they are
constituted on entirely different principles; they do different work in different
places and they meet only on occasions of great symbolic significance such as the
Coronation or the opening of Parliament by the Queen in person, when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making
organ of State, however, Parliament is a corporate body and cannot legislate with¬
out the concurrence of all its parts, except in the case of measures passed under
the Parliament Act, 1949.1
1 See p. 32.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
25
The Parliament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the United
Kingdom; it can legislate for the whole of the United Kingdom, or for Great
Britain, or, separately, for England and Wales, or for Scotland alone. It is not,
however, the only Parliament in the United Kingdom, for Northern Ireland has
its own Parliament (see p. 34), and within the British Islands the ancient legis¬
latures of the two Channel Island Bailiwicks (the States) and of the Isle of Man
(the Tynwald) each legislates on domestic matters although the United Kingdom
Parliament retains supreme authority.1 Nevertheless, the Parliament at West¬
minster has no rival authority, and within practical limits there is nothing that it
cannot legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act, 1911, the normal life of the United King¬
dom Parliament was fixed at five years (although it may be and often is dissolved
in less than that time); and since one Parliament cannot bind its successor (for
otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not be sovereign or supreme), each
assembly has a period of time of up to five years during which it may legislate
exactly as it chooses. During its life, it can make or unmake any law; it can destroy
by statute the most firmly established convention of the constitution; it can legalize
past illegalities and thus reverse the decisions of the courts; and it even has power
to prolong its own life by legislative means beyond the normal period of five years
without consulting the electorate.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice, Parliament
does not attempt to exert its supremacy in this way. In the first place, pressure of
business in recent decades has resulted in a large and increasing amount of delega¬
tion of legislative authority to ministers (see pp. 32-33), and of specific powers to
local authorities and to public corporations of various kinds. Powers delegated in
this way could, of course, be withdrawn by Parliament, but existing demands on
parliamentary time make such a development extremely unlikely. Secondly, the
system of party government in the United Kingdom effectively discourages Parlia¬
ment from acting in too arbitrary a fashion; any parliamentary majority which
abused its powers would almost certainly suffer severely at the hands of the electors.
The Meeting of Parliament
A ‘Parliament’ in the sense of a parliamentary period begins and ends with a
proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council. Such a
proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and on the other
orders the issue of writs for the election of a new one and appoints the day and
place of its meeting.
Formerly the death of a Sovereign involved the dissolution of Parliament, since
Parliament meets on the personal summons of the monarch. Since 1867, however,
when the Representation of the People Act of that year made the duration of Parlia¬
ment independent of the demise of the Crown, both Houses stand adjourned only
until their members have taken the Oath of Allegiance to the new Sovereign, which
occurs immediately after the Accession Council has made the order for Proclamation.
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or dissolution
is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a commission under the Great
Seal, which appoints the day and place of its meeting in a new session. The date so
appointed may be brought forward or deferred by a subsequent proclamation. The
effect of a prorogation is at once to terminate all business until Parliament shall be
1 The channel of communication between the United Kingdom Government and the
local legislatures is the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who advises the
Crown on the exercise of the Royal Prerogatives. The Queen is represented in each of
the Channel Island Bailiwicks and in the Isle of Man by a Lieutenant-Governor.
26
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
summoned again, when any measures not yet passed must be re-introduced, unless
it be decided that they are to be abandoned.
During the session, either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to such
date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business. A re¬
assembly of the House can be accelerated or delayed either by proclamation or
by virtue of powers specially conferred by each House on its Speaker.
The average length of a session is about 160 sitting days divided by custom into
the following periods: one from November until Christmas lasting about 30 sitting
days, one from January to Easter of about 50 sitting days, one from Easter until
Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and one from Whitsun until the end of July
lasting about 40 sitting days. In addition, in recent years, the session has usually
concluded with a short period of about 10 sitting days in October, after the long
summer recess.
The House of Lords
In June 1955 the House of Lords consisted of 878 peers, as follows: (1) princes
of the royal blood (who by custom take no part in proceedings), (2) 26 spiritual peers
—the archbishops and senior bishops of the Church of England, (3) all hereditary
peers (other than minors and those who had not then applied for a writ of summons)
of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom,1 (4) 16 hereditary peers of
Scotland elected from their own number for each Parliament in accordance with
the provisions of the Act of Union, 1707, (5) five representative peers of Ireland
elected for life,2 and (6) several Lords of Appeal in Ordinary appointed to perform
the judicial duties of the House and holding their seats therein for life.
Temporal peerages are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Ministers
of the Crown, as a mark of distinction. All, except the judicial peerages, are heredi¬
tary and, with the exception of the Scottish and Irish peerages, they carry with
them, for men over 21 years of age, a right to a seat in the House of Lords. A sum¬
mons to Parliament cannot be withheld from a peer who is entitled to it, although of
the peers who receive the writ of summons only about one-tenth take any active
part in the work of the House. Party politics have little effect upon the membership
of the House, which remains relatively stable over a long period of time.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who is the Speaker
of the House. The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is
charged with keeping the records of proceedings and judgments and who pro¬
nounces the words of assent to Bills; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who
enforces the orders of the House; and the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Lord
Chancellor.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is a popular assembly elected by an almost universal
adult suffrage and containing members from all sections of the community regard¬
less of income or occupation. There are at present 630 members of the House of
Commons (511 for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
Members of the House of Commons hold their seats during the life of a Parlia¬
ment. They are elected either at a General Election which takes place after
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one summoned by the Sovereign, or at
1 Peerages created between 1707 (the Act for the Union of England and Scotland) and
1800, are peerages of Great Britain; those created since the Act for the Union of Great
Britain and Ireland, 1800, are peerages of the United Kingdom.
2 By the Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, 1800, the Irish peers were
entitled to elect 28 representatives, but since 1922 no new peers have been elected.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

a by-election which is held when a vacancy occurs in the House as a result of the
death or resignation of a member during the life of a Parliament.
For electoral purposes, the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies, each
of which returns one member to Parliament. In order that the people shall at all times
be equitably represented by this means, permanent Boundary Commissions for
England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (established in 1944) keep con¬
stituencies constantly under review and submit periodic reports either recommend¬
ing some alteration in boundaries if, for instance, movement of the population has
made this necessary, or recommending no change. Changes in the boundaries of
constituencies which came into effect for the 1955 General Election increased the
number of seats in the House of Commons from 625 to 630.
Election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot in which all United
Kingdom citizens (except members of the House of Uords) and all citizens of the
Commonwealth and of the Republic of Ireland who are resident in the United
Kingdom are entitled to vote, provided that they are 21 years old or over, and unless
they suffer any legal incapacity to vote. A register containing the names of all
electors is prepared and published yearly by registration officers, who, in England
and Wales, are usually the clerks of local councils, and in Scotland are the lands
valuation assessors. Electors normally vote in person at specially established polling
stations, although Service voters, i.e. members of the armed forces, Crown servants
of the United Kingdom employed overseas, and the wives of such persons if resi¬
dent overseas with their husbands may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or in certain
cases by proxy, may also be allowed if the voter cannot attend in person for such
reasons as illness or the nature of his work. All entitled to vote may stand for
election, except undischarged bankrupts and such persons as clergymen of the
established Churches of England and Scotland, of the Church of Ireland and of
the Roman Catholic Church, and persons holding certain offices of profit under the
Crown.
The chief parliamentary officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is
elected by the members as president of the House immediately after a new Parlia¬
ment is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, and the Deputy-Chairman, who may act as
Deputy-Speaker; both these officers are elected by the House. In addition there are
the party officials, i.e. the Government and Opposition Whips. Non-parliamentary
or permanent officers of the House, i.e. those who are not members of Parliament,
include the Clerk of the Commons, who is charged with such matters as keeping
the records, endorsing Bills and signing Orders; the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends
the Speaker in the House; and the Chaplain to the Speaker.
Parliamentary Privilege
Both Houses of Parliament enjoy certain privileges and immunities designed to
protect them from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out their duties. These
privileges apply collectively to the Houses and individually to each member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown for the
Commons ‘ their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges ’ at the beginning of
each Parliament. These include freedom from arrest1; freedom of speech in debate;
and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege of the House
and is exercised by the Speaker on its behalf. Further privileges include the right
(rarely exercised) to debate in secret; the right to control internal proceedings; and
the right to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare
a seat vacant on such grounds.
1 This does not imply freedom from arrest for a criminal offence or for contempt of court.
28
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The privileges of the House of Lords are (i) freedom from civil arrest for them¬
selves and their servants for a period of 40 days before and after a meeting of
Parliament, (2) freedom of speech in debate, (3) freedom of access to the Sovereign
for each peer individually, (4) the right to commit for contempt, (5) the right to
try and be tried by their fellow peers on charges of treason or felony, and (6) the
right to exclude disqualified persons from taking part in the proceedings of the
House. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker as in the House of
Commons; they exist independently without grant.
The Party System
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth cen¬
tury, and has now become an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the fact that there are three effective political
parties in the United Kingdom: Conservative, Labour and Liberal, each of which
lays rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a General Election, these
parties (and any minor parties that may be in existence at the time) may all put up
candidates for election; independent candidates may also stand. The electorate then
indicates, by its choice of candidate1 at the poll on election day, which of the
opposing policies it would like to see put into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the majority
of votes) at a General Election forms the Government. By tradition, the leader of
the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign, usually on the
formal advice of the retiring Prime Minister; and its most outstanding members in
the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial appointments
on the advice of the Prime Minister. The larger of the two minority parties becomes
the Official Opposition with its own leader and its own council of discussion or
‘shadow Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties or any Independents
who have been elected may support the Government or the Opposition according
to their party’s or their own view of the policy being debated at any given time.
In the General Election which took place on the 26th May i955> 76'8 per cent
of the electorate voted, compared with 76-1 per cent in 1945, §4 Per cent in I95°»
and 82-6 per cent in 1951. The number of votes cast for the principal parties is
shown in Table 3.

1 In the General Election of May 1955, the choice was between Labour and Conservative
in most constituencies. In a few constituencies, two of the parties agreed to support the
same candidate. Liberal candidates numbered no, and the number of candidates repre¬
senting other political parties was very small.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 29
The distribution of seats in the House of Commons resulting from the General
Elections of 1951 and 1955 is shown in Table 4.
TABLE 4
Seats Gained at General Elections in 1951 and 1955
(a) Two Irish Nationalists and one Irish Labour Party.
(b) A majority of 61 (excluding the Speaker) over all other parties. This is the first time
in 90 years that a Government in office has been returned with an increased majority. Sinn
Fein candidates headed the poll in two Northern Ireland constituencies, but as they were
serving sentences of penal servitude (for taking part in an armed raid on an army barracks
in 1954) they were legally incapable of becoming members of Parliament; the Ulster
Unionist candidate was therefore returned in each case.
The effectiveness of the party system rests to a considerable extent upon the fact
that Government and Opposition alike are carried on by agreement: that is to say,
the minority agrees that the majority must govern and, therefore, accepts its deci¬
sions; and the majority agrees that the minority should criticize and, therefore, sets
time aside for that criticism to be heard. As far as is compatible with effective
government, the Prime Minister meets the convenience of the Leader of the Opposi¬
tion and the Leader of the Opposition meets the convenience of the Prime Minister.
Through the respective Whips there is a measure of agreement on the subjects to
be debated and on the time to be allowed; sometimes even on the information to
be provided and the proposed line of attack. In this way, Parliament has a chance
of hearing a full discussion on policy from every point of view.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local organiza¬
tions ; inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Whips, who in addition to their other
functions are expected to keep their forces effective by all means in their power.
For the Government, this work is done by the Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury, the Junior Lords of the Treasury, and the political officers of the House¬
hold—the Treasurer, the Comptroller and the Vice-Chamberlain. The Opposition
Whips have no official position and are not paid from public funds, but their
parliamentary duties are the same.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on forms and rules, many of which date back
to the beginning of the sixteenth century and even earlier.
Each House has its own Standing Orders, but the system of debate is much the
same in the two Houses, except that in the House of Commons the Speaker has a
much greater measure of control. In the House of Lords, the office of Speaker
could be held by a commoner, since the Woolsack on which the Lord Chancellor
sits as Speaker is technically outside the precincts of the House. In fact, the office
is always held by a peer, but it carries with it only a limited authority to check or

curtail debate. The Lords, unlike the Commons, claim the right to overrule their
Speaker forthwith on issues of procedure.
In the Commons, the Speaker has the prime duty of controlling debate. It is his
responsibility to see that parliamentary time is used to the best possible advantage
and, therefore, although he must carefully guard against abuse of procedure or any
infringement of minority rights, he has power to limit unreasonable obstruction and
his rulings on points of order cannot be challenged at the time. The Speaker has
the right to allow or disallow a closure motion (i.e. a motion to curtail or end dis¬
cussion so that the matter may be put to the vote), to check irrelevance in debate,
and to refuse to admit delaying tactics. In cases of grave and continuous disorder,
he may even adjourn the House or suspend the sitting.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number of
votes is cast, the Speaker must give the decisive vote; he does this in such a way as
to avoid change and leave the question to be debated on another occasion.
The Speaker has the responsibility of deciding what is a Money Bill (a Bill deal¬
ing only with national taxation and finance, see p. 31); and who, in case of doubt,
is the Leader of the Opposition. He is also responsible for such extraneous matters
as the decision whether a prima facie case has been made against persons accused
of breach of privilege; the issue of warrants for elections to fill vacancies in the
House; and the appointment of the chairmen of the Standing Committees.
All proceedings of either House (except secret sessions) are public, and a verba¬
tim record is published daily in the official reports Parliamentary Debates {Hansard).
Parliamentary Functions
The main functions of Parliament today are {a) to make laws regulating the life
of the community, {b) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make avail¬
able finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the funds necessary
for the services of the State, and (c) to criticize and control the Government (see
pp. 33-34). By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of certain
international treaties and agreements, in spite of the fact that the making of treaties
is a Royal Prerogative (see pp. 21 and 22) exercised on the advice of the Government
which, strictly speaking, is under no obligation to obtain parliamentary approval at
all. In practice, there are two types of agreement about which Parliament is con¬
sulted : treaties which could not be implemented without legislation; and treaties of
such political importance that the Government feels obliged to arrange a debate on
the matter before becoming committed. In the case of other treaties requiring rati¬
fication, it is customary to presume parliamentary acquiescence unless disapproval
is expressed within 21 days from the date on which the treaty was laid before
Parliament.
In the past, legislation was initiated from both sides of the House; but in present-
day practice almost all Bills are brought forward by the Government in power as a
result of policy decisions taken in the Cabinet at the instigation of those Government
Departments which will be responsible for their administration when the Bills
become law. The chief exceptions are Private Bills,1 which relate solely to some
matter of individual, corporate or local interest, and Private Members’ Bills, which
1 Such Bills begin with a petition, and promoters must give notice of their intention to
all persons and bodies whose interests may be affected by their proposals. Committees
are small, consisting of five members in the Lords and four members in the Commons.
The committee stage is quasi-judicial and provision is made for counsel to represent
supporters and opposers of the Bill.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 31
are Public Bills introduced by members on their own initiative on certain days set
aside expressly for the purpose.
Bills may be introduced in either House, unless they deal with finance or repre¬
sentation, when they are always introduced in the Commons. As a rule, however,
no Bills likely to raise much political controversy are introduced in the Lords, as
the House of Commons is considered a more suitable place of origin for measures
of that kind.
The process of passing a Public Bill is the same in the House of Lords as in the
House of Commons: the Bill receives a formal First Reading on introduction; it is
then printed; and after a period of time (which varies between one and several
weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it may be given a Second Reading as
the result of a debate on its general merits or principles. It is then referred either
to one of the Standing Committees appointed for the purpose by the Committee
of Selection1 2 and composed of members of all parties in the same proportion as in
the whole House, or, in the case of more important measures, to the whole House
sitting in Committee if the House so decides on a motion. During the Committee
stage, members may suggest appropriate amendments, which will be incorporated
into the Bill if the majority of the Committee agrees. When this stage is finished,
the Bill is reported to the House, and a further debate takes place during which the
Committee’s amendments may be altered, additional amendments may be suggested
and incorporated, and, if necessary, the Bill may be recommitted to Committee.
Finally, it is submitted for a Third Reading and, if passed, it is sent on from the
Commons to the Lords or from the Lords to the Commons (depending on its place
of origin), where it enters on the same course again.
An exception to this procedure is made in the case of Money Bills, of which the
two most important are the Finance Bill, which authorizes annual taxation and
amends existing taxation, and the Appropriation Bill, which authorizes expenditure
on the Supply Services from the Consolidated Fund.8 As a general rule, these Bills
must be introduced in the House of Commons upon Resolutions in a Committee of
the whole House and, since their purpose is to raise money for the Crown as a
means of providing for payment of the various services performed by the Crown,
they may be initiated only by a Minister of the Crown.
All Bills which have passed through their various parliamentary stages are sent
to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, which is automatically given either by the
Sovereign in person or (usually) by commission. The right of veto has not been
exercised since the early eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the Com¬
mons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; and they are
then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent. However,
should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would never reach the
Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it—at any rate until a new
Government came into power, when it might be revived. The Lords, on the other
hand, are unlikely to be able to prevent a Bill passed in the Commons from becom¬
ing law. In the normal course of events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons
and return it unchanged; or they amend it and return it for the consideration of
members of the other House, who frequently agree to the amendments made. They
cannot require the Commons to agree to amendments; nor can they delay a Bill
indefinitely. They have no powers in respect of Money Bills; and since the passing

of the Parliament Act, 1949, any other Bill which has been passed by the House of
Commons in two successive sessions may be presented for Royal Assent without
the consent of the Lords, provided that a year has elapsed between the date of the
Second Reading of the Bill in the Commons and the date on which it is finally
passed in that House. These limitations to the powers of the Lords are based on
the fundamental principle that the function of the Upper House, which is a non¬
representative assembly, is not to thwart the will of the people, but to use the com¬
bined experience and wisdom of its members to ensure that that will is precisely
and reasonably interpreted.
Parliamentary Committees
There are three kinds of Parliamentary Committee, all of which exist to a varying
degree to relieve the full assembly of Parliament of some of the details of its more
specialized and complex work. They are: regular Standing Committees (see p. 31)
which are concerned with current legislation; official Parliamentary Committees
such as the Committee of Privileges and the Select Committees on Public Accounts
(see p. 279), on Estimates (see p. 280), on Statutory Instruments, and on the
Nationalized Industries (see p. 137), which are concerned with particular aspects
of parliamentary work; and a number of informal committees, consisting of
members either of one party or of all parties, such as study groups concerning
themselves with particular issues (e.g., the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee,
see p. 384), parliamentary party committees (e.g., the Labour Policy Committee)
and backbenchers’1 organizations (e.g., the Conservative Members’ Committee,
known as the 1922 Committee). These groups have grown up spontaneously and
have a varying degree of influence upon the development of Government policy.
Delegated Legislation
Delegated legislation, which is legislation not by Act of Parliament but by Orders-
in-Council, Orders, Warrants, Regulations and Rules, has been part of the parlia¬
mentary system for at least six hundred years. One of the earliest recorded examples
is to be found in a statute of 1337 which laid down that no wool should be exported
from England ‘till the King and his Council do otherwise provide’. Parliament,
however, made but sparing use of its power to delegate legislation (except during
a period of social, political and economic change in the second half of the fifteenth
and most of the sixteenth centuries) until the end of the nineteenth century, when
a changing conception of the part to be played by the State in the life of the com¬
munity made inroads upon parliamentary time and thus caused the system to be
adopted on a more extensive scale. With the ever-increasing scope of Government
activity in domestic affairs during the past fifty years, pressure on parliamentary
time has become even more acute; as a result the system of delegated legislation
has become generally accepted and there are at present few Acts of Parliament
which do not contain provisions for its use.
The advantages of the system of delegated legislation, which empowers ministers
and other authorities to regulate administrative details after a Bill has become an
Act, are said2 to be: (1) that it shortens and clarifies Bills before Parliament, thus
enabling Parliament to deal with a greater volume of business and to give fuller
attention to matters of policy and principle which are its primary concern; (2) that
it encourages flexibility, for administrative details can be worked out as and when
1 Members who are neither ministers nor, as a rule, ex-ministers.

Law, by Sir C. T. Carr. Oxford University Press. 1942. pp. 33—34.

the necessity arises ‘with greater care and minuteness, and with better adaptation
to local and other special circumstances than they possibly can be during the
passage of a Bill through Parliament’; (3) that it is invaluable in an emergency, for
it is ‘ the means by which the legislature can dispense with its own deliberative
procedure and arm the executive with power to take immediate action’; and (4)
that it provides a speedy, convenient and accurate means of giving effect to the
policy of Parliament.
In order to minimize the risk—inherent in the system—that delegated legislative
powers might supersede or weaken parliamentary government, such powers are
normally delegated to the Queen-in-Council or to authorities directly responsible
to Parliament—to Ministers of the Crown, to Government Departments for which
ministers are responsible or to organizations whose legislation is subject to con¬
firmation or approval by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament
for it. Moreover the Acts of Parliament, by which particular powers are delegated,
frequently provide for some measure of parliamentary control over the legislation
made in exercise of them. There are cases in which an instrument1 must be approved
by Parliament or the House of Commons before it can have permanent operation
(‘ affirmative resolution procedure ’), or in which Parliament or the House of Com¬
mons may secure the annulment of an instrument by a resolution passed within a
certain number of days of the instrument being laid before it (‘ negative resolution
procedure ’), and others in which drafts of proposed instruments must be laid before
Parliament or the House of Commons before they are made and must then be
subject either to affirmative or negative resolution procedure. The resolution, in
the case of an instrument to be annulled after it has been made, takes the form of
a Prayer to Her Majesty that the instrument be annulled (after which the instrument
may be annulled by Order-in-Council).
As a further safeguard, the principal Act generally defines the precise limits of
delegated legislative power; and if these limits are surpassed, the courts can be
moved to declare that the action taken is ultra vires. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation with organizations which will be affected by delegated legislation before
such legislation is made.
Parliamentary Control
Parliament’s function of controlling the Government in power is exercised in the
final analysis by the power of the House of Commons to pass a resolution of
‘ no-confidence ’ in the Government, or to reject a proposal which the Government
considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘ matter of confidence ; and thus
to force the Government to resign.
The financial control necessary to ensure that money shall be spent only with
the authority of Parliament and for the purposes authorized by Parliament is
described on pp. 277-81. Methods of general control are provided by:
(1) the institution of Question Time, which is a daily hour of parliamentary
time during which members may question any minister on matters for
which that minister is responsible, and may thus focus the attention of
the public on the day-to-day processes of government;
1 Almost all delegated legislation of the central Government is enacted by means of
‘ statutory instruments ’, made in accordance with the provisions of the Statutory Instru¬
ments Act, 1946, which repealed and replaced the Rules Publication Act, 1893. Instruments
of delegated legislation made under the Act of 1893 were known as ‘statutory rules and
orders’ (‘S.R. & O.’).
34
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(2) the practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates in Committee of
Supply1 has ceased to be a consideration of the financial requirements of
the Government and has become an occasion, initiated by the Opposition,
for the examination of the Government’s administrative policy2;
(3) the practice of bringing on a debate by moving the adjournment of the
House, which is permitted only if the matter is deemed by the Speaker to
be definite and urgent and to be the responsibility of the Government, and
if 40 members rise in their places to support it, or 10 members rise and the
House grants leave on a division;
(4) the right of members to raise any matter on the motion for the adjournment
of either House at the end of each day’s sitting; and
(5) the power to confirm or annul ministerial Orders and Regulations (see
PP- 32-33).
In addition, Government policy and action are fully discussed in the important
debates which take place during the proceedings at the opening of Parliament and
in the motion for the adjournment of the House before a recess.
The Northern Ireland Parliament
The Northern Ireland Parliament was created by the Government of Ireland
Act, 1920. It is federal in type and consists of the Sovereign, a Senate and a House
of Commons. The Sovereign is represented in Northern Ireland by a Governor,
who summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament in Her Majesty’s name; the
Senate is composed of two ex-officio Senators (the Lord Mayor of Belfast and the
Mayor of Londonderry) together with 24 Senators elected by the House of Com¬
mons according to the principle of proportional representation; and the House of
Commons consists of 52 members, elected by a system of parliamentary franchise
similar to that which operates in the United Kingdom. The House, unless sooner
dissolved, continues in existence for a period of five years.
The Northern Ireland Parliament has power to make laws for the peace, order
and good government of Northern Ireland in relation to all matters except those
especially reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, i.e. the Crown or
succession to the Crown; foreign relations; defence; the postal services; the judi¬
ciary , customs and excise; income and profits taxes; coinage; standards of weights
and measures; trade marks; submarine cables; wireless telegraphy; aerial naviga¬
tion, and lighthouses, buoys and beacons. The Northern Ireland Parliament is also
prohibited from making laws which would interfere with religious freedom, and
from taking property without compensation.
In consequence of these reservations, provision was made in the Government
of Ireland Act for the continued representation of the Northern Ireland consti¬
tuencies in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; by virtue of this pro¬
vision, 12 members are returned to Westminster.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Before the emergence of the system of Cabinet government in the eighteenth
century, the King-in-Council or the Privy Council was the chief source of executive
power in the State. As this system developed, however, the Privy Council declined
in importance, many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet, and much of its
1 See p. 278.
2 Such an examination must relate to a matter included in the Estimates.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
35
work was handed over to newly created Government Departments. The present-
day Privy Council exists mainly to give effect to policy decisions made elsewhere.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are sworn of
the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council (which is
retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Prime
Minister as an honour to persons who have reached eminence in some branch of
public affairs in any country of the Commonwealth. In mid-1955 there were just
under 300 Privy Counsellors.
Procedure and Functions
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk to the Council. At meetings where
the Sovereign is present, three Privy Counsellors form a quorum, but in practice
never fewer than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy Council is called
together only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his
or her intention to marry.
Meetings of the Privy Council are presided over by the Lord President of the
Council, who is appointed by Letters Patent under the Great Seal. The duties of
the Lord President in connection with the Privy Council are to attend the
Sovereign’s person, to manage the debates in council, to put forward proposals from
the Sovereign at the council table and to report to the Sovereign the resolutions
of the Council thereon. Since 1660 the office of Lord President has been a political
appointment held by a member of the party in power, who is usually a leading
member of the Cabinet, free to undertake duties of a general nature.
The Privy Council is responsible for the making of Orders-in-Council, of which
there are two kinds differing fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made
in virtue of the Royal Prerogative as, for example, in the ratification of treaties; and
those which are authorized by Act of Parliament and are a form of delegated legisla¬
tion (see pp. 32-33). Members of the Privy Council attending meetings at which
Orders-in-Council are made do not thereby become personally responsible for the
policy upon which the Orders are based; this rests with the ministers in whose
Departments the draft Orders were framed, whether they are present at the meeting
or not. All Orders-in-Council must be published in the London Gazette.1
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of Royal Proclamations—
documents whose lawful use is restricted to prerogative acts such as summoning,
proroguing or dissolving Parliament, and which are of the same validity as Acts of
Parliament.
Committees of the Privy Council
Advisory functions still belong to the committees of the Council, whose meetings
differ from the meetings of the full Council in that the Sovereign cannot constitu¬
tionally be present. These committees may be prerogative, such as the committee
which deals with matters relating to Jersey and Guernsey, and the committees
for medical research, scientific and industrial research, agricultural research and
nature conservation; or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and for the Scottish universities, and that
which deals with applications for the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
The Privy Council Office
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in the
Privy Council Office, which is an ancient prerogative Department under the control

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
36
of the Lord President of the Council. It is also carried out in the Office of the Lord
President of the Council.
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal on
certain legal issues arising in Australia and New Zealand and their dependencies,
in Ceylon, and in the United Kingdom dependent territories.1 Its appellate jurisdic¬
tion derives from the principle of English common law which recognizes ‘ the right
of all the King’s subjects to appeal for redress to the King-in-Council ’ if they
believe that the courts of law have failed to do them justice.
Appeals come to it either where a right of appeal in limited categories of cases
has been specially created, e.g., by Statute, Order-in-Council or Letters Patent, or
by special leave of the Queen-in-Council on the advice of the Judicial Committee.
Appeals are heard by a board of three or five drawn from the committee, depending
on the significance of the case, the quorum being three. Invitations to sit on the
board are issued by the Lord Chancellor, who thus determines which members of
the committee shall hear particular appeals. In practice, boards are generally
selected from the Law Lords of the United Kingdom—the Lord Chancellor,
ex-Lord Chancellors and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary—although ex-judges of
English and Scottish courts are asked to sit when business is heavy. Chief Justices
and certain judges from other Commonwealth countries have usually been sworn
of the Privy Council and may be invited to sit on the committee’s boards.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time being
with the administration of national affairs.2
Composition
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The usual minis¬
terial offices may be classified under the following heads:
(1) The Prime Minister (see also pp. 37-38), who is the recognized head of the
Government but has no Department.
(2) Departmental Ministers, some of whom are known as Secretaries of State.
There are at present seven Secretaries of State—for the Home Department,
Foreign Affairs, Scotland, Commonwealth Relations, Colonies, War, and
Air. Most of the more recently created posts have the formal title of
‘ Minister’. There are Ministers of Agriculture, Fisheries and F ood; Defence;
Education; Fuel and Power; Health; Housing and Local Government; Lab¬
our and National Service; Pensions and National Insurance; Supply; Trans-
port and Civil Aviation; and Works. A few of the older posts have special
titles: the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury
and for a number of other financial and central Departments); the President
of the Board of Trade; the First Lord of the Admiralty; and the Postmaster-
General.
1 Until 1949, right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council also existed
in Canada, India, South Africa and Pakistan, but these countries then abolished the right.
The Republic of Ireland abolished the right by the Constitution (Amendment No. 22)
Act, 1933.

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
37
(3) Non-Departmental Ministers, or Ministers with few or no departmental
duties, who are the holders of various traditional offices, e.g., the Lord
President of the Council,1 the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster2 3; and, at present, a Minister Without Portfolio.
(4) The Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers. The Lord Chancellor has a
Department, but is in a somewhat special position as a Minister of the
Crown who is also head of the Judiciary in England and Wales. The four
Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the Attorney-
General and the Solicitor-General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate and
the Solicitor-General for Scotland.
(5) Ministers of Statef who are deputy Ministers in Departments where the
work is particularly heavy or involves frequent travelling overseas. There
are at present five Ministers of State.
(6) Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary
or, where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under¬
secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to
relieve their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in
parliamentary debates and answering parliamentary questions, and by
assisting in their departmental duties. The Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury and the Junior Lords of the Treasury are in a different category
as Government Whips (see p. 29).
All senior ministers are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the
Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, since the
approval of that House is necessary for the general policy (and frequently for the
specific proposals) of the Government. There must, however, always be some
ministers in the House of Lords, partly because the Ministers of the Crown Act,
I937, limits the number of ministers who may sit in the Commons while receiving
salaries from the Crown, and also because every Government must be assured of
spokesmen of standing to expound and justify its intentions and its actions to the
Lords.
The Prime Minister
The office of Prime Minister as head of the Government has been in existence
since the middle of the eighteenth century. The office is a conventional one in that
it is not defined by statute or rule of common law, and the Prime Minister’s official
title is First Lord of the Treasury. In 1905, however, the Prime Minister was given
1 The Lord President of the Council, who controls the Privy Council Office, is respon¬
sible to Parliament for the work of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research,
the Medical Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council, the Nature Conservancy
and the Atomic Energy Authority, and has a general oversight of scientific questions.
2 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed
by the reigning Sovereign, although kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and
separately administered. Full power to manage and control the Duchy is delegated by
the Sovereign to the Chancellor, who is the chief officer of the Duchy Council. The
Chancellorship is now a political appointment carrying with it Cabinet rank. Since the
Duchy duties of the Chancellor are not onerous, he is free to perform any special functions
which may be entrusted to him by the Prime Minister.
3 Departments which have a Minister of State are the Foreign Office (two), the Colonial
Office and the Board of Trade. The Secretary of State for Scotland also is assisted at
ministerial level by a Minister of State.

precedence as the fourth person in the realm after the Royal Family.1 The unique
position of authority enjoyed by the Prime Minister derives on the one hand from
his status as leader of the majority party in Parliament and on the other from his
power to submit his own choice of ministers to the Sovereign and to obtain their
resignation or dismissal individually.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Crown of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; to exercise a general
supervision over Departments, settling Departmental differences where possible
and approving important Departmental decisions where Cabinet reference is
not required; to be prepared to speak in Parliament both on general subjects and
on the most important Government Bills; and to answer to Parliament for all actions
of the Government, both at home and abroad. Only the Prime Minister can recom¬
mend to the Sovereign a dissolution of Parliament if he wishes to put the Govern¬
ment’s policy to the country before the normal time for a General Election has
come. The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include recommending the
appointment of Church of England archbishops, bishops, some senior dignitaries,
and incumbents of Crown livings, as well as that of the Lord Chief Justice and of
the holders of other high judicial offices, Lords Lieutenant of Counties,2 Trustees
of National Museums and Regius Professors in certain universities. He also makes
recommendations for the awards of most civil honours and distinctions.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is a conventional organ of government composed of a number of
ministers selected by the Prime Minister. Membership is not fixed by statute,
although certain ministers are always appointed; the number of members is now
usually less than 20.
The system of Cabinet government came into being as one of the results of the
passing of the Bill of Rights in 1689. In origin it was an informal gathering of those
Privy Counsellors who were also ministers, meeting at first with, and later without,
the Sovereign. The Cabinet assumed its present shape when the accession of the
Hanoverian kings with their limited knowledge of the English language, the British
constitution and the British way of life had severely curtailed the personal participa¬
tion of the Sovereign in executive government and made it essential that a substitute
should be found.
The Cabinet is not in itself an executant in that it has no legal authority, its
decisions being valid by convention and not by law. It is designed to formulate
general policy, to bring about co-operation between the different forces of the
State without interfering with their legal independence, and to exercise general
control. Its functions3 are:
(1) the final determination of the policy to be submitted to Parliament;
(2) the supreme control of the national executive in accordance with the policy
agreed by Parliament;
(3) the continuous co-ordination and delimitation of the authority of the
several Departments of State.
In the performance of its functions the Cabinet makes considerable use of a
system of committees. The beginnings of this system can be traced back to the

nineteenth century and it has been developed to keep pace with government busi¬
ness during the past fifty years. The system involves the reference of any issue
either to one of the standing Cabinet committees or to an ad hoc committee com¬
posed of the ministers primarily concerned, which considers the matter in detail
and either disposes of it or reports upon it to the full Cabinet with recommendations
for action.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential. Its
members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose any informa¬
tion. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publication of Cabinet as well as of other
State papers, and a resigning minister desiring to make a statement involving dis¬
closure of Cabinet discussions must first obtain the permission of the Sovereign
through the Prime Minister. The theoretical reason for this secrecy is that a Cabinet
decision is advice to the Sovereign, whose consent is necessary before it is made
public. From a practical point of view, secrecy is essential in the interests of unpre¬
judiced debate, which can take place only if there is no risk of publicity for every
statement made and every point conceded.
In normal times, the Cabinet meets for about two hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is not
sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any time if a
matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. During Cabinet meetings, deci¬
sions are reached on major issues of Government policy, and the Cabinet settles
any matters which cannot be disposed of at lower levels.
Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend Cabinet meetings when matters
affecting their Departments are under discussion; they may also be members of
Cabinet committees.
Detailed accounts of Cabinet meetings are not prepared; only the substance of
documents submitted, together with a summary of the arguments and the conclu¬
sions, are recorded; and even these records have a strictly limited circulation.
Responsibility for the keeping of records lies with the Secretariat of the Cabinet,
known as the Cabinet Office (see p. 41).
Ministerial Responsibility
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which ministers
share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual responsibility
of ministers to Parliament for the work of their Departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the middle
of the nineteenth century, imposes upon ministers the obligation to act not as
individuals but (in the interests of stability of government) as a united group. It
does not require every Cabinet minister to be present at every Cabinet meeting;
and the obligations of individual ministers may be passive rather than active when
the decision to be taken does not relate to their spheres of administrative responsi¬
bility. At the same time, every minister should be fully informed of the subject of
discussion beforehand, so that if he has any objections he may voice them at the
meeting. He may not repudiate, either in Parliament or in his constituency, policies
which have received Cabinet approval, nor may he adopt policies which have not
been agreed with other Departments (including the Treasury) who may be
concerned. He must be prepared to vote with the Government on all issues, and
where necessary to speak in support or defence of its policy. Any minister who feels
himself unable to agree or to compromise with the view of the majority of his
colleagues in Parliament or elsewhere must resign. If he does not resign, he is held
D
40 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to be responsible, and cannot afterwards reject criticism on the ground that he did
not personally agree with the policy adopted.
The doctrine of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet is bound to
offer unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his Depaitment means
that, as political head of that Department, he is answerable for all its acts and
omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of administration, any
injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be criticized in Parlia¬
ment, whether he is personally responsible or not.
Since the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in person.
Ministers who are in the House of Lords must be represented in the Commons by
political subordinates qualified to speak on their behalf, i.e. by their Parliamentary
Secretaries and Under-Secretaries. Responsibility, however, cannot be delegated
and remains with the senior minister concerned.
Ministers are expected to take all decisions relating to their spheres of administra¬
tion, unless these are of such political importance that in their opinion Cabinet
sanction is required. ... .
If any departmental decision brings a minister under fire of criticism in Parlia¬
ment he may be upheld by the Cabinet, which will then treat the matter as one of
confidence in itself; or he may be disowned, when he alone will be liable to lose
office. . . , ...
Ministerial responsibility is an effective way of bringing government under public
control, for the knowledge that any departmental action may be reported to and
examined in Parliament discourages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered
decisions.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government Departments exist for the most part to assist ministers in the dis¬
charge of their functions by providing information and advice as a basis for the
formation of policy, and by putting that policy into effect when the necessary
legislation has been passed. Both in their advisory and executive capacities Govern¬
ment Departments may and frequently do work with and through local authorities
(see p. 63), public corporations (see pp. 130 and 136-7), and many Government-
sponsored organizations which, while not forming part of Government Depart¬
ments, are under varying degrees of Government control.
A change of Government does not generally affect the number or functions of
Government Departments, although a radical change in policy may be accompanied
by a corresponding change in the Departments concerned. The widening scope
of Government activity has, however, led to the formation of a substantial number
of new Departments in the past half-century. A few have existed for over 200
years. .
The work of some Departments, e.g., the Post Office and the Customs and bxcise
Department, covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other Departments cover
Great Britain (England and Wales, and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland), e.g.,
the Ministry of Labour and National Service; others cover England and Wales
only, e.g., the Ministry of Health, and there are similar but separate Departments
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some Departments, e.g., the Ministry of
Education, make special arrangements for Welsh affairs.
Departments differ in size and in the number, type and complexity of their
functions, and some have regional and local offices. Most Departments have a minister
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
41
of their own in control; a very few have no minister responsible to Parliament,
e.g., the Exchequer and Audit Department under the Comptroller and Auditor
General, who is an officer of Parliament and not of the Government; and some are
in charge of ministers who have other duties. For instance, Treasury ministers are
responsible for the administration of a number of Departments, including H.M.
Stationery Office, the Central Office of Information, the Treasury Solicitor’s
Department, the Central Land Board, the Departments of the Government
Actuary and of the Government Chemist, the Royal Mint, the National Debt Office,
the Public Works Loan Board, the National Savings Committee and certain
museums and art galleries.
This section provides an outline of the principal functions of the main Govern¬
ment Departments. Since much of their work is interconnected, they are not
grouped according to the subjects with which they deal, but are arranged in
alphabetical order, except for the Cabinet Office and the Treasury (which, in view
of their central position, are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern Ireland
Departments, which are grouped at the end of the section. Further information on
the work undertaken by the various Departments is given in later sections of this
handbook under the relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office, or Secretariat of the Cabinet, was introduced as an emer¬
gency institution during the first world war and has grown into an organ of great
importance in the co-ordination of policy at the highest level. The Secretariat is
responsible for the keeping of Cabinet records, for providing information and advice
to ministers, and for issuing directives or promulgating decisions of the Cabinet or
the Prime Minister to the Departments concerned. It has a military side and a civil
side. There is also a Central Statistical Office which is charged with the collection,
analysis and presentation of statistics relating to the national economy.
The Treasury
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the First
Lord of the Treasury (who is now invariably the Prime Minister), the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and five Junior Lords. In practice the Lords Commissioners
never meet as a Board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer assisted by two junior ministers, the Financial Secretary and the
Economic Secretary. There is also a Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury who
is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons (see p. 29).
The functions of the Treasury fall under four main headings: finance, control of
expenditure, general Civil Service establishment matters, and co-ordination of
economic policy. Finance may be further sub-divided into home finance and
oversea finance. Home finance includes taxation policy (though executive responsi¬
bility for the collection of revenue lies with the Board of Inland Revenue and the
Department of Customs and Excise), the provision of funds for the day-to-day
needs of the public services, currency and banking, and the management of the
national debt. Oversea financial questions have formed a greatly increased part of
the Treasury’s work since the second world war because of the post-war emphasis
on the problem of the balance of payments.
Control of expenditure is a matter partly for Parliament, partly for the Treasury,
and partly for the Departments themselves. Treasury control arises very largely out
of Parliamentary control and the scrutiny of detailed annual estimates for the great
majority of Government expenditure. The Treasury responsibility in general Civil
Service questions has developed gradually out of the control of expenditure.
42 Britain: an official handbook
In the last ten years the Treasury has acquired a new function of co-ordination
in economic affairs. This has come about for two reasons: the acceptance by succes¬
sive Governments since the war of responsibility for maintaining full employment,
and the need to safeguard the balance of payments by ensuring that economic
resources are directed to essential ends. . , . ,
Attached to the Treasury is the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, in which
Government Bills are prepared for introduction into Parliament.
The Admiralty , , .
The Board of Admiralty has been in existence since 1708. It is served by the
Admiralty Divisions of the Naval Staff and the Admiralty Departments.
The Divisions of the Naval Staff deal with operational and technical policy. I he
Departments deal with the manning of the ships and establishments; the provision
of warships and other vessels, aircraft, weapons and munitions, stores, fuel and
other goods, equipment and reserve forces; the general organization and administra¬
tion of the Fleets and establishments; and the accounting and administration of the
moneys voted by Parliament for these purposes. _ . ,
The Admiralty is also responsible for the Government’s economic policy in the
shipbuilding and ship repair industries and certain minor allied industries.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was established by Order-in-
Council in April 1955 and assumed the responsibilities previously discharged by
the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Food.
The Department has a general responsibility for food supplies, both home pro¬
duced and imported, for food manufacture and food distribution. Its statistical
work ranges from crop returns to analyses of food production and distribution, or
analyses of the diet of various sections of the population; and its economic appraise¬
ments range from the annual review of farm prices to assessments of food and
agricultural imports in relation to the country’s balance of payments.
The Department is responsible generally for the efficiency of the agricultural,
horticultural and fishing industries in England and Wales.1 This involves super¬
vision over County Agricultural Executive Committees who act locally as the
Minister’s agents; the administration of schemes to improve the quality of live¬
stock, to control or eradicate animal diseases, to control pests, and to facilitate
production on marginal land; the provision of technical advice on all aspects of
food production; responsibility for agricultural education, for research as applied
to agriculture, horticulture and fisheries, and for such questions as land drainage,
the enforcement of agricultural wages awards and labour supply. With other
Government Departments, the Department is concerned with the improvement of
such rural services as housing, farm buildings, water supplies and electricity, and
with the supply of machinery, fertilizers and seeds.
The Department administers in England and Wales the guarantees to farmers
under the Agriculture Act, 1947 5 and in this connection it operates deficiency
payments schemes for fatstock and for the main cereal crops, and a support price
scheme for eggs. It is also generally responsible for schemes for milk, potatoes and
wool operated through producers’ marketing boards. Other subsidies operated by
the Department include those on bread and on the ‘ welfare foods (liquid and drie
milk, orange juice, and cod liver oil) for mothers and young children.
1 For the operational control of epidemic diseases of animals, e.g., foot-and-mouth
disease, and for the control of plant diseases and pests the Ministry’s responsibilities also
extend to Scotland.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
43
The Ministry has primary responsibility for administering part of the food and
drugs legislation, in particular that part dealing with the composition of food and
with labelling and advertising. It is responsible for matters concerning slaughter¬
houses and for the inspection of meat, and for enforcing legislation relating to the
quality and cleanliness of milk.
The Department maintains relations with Commonwealth and other oversea
countries interested in the United Kingdom as a market for their food exports;
and operates such schemes as the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. It contributes
to the work of a number of international bodies including the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, the Organization for European Economic
Co-operation, and, for food defence planning purposes, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
The Department is also responsible for the Ordnance Survey and for Kew
Gardens.
The Air Ministry
The Air Council was established in 1918 under the presidency of the Secretary
of State for Air to provide for the growing importance of aircraft in warfare by
taking over responsibility for the administrative control of the Royal Air Force.
The functions of the Air Ministry include strategic planning; the manning of the
Royal Air Force and its reserves and auxiliaries; the organization of flying, technical
and general training; the acquisition of lands required for air force purposes; and
the supervision of the finance and contracts of the Royal Air Force.
The Meteorological Office operates the State weather service. It has existed since
1855, at first under the Board of Trade, then as a self-contained unit, and since
1920 as a part of the Air Ministry. The Office provides meteorological services for
the general public, Government Departments, the Armed Forces and civil aviation.
It organizes meteorological observations in the United Kingdom and at certain
stations overseas and undertakes the collection, publication and distribution of
meteorological information from all parts of the world. Research is undertaken at
Dunstable (Bedfordshire), Harrow (Middlesex) and London, and at observatories
at Kew (Surrey), Eskdalemuir (Dumfriesshire) and Lerwick (in the Shetland
Islands).
The Colonial Office
The Colonial Office is the Department of the United Kingdom Government
whtch deals with the affairs of the great majority of the non-self-governing countries
of the Commonwealth. At the head of the Colonial Office is the Secretary of State
for the Colonies, who is the Minister responsible to Parliament for the general
administration of those territories. The main functions of the Colonial Office
are to convey to Colonial Governments the views and wishes of Her Majesty’s
Government on broad matters of policy; to see that the interests of Colonial
Governments and peoples are safeguarded and promoted; to provide, through
its staff of professional advisers and with the help of Advisory Committees com¬
posed of men and women eminent in many fields, guidance to Colonial Govern¬
ments on a wide range of matters; and to undertake expert services of many kinds,
including the allocation of moneys for development purposes under the Colonial
Development and Welfare Acts and the provision of administrative and profes¬
sional staff for the Oversea Civil Service. Other functions of the Colonial Office
include the care of Colonial students in the United Kingdom, the British Council
acting as agent in providing for their general welfare.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Colonial Office does not directly administer the non-self-governing terri¬
tories with which it deals. Each of these has its own administration and an increasing
measure of autonomy.
Her Majesty's Oversea Civil Service. Members of this Service are employed in
the public service of the territory in which they serve and are paid by the Govern¬
ment of that territory. The Service merges the former administrative and profes¬
sional branches of the Colonial Service. Its members are eligible for employment
in any post which the Secretary of State for the Colonies is requested or authorized
to fill and may be considered, as opportunity offers, for posts in Commonwealth
or foreign territories for which the United Kingdom Government may be invited
to recommend candidates. Recruitment into this Service is undertaken in the
United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries when suitably qualified local
candidates are not available for appointment to the territorial public service.
The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations are appointed
by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to act as commercial and financial agents
in the United Kingdom for the Governments of the territories for which he is
responsible. They also act by special arrangement for other Governments and
bodies.
The Commonwealth Relations Office
The Commonwealth Relations Office is the main channel of communication
between the United Kingdom Government and the Governments of the other
member nations of the Commonwealth—Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South
Africa, India, Pakistan and Ceylon. Through it, consultation and exchange of infor¬
mation takes place with the External Affairs Departments of those Commonwealth
countries, either directly or through United Kingdom High Commissioners, on
all subjects of mutual interest—foreign affairs, defence co-operation, economic
and other matters. Where foreign policy is concerned, the Office works in close
association with the Foreign Office.
The Commonwealth Relations Office is also responsible for the conduct of rela¬
tions with the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland1 and for the administration
of the High Commission Territories—Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate
and Swaziland.
The Commonwealth Relations Office was established in 1947, replacing the
Dominions Office (set up in 1925). In the same year the conduct of relations with
India and Pakistan was transferred to the Commonwealth Relations Office from
the India Office, which was abolished, and in 1948 the Office assumed similar
responsibility in respect of Ceylon, which in that year became an equal member of
the Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth Relations Office remains the Department responsible for
the conduct of relations between the United Kingdom Government and the
Government of the Irish Republic, which left the Commonwealth in 1949.
The Customs and Excise Department
Commissioners to collect the Customs and the Excise revenues were first
appointed by the Long Parliament in 1643 (although after the Restoration the
older method of collection through private contractors was again resorted to for

a time). The two branches of the Revenue remained distinct until 1909, when
they were amalgamated under Commissioners of Customs and Excise. The
primary work of the Customs and Excise Department is to collect and administer
the duties of Customs and Excise imposed from time to time in the annual Finance
Acts or by other legislation, and to advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on
any matters connected with them. The Department is also responsible for prevent¬
ing and detecting evasion of the Revenue laws, including smuggling and illicit
distillation.
In addition to its revenue work the Department undertakes a wide range of
non-revenue agency work for other Departments, e.g., the enforcement of prohibi¬
tions and restrictions on the importation and exportation of certain classes of goods,
exchange currency control, and the compilation of United Kingdom oversea trade
statistics from Customs import and export documents.
The Ministry of Defence
The Ministry of Defence was formally constituted in January 1947 following the
passing of the Ministry of Defence Act, 1946. The Act charges the Minister with
the responsibility for ‘ the formulation and general application of a unified policy
relating to the armed forces of the Crown as a whole and their requirements ’. He
carries out this responsibility in accordance with general defence policy laid down
by the Cabinet.
In addition to its main function of co-ordinating the policies and requirements of
the three armed Services, the Ministry is responsible for the administration of
certain inter-service organizations, such as Amphibious Warfare Headquarters, the
Joint Intelligence Bureau and the Imperial Defence College.
The Ministry of Education
The Ministry of Education was established in 1944 to take over the powers and
duties previously exercised by the Board of Education (1899-1944) in regard to
the promotion of.the education of the people of England and Wales and of the
progressive development of institutions devoted to that purpose. The Ministry
exercises this function in co-operation with the local education authorities—the
councils of the counties and of the county boroughs—whose duty it is to secure
the provision in their areas of adequate facilities for all forms of education. On
professional matters, contact with the local education authorities is maintained
through Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Schools, organized in regional divisions
throughout England and Wales for its work of inspection, liaison and advice. A
separate Welsh Department of the Ministry deals with education in Wales.
The Ministry is concerned with the development of primary, secondary and
further education, including vocational education and education for leisure and
the social and physical training of young people. It deals with the supply, training
and superannuation of teachers; the building of new schools and other institutions;
the school health service; the special educational treatment of handicapped children;
and the provision of school meals and milk. It is responsible for the award of State
scholarships and other awards for university students; for the administration of
certain museums; and for the maintenance of educational relations with the
countries of the Commonwealth, with foreign countries, and with the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
The Imperial Institute, which was founded in 1893, has since 1949 been the
responsibility of the Minister of Education. The Institute houses permanent
exhibitions of the peoples and products of the Commonwealth, shows films on
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
46
Commonwealth subjects, and does much educational work in co-operation with
the schools. It also arranges lectures and conferences and has study and recreational
accommodation for Commonwealth students. The Institute is financially depen¬
dent on an endowment fund and on grants from the United Kingdom and other
Commonwealth Governments.
The Foreign Office
The Foreign Office, which is the headquarters of Her Majesty’s Foreign Service,
first became a separate Department of State in 1782. The Minister in charge of
the Foreign Office, and responsible to Parliament for the conduct of foreign affairs
and for the direction and operation of the Foreign Service, is styled Her Majesty’s
Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
The Foreign Office acts as a channel of communication between the Government
of the United Kingdom and the Governments of foreign States, either through
the representatives of foreign States in the United Kingdom or through Her
Majesty’s representatives abroad, for the discussion and negotiation of all matters
falling within the field of international relations, including the drawing up of inter¬
national treaties and agreements. It also provides the means by which the United
Kingdom Government is represented in the United Nations and on other inter¬
national bodies and is kept informed of developments in foreign countries; by
which British subjects and interests abroad are protected and trade promoted; and
by which British policy is explained to the Governments and peoples of foreign
countries. The questions dealt with by the Foreign Office are primarily of a political
nature, but they also include many other matters such as questions of nationality,
the issue and renewal of passports, and the immunities and privileges of foreign
diplomatic representatives.
Her Majesty's Foreign Service. The Foreign Office is staffed by members of the
Foreign Service, which is a separate and self-contained Service of the Crown formed
in 1943 as a result of the amalgamation of the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic
Service with the Consular and Commercial-Diplomatic Services. It provides an
interchangeable staff for service both at home and at United Kingdom diplomatic
missions and consular posts abroad.
The Forestry Commission
The Forestry Commission was established under the Forestry Acts, 1919-47,
to promote the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation, and the
production and supply of timber in Great Britain; the Forestry Act, i95I> places
responsibility on the Forestry Commissioners for the maintenance of reserves of
growing trees, through a system of licensing of felling.
The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for
Scotland are responsible for forest policy in Great Britain.
The Ministry of Fuel and Power
The Ministry of Fuel and Power was established in 1942, when it absorbed the
former Mines and Petroleum Departments of the Board of Trade and the Board’s
functions in relation to gas and electricity. It was made permanent by the Ministry
of Fuel and Power Act, 1945.
The Ministry has the general duty of ensuring the effective and co-ordinated
development of fuel and power supplies in Great Britain, and of promoting
economy and efficiency in their distribution and consumption. The business of
producing and distributing gas and electricity and of producing coal is operated
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
47
by the boards of the three nationalized industries, whose members are responsible
to the Minister on policy issues. The distribution of coal and coke is carried out,
under Ministry control, largely by private concerns. The Ministry is also responsible
for Government relations with the petroleum industry.
The Acts and Regulations governing the safety and he’alth of workers in and
about coal mines, metalliferous mines and quarries are administered by the Safety
and Health Division of the Ministry, which includes the Inspectorate of Mines.
The Ministry is responsible for the general co-ordination of fuel research, and the
Chief Scientist’s Division itself conducts or arranges for scientific research on
specific projects and on matters affecting safety and health in mines and quarries.
The General Register Office
The General Register Office, which is under the Minister of Health for purposes
of parliamentary control, is responsible under the Registrar General for the
administration of the system of civil registration in England and Wales, for the
preparation of statistics and reports relating to population, fertility, births, mar¬
riages, diseases and deaths, and for making arrangements for the periodic census
of the population.
The Ministry of Health
The Ministry of Health, created in 1919 to take over the powers and duties
previously attaching to the Local Government Board (established in 1871) and the
National Health Insurance Commission (formed in 1912), assumed in 1920 the
responsibilities in connection with mental illness formerly attached to the Home
Office.
Twice since 1944 there has been a transfer of some of the Ministry’s main
responsibilities to newly created Departments—in 1945 those in respect of national
health insurance and contributory pensions to the Ministry of National Insurance
(now the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance), and in 1951 those in respect
of housing, water and sewerage services, and the supervision of local government to
the Ministry of Local Government and Planning (now the Ministry of Housing and
Local Government).
The main function of the Ministry of Health is now the administration of the
National Health Service in England and Wales under the National Health Service
Acts. The Ministry is also responsible in England and Wales for general food
hygiene, for supervising the work of local authorities under certain sections of the
Public Health Acts, for welfare food services, and for providing for the care of
the aged, infirm, blind, deaf and dumb and other handicapped persons under the
National Assistance Act, 1946.
On the amalgamation of the Ministry of Pensions with the Ministry of National
Insurance in 1953, the medical and surgical treatment of war pensioners—including
the management of hospitals and the supply of artificial limbs, surgical appliances
and invalid vehicles—hitherto the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions, was
transferred in England and Wales to the Ministry of Health (and in Scotland to
the Department of Health for Scotland). The responsibility of the Ministry of
Pensions for the medical treatment of war pensioners in the Channel Isles and
the Isle of Man and of those residing in the Irish Republic was also transferred to
the Ministry of Health on that date.
The Home Office
rI he Home Office was created in 1782. Its head is the Secretary of State for the
Home Department (the Home Secretary), who is the principal Secretary of State
48 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and is entrusted with all the responsibilities of national administration which have
not been especially assigned by law or convention to the remaining Secretaries of
State or Ministers. The Home Secretary is also the channel of communication
between the Sovereign and his or her subjects, and between the United Kingdom
Government and the Governments of Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man. In October 1951 the Home Secretary was appointed Minister in
charge of Welsh affairs; at the same time a second Under-Secretary of State for the
Home Department was appointed for Welsh affairs.
The chief matters with which the Home Office deals are: the maintenance of law
and order; the efficiency of the police service; the treatment of offenders, including
juvenile offenders; the efficacy of the probation service; the organization of
magistrates’ courts; legislation on criminal justice; the efficiency of the fire service;
the care of children by local authorities and voluntary organizations; the regulation
of the employment of children and young persons; the control and naturalization
of aliens; the law relating to parliamentary and local government elections; public
safety and public well-being; and preparations for civil defence.
In carrying out its functions in these matters, the Home Office is responsible,
inter alia, for receiving and submitting Addresses and Petitions to the Sovereign
and for preparing Presentations to Parliament; for preparing patents of nobility
for peers and formal proceedings for the bestowal of honours; for advising the
Crown on the exercise of the Prerogative of Mercy; for the sanctioning of byelaws
made by local authorities in so far as they relate to ‘ law and order and good
governance’; for granting licences to experiment with animals; for ordering the
exhumation and removal of bodies; for the control of explosives, firearms and
dangerous drugs; and for the administration of the State Management Scheme for
controlling the liquor trade in the Carlisle district.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government was constituted in January
1951, under the title of Ministry of Local Government and Planning, to take over
the housing and local government functions of the Ministry of Health and the
planning functions of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning (1943-1951). It
was renamed the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in November 1951.
It is the Department generally responsible for local government, the loan-sanction¬
ing authority for most purposes for which local authorities require to borrow
money, and the main link between local authorities and the central Government.
The Ministry exercises powers in regard to housing, water, sewerage and other
services administered by local authorities in England and Wales. In regard to these
services, the position, broadly, is that the Minister is responsible to Parliament
(a) for securing, so far as intervention by the central Government is necessary, the
performance of duties laid upon local authorities by Parliament, whether this
obligation is to be discharged by the aid of grants from national funds or not;
(b) for encouraging the exercise of powers given to local authorities in regard to
such services whether by grants paid out of national funds or otherwise; and
(c) for communicating with local authorities in regard to difficulties and complaints
concerning any local authority services which may be brought to the Minister’s
notice.
As the central Housing Authority under the Plousing Act, 1936, the Minister
has supervisory responsibilities regarding the administration of the statutes
relating to housing and the national housing programme; and he keeps in close
touch with the local authorities through his officers in ten regions covering England
and an officer in Wales. Local authority proposals for dealing with areas of unfit
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
49
houses (slum clearance) are also submitted to the Minister and he has important
functions in relation to the problem of overcrowding.
The town and country planning work of the Ministry includes the framing and
execution of the national policy with respect to the use and development of
land for the purpose of achieving the best use of land in the public interest. The
responsibilities of the Minister in this respect include confirmation of the acquisi¬
tion and disposal of land by local authorities; and the payment of grants, for
planning purposes, in respect of certain cases of acquisition, clearing and com¬
pensation. The Minister also has responsibilities in connection with the establish¬
ment and work of the Development Corporations of the New Towns, and with the
National Parks Commission.
The Central Office of Information
The Central Office of Information was established in 1946 as the successor to the
war-time Ministry of Information. It is a common service agency for the produc¬
tion of information and publicity material and the supply of general publicity
services required by Government Departments. Both for the home and oversea
ministerial Departments it produces and distributes books, pamphlets, magazines,
films, exhibitions, photographs and other visual material. It conducts all official
press and poster advertising except that of the National Savings Committee, carries
out social surveys, and distributes Departmental news to the Press, the BBC and
the television companies. For the oversea Departments, it supplies British informa¬
tion posts with a daily service of topical information, comment and official news
and with a comprehensive reference service. Administratively, the Central Office is
responsible to Treasury Ministers, while the Ministers whose Departments it
serves are responsible for the policy expressed in its work.
The Board of Inland Revenue
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax and
surtax, profits tax, stamp duty, death duties, and certain other direct taxes of lesser
importance; and advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected
with them. The Board is also responsible for the valuation of real property for
various purposes such as compensation for compulsory purchase, local authority
rates and death duties.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service
The office of Minister of Labour was created by the New Ministries and
Secretaries Act, 1916, which provided for the transfer to the Ministry of Labour
of certain duties of the Board of Trade. Under the Minister of National Service
Order, 1939, the title of the Ministry was changed to the Ministry of Labour
and National Service and the offices of Minister of Labour and of National Service
are held by the same Minister. The principal functions of the Ministry of Labour
and National Service are: (1) administration of the Employment and Training
Act, 1948, and provision of facilities and services for the purposes of assisting
persons to select, fit themselves for, obtain and retain employment suitable to their

The Law Officers’ Department
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales' (the Attorney-General
and the Solicitor-General) are the legal advisers to the Crown and to all Govern¬
ment Departments and appear in Court on their behalf in cases of importance.
In such cases the Law Officers are assisted by Junior Counsel to the Treasury.
The appointments, which are made from among the more distinguished members
of the English Bar, are generally, though not invariably, political and the office
holders change with the Government.
The Attorney-General has a number of important functions in regard to the
administration of justice and he has wide powers in connection with the enforce¬
ment of the criminal law. The Director of Public Prosecutions acts under his
superintendence and is subject to his directions. The Attorney-General is the
senior Law Officer but the Solicitor-General as his deputy acts for him in all cases
where he is authorized or required to do so.
The Lord Chancellor’s Department
The Chancellorship is a legislative, judicial and executive office always carrying
Cabinet rank in peace time. The office is political in that it is held by an eminent

ex-member of the Bench or of the Bar adhering to the political party in
power.
In addition to his functions as Speaker of the House of Lords and Custodian
of the Great Seal, the Lord Chancellor is in charge of more than 20 different offices
and branches which are mainly concerned with legal practice and procedure.
He controls the machinery of the courts of law both through his patronage and
through administrative powers conferred by the Judicature Act, 1925, and other
Acts; he advises the Crown on many appointments to the judiciary in England and
Wales; and he is the Minister responsible for the Judge Advocate General’s Depart¬
ment. This Department advises the War Office and the Air Ministry on all legal
matters arising out of the administration of military law, and, where necessary,
reviews the proceedings of army and air force courts martial.1 The Lord Chancellor
is also a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, exercises eccle¬
siastical patronage and is connected with a number of administrative tribunals,
including the Pensions Appeal Tribunals and also the Lands Tribunal which deter¬
mines questions relating to compensation for the compulsory acquisition of land and
hears rating appeals from local valuation courts. The Land Registry, which is
responsible for maintaining a State register of title to land,2 and the Public Trustee
Office, which may act as the executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased
person or as a trustee under a will or settlement, are both administered under the
Lord Chancellor.
The National Assistance Board
The National Assistance Board, responsible to Parliament through the Minister
of Pensions and National Insurance, administers the State service of financial
assistance to persons in need and unable to maintain themselves, and the non¬
contributory pension scheme under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1936. It has also
responsibilities for assessing the needs of applicants for free legal aid.
The Paymaster-General’s Department
The Paymaster-General’s Department acts as chief paying agent for Government
Departments other than the Revenue Departments. The majority of payments are
made through banks (to whose accounts the necessary transfers are made at the
Bank of England), but cash payments can be made and the payment of pensions,
mainly comprising those to retired teachers, officers of the Civil Service and the
National Health Service and members of the Armed Forces, and in certain cases
to their widows, is an important feature of the work of the Department.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance
In 1953 the Ministry of Pensions (established in 1917) and the Ministry of
National Insurance (established in 1944) were amalgamated.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance is responsible (a) for the social
security services established by the Family Allowances Acts, 1945 and 1952, the
National Insurance Acts, 1946 to 1955, and the National Insurance (Industrial
Injuries) Acts, 1946 to 1954, and for reciprocal national insurance arrangements
with other countries, (b) for the award and payment of war pensions and
allowances for disablement and death due to service in the armed forces of the
Crown, or due to war injuries sustained by merchant seamen, civil defence per¬
sonnel and civilians in the second world war, and for the welfare of pensioners and

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
their dependants and war orphans, and (c) for the treatment and rehabilitation of
war pensioners in Northern Ireland. In addition to these responsibilities for war
pensioners in the United Kingdom, the Ministry is also responsible for the ad¬
ministration of United Kingdom war pensions for pensioners resident in the
Irish Republic, and for the administration of war pensions and the treatment of
war disablement for the benefit of United Kingdom pensioners living in other parts
of the world. The Ministry maintains an office at Ottawa to serve pensioners in
North America. Various agency arrangements operate in other places.
The Post Office
The Post Office was set up in the seventeenth century to take over the responsi¬
bility for carrying letters, which was previously attached to the Crown. The
Minister at its head is the Postmaster-General. Its work is mainly concerned with
the operation of the inland postal, telegraph and telephone services and, in co¬
operation with other countries and interests, of the oversea postal and telecom¬
munications services. It also undertakes certain banking functions, including the
operation of the Post Office Savings Bank and the issue of money orders, and it
acts as an agent for many other Government Departments in the collection of
revenue (e.g., by the sale of broadcast receiving and other licences and by the sale
of stamps for National Insurance contributions) and the payments of grants and
allowances, such as National Insurance payments, retirement and certain other
pensions and family allowances.
The Postmaster-General is the minister responsible to Parliament for broad
questions of national policy concerning sound broadcasting and television services.
The Engineering Department of the Post Office carries out a considerable
volume of scientific research and technical development relating to telephone,
telegraph and radio systems.
The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was set up as a Depart¬
ment of the Privy Council in 1916. It accounts for its own Vote in the Estimates and
is responsible to Parliament through the Lord President of the Council.
The work of the Department covers research (except defence research) in all
branches of natural science except medicine and atomic energy, and in all industries
except agriculture, fishery and forestry. Its primary functions are to undertake
research in the national interest for the benefit of the community and to meet the
requirements of other Departments; to encourage research and the application of
scientific knowledge in industry; and to encourage fundamental research at
universities and elsewhere, and the maintenance of an adequate supply of trained
research workers for laboratories of all kinds.
The Stationery Office
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office was established in 1786. It is the Government’s
central organization for the supply of desk stationery, office equipment, office
machinery, printed matter, published books and periodicals for British Govern¬
ment Departments at home and abroad. It is responsible for the publishing and
sale of all Government publications. The Stationery Office also undertakes dupli¬
cating, addressing and distributing services for other Departments. The ministerial
head of the Stationery Office is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and questions
pertaining to the Department asked in the House of Commons are normally
answered by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
53
The Ministry of Supply
The present Ministry of Supply was formed in 1946 by the amalgamation of
the war-time Ministries of Supply and of Aircraft Production.
The primary functions of the Ministry are to furnish supplies, which include
complete atomic weapons, to the armed forces; to undertake research on, and the
design and development of, equipment for these forces, principally for the Army
and Royal Air Force, but including aircraft, vehicles, some guns and ammunition
and other equipment for the Royal Navy. Other functions are to carry out the
primary Government responsibility in the field of electronics and in the light metals
industry, and to undertake research on and development and production of certain
classes of equipment for civil use, e.g., civil aircraft and industrial gas turbines.
The Ministry controls the Royal Ordnance factories and those experimental,
storage and other establishments which are owned by the Department; it is
responsible for the administration of such matters as labour supply, labour manage¬
ment, welfare, housing and transport in connection with these organizations.
The Board of Trade
The Board of Trade originated as a Committee of the Privy Council but the
Committee as such has not met for over a hundred years, the chairman, who holds
the title of ‘President of the Board of Trade’, being left to conduct the business of
the Department on the same basis as any other Cabinet Minister. The President
is now assisted by a Minister of State who is specially concerned with oversea trade
and by a Parliamentary Secretary. The Board of Trade has a general responsibility
in relation to the United Kingdom’s commerce, industry and oversea trade, and
carries the central responsibility among Government Departments for the formula¬
tion of policy in certain economic fields.
The most important of the latter are: commercial relations and negotiations with
other countries, including international commodity policy and the commercial
aspect of relations with international bodies; general import and export policy;
policy on the United Kingdom protective tariffs; consumer protection, including,
for example, policy on price control, resale price maintenance, monopolies and
restrictive practices and merchandise marks; matters affecting industrial produc¬
tivity, and publicity for methods of increasing it; and distribution of industry,
including implementation of the Distribution of'Industry Acts.
The Board is also responsible for the following matters: (1) statistics of trade
and industry, including the Censuses of Production and Distribution; (2) the
administration of certain regulative legislation, mainly in relation to patents,
registered designs, copyright and trade marks, companies and bankruptcy, insur¬
ance, weights and measures, and enemy property; and (3) policy towards and
relations with certain non-Government organizations concerned with trade and
industry, such as the British Standards Institution, the British Institute of Manage¬
ment, the British Travel and Holidays Association, the Council of Industrial Design
and the National Research Development Corporation.
In addition, the Board is the ‘ production department ’ for all industries and raw
materials which are not the concern of other Departments, and is responsible for
the management and custody of strategic stockpiles of materials.
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation
In 1953 the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Civil Aviation were
amalgamated. This amalgamation was foreshadowed in November 1951, from
which time the two offices of Minister of Transport and Minister of Civil Aviation
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
54
were held by the same Minister. The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation has
two joint Parliamentary Secretaries.
The Ministry of Transport, established in 1919 ‘for the purpose of improving
the means of, and the facilities for, locomotion and transport’, assumed also, in
1941, the responsibility for merchant shipping formerly exercised by the Mercantile
Marine Department of the Board of Trade.
The Ministry of Civil Aviation was established in 1945 to organize, carry out
and encourage measures for the development of civil aviation, for the promotion
of air safety and efficiency, and for research on air navigation.
The powers and duties of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation relate to
the following aspects of inland transport and merchant shipping: railways; inland
waterways; roads,1 bridges and ferries, and the vehicles they carry; harbours,
docks, piers and river conservancy; national and international shipping policy;
ships, their masters, officers and men; safety of life at sea; navigation (including
pilotage, lighthouses, and other aids to safety in navigation); wreck and salvage;
and the Coastguard Service. The Ministry is the highway authority for trunk roads
and is responsible for providing and operating troopships.
In civil aviation matters, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation may give
general directions to the publicly owned airline corporations on matters affecting
the national interest. He also approves associate arrangements between airline
corporations and independent air transport companies for the operation of
scheduled services.
General civil aviation responsibilities include: the regulation of civil flying; air
safety; the provision, administration and equipment of State-controlled aerodromes
and other ground services; the negotiation of international air transport agreements;
the registration of aircraft; and the licensing of aircrew and aircraft maintenance
personnel.
The War Office
The office of Secretary of State for War was established in 1854 as a preliminary
to abolishing the office of Secretary of State at War, which had been in existence
since the beginning of the century. In i9°4 Army Council was constituted
on the model of the Board of Admiralty, with the Secretary of State as president
and a membership of both military and civil personnel.
The War Office is responsible for the administrative control of the Army, includ¬
ing appointments, promotion, postings and payment. Its functions include the
planning of operations and training; the collection and sifting of military informa¬
tion; the framing of policy on the composition, weapons and equipment of the
Army; the determination of financial and labour policy connected with the Army;
and the supervision of War Office civilian staffs both at home and abroad.
The Ministry of Works
The Ministry of Works, previously known as His Majesty’s Office of Works, was
established under its present title in 1943. Its main functions are: the provision of
office accommodation for Government Departments (including public buildings
overseas), and of many other types of accommodation when required by Civil and
Service Departments; the design, purchase, supply and maintenance of furniture
and equipment for Government Departments and certain other bodies, and the
supply of fuel, household articles and stores; the administration of the Ancient

certain official residences; the ‘ physical ’ arrangements (architectural and engineering
services) for certain State ceremonial occasions; the management and maintenance
of the Royal Parks and certain other open spaces.
The Ministry also has responsibilities for the building programme and for the
efficiency and welfare of the building and civil engineering and building materials
industries, including: oversight of the national building programme; maintenance
of a list of all building and civil engineering firms and collection of statistical
returns; oversight of the production of building materials and fitments; consulta¬
tion with the industries at national and regional level; encouragement of apprentice¬
ship and training in the building and electrical contracting industries; review of
building research and development work to meet the industry’s requirements, and
to ensure that results of research are made available to the industry.
By a special arrangement, announced by the Prime Minister in November 1953,
the Minister of Works has been made responsible for answering questions in the
House of Commons concerning atomic energy, since the responsible Minister—the
Lord President of the Council—is a member of the House of Lords.
SCOTLAND
The first Secretary for Scotland was appointed in 1885 in recognition of the fact
that Scotland required a separate system of administration from that of England
and Wales. In 1926, all the powers and duties attached to the office were transferred
by the Secretaries of State Act to a principal Secretary of State.
The functions of the Secretary of State, who is assisted at ministerial level by a
Minister of State, three Parliamentary Under-Secretaries and the Scottish Law
Officers, are discharged by four main administrative Departments of equal status,
each under a Secretary responsible to the Secretary of State for the discharge of
the duties of the Department. The day-to-day administration of the Departments
is conducted in Edinburgh, but each Department has representatives in London
for liaison and Parliamentary duties. This London office is generally known as
the Scottish Office, a term also used to describe the whole system of Scottish
administration.1
The four main Scottish Departments are the Scottish Home Department, the
Department of Health for Scotland, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Department of Agriculture for Scotland.
The Scottish Home Department
The Scottish Home Department was set up in 1939 to take over the work that
had been undertaken previously by the Secretary of State’s Office, and by the
Fishery Board for Scotland and the Prisons Department for Scotland.
In the field of law and order, the Department is concerned with the police,
probation and remand home services, criminal justice, legal aid and the services
needed by the courts; it is directly responsible for the administration of prisons
and Borstal institutions.
1 A Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs, set up in 1952 to review ‘the arrangements
for exercising the functions of Her Majesty’s Government in relation to Scotland’,
reported in 1954 that the existing organization of Scottish administration was working
satisfactorily. Following the Commission’s recommendations, the Government decided
that responsibility in Scotland for roads, the appointment of justices of the peace, and
animal health (apart from the control of epidemic diseases) should be transferred from other
Ministers to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
E
56
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Department is the central Department in Scotland for the fire service and
civil defence; for the children’s service; and for legislation concerning shops,
theatres, cinemas and licensed premises. Licensed premises in the State Manage¬
ment Districts1 are directly maintained by the Department.
Other functions of the Department are: general duties in connection with the
structure and finance of local authorities, including valuation and rating and the
administration of the Exchequer equalization grants; and the oversight and protec¬
tion of the Scottish inshore, deep-sea and freshwater fisheries. The Department
is also closely concerned, in co-operation with the Board of Trade and other
United Kingdom Departments, with Scottish economic development, including
the provision of electric power and the rehabilitation of the Highlands generally.
The Department of Health for Scotland
The Department of Health for Scotland is responsible for the general supervision
of the National Health Service in Scotland; for the central administration of the
Housing (Scotland) Acts and for the supervision of the house-building programme
and the distribution of grants to local authorities for housing purposes; and for the
control, under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Acts, of the use of land
and the establishment of new towns under the New Towns Act.
The Department is also responsible for supervising the administration of various
environmental services, e.g., water supplies and sewerage; and welfare services,
e.g., the care of the aged and handicapped persons; and for the medical and surgical
treatment of war pensioners in Scotland (including hospital services and the supply
and repair of artificial limbs, surgical appliances and invalid chairs).
The Scottish Education Department
The Scottish Education Department is responsible for supervising the admini¬
stration of the Education (Scotland) Acts, for guiding the development of public
education in Scotland in all its forms, for supervising the training of teachers, for
issuing teachers’ certificates and administering the Teachers’ Superannuation
Scheme, for controlling the distribution of Exchequer grants-in-aid of educational
expenditure, for conducting the annual examination for the Scottish Leaving
Certificate, and for exercising general supervision over Approved Schools and
over the administration of the Royal Scottish Museum.
The Department of Agriculture for Scotland
The Department of Agriculture for Scotland is the successor of the Board of
Agriculture which was established in 1912. The Department is responsible in
Scotland for the management of agricultural property owned by the Secretary of
State; for the administration and finance of various instructional, advisory and
research services provided by agricultural colleges and research institutes; for the
administration of subsidies and other services in connection with food production,
the use of land and the economics of the agricultural industry; for the administra¬
tion of agricultural improvement schemes and of labour, machinery and supply
services; for the promotion of animal health; and for the protection of agricultural
interests generally.
Minor Departments
In addition to the main Departments, there are a number of minor Scottish
Departments, including the Department of the Registrar General for Scotland (the
1 Districts in which State management of the liquor trade is in operation.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
57
General Registry Office), all of which work in varying degrees under the direction
of the Secretary of State. There are also the Scottish branches of the United
Kingdom Departments under the direction of Controllers, who are responsible for
ensuring that the execution in Scotland of the policy and procedure of their Depart¬
ments is in accordance with Scottish conditions and needs.
Legal Departments
The Law Officers for Scotland are the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General.
The Lord Advocate is in administrative control of two Departments: The Lord
Advocate's Department, which is responsible for drafting Scottish legislation,
providing legal advice on Scottish questions for other Departments, and assisting
the Scottish Law Officers in certain of their legal duties; and The Crown Office,
which exercises the powers of the Lord Advocate in relation to criminal proceedings.
NORTHERN IRELAND
There are a number of separate Departments for Northern Ireland, which are
controlled by the Northern Ireland Parliament. Most of these have functions in
Northern Ireland analogous to those performed for England and Wales by the
United Kingdom Departments of the same name—the Northern Ireland Ministries
of Home Affairs, Education and Agriculture; the Northern Ireland Assistance
Board; and the Exchequer and Audit Department for Northern Ireland. Other
Northern Ireland Departments cover activities which in Great Britain are divided
between several Departments. These Northern Ireland Departments include the
Ministries of Finance, Commerce, Health and Local Government, and Labour and
National Insurance.
The Ministry of Finance
In addition to acting as Treasury to the Government of Northern Ireland, the
Ministry of Finance is responsible for administrative work in connection with the
erection and maintenance of public works and buildings; for Government valuation
and survey; for land registry, the registry of deeds, and certain duties in connection
with land purchase; for the reception and preservation of public records; for the
work of the Registrar-General; for the control of Government publications; for
the control and administration of charitable donations and bequests; and for the
control of borrowings.
Attached to the Department is the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, in which
Government Bills are prepared for introduction into Parliament.
The Ministry of Commerce
In addition to its commercial intelligence work, and its work in connection with
industrial production and the development of new, and the expansion of existing,
industries, the Department is responsible for the business of the Government in
relation to electricity and gas undertakings; roads and bridges and inland public
transport; railways; harbours and inland waterways; fisheries; the development of
the tourist traffic; the regulation and inspection of mines and quarries; mineral
development; scientific development; weights and measures; the registration of
companies and trade unions; and the administration of the Assurance Companies
Acts and the Industrial Assurance (Northern Ireland) Act, 1924. The Ministry
also performs functions delegated by the Ministry of Fuel and Power (Whitehall)
relating to the distribution of coal and other solid fuels.
58 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Ministry of Health and Local Government
In addition to its work in connection with the National Health Service, the
Department is responsible for the central administration of local government
services and for housing.
The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance
The Ministry is responsible for the administration of the Factories Acts and other
legislation connected with industrial health and welfare; for the promotion of
joint organizations for the settlement of industrial questions and of machinery of
conciliation in industrial disputes; for the administration of local employment
offices and the machinery for dealing with employment questions of all kinds; for
the administration of the National Insurance Act and the National Insurance
(Industrial Injuries) Act, and of the Family Allowances Act; and for carrying out
certain statutory functions in connection with the National Assistance Scheme in
conjunction with the National Assistance Board for Northern Ireland.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a
political or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose remunera¬
tion is found wholly and directly out of moneys voted by Parliament. The number
of civil servants under this definition amounts to more than a million; for it
includes some 425,000 Government industrial employees in such establishments as
Royal Ordnance factories and Admiralty dockyards. The term ‘ Civil Service ’ is,
however, generally used only to cover ‘ non-industrial ’ members of the staffs of the
various Government Departments.1 At the end of September 1955 the total number
of non-industrial civil servants employed in all Departments, at home and overseas,
was 636,098; nearly one-third of this total are women.
Although the civil servant is legally a servant of the Crown, in practice he serves
the Minister in charge of the Department in which he works, by advising in the
formulation of policy and by carrying out policy decisions once they have been
taken. From time to time the Minister may change, but the civil servant remains
to serve his successor. In Britain changes of government do not involve changes in
departmental staff, and this continuity makes for administrative stability.
Development of the Modern Civil Service
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past one hundred years.
Before then, Departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying standards
were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political jobbery was rife.
Measures of reform instigated during the nineteenth century (mainly as the result
of a report on the Organisation of the Permanent Civil Service by Sir Stafford
Northcote, Secretary of the Board of Trade, and Sir Charles Edward Trevelyan, an
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, which was published in 1854) included the
substitution of open competition for the practice of obtaining Civil Service appoint¬
ments by favour or purchase, and the establishment of an independent body, known
as the Civil Service Commission, to organize recruitment to the service. The great
expansion in State planning which has taken place during the last fifty years, and
the consequent expansion in the numbers of civil servants and the scope of their
duties, have led to further reorganization. During the last few decades, recruitment
1 Working in the United Kingdom, and also overseas in the Foreign Service (see p. 46)
and for other Government Departments such as the Commonwealth Relations Office
(see p. 44).
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
59
competitions have been adapted to a developing educational system; co-ordination
between the various Departments has been improved; and the search for increased
efficiency in the conduct of public business has been the task of many Government-
appointed commissions and committees of inquiry. As a result, civil servants,
though they remain employees of their Departments, are today members of an
integrated service with common conditions of employment and common traditions
and standards of conduct which belong not to individual Departments but to the
Civil Service as a whole.
Departmental Organization
The responsibility for the policy and activities of each Department lies with the
Minister, who is answerable to Parliament for what the civil servants in the
Department do or say.
The internal organization of Departments is a matter for the Department to
decide and it varies according to the volume and nature of the work involved.
There are, however, features common to most Departments, for example, the
Minister of a major Department is likely to have at the head of his officials a
Permanent Secretary (known as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State in those
Departments where the Minister is a Secretary of State) who is also Accounting
Officer and must appear periodically before the Public Accounts Committee; one
or more Deputy Secretaries; and a varying number of Under-Secretaries and
Assistant Secretaries. In addition, major Departments usually have a Principal
Finance Officer and a Principal Establishments and Organization Officer. A number
of Establishment Divisions have their own Organization and Methods (or ‘ O & M ’)
Branch, the members of which act in an advisory capacity as ‘ efficiency experts ’.
Many Departments also have their own Legal Advisers or Solicitors, and their
own Information Division.
The use, wholly or in part, of the standard classes and grades of civil servants,
which are described below, is common to most Departments. Thus a common
hierarchical pattern emerges, although there are many variations of it.
Control of the Service
The measure of uniformity in the Civil Service has largely resulted from the
general control of the Service which is exercised by the Treasury. The Permanent
Secretary to the Treasury is the official head of the Civil Service and the Principal
Adviser of the Prime Minister on matters affecting the Civil Service as a whole,
and in particular on appointments to senior posts in the Service (see p. 61). The
Treasury is also responsible for the salaries and conditions of employment of civil
servants; it controls total numbers of staff and the creation of higher posts, main¬
tains a central Organization and Methods Division which serves all Departments
which do not maintain an Organization and Methods branch of their own, deals
with general questions relating to training after entry into the Civil Service, and
takes the lead on questions concerning the number of Departments and the distribu¬
tion of functions.
Classes and Grades
The engagement and position of all civil servants are covered by regulation,
agreement and traditional practice, every civil servant being assured of a definite
status depending upon the post which he is called upon to fill. There are four main
classes of civil servants, each class containing a series of grades. The classes are:
i. The Administrative Class, which is responsible for advising Ministers on
policy, for dealing with any difficulties which may arise in carrying out
6o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
existing policy, and for forecasting the probable effects of new measures
and regulations. This relatively small class, which at end-September 1955
numbered about 3,430, is recruited largely from university graduates.
2. The Executive Class (numbering some 67,900 at end-September 1955),
which is responsible for the day-to-day conduct of Government business,
including the higher work of supply and accounts, within the framework of
established policy. Members of this class must have reached a recognized
educational standard; after entry they may train for specialist work such as
that of an auditor, actuary or statistician.
3. The Clerical Class (the largest of the main classes, comprising about 185,600
officers), which undertakes all the usual clerical work involved in running
departmental business, e.g., the preparation of accounts and the keeping of
records, the handling of particular claims in accordance with known rules,
and the summarizing and annotation of documents for the assistance of
senior officers.
4. The Typing Class (about 27,400 members), which consists of shorthand
typists, copy typists and learner typists.
Other classes are: the Professional, Scientific and Technical Classes, which consist
of some 112,200 civil servants with the necessary qualifications (e.g., doctors,
lawyers, engineers, information officers and research workers) for carrying out the
wide range of specialized duties which are now discharged by the Government; the
Departmental Classes, which are not found throughout the Service generally but
are confined to one or two Departments, e.g., the Tax Inspectorate of the Board
of Inland Revenue, the Factory Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and
National Service, and the Waterguard of the Customs and Excise Department (in
all some 2,750) and the Manipulative Classes, which include large numbers (about
236,700 at end-September 1955) of postal and telegraph officers, postmen, tele¬
phonists, messengers, paper keepers, office cleaners and similar workers in Govern¬
ment Departments, and their immediate supervisors.
The Foreign Service (see p. 46) which in 1955 numbered some 3,300 members
exclusive of messengerial grades, is separately organized and has its own nomen¬
clature. Branch A corresponds roughly to the Administrative Class of the Home
Civil Service; Branch B to the Executive and Clerical Classes; and Branch C to the
Typing Class. All members of these three branches are liable for service both at
home in the Foreign Office and abroad, and may be employed on any type of
Foreign Service work—diplomatic, consular, commercial and ‘information’.
Various specialists and advisers who are seconded from the Fighting Services and
from home Government Departments (e.g., those concerned with financial, com¬
mercial or labour matters) are attached to many oversea posts. In addition, at many
posts abroad a proportion of the staff is locally engaged on a ‘ temporary ’ basis, i.e.
they do not normally qualify for pensions.
Recruitment of Staff
The recruitment of all permanent civil servants is in the hands of the Civil
Service Commission,1 whose members are appointed by the Crown on the advice of
the Government. The normal method of entry is by open competition, conducted
in accordance with regulations approved by the Treasury and consisting of written

examinations or interviews, or both. The main points of entry into the four main
classes of the Home Civil Service are planned to correspond to definite levels in the
British educational system, and it is the Commission's duty to study the require¬
ments of the Civil Service in the light of the education provided by the schools and
universities.
In addition to holding examinations and conducting interviews, the Commission
is responsible for issuing a Certificate of Qualification in respect of each successful
candidate, for placing new entrants in Departments for which their qualifications
are appropriate, and for watching the careers of those it has selected in order to
ensure that current methods of recruitment are successful and up to date.
Temporary civil servants, who do not qualify for pensions, but are eligible for
gratuities, are normally recruited by the Department concerned through the
Appointments Service (see p. 257) of the Ministry of Labour and National Service.
No qualifying examinations are required for entrance on a temporary basis to
general service.
Training after Entry
Each of the larger Government Departments has a Training Officer and a number
of instructors, who organize both general and technical courses where necessary.
Types of courses vary from Department to Department, but nearly all have
systematic instruction of recruits in all classes. There are also ‘refresher’ courses
for more experienced staff covering technical subjects or broader subjects such as
management and supervision.
Methods of training include the use of films and instructional books; discussion
groups; and educational visits, which enable civil servants to study the appropriate
workings of outside bodies. In addition, officers in the early years of their service
may be transferred from branch to branch and, more rarely, from Department to
Department, in order that they may gain as wide an experience as possible of civil
service activities.
Civil Service training is co-ordinated by the Training and Education Division
of the I reasury, which also undertakes the task of training special groups such as
secretaries and the departmental instructors themselves, and provides central
courses, some months after entry, for members of the Administrative Class.
Promotion
A period of probation (lasting from one to two years according to grade, with
extensions in certain instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent
Civil Service. Promotions from grade to grade are made by Departments; those
from class to class partly through centrally conducted competitions (open only to
serving members of specified civil service classes), and partly by Departments
themselves. All promotions to the Administrative Class from other classes require
Treasury approval. Promotions to most of the highest positions in the Civil Service,
i.e. Permanent Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Principal Establishments Officer and
Principal Finance Officer, must be approved by the Prime Minister, who is advised
in these matters by the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.
Conditions of Service1
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service as
a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council2 which is composed jointly of
1 A review of the pay of the Civil Service, including the principles which should govern
it, and of other conditions of service such as hours of work and annual leave, has been
undertaken by a Royal Commission set up in July 1953, which reported in November iqc;?

official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate sections of the
Service is provided through the various staff associations, which civil servants are
encouraged to join (e.g., the Civil Service Clerical Association, the Union of Post
Office Workers, the Society of Civil Servants, the Institution of Professional Civil
Servants, and the Association of First Division Civil Servants), and through depart¬
mental Whitley Councils (of which there are about 75).
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which, except in the very highest
posts, is intended to compare reasonably with that paid for similar work outside the
Service, and he normally receives annual increments up to the maximum of the
scale of the grade to which he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds
office at the pleasure of the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in
practice he enjoys a considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every
permanent civil servant may reasonably expect a full career in the public service,
and a pension on retirement—though this, again, is not a legal right.
Civil servants are generally ‘ conditioned ’ to a given number of hours of atten¬
dance a week. Overtime is paid to members of most of the lower salary groups if
they work longer than their ‘conditioned’ hours. The standard working week in
the Service, at present, is generally 45^ hours. The highest administrative officials,
who work the longest hours, receive no extra remuneration for extra work per¬
formed. Annual leave varies according to the grade up to a maximum, at present, of
36 days a year. Sick leave on full pay, less any National Insurance benefit received,
may be granted to established civil servants for up to six months in any twelve
months, and on reduced pay up to a maximum of one year’s sick leave in any four years.
Political and Private Activities
Civil servants may participate in political activities subject to certain special rules.
Many grades are completely free to engage in national and local political activities;
others are free to engage in most political activities by permission and subject to
certain conditions; while others again are not allowed to take part in national
political activities, but are free to seek permission to engage in local political activi¬
ties. Civil servants of every grade may, of course, exercise the right of all citizens to
register their private political opinions on appropriate occasions, e.g., at a general
election or at local authority elections. Officially, the position and functions of a
civil servant remain the same whichever political party is in power; and it is his duty
to serve the Government of the day irrespective of his own political opinion.
Every civil servant may engage in such private activities as he wishes, provided
that such activities do not in any way conflict with his official duties, nor with the
provisions of the Official Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920 and the Prevention of
Corruption Act of 1906. A civil servant must not, however, use his official position
to further his private interests; and he is therefore subject to restrictions in matters
of commerce and business from which the ordinary citizen is free, e.g., he may not
hold private interests in public contracts; and he may not use official infoimation
in writing, broadcasting or lecturing without the express approval of his Depart¬
ment. Above all, a civil servant is expected to conform to the high standards of
integrity which characterize the Service to which he belongs.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Local government has been defined as government by elected local bodies charged
with administrative and executive duties in matters concerning the inhabitants of a
particular district or place and vested with powers to make byelaws for their
guidance.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
63
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of the
United Kingdom for many centuries. It has existed in England continuously since
Saxon times. In its present shape, however, it dates back only to the later nine¬
teenth century, when the conception of local government by popularly elected
councils received statutory recognition.
The first 40 years of the present century witnessed a sharp increase in, and
expansion of, environmental and social services, and a corresponding increase in
the responsibilities of local authorities upon whom the greater part of the manage¬
ment of these services devolved. Legislation passed in the post-war period has
made some further changes; on the one hand the powers of local authorities relating
to the provision of hospitals, gas and electricity supplies and (in England and
Wales) valuation for rating purposes have been transferred to national boards or
to Government Departments, while on the other, local authorities (mainly the
councils of counties and county boroughs in England and Wales and of counties
and large burghs in Scotland) have been charged with certain additional or new
responsibilities in connection with the health services, care of children, town and
country planning, care of the aged and a number of other welfare services.
Recent changes have not affected the structure of local government, nor its
importance as part of the administrative system as a whole. In the United Kingdom,
it remains as an essential link between the individual and the central Departments
of State.
Relations between Central and Local Government
As the supreme authority in the United Kingdom, Parliament controls local
authorities through Acts of Parliament which require elected local councils to
implement policies prescribed and defined in those Acts. The scope of local
government is limited by the same means; no council may go beyond the boundary
fixed for its activities by an Act of Parliament.
Legislation is supported by departmental supervision; Parliament makes certain
ministers responsible for securing the efficient functioning of local government
services. Departmental supervision is exercised by means of inspections, inquiries,
examinations of statistics, authorization of loans, the issue of advisory circulars and
statutory Rules and Orders, the approval of byelaws, and the administration of
Government grants. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main link
between local authorities and the central Government in England and Wales; in
Scotland the Scottish Home Department is generally responsible for local govern¬
ment; and in Northern Ireland the Ministry of Health and Local Government.
Principal Types of Local Authority
For purposes of local government, England and Wales and Northern Ireland
are divided into county boroughs and administrative counties. Administrative
counties are further divided into three types of county district: municipal or non¬
county boroughs; urban districts; and rural districts, which are themselves sub¬
divided into parishes (except in Northern Ireland). Each of these divisions is
administered by a different kind of local council, as follows:
England and Wales1
county councils (61)
county borough councils (83)
non-county borough councils (318)
urban district councils (562)
rural district councils (475)2
parish councils (about 7,300) or
parish meetings (about 3,800).
Excluding the London area.
Including the Isles of Scilly.

Northern Ireland
county councils (6)
county borough councils (2)
borough councils (9)
urban district councils (24)
town commissioners (3)
rural district councils (32).
There are, in addition, the local authorities for London, which are unlike those
in the rest of the United Kingdom. They are:
the London County Council
the Corporation of the City of London
the metropolitan borough councils (28).
Scotland
The local authorities in Scotland are:
county councils (33, of which two pairs are combined for certain purposes)
town councils (197, consisting of: the authorities for counties of cities, 4; other
large burghs, 20; and small burghs, 173)
district councils (199; two counties are not divided into districts).
Functions and Services
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer such
environmental and social services as it may be required to provide and administer
by an Act of Parliament. It may provide additional services under the permissive
powers of a general Act or under powers granted to it by Private Bill legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon the type of council. In
England and Wales and Northern Ireland, for example, county borough councils
are all-purpose authorities, while the county councils and county district councils,
i.e. the councils of non-county boroughs and of urban and rural districts, each
have particular functions allotted to them, which they exercise independently to a
considerable extent, although there is a certain degree of delegation from county
councils to county district councils especially in the fields of education and planning.
In Scotland, the town councils of the counties of cities are all-purpose authorities;
elsewhere the county councils exercise very many local government functions. In
large burghs, they administer education and in some cases the police service, all
other functions being exercised by the town councils. In small burghs, county
councils undertake a number of important functions, but housing and some other
services are administered by the town councils. The smallest authorities (the parish
councils or parish meetings in England and Wales and the district councils in
Scotland) have a few functions which they may exercise of right.
The services provided by the councils, which are described more fully in later
chapters, may be considered under three heads:
1. Environmental Services, which are services designed to secure and improve the
citizens’ surroundings. The majority are public health and sanitary services
administered in England and Wales either by county, county district or parish
councils (in London by the metropolitan borough councils, in Northern Ireland
by the county district councils and in Scotland by the county and town councils),
e.g., the inspection and abatement of nuisances, drainage, sewerage, street cleansing,
refuse collection and disposal, the supervision of water supplies, measures for
ensuring food hygiene (including inspection of premises where food is prepared,
sold or served, and the analysis of food samples), rodent control and the provision of
baths and washhouses. There are also the services for street lighting, public safety
on the highways, and the provision of amenities such as parks and recreation
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

grounds, which are generally administered by the same authorities and also by
district councils in Scotland. The important work of town and country planning is
done in England and Wales by the county and county borough councils, except
where it is delegated to county district councils, and in Scotland by county councils
and the town councils of large burghs. County borough councils, as all-purpose
authorities, provide and administer their own environmental services.
2. Protective Services, which include the fire service, the civil defence service
and the police. The fire service is administered throughout England and Wales by
the county borough councils and the county councils, or by joint authorities (or
joint committees) set up by those councils if they amalgamate; and in Scotland, by
the county councils and the town councils of most of the large burghs or by joint
boards. These authorities1 and, in London, the metropolitan borough councils and
the City Corporation, are also responsible for organizing the local divisions of the
Civil Defence Corps. The police service is maintained by Standing Joint Com¬
mittees in the counties of England and Wales, by Watch Committees in the county
boroughs or by joint boards in the case of combined police authorities. In London
the maintenance of the City of London force is a matter for the Common Council
of the City while the police authority for the Metropolitan police force is the Home
Secretary. The appointment of the Commissioner of Police for the City of London
and of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis are subject to the approval
of the Sovereign. The police authorities in Scotland are the county councils, the
town councils of large burghs or joint committees for combined forces.
3. Personal Services, which are services designed to ‘cultivate the best physical,
mental, and moral potentialities of each individual’. The type of authority con¬
cerned depends on the nature of the services, which range from maternity and
child welfare, education, care of children and housing to the provision of entertain¬
ments. Services under this heading also include certain health services, services for
the aged and infirm, and the provision and upkeep of libraries, museums and art
galleries.
There are also some trading services, e.g., passenger transport, water supply,
and harbour, dock and pier services, although these are now less numerous than
before and during the war.
Local Authority Elections
In Great Britain the normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of
local government is three years. In some cases the whole council retires every third
year and another is elected immediately; in other cases elections are held annually,
when one-third of the councillors retire. Procedure at local government elections
is governed by local election rules.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote at a
local government election provided that he or she is a British subject of 21 years
of age or over or a citizen of the Irish Republic, and is registered as a local govern¬
ment elector for the area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for
registration as a local government elector if on the qualifying date for the register
he or she is resident in the area or occupies as owner or tenant any rateable land or
premises in the area of a yearly value of not less than £10.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the council concerned, under
the supervision of a presiding officer specially appointed for the purpose. The pro¬
cedure governing voting methods is the same as that followed at parliamentary
1 These authorities may delegate important civil defence functions to constituent
district councils.
66
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
elections except that, in rural district or parish council elections, voting by post or
by proxy is not allowed, except to Service voters (see p. 27). No elector may give
more votes in all than the total number of councillors to be elected.
Candidates for election stand either as Independents or as representatives of one
of the national or local political parties. Each candidate must be nominated by two
electors, as proposer and seconder; and, in England and Wales, except in elections
for metropolitan borough councils, rural district councils and parish councils, eight
other electors for the area must assent to the nomination. In Scotland, county and
district council candidates require proposers but no assenters, town council candi¬
dates a proposer and five assenters. A candidate for election as a councillor must be
of British nationality and over 21 years of age and must either (a) be registered as a
local government elector in the Register of Electors for the area for which he seeks
election, or (b) have resided within that area during the whole of the twelve months
preceding the election (or within 3 miles in the case of parish councils), or (c) in
England and Wales, own freehold or leasehold land in the area. Candidates are also
subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed to ensure that unsuitable
persons do not offer themselves for election.
In Northern Ireland councillors elected to any form of local government hold
office for three years and elections are held every third year. Procedure at local
government elections is governed by Electoral Regulations made by the Ministry
of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland.
The Elections and Franchise Act (Northern Ireland), 1946, provides that to be
a local government elector a person must be a British subject of full age who was
either born in Northern Ireland or has resided in the United Kingdom for the whole
of the seven years ending on the qualifying date for the register, and who has the
qualifications of a resident occupier of a dwelling house or of a general occupier of
non-residential premises; these qualifications are similar to those which apply in
Great Britain, though differing in certain particulars.
Voting procedure and the qualifications of candidates are substantially the same
in Northern Ireland as in Great Britain, but the town clerk or the clerk to the
council is the returning officer for all elections to the authority; there is no postal
voting and the only persons who may vote by proxy are Service voters.
In parliamentary elections, the contest is normally between several candidates
for one seat. In local government elections there are usually a good many seats to
be filled, and nearly all county boroughs, non-county boroughs and metropolitan
boroughs in England and Wales and the larger burghs in Scotland are divided into
wards. Except in metropolitan boroughs, the number of councillors for each ward
must be three or a multiple of three. All other local authority areas, except the ad¬
ministrative counties, may be divided into wards or they may be left as single units,
depending on their size. The administrative counties are split up in accordance with
orders made by the Secretary of State for the Home Department or the Secretary
of State for Scotland, as the case may be, into electoral divisions which return mem¬
bers to the county council and to the district council. The London County Council
is organized in three-member divisions, which are the same as the parliamentary
constituencies in its area.
Internal Organization of Local Authorities
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own internal
arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they will discharge
their responsibilities. The arrangements made by most councils are briefly as
follows: questions of policy and principle are decided by the whole council, which
appoints committees to carry out the detailed administration of its various services.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
67
The more important of the committees of the larger authorities divide their work
among sub-committees, which stand to the parent committee in more or less the
same relation as do the main committees to the whole council. The execution of
the policy decided upon by the council and the committees rests with salaried
officers and employees, whose number may vary from about half a dozen in a small
rural district to several thousand in the large counties and in the larger county
boroughs.
Apart from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of specialists
on committees and the length of time certain members may hold office, committees
of councils are remarkably free from legal restrictions; even those known as
‘statutory’ committees are constituted according to individual requirements and
not according to any set pattern laid down. For purposes of classification, however,
they may be divided into two kinds: ordinary committees and joint committees.
Ordinary committees may be further divided into statutory committees, the
appointment of which is compulsory under an Act of Parliament; standing com¬
mittees, which are appointed in accordance with the standing orders of the council
on a permanent basis according to the extent of the council’s business; and special
committees, which a council may set up for a limited period to deal with a particular
problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
Joint Committees or Joint Boards consist of representatives of more than one
authority. They are usually established when local authorities co-operate for services
which cannot be dealt with on purely local lines, e.g., water supply, or sewerage.
Committees of a local authority may be advisory or executive; their powers and
duties are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders or, in the
case of a county or large burgh in Scotland, in the council’s administrative scheme.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees except its powers in con¬
nection with raising loans, levying rates or issuing precepts, which are legally
reserved to the council as a whole.
Officers and Employees
In December 1954 some 1,411,000 persons (including teachers) were employed
in local government service.
Every council is empowered to appoint such staff as it deems necessary to carry
out its work. Certain appointments are compulsory, e.g., the Clerk, the Treasurer,
the Medical Officer of Health, the Surveyor and the Sanitary Inspector. Even the
smallest parish councils usually employ a part-time clerk. Choice of personnel is
normally left to a great extent to the individual council.
Officers are normally of three kinds: heads of departments, whose duties are
mainly of an administrative and managerial kind; subordinate officers employed in
a professional, clerical or technical capacity; and manual workers who are employed
to do the actual physical work for which the council is responsible. As a rule, senior
staff appointments are made at the instance of the committee or committees
particularly concerned; while most junior appointments are made by heads of
departments, who are also responsible for engaging the manual labour required.
Appointments and engagements are always made in conformity with a set establish¬
ment, and committees are informed of any appointments which they have not
made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within the
jurisdiction of the employing council (except where the proposed salary of an
officer requires the approval of a Government Department, as in the case of the
clerk of a county council in England and Wales). They are based on recommenda¬
tions made by the Whitley Councils (see pp. 268-9), of which there are several,
68
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
including the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Administrative,
Professional, Technical and Clerical Services, the National Joint Industrial Council
for Local Authorities’ Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers), the National Joint
Council for County Council Roadmen, and, in Scotland, the Joint Negotiating
Committee for Chief Officials of Local Authorities (Scotland) and the Joint
Industrial Councils for Local Authority Services. In England and Wales there are
also two special joint committees, which have made recommendations with regard
to the salaries and conditions of service of town clerks, county district council
clerks and other local authority chief officers.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of conduct;
as public servants they ‘must not only be honest in fact, but must be beyond the
reach of the suspicion of dishonesty ’.
Local Government Finance
Current expenditure by local authorities in 1954 amounted to £990 million
(including housing subsidies and debt interests) which represented about 6 per cent
of the gross national product. Income derives from Government grants,1 from local
rates, from loans, from trading receipts, rents, fees and other miscellaneous sources.
Government grants are of five main types: assigned revenues, which are the
proceeds of certain national taxes handed over to local authorities, e.g., the proceeds
of dog, game and gun licences and of the licence fees for hawkers, pawnbrokers,
money-lenders and refreshment houses; percentage grants, which are agreed
proportions of local authority expenditure upon services approved by Govern¬
ment Departments, e.g., education, health, roads, fire, police and children’s services;
unit grants, which depend exactly on the service provided, e.g., housing subsidies;
equalization grants, which are contributions to the general revenues of the poorer
local authorities; and special grants, which are grants paid from time to time for
some particular purpose.
Rates are a form of local taxation paid by the occupiers (and in Scotland also
by the owners) of land and buildings in a local authority area as contributions to
the cost of local services. They are levied by a poundage on the rateable value of
property which in England and Wales is equivalent to the yearly rent at which
the property might reasonably be expected to let if the tenant paid rates and taxes
and also the cost of insurance and repairs. Valuation is undertaken by the Valuation
Officers of the Board of Inland Revenue; appeals may be made to independent
Valuation Panels and thereafter to the Lands Tribunal. In Scotland the primary
basis of valuation is the annual rent payable. Valuation is carried out by assessors
appointed by county councils and the town councils of large burghs, and appeals
lie to a county or burgh Valuation Committee and thereafter to the Lands Valua¬
tion Appeal Court of the Court of Session.2
The responsibility for levying and collecting the rates in England and Wales lies
with the councils of county boroughs and county districts; in London, with the
City Corporation and the metropolitan borough councils. County councils finance
themselves by issuing a precept on the county districts (in London the metropolitan
borough councils and the City Corporation) for the sums of money required;
while parishes are financed by rates levied by the appropriate rural district council
on property within the parish as an addition to the general rates. Rates in Scotland
are levied by the town councils in burghs and by county councils elsewhere; to
1 Paid in Northern Ireland by the Government of Northern Ireland.
2 In October 1955 the Government introduced legislation to amend the law of valuation
and rating in Scotland in the light of the recommendations of the Scottish Valuation and
Rating Committee, which sat under the chairmanship of Lord Sorn.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

cover their expenditure, district councils issue a requisition each year to the county
council; a town council has to meet an annual requisition from the county council
in respect of the burgh’s share of the expenditure on functions exercised by the
county council throughout the county, including the burgh. In Northern Ireland,
county councils are responsible for making, levying and collecting the rates, except
in such parts of the county as fall within the jurisdiction of the county borough,
borough, or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by all types of local authority for items of capital expenditure
which could not well be met out of current revenue, subject to the approval of the
Government Department responsible for the service for which the capital is
required. Such loans may be raised either on the open market or from the Public
Works Loan Board, which was originally constituted under the Public Works
Loans Act, 1875, to make certain local loans out of moneys provided by the
Exchequer and which for a brief period (1945-52) was the only source from which
local authorities could normally borrow. Freedom to borrow on the open market
was restored to local authorities in January 1953 (see also P- 287).
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned by a
finance Committee, whose function is to keep the financial policy of the council
under constant review. External control is carried out by means of an annual
audit, which in the case of all councils in England and Wales (except for certain
general accounts in about two-thirds of the borough councils) is operated by
district auditors appointed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.
Borough councils must use the services of the district auditor for accounts which
relate to education, national assistance, children, local health services, coast pro¬
tection, motor tax, rate collection, police, fire, civil defence and town and country
planning, but they may and sometimes do employ a professional firm of auditors
to do other work. In Scotland, all accounts are audited by a professional auditor
appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, and paid by the council.
THE LAW
The maintenance of public order in the United Kingdom is effected, generally
speaking, by two agencies—the judiciary and the police. Both are concerned in
different ways with the obedience of the citizen to the law.
Law is said to be based on the concepts of order and compulsion. In the legal
sense, it has been defined as any rule which will be enforced by the courts; as it
applies to a country, it is usually understood as the set of rules by which the
citizens of that country will expect to regulate their conduct in relation to their
fellow citizens and to the State.
There is no written code of law in the United Kingdom. The question whether
a particular rule is recognized as part of law is determined by consideration of the
authorities, which may be statutes, statements made by legal writers, or reports of
decided cases. If none of these exist, the judge uses a process of analogy, that is to
say, he bases his decision in a case on its similarity to a previous case in which
judgment has already been given.
1 he sources of law in the United Kingdom are statute law, common law which
is law recognized by the courts as binding on some other grounds than express
enactment, and equity. Statute law includes Acts of Parliament and delegated or
subordinate legislation made under powers conferred by Parliament (see pp. 32-33).
The origins of common law are to be found in the customs of the realm.
The greater part of statute law applies uniformly in all four countries of the
United Kingdom, although in many fields of legislation there are statutes applying
yo
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to Scotland only. The Scottish common law is different from that prevailing
in England and Wales and (as a rule) in Northern Ireland, since ancient differences
were perpetuated by the Act for the Union of England and Scotland, i7°7» under
which Scotland retained her own system of law. Equity was introduced into English
law to modify the older common law system during the Middle Ages. Its purpose
was to temper justice with mercy, when conscience was opposed to the rigours of
the law, and to enforce and provide more effectual remedies for existing legal rights.
Equity was fused with common law in 1873; its principles still apply.
The two main branches of the law in the United Kingdom, as in most other
countries, are civil law and criminal law. Civil law has been defined as relating to
the maintenance of private claims and the redress of private wrongs, which may
not involve moral guilt’.1 Criminal law deals with offences against the State and
their punishment on behalf of the community.
Criminal Justice
Under the English law, every individual has a right to his or her personal liberty;
therefore, no one may lawfully be arrested except in pursuance of criminal justice
and on certain other specified grounds2; and if anyone is arrested or detained
otherwise than upon lawful grounds, the writ of Habeas Corpus may be invoked to
set him free, and he may sue the person who detained him for assault or false
imprisonment. The writ of Habeas Corpus may be granted by a Divisional Court of
the Queen’s Bench Division or by any judge of the High Court (see p. 73) against
the person who detains the prisoner and this person must then appear before the
court on the day named to show cause for the detention; if he can show no cause,
the prisoner must be released forthwith.
Lawful arrest may be either by warrant (which must contain a statement of the
specific offence with which the accused is charged) or, in certain clearly defined
cases, without warrant. Any person arrested must be brought before a magistrates
court (see p. 74) with the least possible delay and publicly charged with the offence
of which he is accused. It is a basic principle of the English legal system that every
accused person must be presumed innocent until his guilt has been proved by the
prosecution, and it has been laid down that in the conduct of a criminal case, the
prosecution shall neither have, nor appear to have, any advantage over the defence, j
Therefore, no prisoner can be compelled to answer the questions of the police
before trial; but if he is prepared to do so, he must be warned that anything that he
says may be taken down and given in evidence at his trial.3 Private interrogation
before an examining magistrate prior to public trial likewise forms no part of
English criminal proceedings.
Prisoners awaiting trial either before a magistrates’ court or before a higher
court may, in certain circumstances, be released on bail that is to say, they may be |
temporarily discharged subject to their entering into a recognizance, with or with¬
out sureties, for a reasonable sum of money, to appear in court at the time
appointed for the trial. . . , , r • 1

aid (see p. 80); this is at the discretion of the court, except in the case of a person
charged with murder, who must be granted legal aid if his means are insufficient.
During his trial, the accused person or defendant has the right to hear and sub¬
sequently to cross-examine all the witnesses for the prosecution, to call witnesses
on his own account, and to address the court. Once acquitted no accused person
can ever again be charged with that particular offence in any court of law.
The Jury System
Generally speaking, all the more serious crimes, i.e. crimes known as indictable
offences because a formal written accusation or indictment is required for their
prosecution, must be tried in a superior court before a jury. As an exception,
however, certain specified indictable offences may be dealt with instead at a
magistrates’ court if the defendant consents. Conversely a criminal case which
would ordinarily be dealt with in a magistrates’ court must usually be heard before
a jury if the offence is punishable by more than three months’ imprisonment and
the defendant elects to be so tried.
A jury consists of twelve persons duly summoned in pursuance of a precept
from the court. Most property owners and ratepayers (men and women alike) are
liable to be summoned for jury service if they are British subjects and are between
the ages of 21 and 60, unless they are disqualified1; members of certain professions
are, however, exempt from service, and no person can be summoned to serve on
any jury more than once in any one year unless all the jurors on the list have already
been summoned to serve during such year.
In trials by jury it is, broadly speaking, the duty of the judge to determine all
questions of law, including questions as to the admissibility of the evidence, and for
the jury to decide all questions of fact. In criminal cases, therefore, the jury has
to decide whether, on the evidence placed before them and the summing-up of that
evidence by the judge, the defendant is guilty or innocent; if it finds the defendant
guilty, sentence is passed by the judge. The judge never accompanies the jury when
it retires to consider its verdict. The verdict of a jury must be unanimous; if its
members are unable to reach agreement, the case must be retried before a new jury.
Both the prosecution and the defence have the right to object to any member of
the jury on the grounds of his lack of impartiality; it is an offence to assault,
threaten, or attempt to influence a juryman corruptly; and no jury can be penalized
for its verdict, though it be apparently contrary to the evidence or to the summing-
up of the judge.
Procedure under Scottish law differs from the foregoing in a number of impor¬
tant respects; notably, the verdict may be by a bare majority of the jury and, in
addition to ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’, may also be given as ‘not proven’; this last
verdict, which does not exist in English law, involves acquittal in the same way as
‘ not guilty ’.
In England and Wales, all cases in civil courts involving a charge of fraud against
a party or a claim in respect of libel, slander, malicious prosecution, false imprison¬
ment, seduction, or breach of promise to marry, must be tried by jury. Other civil
cases are heard before a judge alone unless either party to a dispute demands a jury
and the required consent of the court to this procedure is obtained. In the trial of
a civil action, the jury is responsible for deciding not only all questions of fact (as
in the trial of criminal cases) but also the amount of damages to be awarded to the
injured party.
The procedure in civil cases in Scottish courts again differs in some respects.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts (see p. 76) a jury is required to be present
to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person died. The jury in
this instance consists of not fewer than seven and not more than eleven jurors.
A jury is also required at an inquest held by a coroner to decide whether objects of
gold or silver found in the ground are ‘treasure trove’ (see p. 77).
Law of Evidence
The law of evidence (evidence being all the legal means, exclusive of mere
argument, which tend to prove or disprove any matter of fact, the truth of which
is submitted to judicial investigation) is, in general, the same in criminal and in
civil trials; but, because of the peculiar nature of a criminal trial—the gravity of the
issue, the extent to which the public interest is involved and the penalty to which
the prisoner may be subjected—some of the rules, as they relate to the proof of the
case against the prisoner, are applied with greater rigour and severity in the course
of criminal than in the course of civil proceedings. Thus in certain cases, although
the uncorroborated evidence of one witness is, as a matter of law, sufficient, a
conviction upon such evidence is, in practice, never allowed, unless the judge has
warned the jury of the danger of convicting without corroboration.1 In addition,
evidence of admissions of guilt by an accused person are accepted in a criminal trial
only with reluctance and subject to certain strict conditions designed to ensure that
the prisoner fully understood that his confession might be used in evidence, and
that it was a voluntary confession not obtained from the prisoner either by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage. Nor may the previous history of the prisoner be
used against him unless he has expressly set up his own virtuous character as an
argument for his innocence, or, where he gives evidence himself, if he has attacked
the character of a witness or of the prosecutor, when evidence of previous convic¬
tions may be given, provided that they are neither irrelevant nor remote. And
finally, by the law of England, a witness must not, as a general rule, repeat in court
statements made by a third party; first, because to admit such evidence would be
to accept the statement of a person not on oath, and secondly, because that person
cannot be cross-examined.
THE COURTS
The courts that apply the law in the United Kingdom are broadly speaking
divided into civil and criminal courts, although, since the distinction is a compara¬
tively modern one, no hard and fast line can be drawn. Quite a number of civil cases
are, in fact, heard in criminal courts; while occasionally a criminal case may be
heard in what is primarily a civil court.
Civil Courts in England and Wales
The more important of the civil courts in England and Wales are:
The County Courts
The County Courts are so arranged that there is no part of the country more j
than a reasonable distance from one of them. This kind of court may be regarded as
a ‘popular tribunal’; something over a million cases are entered in it every year, j
although comparatively few ever reach the stage of trial, many being settled out of
court. County Courts are presided over by a paid judge, sitting alone. Eighty
County Court judges may be appointed.
1 In Scotland, apart from a few statutory exceptions, no person can be convicted unless
there is evidence of at least two witnesses implicating him in the commission of the crime
with which he is charged.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
73
The general jurisdiction of the County Court covers all common law actions,
except cases (such as libel) where the personal reputation of the defendant is
involved, provided that the amount claimed does not exceed £400. Actions which
may involve awards in excess of this sum may be transferred to the High Court
by order of the presiding judge on application by the plaintiff. Cases which fall
under the specific jurisdiction of the County Courts, e.g., those connected with
agricultural holdings, rent restrictions, hire purchase agreements and other matters
governed by statute or ministerial order, are tried irrespective of the amount
involved.
In addition to the ordinary County Courts, there are still a few local courts, with
somewhat similar jurisdiction. Most of these are survivals from the medieval
borough courts, and some of them have little or no work to do at the present time.
Two or three, such as the Liverpool Court of Passage, the Salford Hundred Court
and the Bristol Tolzey Court, are still comparatively well used.
The Mayor's and City of London Court
This Court, which is the County Court for the City of London, is the amalgama¬
tion of two courts, the Mayor’s Court, with a jurisdiction unlimited as to amount,
and the City of London Court, a court for small cases. It is usually presided over
by a judge appointed by the City of London.
The High Court of Justice
The High Court of Justice forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature. The
Supreme Court of Judicature largely took its present form in 1873. It is composed
of the High Court and the Court of Appeal.
The High Court sits in three divisions: the Queen’s Bench Division, the Chancery
Division, and the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. These divisions derive
from the old courts of the same names which existed before 1873, and cases are
distributed between them as tradition and convenience dictate.
The Queen’s Bench Division is staffed by the Lord Chief Justice and 25 puisne
judges, i.e. judges without special office of their own. These judges are mainly
concerned with ordinary civil actions—-debt cases, actions for damages, revenue
cases, insurance cases, commercial cases, etc.; but they also hear criminal cases at
Assizes (see p. 75).
The Chancery Division is officially headed by the Lord Chancellor; but most of
the work is done by seven puisne judges who remain in London all the time. The
jurisdiction of the Chancery Division derives from the equity system (seep. 70),
and its work covers actions for the administration of the estates of deceased persons,
partnership actions, actions connected with trusts and mortgages, some tax cases,
the care of infants’ estates, and company and bankruptcy matters.
The Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division deals, as its name implies, with
the proof of wills, with Admiralty and shipping cases, and with divorce cases, many
of which are also heard (at present) before Queen’s Bench and county court judges.
Appellate Courts
There are two Appellate Courts in civil law actions—the Court of Appeal, which
is part of the Supreme Court of Judicature (see above), and the House of Lords.
There are several ex-officio members of the Court of Appeal, but its effective
head is a judge called the Master of the Rolls, who is assisted by eight Lord Justices
of Appeal. Appeals lie to the Court of Appeal from the County Courts, the Mayor’s
and City of London Court and the civil side of the High Court. The Court of
Appeal generally sits in two or three divisions, with three judges to a division.
74
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
From the Court of Appeal, a further appeal is possible to the House of Lords,
with the leave of the House of Lords or of the Court of Appeal. Such appeals are
usually heard by five Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who are paid professional
judges with peerages for life. In addition, the Lord Chancellor and any peers who
have held ‘ high judicial office ’ are entitled to sit. The House of Lords is the supreme
court of appeal in civil cases in the whole of the United Kingdom.
Civil Courts in Scotland
The Sheriff Court
The Sheriff Court in its civil capacity corresponds roughly to the County Court
in England and Wales, but it has a wider jurisdiction unlimited by the value of the
case. It also has power to try (summarily or by indictment) all but the most serious
crimes and offences. The work of the court is normally done by a Sheriff-Substitute,
against whose judgment an appeal may be made to the Sheriff1 or directly to the
Court of Session.
Minor civil matters (actions not exceeding £5 in value) may be tried by justices
of the peace.
The Court of Session
The Court of Session is the supreme civil court in Scotland. It was established in
1532 and consists at present of 15 judges. The Court is divided into two parts—the
Inner House, which is mainly an appeal court, and the Outer House, a court of
first instance, where, inter alia, all actions for divorce are taken. The Inner House
is divided into two Divisions of equal status, each consisting of four judges; the
First Division being presided over by the Lord President, and the Second Division
by the Lord Justice Clerk. From the Inner House, an appeal may lie to the House of
Lords.
The Scottish Land Court
This is a special court in Scotland for dealing with certain agricultural matters.
The Court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank and dignity of
a Judge of the Court of Session.
Criminal Courts in England and Wales
The criminal courts in England and Wales include:
Petty Sessional or Magistrates’ Courts
Magistrates’ courts are courts of summary jurisdiction where persons accused
of all kinds of technical offences and a large number of the less serious indictable
offences may be tried without a jury (see p. 71). These courts are also used for
committal proceedings, i.e. the public conduct, by magistrates, of preliminary
inquiries into indictable offences to determine whether or not an accused person
should be committed for trial. In 1954, over 97 per cent of all persons convicted
were convicted at magistrates’ courts; and in cases where the charge was withdrawn
or the accused was acquitted, the proportion of summary proceedings to proceed¬
ings at superior courts was even higher.
The majority of magistrates’ courts are presided over by two or more unpaid ‘ lay ’
magistrates or justices of the peace, who are appointed by the Crown, in each
county, and for each borough which has its own commission of the peace, on the
1 Scotland is divided into 12 Sheriffdoms, each provided with a Sheriff and a varying
number of Sheriffs-Substitute.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
75
recommendation of the Lord Chancellor, who is advised as to a county by the Lord
Lieutenant1 with the assistance of an advisory committee, and as to boroughs by
separate advisory committees. There are also a few persons who are authorized by
statute to act as justices, by virtue of holding some other public office, e.g., mayors
of county and non-county boroughs and chairmen of county councils.
In central London, the courts are presided over by paid metropolitan magis¬
trates ; some of the larger towns also have stipendiary magistrates.
Juvenile Courts in England and Wales are specially constituted courts of summary
jurisdiction which deal with children and young persons (i.e. persons under 17
years of age) charged with any offence except homicide. They also hear applications
in respect of children and young persons in need of care or protection or beyond
control, truancy cases and the majority of applications for adoption.
Outside the Metropolitan (London) magistrates’ courts area the justices for each
petty sessional division elect from their numbers a panel of justices specially
qualified to deal with juvenile cases. Within the Metropolitan area the panel is
appointed by the Home Secretary.
A juvenile court consists of not more than three justices drawn from the panel
and must, except in special circumstances, include a man and a woman. A juvenile
court must sit either in a different room or building from that in which other courts
are sitting or on a different day. Only persons within certain specified categories are
admitted and only limited publicity is allowed.
Domestic proceedings are also tried by not more than three justices, of whom
one should be a man and one a woman. The hearing of domestic proceedings is
separated from other business and, as in juvenile courts, the public is excluded.
Courts of Quarter Session
There are two different kinds of Quarter Sessions—county sessions and borough
sessions; both are normally held four times a year.
County Quarter Sessions consist of the magistrates of the county assembled
together under a legally qualified chairman. In those boroughs, which hold separate
Quarter Sessions, the courts are presided over by a Recorder, who is a salaried
barrister, as sole judge. Trial by jury applies at both borough and county sessions.
The jurisdiction of Quarter Sessions covers the less serious indictable offences;
the courts are debarred, for example, from trying any crime that carries the death
sentence or (subject to certain exceptions) imprisonment for life.
Assizes
The Courts of Assize are branches of the High Court of Justice. They are held
in the county towns and in certain big cities three times a year, a Queen’s Bench
judge or a Commissioner of Assize (who may be a barrister commissioned to act as
a judge) presiding. The Assize judges work on circuits covering England and Wales,
and ti-avel from one county towm to another in the course of their duties. They can
try any indictable offence committed in the county.
At the winter and summer Assizes, civil business as well as criminal may be
taken, but except in a few large towns the autumn Assize is confined to criminal cases.
The Central Criminal Court
The Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey acts as the Court of Assize for the
criminal business of London, Middlesex and parts of the Home Counties. The

Its holder was chief among the county justices and commander of the county militia.
y6 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
judges include: a judge chosen from the Queen’s Bench Division in rotation for
each monthly session of the Court; the Recorder of London; the Common Serjeant;
and two additional judges of the Mayor’s and City of London Court.
Criminal Appeals
Appeals may be made direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court on a
point of law; but the more usual kind of appeal is the appeal of a convicted person
against his conviction or his sentence. Appeals of this kind from a magistrates
court are heard in the counties by the Appeal Committee of Quarter Sessions, con¬
sisting of between three and twelve magistrates, and in the boroughs by the
Recorder; in neither case is a jury required.
Appeals against convictions or sentences by Quarter Sessions or Assizes go to the
Court of Criminal Appeal. Appeals may be made on any point of law, and also, by
leave, on a point of fact.
The Court of Criminal Appeal consists of the Lord Chief Justice and a number
of Queen’s Bench judges; three in session is the usual number.
A further appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the House of Lords on a
point of law can be made if the Attorney-General grants a certificate affirming that
the appeal is of ‘ exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public
interest that a further appeal should be brought’. Appeals of this kind are very rare.
Criminal Courts in Scotland
The bulk of the criminal prosecutions in Scotland are dealt with in the Sheriff:
Court (see p. 74), and only minor offences are tried in Police Courts in burghs and
in Justice of the Peace Courts in counties. Cases involving serious crime are taken
in the High Court of Justiciary, which is the supreme criminal court of first instance.
It also functions as an appeal court from inferior criminal courts. It consists of the
Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of Session), the
Lord Justice Clerk and thirteen Lords Commissioners of Justiciary who are also
judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the court is in Edinburgh, but the
judges go on circuit to preside at trials in other towns. Appeals to the High Court
are heard by three or more judges; there is no further appeal to the House of
Lords.
Courts in Northern Ireland
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in
England and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller community.
The main difference is that all petty sessional cases are dealt with by resident
magistrates who correspond to the metropolitan or stipendiary magistrates of
England and Wales. The inferior courts, that is to say the courts where the less
serious cases are tried, are administered by the Parliament of Northern Ireland; the
administration of the superior courts has been reserved to the Parliament of the
United Kingdom.
The Coroner’s Court
Where a person appears to have died a violent or unnatural death or a sudden
death of which the cause is unknown, or in certain other circumstances, the death
must be reported to a coroner1 within whose jurisdiction the body is lying. When
a death is reported to a coroner, he inquires how, when, and where the deceased
1 A coroner may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical practitioner of not less than five
years’ standing. Coroners are appointed by county and county borough councils.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
77
died. A coroner may hold an inquest in court for this purpose and he must hold an
inquest if he has reasonable cause to believe that the deceased has died a violent or
unnatural death or has died in prison or in circumstances for which an Act of
Parliament provides that an inquest must be held. A jury must be summoned if
there is reason to suspect that the deceased came by his death by murder, man¬
slaughter, or infanticide, or from an accident arising out of the use of a vehicle in
a street or public highway, or in certain other special circumstances. If the jury
returns a verdict of murder, manslaughter or infanticide by a particular person, the
coroner commits that person for trial at Assizes. If the death is merely a sudden
death of which the cause is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest but m3y
order a post-mortem examination to ascertain the cause of death.
Any person finding objects of gold or silver hidden in the soil or in buildings, the
original owner of which cannot be traced, must report the find to a coroner. The
coroner then holds an inquest with a jury to inquire whether the objects are
‘treasure trove’ and who was the finder thereof. If it is decided that the objects are
treasure trove, then, though the law is that treasure trove vests in the Crown, the
declared finder will either receive them back or be paid their full market value.
In Scotland, the office of Coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal inquires
privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may report the
results of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that Crown Counsel may
consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
Ecclesiastical Courts
The established Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts, which
constitute a graduated hierarchy. They include the Court of the Archdeacon, the
Consistory Court of the Bishop of each diocese and the provincial courts of the
Archbishops of Canterbury and of York.
The ecclesiastical courts, which are still courts in the full sense of the word, have
jurisdiction only in matters of purely ecclesiastical concern, such as questions of
doctrine and ritual, ordination, consecration, and the celebration of divine service.
Special Tribunals
A number of special tribunals1 exist in the United Kingdom for the exercise of
what is known as administrative justice, i.e. for the settlement of disputes or the
determination of rights in cases where the public interest is the central issue.
Such tribunals, though too various to permit of formal classification, include
professional tribunals, e.g., the General Medical Council, and the Disciplinary
Committee of the Law Society, which regulates the professional practice, conduct
and discipline of solicitors; ministerial tribunals, e.g., the Pensions Appeal Tri¬
bunals, the Lands Tribunal, the Rent Tribunals, and the Local Appeal Tribunals
for Insurance Benefits; and the disciplinary committees of marketing boards.
Appeals on a point of law in most cases lie from such tribunals either to a single
judge of the High Court or to permanent commissioners appointed under an Act
of Parliament or to the appropriate minister.
Military Courts
The jurisdiction of military courts or courts martial is exclusively over persons
subject to military law, and appeals lie to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, set up
by the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act, 1951. The powers of courts martial are limited
1 In November 1955 a committee was appointed by the Government to inquire into the
practice and procedure of administrative tribunals.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
78
to those conferred on them by statute, and if these powers are exceeded, the person
injured has his remedy in the High Court.
THE JUDICIARY
The judiciary of the United Kingdom is independent. That is to say, it is free to
administer the law under the protection of the law without fear or favour. All
judges, from those of the House of Lords and the Supreme Courts to the ‘lay’
magistrates or justices of the peace, must not only be, but must appear to be,
completely impartial, for it is of fundamental importance that ‘justice should not
ohly be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done’.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts in that ‘ all jurisdiction
of the courts is either indirectly or immediately derived from the Crown’1; but
since the end of the seventeenth century it has been established that the executive
cannot disturb or delay the course of common justice, attempt to force the judges
to act otherwise than impartially, or use the prerogative powers of the Crown to
create courts to administer any system of law other than common law.
The independence of the judiciary vis-a-vis the legislature is likewise strictly
observed. Thus, although the Act of Settlement, 1701, laid down that the judges
of the superior courts should be appointed by the Crown to hold office during
good behaviour subject to a power of removal by the Sovereign on an address by
both Houses of Parliament, it may be stated with confidence that no such address
would ever be moved to interfere with judicial independence. Similarly, although
no court in the United Kingdom would ever question the validity of an Act of
Parliament which had been duly passed by both Houses of Parliament and duly
promulgated and published by the proper authority, it might, through its inter¬
pretation of the statute, come to a decision contrary to the policy of the Govern¬
ment which introduced the Act. In such a case, it would be open to the
Government to persuade Parliament to clarify or amend the statute, or even to pass
a new Act to reverse the decision of the court. It would not be open to it to
penalize the judge or to try to influence the court in any other way.
Administration of the Judicial System
There is no Minister of Justice in the United Kingdom. The central responsi¬
bility for the administration of the judicial system in England and Wales lies partly
with the Lord Chancellor and partly with the Home Secretary. The Prime Minister
is also concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the Crown the
appointment of the Lord Justices of Appeal and that of the Lords of Appeal in
Ordinary (see pp. 73~74)-
Apart from the appointment of the Lord Justices of Appeal, Crown appoint¬
ments to the High Court bench are made on the recommendation of the Lord
Chancellor, who is also responsible for recommending to the Crown the appoint¬
ment or removal of justices of the peace, Recorders of boroughs and metropolitan
and stipendiary magistrates. County Court judges are appointed by the Lord
Chancellor (except in Lancashire, where they are nominated by the Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster).2 The administrative business of the Supreme Court of
Judicature and the appointment of court officials is partly in the hands of the Lord
Chancellor and partly in the hands of the appropriate judges. The Lord Chancellor
is a member of the Rule Committee which makes the rules of the Supreme Court;
1 Blackstone's Commentaries.
2 Under clause 21 of the Administration of Justice Bill, which received its second
reading in the House of Lords in November 1955, provision is made for the appointment
of county court judges by the Crown, on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor or
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
79
he also appoints the County Court Rule Committee and has power to alter or to
disallow the rules made by it. In addition, responsibility for initiating proposals for
judicial reform, save in the field of criminal law, lies with the Lord Chancellor, who
is advised in this matter by the Law Reform Committee and the Private Inter¬
national Law Committee, both established in 1952.
The Home Secretary is responsible for approving appointments of clerks to
justices throughout England and Wales, and for the general administration of
magistrates’ courts, except in relation to their judicial functions in which they can
be controlled only by the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court. The local
responsibility for the administration of magistrates’ courts lies with the magistrates’
courts committees, of which there is one for each county and county borough.
In Scotland, the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appointment of
the Lord President and Lord Justice General and also of the Lord Justice Clerk
(see p. 76). Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies with the
Secretary of State for Scotland on the nomination of the Lord Advocate. The High
Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session are administered by the Clerk of the
Justiciary and his staff and the Principal Clerk of Session and his staff respectively.
Powers of appointment and removal of justices of the peace, formerly held by the
Lord Chancellor, were transferred in 1955 to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
THE LEGAL PROFESSION
The legal profession of England and Wales is strictly divided into two classes of
lawyers—barristers and solicitors. The distinction, which is due mainly to historical
causes, is found also in Northern Ireland, Scotland and certain parts of the
Commonwealth.
No hard and fast line can be drawn between the work of the solicitor and the
work of the barrister, since there are many barristers who do little advocacy, and
there are solicitors who do little else, and who have made considerable reputations
for themselves in the courts in which they are permitted to appear. In general,
however, it may be said that solicitors are professional men who undertake legal
business for lay clients; while barristers advise on legal problems submitted
through solicitors, and conduct legal proceedings in the higher courts.
A barrister is required to have reached an accepted educational standard, to have
passed the legal examinations conducted by the Council of Legal Education and to
have become a member of one of the four Inns of Court—Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s
Inn, the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple. A barrister with a substantial
junior practice may apply to the Lord Chancellor for a patent appointing him
Queen’s Counsel—a proceeding that is known as ‘taking silk’. The highest
appointments in the legal profession, including those of Attorney-General,
Solicitor-General, and other Law Officers of the Crown, are usually open only to
barristers who have become Queen’s Counsel. The professional conduct of a
barrister is subject to the scrutiny of the General Council of the Bar; but discip¬
linary powers are vested exclusively in the Benchers of the Inns of Court.
The prospective solicitor must be considered suitable by the appropriate Com¬
mittee of the Law Society and he must enter into ‘Articles of Clerkship’ with a
practising solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his
professional career. The term of articles lasts for three or five years, depending
upon the educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must pass the
necessary examinations held by the Law Society and, unless he has been a barrister
or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally required to attend a course of
studies at a recognized law school. Once a solicitor is qualified, he becomes an

officer of the Supreme Court of Judicature. He may also become a member of the
Law Society.
In Scotland, the conditions for admission as, and the standing of, advocates and
solicitors are much the same as those applying in the case of barristers and solicitors
in England and Wales.
LEGAL AID
Schemes for free legal assistance to persons of slender means and resources have
existed in some courts and to a limited extent for centuries in England and Wales
and in Scotland. The schemes were revised in 1949 when the Legal Aid and Advice
Act and the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act received Royal Assent. These
Acts were introduced to improve and extend the existing arrangements in civil
proceedings so that no one would be financially unable to prosecute a just and
reasonable claim or to defend a legal right, and to make the facilities already avail¬
able in criminal proceedings more easily accessible to those who need them. The
Acts also provided that solicitors and barristers acting for persons receiving legal aid
should no longer be required to act gratuitously in civil cases, but should be
remunerated for their services from public funds.
Legal Aid in Civil Cases
Legal aid in civil cases is now available to persons whose income, computed in
accordance with rules applied by the National Assistance Board, does not exceed
£420 a year, and whose capital, as so computed, does not exceed £500. Where an
assisted person can afford to make a contribution to the costs of his case, he is
required, as a condition of receiving legal aid, to pay an amount which is settled
with due regard to his financial resources.
In England and Wales, legal aid in civil cases has been limited to proceedings
started in the High Court or in the Court of Appeal, although eventually the
scheme will cover representation in courts of all types, from magistrates’ courts up
to the House of Lords.1 The scheme is operated through the Law Society under the
general guidance of the Lord Chancellor. The cost is met from a Legal Aid Fund,
drawn from three sources: contributions from assisted persons; costs recovered
from opposite parties in litigation; and a grant from the Exchequer.
For the purposes of the scheme, England and Wales are divided into twelve
areas. In each area a committee of solicitors and barristers, known as an area com¬
mittee, is responsible for the scheme’s initial organization and subsequent admini¬
stration. These committees are responsible for setting up legal aid centres to which
anyone seeking legal aid may apply. Committees hear the facts, and if they consider
that there is a prima facie case they give it their support. The person who wishes
to bring the action is then allowed to select from a panel a solicitor and, if neces¬
sary, a barrister, to conduct his case. Certain types of action, including breach of
promise to marry, and libel and slander, are excluded from the scheme.
In Scotland the Legal Aid Scheme is administered by the Law Society of
Scotland through a Central Supervisory Committee, a Supreme Court Committee
and twenty-one local committees. Legal aid is at present available for civil pro¬
ceedings in the Court of Session and the Sheriff Courts. An applicant for legal aid
in Scotland is required to show a ‘ probable cause ’ and produce in support of his
application a statement corroborated according to the requirements of Scottish law.
1 Under the Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, Order 1955, legal aid will be available in
connection with proceedings in county courts and certain local courts of similar standing
as from 1st January 1956.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

Legal Aid in Criminal Courts
Free legal aid is already available in the criminal courts in England and Wales
under the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, the Poor Prisoners’ Defence Act, 1930, and
the Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act, 1933. The Legal Aid and Advice Act,
1949, makes certain procedural changes in the system and, when fully implemented,
will transfer financial responsibility for paying for free legal aid from local to
central funds. It also lays down the principle of allowing fair remuneration accord¬
ing to the work actually and reasonably done.
Under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1952, the courts also have power, in the
case of an indictable offence, to order the reasonable costs of the defence to be paid
out of local funds when the accused has been discharged by the magistrates’ court
or acquitted. A magistrates’ court has power under the Act if it dismisses an
information on summary trial to order such costs to be paid to the accused by the
prosecutor as it considers just and reasonable.
Pending the full implementation of the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act,
legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons in Scotland under the Poor’s
Roll system, which is administered on a voluntary basis by the legal profession.
In Northern Ireland, free legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons
under the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act, 1945. The cost of providing
free legal aid is met out of public funds.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The chief aims of the penal system of the United Kingdom are deterrence and
reformation. The principle underlying the system is that its effectiveness depends
less on the punitive treatment of the detected offender than in its total impact—fear
of detection, public trial and conviction and the possibility of punishment, whether
by imprisonment or otherwise. The treatment of offenders is therefore based as far
as possible upon measures for the social rehabilitation of the offender rather than
upon measures intended simply to punish the offender for his crime.
The penalties which may be imposed by the courts according to the law depend
on the circumstances of the offence and the offender, and although maximum
penalties are prescribed by law, the courts have discretion (within the limits
provided) in imposing sentence.1 In general the courts have power to impose either
imprisonment or a fine for serious offences, and, in certain cases, both; while most
minor offences are punishable by a fine only, with the alternative of imprisonment
for failure to pay within the time allowed. Moreover, it is at the discretion of the
court, instead of sentencing an offender, to discharge him absolutely, to discharge
him conditionally (i.e. subject to conditions that he commits no offence during a
specified period not exceeding twelve months), or to place him on probation (see
p. 87). There are special provisions governing the treatment of young offenders
(see pp. 85-88). The Criminal Justice Act, 1948, and the Criminal Justice (Scotland)
Act, 1949, provide that courts shall not sentence a person under 21 years of age to
imprisonment unless they consider that no other method of dealing with him is
appropriate.
The death sentence is imposed only on persons found guilty of murder or
treason.2 It may not be passed upon anyone who was under 18 years of age at the
time the crime was committed, upon a pregnant woman, or upon anyone who is
1 Except where the offence is punishable by death, when the death sentence must be
pronounced, although it is by no means always carried out.
2 In practice, no death sentences are carried out for treason in time of peace.

found to be legally insane. Furthermore, it is the long-established practice for the
Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland to review every capital case
before the law is allowed to take its course and to consider whether there are
grounds for advising the Crown to exercise the Prerogative of Mercy. Where a
reprieve is recommended, the sentence of death is commuted to one of imprison¬
ment for life.1
Two special types of treatment have been devised to deal with the persistent
offender. Offenders of 21 years of age or over may be sentenced to corrective train¬
ing if they are convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term
of two years or more and have been convicted on at least two previous occasions
since attaining the age of 17 of offences punishable with such a sentence. Corrective
training is intended to reform the offender as well as to prevent crime and is
normally imposed for not less than two or not more than four years, as the court
decides.
Persons who are not less than 30 years of age and are convicted of offences
punishable with imprisonment for a term of two years or more and have been
convicted on at least three previous occasions since attaining the age of 17 of
offences punishable with such a sentence and have been sentenced to Borstal,
imprisonment or corrective training on at least two of these occasions, may be
sentenced to preventive detention. Preventive detention is primarily for the protec¬
tion of the public, and the sentence runs for not less than five or more than 14 years
as the court decides.
Administrative Authorities
In England and Wales, general responsibility for all institutions for the treatment
of offenders is vested in the Plome Secretary. His statutory powers and duties in this
connection include the making of rules for the governance of such institutions, the
recommendation of persons for appointment by the Crown as Prison Commis¬
sioners, and the appointment of Boards of Visitors.
In the discharge of his duties relating to institutions for offenders, the Home
Secretary is advised by an Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders, which
also acts as the National Working Group for the Economic and Social Council of
the United Nations, and as the National Committee of the International Penal and
Penitentiary Commission.
Responsibility to the Home Secretary for the administration of prisons, Borstal
Institutions and Detention Centres in England and Wales lies with the Prison
Commission, assisted by inspectors and by a professional and technical staff. The
Prison Commission consists of not more than five Commissioners, who are ap¬
pointed by the Crown, including the chairman, who is appointed to that office by
the Home Secretary. There are also a number of Assistant Commissioners who are
inspectors under the Prison Acts.
The oversight of each of these institutions is the responsibility of either Visiting
Committees appointed by the justices for those prisons to which convicted persons
are committed direct from their courts, or Boards of Visitors appointed by the
Home Secretary for the other prisons and institutions. The main functions of
the committees and boards are: to act as the superior disciplinary authority of the
prison or institution; to constitute an independent judicial body to which any
prisoner or inmate may make a complaint or request; and to report direct to the
Home Secretary, both by formal annual report and as occasion may require, on
every aspect of the administration of the prison. In Borstal Institutions and
1 Rather more than half the death sentences passed each year are actually carried out.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 83
preventive detention prisons, the boards also advise the Prison Commissioners on
the release of the inmates on licence.
The prison systems of Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of
the Secretary of State for Scotland and of the Minister for Home Affairs respec¬
tively, and are administered by the Plome Departments in Edinburgh and in Belfast.
Prisons
Prisons in England and Wales are of the following types: local prisons (i) of the
ordinary type which receive all classes of prisoners direct from the courts, (2) special
(these may be open or walled) for short-sentence prisoners, chiefly first offenders;
regional training prisons, some of which are open, for first offenders and trainable
prisoners of other categories; corrective training prisons; and central prisons for
long-term recidivists, preventive detention prisoners and long-term prisoners of
the ‘ Star ’ class—one for the latter class is an open prison.
In Northern Ireland, with its smaller population, the necessity for several kinds
of prison for the separation of various classes of prisoners does not arise to the
same extent as in England and Wales. The Scottish system of classification of
prisoners is broadly the same as that of England and Wales; but each prison in
Scotland accommodates more than one classification group.
Full-time prison officers of all ranks, except chaplains, are permanent civil
servants. At the end of September 1955 prison staff of all grades in England and
Wales numbered about 7,200. Some 9 per cent of this number were women.
Classification of Prisoners
Every person committed to prison is first received in the local prison serving the
court from which he is committed. Subsequently, he may either serve his whole
sentence at the local prison or he may be sent to another institution, depending on his
age, the length and nature of his sentence, and his personal history and character.
The object of classification is first to ensure the separation of the sexes, of young
persons from adults, of untried prisoners from convicted prisoners and of civil
prisoners from criminal prisoners; secondly to prevent contamination, among
convicted prisoners, of the better by the worse; and thirdly to provide training
appropriate to their needs for those among convicted prisoners who seem likely to
benefit therefrom.
Training
The main elements of prison training (including corrective training) have been
defined as (1) the provision of work which will, so far as is practicable, help to fit
prisoners to earn their living after release, with technical training in skilled trades
for suitable persons, (2) the provision of suitable educational facilities, and (3) the
provision of every opportunity for the development of a sense of personal responsi¬
bility, including (for suitable persons) training in open conditions.
Full training can be given only in prisons set aside for the purpose, which provide
vocational training courses, based on a Ministry of Labour and National Service
syllabus, at which prisoners may receive a theoretical and practical training in a
number of skilled trades. The principles on which training is based, however, hold
good for all prisons and are applied as far as individual conditions permit.
Employment
Prison industries are organized under the control of a Director of Industries,
who has a head office staff of technical officers and supervisors, including a super¬
visor of farms and gardens, and industrial managers at the prisons.
84
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Except in training and central prisons, where the hours are longer, prisoners in
England and Wales spend at present about 25 hours a week in the workshops or
in other employment such as building, farm work, domestic work and gardening, in
company with their fellow prisoners, and conversation is allowed. In most of the
Scottish prisons prisoners are employed for nearly 40 hours a week.
All prisoners are entitled to earn a limited amount from the first day of their
sentence; these amounts may be increased for satisfactory output after a specified
lapse of time.
Education
Educational schemes are provided in prisons in England, Wales, and Scotland
by the local education authorities with the advice of the Government Departments
responsible for education in their respective countries. In England and Wales the
local authorities are reimbursed for the full cost of their services, and the work is
under the organizational control of the Assistant Commissioner for Education in
the Prison Commission. Evening Institutes have been established; and a wide range
of correspondence courses is made available for those who have a serious desire to
improve their education and qualifications.
Educational schemes are supplemented by periodical lectures, film displays,
concerts, and dramatic performances. Prisoners may also use the prison library,
which in most cases is now stocked by the county, city or borough library
committee.
Welfare
A chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland)
and a Roman Catholic priest are appointed to every prison. Ministers of the
Methodist Church and of other denominations are either appointed or specially
called in as required. The chaplain is generally responsible for welfare in the
prison to which he is appointed. Regular services are held, and chaplains and other
ministers may visit prisoners in their cells.
Prisoners may also be visited by their relatives and friends at specified intervals
and, in England and Wales, by recognized prison visitors asked to serve in this
field by the Prison Commissioners. The voluntary work of these visitors is co¬
ordinated and guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
Remission of Sentence
On reception, all prisoners, except those sentenced to preventive detention, are
credited with remission of one-third of their sentence (one-fourth in Northern
Ireland), provided that this does not reduce their sentence below 30 days. A
prisoner sentenced to preventive detention obtains remission of one-third or one-
sixth of his sentence according to an assessment of his character, conduct and
prospects which is made after he has served a substantial part of his sentence. In
addition, at successive stages of a prisoner’s sentence, he becomes entitled to
additional privileges; for example, he is allowed to have meals and recreation with
his fellow prisoners and to have some of his personal belongings in his cell.
For breaches of discipline in prison, the Governor or the Visiting Committee or
the Board of Visitors have power to order forfeiture of remission and of privileges.
After-Care of Prisoners
Prisoners from local prisons are assisted on discharge by Discharged Prisoners’
Aid Societies, which are local and voluntary bodies supported partly by private
and partly by public funds. The work of the local societies is co-ordinated by the
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 85
National Associations of Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Societies for England and
Wales and for Scotland, both of which depend on a grant from public funds for
their administrative expenses. For persons discharged from other prisons and from
Borstal Institutions, after-care in England and Wales is in the hands of the Central
After-Care Association, a voluntary body financed from public funds and governed
by a council appointed by the Home Secretary, which includes in its membership
representatives of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, of the National
Assistance Board and of the Probation Service. The Secretary of State for Scotland
appoints an After-Care Council to carry out similar duties in Scotland.
In England and Wales the Association works through local associates, usually
Probation Officers, who, since the passing of the Criminal Justice Act, have added
after-care to their other duties, and in Scotland through voluntary guardians. These
officers make all arrangements for the reception of the prisoner after his discharge,
and will advise, assist and befriend him for as long as is necessary or required by
statute.
Treatment of Young Offenders
Under the English and Scottish legal systems, a child under the age of eight
cannot be charged with an offence, and a child over eight but under fourteen years
old charged with an offence other than homicide must be dealt with in a juvenile
court. In England and Wales a young person between fourteen and seventeen years
of age charged with an indictable offence (see p. 71) may be dealt with summarily
(as is usually the case) or committed for trial by jury. In certain cases young persons
may claim to be tried by jury, though this right is rarely exercised. In Scotland all
young persons up to the age of 17 years of age charged with offences must be dealt
with in juvenile courts.
The following methods of treatment are available in law for dealing with children
and young persons who have been found guilty of committing an offence: absolute
discharge; conditional discharge; fines (imposed upon the offender himself if a
young person, or upon his parents if a child); probation (see p. 87); committal to
the care of a fit person (normally the appropriate local authority) until the age of 18;
or a period of detention in one of the different types of institution which are avail¬
able when institutional treatment is considered necessary.
Remand Homes
Remand Homes are provided by local authorities for the safe custody of boys and
girls under the age of 17 before their appearance in court, or between court
appearances (while inquiries are made as to the best method of treatment for them),
while they are awaiting vacancies in approved schools, or for a short period (up to
a month) of punitive detention. There are facilities for observation, and valuable
reports can be provided as a result of the stay in a Remand Home.
Borstal Institutions
There are various types of Borstal Institution providing training and conditions
suitable to different types of character and stages of development. For boys in
England and Wales there are two Borstal Allocation Centres, and 14 Training
Borstals, one Correction and one Recall Centre; and there are two Training Borstals
and one Recall Centre for girls. In Scotland, there are four Borstals for boys and
two for girls; and in Northern Ireland, one for boys and one for girls. The period of
the sentence is in effect four years (three years in Scotland and Northern Ireland),
the first part being up to three years’ training (two in Northern Ireland) in a Borstal
Institution, and the second a period of controlled freedom under supervision. In
86
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scotland the supervision period is for one year from the date of release from the
Institution or until the expiration of three years from the date of sentence, which¬
ever is the shorter. The system of training seeks the all-round development of
character and capacities, and is based on progressive trust demanding increasing
personal decision, responsibility and self-control. There is much freedom of move¬
ment and many Borstals are conducted in open conditions. An initial period of
classification ensures that each boy or girl is sent to the institution best suited to his
or her requirements.
Approved Schools
Approved Schools are residential schools approved by the Home Secretary under
the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933, by the Secretary of State for Scotland
(working through the Scottish Education Department) under the similar Scottish
Act of 1937, and by the Minister of Home Affairs in Northern Ireland under the
similar Northern Ireland Act of 1950, for the education and training of young
offenders and children committed to them by the courts as in need of care or
protection. Approved Schools may be provided by local authorities, by voluntary
organizations concerned with the welfare of children on a national scale, or by local
committees formed for the purpose by people interested in such work. The number
of Approved Schools in England and Wales in mid-1955 was 127 but was likely to
be reduced to 119 by the end of 1955, owing to the decrease in juvenile delinquency.
There are 23 Approved Schools in Scotland and six in Northern Ireland.
The schools are for boys only or for girls only. They are formally classified
according to the age ranges of the children on admission, and include separate
schools for Roman Catholic children. The assignment of a child to a school in the
appropriate age group is determined by a variety of considerations, including the
location of the school in relation to the child’s home, the type of training provided,
and the probable reaction of a child to the individual personalities of the staff. In
general, the education follows the lines of that given in ordinary schools, with
vocational training for older boys and girls; the emphasis is on character building,
and close attention is given to after-care.
The period for which a child or young person may be detained in an Approved
School is determined by law and is three years, except that children under the
age of 12 years and 4 months at the time of committal may be kept until the age of
15 years and 4 months,1 while those over the age of 16 on committal can be detained
only up to the age of 19, or 19J if they have been found guilty of absconding or of
serious misconduct in an Approved School. School managers are under an obliga¬
tion to review the progress of each child in their school towards the end of the first
year of his detention and thereafter at least quarterly, with a view to releasing him
on licence as soon as he is fit to go out.
Statutory responsibility for after-care rests on the school managers. A boy or girl
on release remains under the care of the managers during the periods of licence and
supervision. The period of licence lasts until the expiry of the time for which the
boy or girl might have been legally detained in the school. The period of super¬
vision lasts for three years more, or until the boy or girl reaches the age of 21,
whichever is the shorter period. Managers are assisted in their after-care work by
Welfare Officers and social service organizations.
1 In Northern Ireland the period is three years or until the child reaches the age of
14 years and 4 months, whichever is the later. School-leaving age in Northern Ireland is
still 14.

Attendance Centres
Attendance Centres have been established in England and Wales in some 32
towns to deal with boys between the ages of 12 and 17 found guilty of offences for
which an adult can be sentenced to imprisonment. Attendance at such a centre is
a comparatively new form of treatment (the first centre was opened in 1950)
designed to teach young offenders a respect for the law and to give them some
instruction in the proper use of leisure. Boys ordered to attend centres must do so
during their spare time on Saturday mornings or afternoons; they may be required
to attend for up to three hours on any one occasion and for not more than twelve
hours in all. The activities include a period of instruction in handicrafts, or a lecture
(e.g., on first aid) and a period of physical training or disciplinary tasks, under
supervision. Efforts are made at the centres to induce the boys to join a youth club
or other suitable organization.
Detention Centres
Detention Centres are designed to provide a ‘ short sharp shock ’ for those who
have not yet developed a definitely anti-social attitude, but who need to be taught
that the law cannot be defied with impunity. The regime in such a centre is designed
to deprive the boy of his liberty and of all the elements of what he thinks of as a
‘good time’, for a period varying between one and six months, and to oblige him
for this period to live a brisk disciplined life, maintaining the highest possible
standards at the highest possible tempo. Each boy in a detention centre must be
alert, punctual and tidy, and emphasis is placed on the inculcation of obedience,
cleanliness and good manners. The routine provides a normal working week of
44 hours of day and evening classes, including one hour daily devoted to physical
training. Boys of compulsory school age receive full-time education. In 1955 there
were two Detention Centres in England and Wales—a junior centre for boys over
14 and under 17, accommodating about 60 boys, and a senior centre for boys over
17 and under 21, accommodating about 75 boys. Two other Detention Centres are
to be opened before April 1956.
Probation
The probation system is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender
while he remains at work or at school in the community under the supervision of a
probation officer, whose duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal
feature of the system is that it relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before
making a probation order, the court must explain its effects to the person con¬
cerned and inform him that if he fails to comply with its requirements he will be
liable to be dealt with for the original offence. A probation order cannot be made
without the consent of the person concerned unless (in England and Wales only)
he is under 14 years of age. The order usually requires the probationer to keep in
regular touch with the probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an
industrious life. It may also require him to live in a specified place, or to submit to
treatment for his mental condition. A probation order is made for not less than one
year and not more than three years.
Every magistrates’ court and superior criminal court must have available the
services of probation officers of both sexes. In 1955 the total numbers were: 1,229
whole-time and 66 part-time probation officers in England and Wales, 14 whole¬
time and one part-time in Northern Ireland, and no whole-time and 35 part-time
in Scotland. The appointment of probation officers is the responsibility of the
Home Secretary in the Metropolitan Magistrates’ Court area; elsewhere it is the
responsibility of probation committees appointed by magistrates in England and
88
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Wales, and by local authorities in Scotland where appointments of probation
officers are subject to a confirmation by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Training facilities in England and Wales are provided by the Home Office on the
advice of the Probation Advisory and Training Board. In Scotland training is
provided during the first year of appointment and before the officer is allowed to
make probation work his permanent career.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organized and controlled on a local basis
under the guidance of those Ministers of the Crown who are responsible for the
maintenance of law and order in their respective countries. In England and Wales
the responsible Minister is the Home Secretary and Minister for Welsh Affairs; in
Scotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Northern Ireland the police force
(see p. 91) is controlled by an Inspector-General who is responsible to Northern
Ireland’s Minister of Home Affairs.
POLICE IN GREAT BRITAIN
Police Forces
There are 126 separate, independent police forces in England and Wales, defined
according to area of responsibility as county forces, borough forces, combined
forces (which are forces whose area of responsibility extends over neighbouring
counties or boroughs), the Metropolitan Police Force (which is responsible for the
county of London, the county of Middlesex, parts of adjoining counties and three
county boroughs) and the City of London force. In Scotland there are 33 forces,
including county forces, burgh forces and combined forces.
In England and Wales and Scotland, police forces vary considerably in size
according to the area and population which they serve. Thus the Metropolitan
Police Force has an establishment of nearly 20,000, while the smallest force in
Scotland numbers 16.
The present strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is approximately
71,200 men and 2,200 women.
Police Authorities
In the counties of England and Wales the police authority is the Standing Joint
Committee, half of whose members are members of the county council while
the other half are justices of the peace. In the boroughs the police authority is
known as the Watch Committee and is elected by the council from its members.
The police authority of a combined force is made up of representatives of the
constituent areas as prescribed in the scheme under which they combine.
In the Metropolitan police district the Home Secretary is the police authority.
In the City of London the Common Council is the police authority, although it
usually appoints a standing committee to deal with all police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland the police authority for the counties is the county or joint county
council; in the large burghs it is the town council; where there are combined forces
there is a joint police committee.
It is the statutory duty of the police authorities to establish and maintain efficient
police forces for their areas. They are also responsible for the appointment of the
chief officer of police in their areas, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary
in the provinces of England and Wales, to the approval of the Crown in the City of
London, and to the approval of the Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland. In
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
89
the Metropolitan police district the chief officer of police and his immediate sub¬
ordinates are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Home
Secretary.
Central Authority
Co-ordination and a certain measure of central control are exercised through
detailed police regulations which are issued for their respective countries by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are required by
the Police Act, 1919, ‘ to act in consultation one with another ’ in this connection. The
police regulations cover the ‘government, mutual aid, pay, allowances, pensions,
clothing, expenses and conditions of service ’ of the members of all police forces to
which the Act applies.
The Secretaries of State are advised on questions relating to the conditions of
service of the police by the Police Council for Great Britain, a negotiating body
established on Whitley Council lines in September 1953. In their supervisory
responsibilities they are assisted by Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary, who
inspect each force, except the Metropolitan Police Force, at least once a year. There
are at present four inspectors in England and Wales and one in Scotland.
Central control also derives from the fact that all police authorities receive a
Government grant equal to half their net expenditure reckoned in accordance with
the provisions of Orders made under the Miscellaneous Financial Provisions Act,
I950 (as regards England and Wales), and the Police (Scotland) Act, 1946 (as
regards Scotland). These Orders empower the Home Secretary and the Secretary
of State for Scotland to withhold the grant in whole or in part, permanently or for
such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a police area is effi¬
ciently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered, or that the
rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
Centrally Run Services
During recent years the Home Office has established a number of common
services to supplement those provided by the police authorities for their own use.
In England and Wales such services include a training service, which provides a
number of residential district training centres and a central police college; an
installation and maintenance service of wireless equipment for the police; and a
forensic science service, which provides laboratories for the use of regional groups
of forces. In Scotland there is a central police college, which provides training
courses for recruits and courses of higher training; but the installation and main¬
tenance of wireless equipment is a direct charge upon the police authorities con¬
cerned and there is no centrally run forensic service. The Glasgow police force,
however, operates an extensive laboratory, the service of which is available to the
whole of the Scottish police, and the universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow
and St. Andrews render assistance when required.
In addition to the common services, a number of national services are provided
by the Metropolitan Police Force, whose functions in this respect include: (a) the
maintenance of the Criminal Record Office, which is a national registry of crimes
and their perpetrators containing a Central Fingerprint Bureau, available to all
police forces of the United Kingdom and certain foreign forces; (b) the publication
of the Police Gazette^ which contains particulars of people wanted for crime and
details of stolen property, and is supplied without charge to the police forces of the
United Kingdom and to certain Commonwealth and foreign forces; (c) the organiza¬
tion and control of the Special Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department at
1 A Scottish Police Gazette is published by the City of Glasgow Police Force.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
New Scotland Yard,1 whose duties include the protection of Royalty, Ministers of
the Crown, and distinguished foreign visitors; and (d) the carrying out of extradi¬
tion orders made by the courts. For these services, the Metropolitan Police Force
receives an additional Exchequer grant.
Police Officers
There are several different kinds of police officer in Great Britain: regular police
officers who usually serve for 25 years or more and thereafter retire on pension;
members of the first police reserve, which is composed almost entirely of police
pensioners or men with previous police experience who are prepared to give whole¬
time paid service to a particular force in an emergency, whether national or local;
members of the Special Constabulary, which consists of volunteers who perform
short periods of duty without pay in their spare time from their normal occupations;
the police of certain public services, e.g., the British Transport Commission Police,
the Civil Aviation Constabulary, the Port of London Authority Police and other
dock and harbour forces (who, although not subject to the supervision of the Home
Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland, have duties and powers analogous
to those of ordinary constables but limited to the premises and immediate neigh¬
bourhoods of their employers), the police of the defence services, i.e. the Admiralty
Constabulary, the War Department Constabulary, which guards War Office lands
and military property, the Royal Marine Police, who are employed chiefly in dock¬
yards, and the Air Ministry Constabulary.
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the ages
of 19 and 30, although an exception may be made in the case of ex-regular Navy,
Army and Air Force men of over 30 years of age. Women entrants in England
and Wales must be between the ages of 20 and 35, and in Scotland between 20 and
30 years old. The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
police district, are: chief constable, superintendent, inspector, sergeant and con¬
stable. The following intermediate ranks may also be adopted where the field of
operations renders them necessary: assistant chief constable, chief superintendent,
chief inspector and, in England and Wales only, station inspector, station sergeant
and acting sergeant. In the Metropolitan police district the chief officer is the
Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. He is assisted by a Deputy Commis¬
sioner and four Assistant Commissioners. Next in rank are commanders, then
deputy commanders; thereafter (i.e. from chief superintendent downwards) the
ranks are the same as in the rest of the country. In the City of London the ranks are
the same as in the provinces except that the chief officer is called the Commissioner
of Police and the second in command is an Assistant Commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a basic
principle of the service that its members must not only be free from political bias,
but must also be seen to be free of it. The Police Act, 1919, however, laid it down
that the police should have a statutory representative organization of their own.
This is known in England and Wales as the Police Federation and in Scotland
as the Scottish Police Federation and all constables, sergeants and inspectors belong
to it. Any part of the organization can make representations to the individual police
authority, to the individual chief officer of police, or, in England and Wales, to the
Secretary of State for the Home Department and, in Scotland, to the Secretary of
State for Scotland. Delegates from the Joint Central Committees of the two Federa¬
tions sit on the Police Council.
1 The Metropolitan Police Force is not the only force with a Criminal Investigation
Department; all provincial forces have their own Criminal Investigation Departments.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
91
Police Duties
Every police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office.
His powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by common law, are
exercised by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on the responsibility
of any person but himself. Thus, unless acting in pursuance of a magistrate’s
warrant, a police officer is liable for any wrongful or mistaken action on his part,
for he is not the servant of the police authority, and in discharging his duties must
rely on his own discretion and his own knowledge of the law.
The manifold functions of a police officer as a constable range from road or street
patrolling and traffic control to arresting persons committing offences or (in certain
cases) under suspicion of acting in an unlawful way. In England and Wales (although
not in Scotland where the police investigate cases and report to the prosecutor) the
police are responsible for initiating, and in most cases conducting, prosecutions,
except those which must be dealt with by the Director of Public Prosecutions, i.e.
if the offence is punishable by death; or when an offence is referred to him by a
Government Department, subject to his discretion; or in any case which appears
to the Director ‘ to be of importance or difficulty or which for any reason requires
his intervention’.
In addition to their duties as constables, police officers are sometimes appointed,
usually by the local authority, to be inspectors under an Act of Parliament; as such,
their duties may include the inspection of weights and measures, and investigation
into diseases of animals.
Police Cadets
Many police forces offer free training and paid work in police offices and stations
to boys between school-leaving age and the age at which they are called up for
National Service. Selection is limited to boys who are likely to become useful
members of the Force. On completing their full-time National Service, or at the
age of 19 years if deferment of National Service is granted, the cadets are eligible
for appointment as constables. One police force has a similar cadet scheme for girls.
POLICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The Royal Ulster Constabulary
The general control of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which is a State Force, is
vested in an Inspector-General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
The cost of the force is met from the Northern Ireland Exchequer, the County
Borough of Belfast contributing a token sum of £25,000 annually towards the cost
of policing the City of Belfast.
The present strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is approximately 2,700
officers and men. Conditions of service and pay follow closely on the lines of the
police service in Great Britain, the general duties pertaining to the tasks being
similar in all respects.
In addition to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, there exists in Northern Ireland an
auxiliary police force called the Ulster Special Constabulary, which is also under
the general control and direction of the Inspector-General. In the main, this force
is a part-time force and its duties cover training and assistance to the regular force
on special occasions. If necessary, however, its part-time personnel may be
mobilized for full-time duty and its duties extended to cover ordinary police duties.
The present strength of the Special Constabulary is approximately 10,300 officers
and men.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organized on a local basis, subject to a
measure of central control exercised by the Secretary of State for the Home
Department (in England and Wales) and the Secretary of State for Scotland (in
Scotland). The fire services in Northern Ireland are described on pp. 94-95.
Every place throughout the United Kingdom is covered by a public fire brigade.
FIRE SERVICES IN GREAT BRITAIN
There are at present 135 local authority fire brigades in England and Wales and
11 in Scotland.
Fire Authorities
The responsibility for fire-fighting functions, which was vested in the two
Secretaries of State on a national basis as an emergency measure during the second
world war, was restored in 1948 to local government control under the Fire Services
Act, 1947. The effect of the Act was to transform the National Fire Service (estab¬
lished in 1941) into separate fire brigades administered, in England and Wales, by
the county or county borough councils, who were created the Fire Authorities for
their areas and were given powers and duties which they exercise either separately
or as Combined Authorities where neighbouring councils care to make such
arrangements to increase the efficiency of the service. The Act provides that each
Fire Authority which is a county council (except London) must establish a Fire
Brigade Committee, consisting of both county council members and representatives
of the county district councils in the county, to deal on the county council’s behalf
with matters concerning fire prevention and control. In Scotland, the local authori¬
ties are grouped in eleven areas each with a single brigade; with the exception of
Glasgow, where the town council of the city is the responsible authority, each area
is administered by a Joint Committee representative of the councils of the counties
and large burghs in the area.
Central Control
The Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for
Scotland are empowered to make regulations prescribing such matters as conditions
of service, standards of efficiency and the organization of training in the local fire
brigades. In matters affecting the fire brigades as a whole (excluding regulations
about conditions of service and similar matters) each Secretary of State is advised
by a Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of representatives of the
local authority associations, representatives of the Chief Officers (Firemasters in
Scotland) and other members of the brigades, and other persons having special
qualifications for the purpose. The Advisory Councils are not concerned with the
conditions of service of members of the brigades. On these subjects the Secretaries
of State are advised by the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Fire
Brigades in Great Britain and the National Joint Council for Chief Officers of Local
Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain.
Central control is also exercised through the Inspectors of Fire Services, whose
duties include advising the Secretaries of State on technical matters. In 1955 there
were 11 inspectors and assistant inspectors in England and Wales and one inspector
and an assistant inspector in Scotland.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
93
Establishment Schemes
Each Fire Authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment
of officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and loca¬
tion of fire stations and the number and type of vehicles and appliances considered
necessary for the provision of an all-over cover of its area. Details of establishment
schemes, which must be approved by each Secretary of State for his own country,
vary considerably according to the fire risks in the area concerned; but in an English
county of about 500,000 acres and a mixed urban and rural population of some
750,000, for example, there might be 30 whole-time and part-time fire stations
equipped with 150 vehicles and appliances and served by a whole-time force of
approximately 250 and a part-time force of approximately 400 officers and men.
It is the duty of each fire authority to purchase such vehicles and equipment as
are required under the establishment scheme. Equipment is standardized, and
appliances are bought by fire authorities to Requirement Specifications which
ensure that essential standards are maintained, and yet allow sufficient freedom of
design to meet local requirements and further developments.
Operational Methods
Each Fire Authority is required to appoint a Chief Officer (Firemaster in
Scotland) to be the chief administrative and executive officer for the fire services in
its area. The appointment must be ratified in England and Wales by the Secretary
of State for the Home Department and in Scotland by the Secretary of State for
Scotland. The Chief Officer or Firemaster is responsible to the Fire Authority for
seeing that both the fire brigade and the fire department (which is the administra¬
tive centre and staff headquarters for the fire brigade) are organized and managed
in accordance with policy laid down.
Operational control is centralized at headquarters; but it is generally exercised
on a more local basis by divisional officers, in charge of geographical divisions into
which most areas are divided for the purpose. Each divisional officer has at his
disposal a small staff of whole-time, and a varying number of part-time, officers
and men; and he is responsible for mobilizing this force in the strength necessary
for dealing with any outbreaks of fire in his division. Constant communication is
maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters; and if at any time an
outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a divisional force, help is
sent from one or more neighbouring divisions in its area, or even from the area of
another Fire Authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all Fire
Authorities, the nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire, regardless of
area boundaries.
Firemen
Firemen in Great Britain include: whole-time firemen; part-time firemen—
either ‘retained’ firemen, who undertake, in return for a small retaining fee, to
attend fires if they are called upon to do so, or ‘volunteer’ firemen, who receive
no remuneration; auxiliary firemen, who are enrolled as part of the local authority
civil defence organization as members of individual brigades under the command
of Chief Officers or Firemasters, and whose activities are restricted (except in a
war emergency) to such duties as are desirable for training; and members of fire¬
fighting organizations with specialized functions, which are outside the scope of
the 1947 Act, e.g., those maintained by the War Office, the Air Ministry, the
Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and by some of the more important
industrial and commercial concerns.
94
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ranks in the fire services (for men) are chief officer, assistant chief officer (fire-
master and assistant firemaster in Scotland), divisional officer, assistant divisional
officer, station officer, sub-officer, leading fireman and fireman. Ranks in the
women’s branch, which is mainly concerned with controls, administrative duties
and duties of a clerical nature, are (for Great Britain as a whole) group officer,
assistant group officer, senior leading firewoman, leading firewoman, and fire-
woman. Promotion in the lower ranks of the fire-fighting forces is by examination
and by merit, and in the higher ranks by merit only.
Training for full-time firemen in England and Wales includes practical and
theoretical instruction given to recruits at a training school, which is run either by
the Fire Authority itself or by a neighbouring Authority, and refresher courses for
firemen, arranged by Fire Departments. The training of recruits and junior ranks
in Scotland is carried out at a central training school which is the responsibility
of the Scottish Home Department. Courses for officers and potential officers
of Fire Authority brigades are held at the Fire Service College, at Wotton House,
near Dorking, Surrey, which is maintained by the Home Office and the Scottish
Home Department as the central training institution for the fire services.
Finance
Every Fire Authority is required to submit to the Flome Secretary or to the
Secretary of State for Scotland an annual statement showing its expenditure and
income in connection with the provision of fire services during the preceding year.
The Government pays a grant of 25 per cent of the net expenditure approved by
the Home Office or the Scottish Home Department, less an annual contribution
towards the expenses of the Fire Service College (and in Scotland a contribution
towards the Scottish Central Training School); the rest of the money is raised from
local authority funds.
Research
The principal means by which research on fire prevention and fire-fighting is
carried on is the Joint Fire Research Organization, the cost of which is shared
equally between the Government and the Fire Offices’ Committee (a Committee
of the Insurance Companies dealing in fire risks). The Organization makes con¬
tinuing research into all aspects of fire prevention and fire-fighting and controls a
Fire Research Station at which practical tests are carried out.
FIRE SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The Fire Authorities in Northern Ireland, as established by the Fire Services
(Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, are the Belfast Corporation, which
controls the Belfast Fire Brigade and is responsible for the area inside the city
boundary, and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, which covers the rest of the
country outside Belfast.
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains five whole-time stations and has an establish¬
ment of 182 officers and men manning 12 appliances, while the Northern Ireland
Fire Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry and 42 other stations
throughout the remainder of the area, and an establishment of 91 whole-time
officers and men and 690 part-time firemen, manning 66 appliances.
Ranks of Firemen
The ranks of firemen in Northern Ireland are: for the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority—fire force commander, divisional officer, assistant divisional officer,
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
95
senior company officer, company officer, section leader (retained brigades only),
leading fireman and fireman; and for the Belfast Fire Brigade—chief officer,
divisional officer grade 2, divisional officer grade 3, assistant divisional officer,
station officer, sub-officer, leading fireman and fireman. There are only a few
women in the Northern Ireland Fire Services, all of the rank of firewoman.
Finance
The Fire Services (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1953, passed in
December 1953, provides that for the three financial years commencing 1st April
I953 the Northern Ireland Fire Authority may receive a Fire Service Grant made
up of 50 per cent of loan charges in respect of capital expenditure, subject to a
maximum grant of £22,500, together with 50 per cent of the first £110,000 of non¬
capital expenditure and 25 per cent of the excess over that amount. The expenditure
in excess of the Fire Service Grant is apportioned among the local authorities. The
Belfast Fire Brigade, however, cannot qualify under the Fire Services Acts for the
payment of Fire Service Grant.
III. DEFENCE
THE DEFENCE SYSTEM
Britain’s defence policy is the responsibility of the Minister of Defence, who,
under the general direction of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, of which he is
a member, is answerable for the ‘ formulation and general application of a unified
policy relating to the armed forces of the Crown as a whole and their requirements
The higher direction of each of the three fighting Services—the Royal Navy, the
Army and the Royal Air Force—is on similar lines. Supreme control is in the hands
of Parliament, which makes annual financial provision for defence needs. By limiting
provision to the current year, Parliament ensures an annual review of the state of
each Service.
The Minister of Defence answers for all matters of policy common to the three
Services and their supply. He is responsible for the apportionment of available
resources between the three Services and for seeing that the composition and
balance of forces within each Service accord with strategic policy. Each of the three
Service Ministers—the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for War
(who deals with the Army), and the Secretary of State for Air—is responsible to
Parliament for the administration of his own Service; and the Minister of Supply
is similarly responsible for the Service supplies procured by his Department. The
Chiefs of Staff Committee, which comprises the professional heads of the three
Services and an independent chairman who is a senior officer of one of the Services,
is responsible for preparing and advising upon strategic plans and policy for
consideration by the Cabinet.
Policy
Britain’s defence policy is reviewed in the annual Statement on Defence presented
each spring to Parliament by the Minister of Defence immediately before the detailed
Estimates of the Service Departments. The statement outlines the programmes of
the three Services for the ensuing year and summarizes the proposed defence budget.
The Statement on Defence 1955 redefined the Government’s defence policy in the
light of the emergence of the thermo-nuclear or hydrogen bomb and the international
situation at the time. The defence problem, said the Statement, remained funda¬
mentally a dual one. ‘We have to prepare against the risk of a world war and so pre¬
vent it; it is on the nature of these preparations that the existence of thermo-nuclear
weapons has its main effect.’ At the same time Britain must continue to play its
part in the defence of the interests of the free world as a whole, and particularly
of the Commonwealth and Empire, in meeting ‘limited aggression’—either overt
armed intervention, as in Korea, or infiltration and subversion; and must meet
the many other peace-time commitments overseas arising from its position as a
great Power with world-wide responsibilities. Announcing the Government’s deci¬
sion to proceed with the production of thermo-nuclear weapons, the Statement
said that from a universal realization that the results of a major war could only be
entirely disastrous for both sides, there might emerge a new hope. The nuclear
weapon was a most powerful deterrent which in the Government’s view had signifi¬
cantly reduced the risk of war on a major scale. The United Kingdom would continue
to strive for international agreement on a practical scheme of disarmament with
adequate safeguards, but until this was achieved the ‘Grand Alliance’ of the free
world must maintain its strength.
Each of the three fighting Services has a contribution to make to these aims,
96
DEFENCE
97
and their roles are complementary. To meet the changes brought about by the
advent of new weapons, current plans provide, within the limits of economic
resources, for a better equipped and maintained active Fleet; a smaller, better
disposed and more mobile Army; and a more powerful Air Force including, in
particular, an effective strategic bomber force.
Defence plans are made in full co-operation with Britain’s allies in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and Western European Union, in the South-East
Asia Collective Defence Treaty and in the Baghdad Pact. Close liaison is main¬
tained with other Commonwealth countries, between whose forces there is con¬
siderable standardization of equipment, weapons and training techniques and
interchange of personnel; regular Service conferences are held and there is intimate
co-operation over regional planning and strategy.
Finance
After the end of the second world war the strength of the armed forces was
drastically reduced. It was not until growing world tension made it inevitable that
this trend was first halted and then reversed. Following the outbreak of the war in
Korea in 1950, the United Kingdom embarked on a programme for building up its
armed forces, which aimed at increasing both manpower and supplies of armament
and equipment. Annual defence expenditure, excluding the sterling counterpart of
United States defence aid, rose from £777 million in 1950-51 to some £1,400
million in 1952-53. Over the same period the strength of the active and reserve
forces increased from 827,000 to nearly 1J million.
Since its inception, the programme has been subject to periodic reviews in the
light of changing conditions, and in 1952 it was announced that in order to keep it
within the limits of national economic strength, some modifications had been made
and rearmament would be spread over a longer period than had originally been
planned. This reorganization of the programme initiated the policy of ‘the long
haul ’. In carrying out this policy, it is the Government’s aim progressively to
increase the efficiency of the armed forces and to take advantage of all new develop¬
ments likely to increase fighting strength and to promote economy of effort. Defence
research and development continues to have high priority.
In October 1955 the Government announced its decision, following an examina¬
tion of the long-term plan in the light of the United Kingdom’s obligations overseas,
the cost of the defence programme, and the demands made by defence on resources
of manpower and materials, to reduce the strength of the active forces by adjusting
the rate of call-up for National Service (see p. 101).
The Defence Budget for 1955-56 amounted to £1,537-2 million. This compares
with a total of £1,639-9 million planned for 1954-55. Actual expenditure in 1954-55
was, however, some £120 million less than was originally estimated. The figure for
*955~56 includes provision for expenditure representing £43 million of the sterling
equivalent of aid from the United States of America (as against £88-36 million in
I9S4_55)- In addition to the Defence Budget it was estimated that a further £69-66
million would be spent on home defence preparations under civil votes (including
loan expenditure by the Post Office).
The Ministry of Defence estimate consists mainly of contributions to inter¬
national defence organizations, including contributions to the NATO common
infrastructure programmes.1 The 1955-56 Estimate includes £12-6 million on
account of infrastructure.
-NATO common infrastructure’ has been defined as capital investment in basic
facilities, such as airfields, signals systems, headquarters, etc., designed for common use.
The United Kingdom is contributing n£ per cent of the cost of the current programme.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Compulsory military service in peace time was first introduced in Britain in 1939,
shortly before the outbreak of the second world war. Under the National Service
Acts, 1948-50, fit male British subjects between the ages of 18 and 26 ordinarily
resident in Great Britain are liable (with certain limited exceptions) to serve for two
years in one of the armed forces.1 After this period of full-time service they must
serve for a period of three and a half years with one of the reserve forces, giving in all
five and a half years of whole-time and part-time service. During the latter period
they may be called upon to undergo up to 60 days’ training in all,2 3 but not more
than 21 days in any year. In addition, National Service men called up before
31st December 1953 remain statutorily liable, on completion of their 5! years’
National Service liability, to recall as reservists up to 30th June 1959, but are not
required to carry out training during this latter period of reserve liability.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service calls up the men from civil life for
registration and medical inspection, and allots them to the Services. The Army is by
far the biggest user of National Service men. In 1955 nearly half the Army strength
was provided by National Service men as against under 30 per cent of the Royal
Air Force and only some 8 per cent of the Royal Navy.
Table 7 shows the strength of the various Services on 1st October 1955.

(ft) Figures for Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (which include women) relate only to
volunteer reserve and auxiliary forces having a training liability and to National Service
reserves. They do not cover the whole of the Reserve Forces available in emergency, the
total strength of which is much greater.
1 The upper age limit may be extended, under the National Service Act, 1955, in the
case of men absent from Great Britain in the last year of their liability. Men employed in
certain occupations are granted deferment of National Service, in the national interest, for
as long as they are engaged in those occupations. This provision applies to men in certain
coalmining occupations, merchant seamen, seagoing fishermen who are members of the
Royal Naval Reserve (Patrol Service), regular whole-time agricultural workers whose
call-up would mean a loss in food production, a small number of highly skilled scientists
and engineers engaged on work of high priority or on fundamental research, a very small
number of shale oil underground workers, and a limited number of police cadets.
2 In October 1955 it was announced that for most reservists the training time during the
3 J years would be reduced to 20 days, though a maximum of 60 days would remain
necessary for some specialists.

IOI
In October 1955 the Government announced its decision to reduce the size of the
active forces (then nearly 800,000, of whom 280,000 were on National Service) to
about 700,000 by March 1958. Over five years from March 1953 this would be a
reduction of 170,000, or more than one-fifth. It would be brought about by
slowing down the rate of call-up for National Service and allowing the general age
of call-up to rise from 18 to 19 years; earlier call-up could be arranged in special
cases to avoid hardship. The principle of universal liability for National Service
remained and the period of full-time Service continued to be two years.

Inter -Service Organizations
In addition to his co-ordinating functions outlined on page 96, the Minister of
Defence also has ministerial responsibility for certain inter-Service organizations
such as Amphibious Warfare Headquarters, the Joint Intelligence Bureau, the Joint
Services Staff College, and the Imperial Defence College.
Co-operation between the fighting Services is illustrated in the system of staff
training for selected officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force. After about 10 years’
service, they are sent to separate staff colleges at Greenwich (London), Camberley
(Surrey), and Bracknell, Berkshire (or Andover, Hampshire), respectively, where
they learn the elements of staff work. At a later stage in their careers selected officers
from the three Services go to the Joint Services Staff College at Chesham, where they
live and work together and where particular attention is paid to the inter-Service
aspects of staff work. This College caters for about a hundred and fifty students a
year from the Navy, Army and Air Force, the Civil Service and the Commonwealth.
Finally, there is the Imperial Defence College in London, which caters for a few
specially selected more senior officers from the Services, the Civil Service and the
Commonwealth.
Supply
The Ministry of Supply is responsible for the procurement of all equipment used
by the Army and Air Force. It is also responsible for the procurement of aircraft,
some guns and ammunition, guided weapons and a certain amount of miscellaneous
102
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
equipment used by the Royal Navy. The Admiralty is responsible for the procure¬
ment of ships and associated equipment.
Production for the Services is carried out to a great extent by private industry on
a contract basis, but also by the Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal Dockyards
and other establishments operated by the Ministry of Supply and the Admiralty.
At the beginning of the second world war three Royal Ordnance Factories were in
operation; at its peak there were 44. There are now 24. The Ministry of Supply’s
research establishments carry out research and development on behalf of the War
Office and Air Ministry, and also for certain aspects of Admiralty requirements, in
particular naval aviation. The Admiralty has its own research establishments which
carry out research on ships and maritime equipment. Current production and
development programmes are summarized later in this chapter in the sections dealing
with the three Services individually.
Some military equipment, including aircraft and radio and radar equipment, is
being supplied to Britain by the United States under the Mutual Security
Programme. Some of this equipment is manufactured in the United Kingdom and
financed by the United States under the ‘ offshore procurement ’ programme. Under
this programme the United Kingdom is also making equipment for other NATO
countries in Europe. The total value of such contracts placed in the United Kingdom
to the end of 1954 was $650 million.
Nuclear Weapons
During the second world war, British research workers played an essential part in
the allied project that led to the production of the first atomic bombs in the United
States. After the war, owing to the security restrictions imposed by the United States
on the exchange of atomic information, the United Kingdom decided to undertake
independently the development and construction of atomic weapons. The first test
explosion of a British atomic weapon was carried out in October 1952 in the Monte
Bello Islands off the north-west coast of Australia, in close co-operation with the
Australian Government; further tests took place a year later near the Woomera
Rocket Range in Central Australia. In February 1954 it was announced that
deliveries of atomic weapons to the armed forces had begun. By agreement with the
Australian Government a proving ground is being established at Maralinga in the
South Australian Desert.
In February 1955 the Government announced its intention to begin the develop¬
ment and production of thermo-nuclear weapons.
Production of and research on nuclear warheads to meet Service requirements are
carried out by the Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 379) under contract from the
Ministry of Supply, which is responsible for the completed weapons.
Guided Missiles
In the development of guided weapons, the main effort is being devoted to pro¬
viding defence against bombers flying at high speed and at great altitudes. Develop¬
ment of air-to-air guided weapons to be fitted in manned fighter aircraft has reached
an advanced stage, and good progress is being made in the development of surface-
to-air missiles for use from the land and from ships. Work is in hand on the develop¬
ment of a ballistic rocket which may eventually supplement the manned bomber.
Testing is carried out both in the United Kingdom and at the Woomera range set
up in Australia under the Joint United Kingdom/Australia Guided Weapon Project.
There is close collaboration with the United States in the exchange of information
and of visits by technical personnel. The United Kingdom has co-operated with the
United States in the provision of guided missile testing stations in the West Indies.

THE ROYAL NAVY
The Royal Navy is governed by the Board of Admiralty. The First Lord of the
Admiralty is the minister responsible to Parliament for the Navy. The other ten
members of the Board are the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary; the Civil
Lord; the Permanent Secretary, who is a civil servant and responsible for the
general conduct of Admiralty business; the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval
Staff, who is the professional head of the Service and is a member of the Chiefs of
Staff Committee; the Second Sea Lord and Chief of Personnel; the Third Sea
Lord and Controller of the Navy, responsible for engineering, equipment, ord¬
nance, and research; the Fourth Sea Lord and Chief of. Supplies and Transport;
the Fifth Sea Lord and Deputy Chief of Naval Staff (Air), responsible for air
matters; the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff, responsible for operations, intelligence and
plans; and the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, responsible for special subjects.
Policy and Production
The functions of the Navy in the event of a major war would be: (a) to search out
and destroy enemy ships and to prevent the enemy from using the seas for his own
purposes; (b) to protect communications and to safeguard the supply lines; and
(c) to provide direct air support for operations ashore and afloat in areas where it
cannot readily be given by shore-based aircraft. In place of the concentrated main
fleets of the past, battle groups of carriers operating the latest aircraft, guided missile
ships and their escorts are needed to provide mobile offensive forces.
When rearmament started in 1950, the Admiralty gave particular attention to the
need to build up anti-submarine and minesweeping forces, and to expand the Fleet
Air Arm; and priority was given to construction work which would show quick
results. The building of carriers and ‘ Daring ’ Class escort ships already in hand was
therefore pressed forward as quickly as possible, and a large programme of moderni¬
zation and conversion of ships and a much increased building programme were
started.
By 1955 a strong force of new or modernized carriers was being built up, equipped
with the angled deck, the steam catapult and the mirror landing device (all British
inventions); eight ‘Daring’ Class ships had joined the Fleet; a large number of
destroyers had been converted to function as fast frigates or otherwise modernized,
and the first of a group of new frigates under construction was wrell advanced; over
150 new minesweepers had been completed and another 100 were under con¬
struction; much progress had been made with design of submarines, and new
methods of propulsion had added greatly to their range and speed. Development of
the guided missile, and its associated equipment, had advanced sufficiently to enable
the Admiralty to include in its 1955-56 programme plans for the construction of
guided weapon ships to replace the ageing cruiser fleet. The introduction of this new
armament is expected to effect revolutionary changes in naval warfare. The first
operational application of the guided missile wall be a purely ship-to-air weapon; but
later a system will be developed capable of operating a ship-to-ship wreapon from the
same equipment. To help bridge the gap before the guided weapon ships come into
service, three ‘Tiger’ Class cruisers with modern gun armament are being com¬
pleted and the best of the cruisers now in commission are being modernized. The
i955-56 Estimates also included provision for further new escort ships and coastal
minesweepers, and steps are being taken to improve the standard of maintenance
of the Reserve Fleet.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Strength of the Fleet
During 1955 the fighting ships of the Fleet were deployed as follows:
1. Ships in the operational Fleet, or preparing for service with it: 1 fast battle¬
ship1, 2 fleet carriers, 2 light fleet carriers, 9 cruisers, 7 ‘Darings’, 22 des¬
troyers, 30 frigates, 1 fast minelayer, 43 submarines, 32 minesweepers,
26 coastal craft, and 7 landing vessels.
2. Ships engaged in trials and training: 4 light fleet carriers, 1 cruiser, 3 des¬
troyers, 22 frigates, 23 minesweepers, 4 coastal craft, and 1 tank landing ship.
3. Ships in course of construction: 4 light fleet carriers, 3 cruisers, 26 frigates,
2 submarines (excluding those not yet launched), 101 minesweepers, and
10 coastal craft.
4. Ships at present in reserve or undergoing modernization or refit, etc.: 4 fast
battleships, 5 fleet carriers, 2 light fleet carriers, 14 cruisers, 1 ‘Daring’,
57 destroyers, 115 frigates, 2 fast minelayers, 14 submarines, 165 mine¬
sweepers, 42 coastal craft, and 58 tank landing vessels.
The Navy also operates some 350 oil tankers, supply ships, tugs and other
auxiliary support craft.
Fleet Air Arm
The Sea Hawk and Sea Venom provide the day and all-weather fighter strength
of the Fleet Air Arm, but orders have been placed for their successors the N.i 12
and D.H.no which will have a greatly improved performance.
The anti-submarine turbo-prop Gannet came into service in 1954. A strike air¬
craft to replace the Wyvern is being planned; it will be capable of carrying an
atomic bomb, and will have a far greater range and speed than any previous naval
strike aircraft.
A Naval Helicopter Squadron equipped with Sikorsky S.55 helicopters has been
in operational service in Malaya since 1953. An anti-submarine twin-rotor heli¬
copter, the Bristol 191, is being developed.
Research and Development
Increased provision was made in the 1955-56 Estimates for basic research.
Among recent developments, there have been advances with anti-submarine
detectors and locators; techniques for the detection and location of mines, and
methods of sweeping them, have improved; and performance of new torpedoes,
both in range and accuracy, shows great promise. In radio communications, research
on very short waves may enable reliable communications to be maintained over
much greater distances than had been thought possible. The Admiralty is the agent
for all the Services in valve development for use in radar communications and
guided missiles. Increasingly close liaison is maintained between naval scientists
and their opposite numbers in the universities, in other Commonwealth countries,
and in NATO.
Stations
The Navy’s commands in home waters are Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham,
Rosyth in Scotland, and the Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet. Abroad there are
the Mediterranean, East Indies, Far East, America and West Indies, and South
Atlantic stations. The Mediterranean Station, with headquarters in Malta and with
Gibraltar as a secondary base, covers the Red Sea (but not Aden) as well as the
Mediterranean. The East Indies Station is practically co-extensive with the Indian
1 In September 1955 it was announced that this battleship, the Vanguard, was to go into
reserve.

Ocean. By agreement with Ceylon, the Navy has a base and dockyard facilities at
Trincomalee which are maintained by the United Kingdom. The Far East Station,
formerly known as the China Station, extends eastwards from Singapore. Hong
Kong remains the operational base but the headquarters have now been moved to
Singapore. Largest in area of the stations is the America and West Indies Station,
with headquarters at Bermuda, where there is a small dockyard now in a care and
maintenance condition. From this station, ships operate in both the North and
South Atlantic and in the Eastern Pacific, except where the Royal Canadian Navy
operates from Halifax and Esquimalt (V ancouver Island). By agreement with the
Union of South Africa, ships on the South Atlantic Station are based on Simons-
town Dockyard, at the Cape of Good Hope. The navies of other Commonwealth
nations operate in their respective areas from their home bases, the use of which is
made available to the Royal Navy at the discretion of their Governments.
Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham, Rosyth, Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore, and
Hong Kong are also dockyards for the Navy with major supply and repair facilities.
There are also a number of naval air stations at home and abroad.
A programme to modernize the Royal Dockyards in the United Kingdom, and
to reconstruct and extend those damaged in the second world war, was put in hand
in I9S4—55 and is expected to extend over four or five years.
Recruitment and Training
The main entry for Naval officers is the cadet-entry. Cadetships are available to
young men between the ages of approximately 17 and 19, and those selected, except
Electrical Branch cadets, spend two years at the Britannia Royal Naval College,
Dartmouth, after which they join the Fleet as Acting Sub-Lieutenants. Electrical
Branch cadets spend one year at Dartmouth and then take a three-year course up to
honours degree standard in electrical engineering at a university.
Short service commissions as pilot or observer in the Fleet Air Arm are open to
young men between the ages of 17 and 26, and those accepted have opportunities of
obtaining a permanent commission. Doctors, dental surgeons and instructor officers
all enter on short service commissions after completing their professional training,
and permanent commissions are awarded to them according to vacancies available.
Commissions in the Royal Marines are gained through the same examination as
are cadetships in the Royal Navy, and successful candidates are given a special
training, part naval and part military, which lasts three years.
The age limits for entry as a rating in the Navy are as follows: seaman branch,
15i t° 23; artificer apprentices, 15 to 17; communications, engineering, naval
airman, electrical, and supply and secretariat branches, 16J to 23; sick berth
branch, 17^ to 23; artificers (trained) 19^ to 28. Age limits for entry into the ranks
of the Royal Marines are: marines, 17 to 23 ; boy buglers, 15 to 15boy or recruit
musicians, 14 to 18; musicians (trained), 17I to 23. Women may enter the Women’s
Royal Naval Service between the ages of 18 and 28 and most WRNS officers are
selected from serving ratings.
On entry, all Naval and WRNS ratings and Royal Marines other ranks are given
a basic training at the appropriate school or shore establishment and are given
‘ refresher’ courses at regular intervals during their time in the Service.
Royal Marines
The Corps of Royal Marines is a body of trained men for service on sea or land.
Its official existence dates from 1664. The present-day functions of the Corps are:
1. To supply detachments for HM ships, which (a) man a proportion of the
ships’ armament, (b) provide emergency landing parties, and (c) carry out
guard duties and the like.
io6
BRITAm: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
2. To provide personnel for the Commando Brigade.
3. To provide crews for minor landing craft and certain other parties required
for amphibious assault.
Women’s Royal Naval Service
The WRNS is now a permanent and integral part of the Naval Service. It has its
own disciplinary code. The estimated average strength in 1955-56 is 4,600.
Reserve and Auxiliary Forces
The Royal Fleet Reserve (RFR) consists of men who have taken their discharge
from the regular service and who, either voluntarily or as part of their contract,
join this reserve for a minimum period of five years.
The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) reopened its ranks in February 1950 to officers
and men of the Merchant Navy who volunteer to serve in the Royal Navy in war.
The qualification for service in the RNR is that the candidate should be following
the sea as a profession.
The Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), composed of officers and men who
voluntarily train in peace time, is organized in 12 divisions which provide training
for general naval service. There are also five RNVR Air Divisions. The Royal Naval
Volunteer (Wireless) Reserve consists of specialist officers, wireless operators
and radio electricians. The Royal Marines Rorces Volunteer Reserve (RMFVR) and
Women’s Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (WRNVR) are the Royal Marines’ and
WRNS’s counterparts of the RNVR.
Behind these fully trained reserves, available to meet immediate needs on mobili¬
zation, is the vast background of officers and men with past war-time and peace¬
time service in the Royal Navy, now either in retirement or in civil occupations.
All those still fit for service are liable to recall on the outbreak of war and, after
refresher training where necessary, would help to provide the additional trained
manpower required to meet the war-time expansion of the Navy as a whole.
Royal Naval Minewatching Service
The RNMWS, a civilian organization formed in January 1952 and composed of
men and women volunteers, is responsible in time of war for manning posts around
the coast and overlooking the main navigable waterways. Its object would be to spot
mines dropped from aircraft, and to plot and report their positions. Its strength on
1 st October 1955 was 4,300-
Sea Cadet Corps
The Sea Cadet Corps is the oldest pre-Service movement for boys in Britain, its
origin dating from the time of the Crimean War in the mid-nineteenth century. As
an organization it was sponsored in 1899 by the Navy League (the objects of which
are the promotion of a strong Navy and instruction in the history and traditions of
the sea). The aim of the Sea Cadet Corps is to give technical training to, and instil
naval tradition in, boys under the age of 18 who intend to serve in the Royal and
Merchant Navies and also to those sea-minded boys who do not intend to follow a
sea career but will, given this knowledge, form a valuable reserve for the Navy. It
also aims to provide for the social and educational welfare of the cadets and to
develop character and good citizenship. The estimated strength in 1955-56 is about
2,000 cadet officers, 900 chief petty officer instructors and 20,000 cadets.
DEFENCE
107
THE ARMY
The control of the Army is vested in the Army Council, of which the Secretary of
State for War is president. The other civilian members of the Council are the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War and Financial Secretary of the
War Office, who performs parliamentary duties, and the Permanent Under¬
secretary of State for War, a civil servant who acts as secretary to the Council. The
military members of the Army Council comprise the Chief of the Imperial General
Staff, who is also a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee; the Vice-Chief of the
Imperial General Staff, who is responsible for strategic policy and plans, operations
and intelligence, and is also a member of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff Committee; the
Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff, responsible for war organization,
equipment, weapons and training; the A.djutant-General to the Forces, responsible
for manpower, personnel, discipline, medical services, welfare, education, and the
women’s services; and the Quartermaster-General to the Forces, responsible for
supplies, transport, and works services.
Disposition
In 1954 the heavy burden of the Army’s commitments all over the world was for
the first time for years slightly eased. The withdrawal of Allied troops from Trieste
and Austria, the reduction in the size of the British Commonwealth Division in
Korea and the redeployment of the British forces in the Middle East, following the
agreement with Egypt on withdrawal from the Canal Zone, released some troops
for use in building up a strategic reserve within the United Kingdom.
Nevertheless commitments remain heavy. As a contribution to the defence forces
of NATO and the Western European Union, the United Kingdom has undertaken,
subject to certain understandings, to maintain its forces on the mainland of Europe
at their existing strength. The British Army of the Rhine, which forms part of the
NATO Northern Army Group, consists of four divisions, three of them armoured.
In the Federation of Malaya, since 1948 United Kingdom forces have been heavily
engaged—together with Malayan, Gurkha and Colonial troops—in operations
against Communist terrorists. In 1955 arrangements were made for forces from
Australia and New Zealand to join the United Kingdom and other forces in opera¬
tion in Malaya. In Kenya, security forces have been making such steady progress
in overcoming the threat to order from Mau Mau terrorists that in the autumn of
1955 it became possible to reduce their strength from 11 to 8 battalions (3 United
Kingdom and 5 African). The Middle East Land Forces, which include one armoured
division, are now stationed mainly in Cyprus and Libya. In addition, there are
garrisons in Gibraltar, Malta, Akaba, Hong Kong and the West Indies.
Equipment
During the first years of the rearmament programme, attention was concentrated
on the production of tanks and other armoured vehicles, infantry weapons, and
engineers’ and signal equipment.
The Army is now fully equipped with a range of new wheeled-vehicles and with
the Centurion tank, which has also been supplied to allied countries. The heavy gun
tank, the Conqueror, is now undergoing Service trials. Complementary to the
Centurion, it is larger and more powerfully armed. Its suspension is of a new and
improved design.
Other weapons taking an important place in the current production programme
include the L.70 light anti-aircraft gun, the FN self-loading rifle on which large-
scale field trials are being carried out, and a new sub-machine gun. A comprehensive
io8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
programme of wireless re-equipment is in hand, and a new range of bridging and
ferrying equipment is being introduced into service.
Provision is being made for the introduction of surface-to-surface guided
weapons. In 1955 groups of Army instructors began to receive training in the
United States in the use of the Corporal guided missile.
With the development of nuclear weapons, much attention is being given to the
problem of increasing mobility without loss of fighting capacity. Studies and
experiments are being carried out, in consultation with other Commonwealth and
NATO countries, with a view to simplifying weapon systems, reducing the number
and variety of weapons and speeding up methods of supply.
Organization of the Regular Army
The Army is organized in twenty-five corps or arms, which include the Royal
Armoured Corps (the historic Cavalry Regiments—Dragoons, Hussars, Lancers—
and the Royal Tank Regiment), Artillery, Engineers, Signals, Infantry, and various
other corps such as the Royal Army Service Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance
Corps, and the Royal Army Medical Corps. The Infantry has been reorganized
since 1946 in the following groups:
1. The Grenadier Guards, The Coldstream Guards, The Scots Guards, The
Irish Guards, The Welsh Guards.
2. The Royal Scots, The Royal Scots Fusiliers, The King’s Own Scottish
Borderers, The Cameronians.
3. The Queen’s Royal Regiment, The Buffs, The Royal Fusiliers, The East
Surrey Regiment, The Royal Sussex Regiment, The Queen’s Own Royal
West Kent Regiment, The Middlesex Regiment.
4. The King’s Own Royal Regiment, The King’s Regiment, The Lancashire
Fusiliers, The East Lancashire Regiment, The Border Regiment, The South
Lancashire Regiment, The Loyal Regiment, The Manchester Regiment.

Within the United Kingdom, the Army is organized into commands and districts
as follows: Scottish, Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western, London District, and
Northern Ireland District. There are three chief commands overseas: Middle East
Land Forces, Far East Land Forces, and British Army of the Rhine.
Recruitment and Training
The normal method of entry for a regular commission in the Army is through the
Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst (Camberley, Surrey), where selected cadets un¬
dergo a course lasting two years before receiving their commissions. This course gives
a general military and academic background for all arms and services, and young
officers on leaving Sandhurst then attend special Arm Courses to prepare them for
their own arm, some attending Technical Courses at the Royal Military College of
Science (Shrivenham, Wiltshire) and at Cambridge University.
Cadets may enter Sandhurst direct from school or after they have enlisted in the
Army or been called up for National Service.
The War Office also maintains a boarding school, known as Welbeck College, at
Worksop, Nottinghamshire, where 150 boys are educated for two years between
the ages of 16 and 18 years. These boys pass into Sandhurst at the end of their
school course and are normally commissioned into the Royal Corps of Signals,
Royal Army Ordnance Corps or Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers. A few may be commissioned into the Royal Engineers.
University graduates may be accepted for direct regular commissions.
A small number of schoolboys are selected to take engineering or science degrees
at the Royal Military College of Science as National Service officers and thereafter
to be granted regular commissions.
Regular commissions may also be granted to other officers already serving on
National Service commissions or on Short Service commissions.
Candidates for National Service commissions are trained at the Officer Cadet
Schools, Eaton Hall, Chester, or Mons Barracks, Aldershot, depending on the arm
or service for which they are selected. At these schools the course, which consists
of purely military training, lasts for four months.
Men wishing to enlist in the ranks must be British subjects between the ages of
17! and 30 years, of good character, medically fit and able to pass an intelligence
test. Men with certain trade qualifications may be accepted up to the age of 33 years.
The terms of service are for either three years with the Active Army and four
years in the Reserve or 22 years with the Ac ive Army with the option of ter¬
minating the engagement at the end of each period of three years.
Men may choose the corps in which they wish to serve and their wishes regard¬
ing trade training are met as far as possible.
On entry into the Army, other ranks are trained at the Depots or with the
Training Units of the arms or services for which they have been selected. This
initial training consists of six weeks’ basic military training common to all arms and
services, and a further period of training which is special to the arm or service
concerned. This latter training varies in length of time, depending on the arm and
service, e.g., Infantry, four weeks; Royal Signals electronic technician, 22 weeks.
A boy can enlist in the Army as an Army apprentice tradesman, between the ages
of 15 and 17; a Regimental boy, between the ages of 15 and 16and a drummer,
band boy, tailor or piper, between the ages of 15 and 17J.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
After the age of 18 years, boys who have enlisted as Army apprentice tradesmen
and regimental boys in the Royal Army Service Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance
Corps and the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers serve eight
years with the Active Army and four years in the Reserve. All other boys serve six
years in the Active Army and three years in the Reserve.
The object of the Regimental Boys Units is to produce long-term Regular
Warrant Officers and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers, and that of the Appren¬
tice Schools is to produce WO and NCO tradesmen for the Regular Army, some
of whom may become specialist Commissioned Officers.
Women may enlist into the Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps or
into the Women’s Royal Army Corps between the ages of 17J and 33 years. The
terms of service are the same as for men except that there is no liability for reserve
service.
Women’s Royal Army Corps
The WRAC, which has replaced the ATS, is a corps in the Regular Army, the
officers and other ranks of which, with minor exceptions and modifications, are
subject to the Army Act and Queen’s Regulations to the same extent as members
of any other corps. Its strength in January 1955 was about 6,400.
Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps
The QARANC, which has replaced the QAIMNS, is a corps of the Regular
Army and provides the nursing services within the Army. It numbers just under
2,000.
Territorial Army1
The Territorial Army, which was reconstituted in 1947, now forms part of the
national Army. The male section of the Territorial Army is organized in some
1,400 separate units with a total strength of some 300,000. It is composed of a small
whole-time regular cadre and three other elements:
1. men who have no legal liability for service but who voluntarily engage and
re-engage for varying periods (volunteers);
2. National Service men who accept additional obligations by undertaking a
normal voluntary engagement during their statutory period of part-time
service (National Service volunteers); and
3. men who are simply carrying out their statutory obligation of three and a
halfyears’ part-time service with theTerritorial Army (National Servicemen).
In 1955 the male strength was made up of some 65,000 volunteers, 5S>000
National Service volunteers and 180,000 National Service men. In addition, the
Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps (TA) and the Women’s Royal
Army Corps (TA), both of which are recruited on a purely voluntary basis, numbered
some 9,000. All these members of the Territorial Army are liable to be called out
for permanent service in the United Kingdom in the event of actual or apprehended
attack, and, on proclamation, for permanent service anywhere in the world.
While the military authorities are responsible for policy, training and discipline,
local administration is largely carried out by county Territorial and Auxiliary
Forces Associations.
1 Government statements have indicated that changes are to be made in the organization
of the Territorial Army and the Army Emergency Reserve.
DEFENCE
III
From the outbreak of war the Regular and Territorial Armies would be inte¬
grated. In the United Kingdom the combined resources of Regular and Territorial
units would be used together to meet initial operational requirements and to pro¬
vide the framework of subsequent expansion. The Territorial Army would also play
an important part in support of the civil defence organization in the event of air
attack with nuclear weapons (see p. 117).
Army Emergency Reserve
The object of the Army Emergency Reserve is, broadly, to provide the technical
and other specialized units and individuals needed to form the essential backing to
the fighting formations of the Regular Army and of the Territorial Army imme¬
diately on mobilization. In structure its units are similar to those of the Territorial
Army in that they consist of basic elements of volunteers to provide the senior
officers and NCOs, with a complement of National Service men doing their part-
time service; but the units are raised on a trade or ‘ skill ’ basis and not territorially.
Its strength in March 1955 was 164,500.
Combined Cadet Force and Army Cadet Force
The CCF and ACF were both founded some 90 years ago. Their object is to
provide pre-Service training for boys between the ages of 14 and 18 and, in the
ACF, the encouragement of club life, camps, etc. In the 1955-56 Estimates pro¬
vision is made for about 6,000 officers and 123,000 cadets, of whom about three-
fifths are in the Combined Cadet Force, which is organized in schools.
The Home Guard1
The Home Guard, instituted during the second world war, was re-established on
a voluntary and limited basis by the Home Guard Act, 1951. In September 1955 it
had a total strength of 78,000 (including 41,700 on the reserve roll). The tasks of
the Home Guard in war time would be concerned with home defence.
The force is open to men between 18 and 65, unless they are members of the
Regular forces, or of certain reserves, or of the Territorial Army. Women are
eligible for service as clerks, telephone operators, storewomen, medical orderlies,
cooks and canteen orderlies, and drivers. Service is for two years and may be
extended for one year at a time. Service is part-time in times of peace, but members
of the Home Guard are required to give whole-time service in the United Kingdom
if the unit to which they belong is mustered to defend its area. When on duty and
mustered, members of the Home Guard will be subject to military law, but no
member will be tried under military law for an offence which could come within
the civil code.
The Home Guard was started as the Local Defence Volunteers in 1940 and was
afterwards named the Home Guard on the suggestion of the then Prime Minister, Mr.
(now Sir) Winston Churchill. In the course of the war the organization reached a
strength of over if million. It held its ‘stand-down’ parade in December 1944.
THE ROYAL AIR FORCE
The Royal Air Force is administered by the Air Council (a body similar in
organization to the Army Council). The Council is composed of nine members,
including the Secretary of State for Air who is president. Of these, the Parliamen¬
tary Under-Secretary for Air acts as vice-president and performs parliamentary

basis.

duties; and the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Air, who is a civil servant,
acts as secretary. The military members of the Council include the Chief of the Air
Staff, who is responsible for strategic policy and the fighting efficiency of the RAF
and is also a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee; the Vice-Chief of the Air
Staff, responsible for inter-Service policy, operations, intelligence, liaison with
other air forces, standardization and ground defence; the Deputy Chief of the Air
Staff, responsible for the preparedness for war of the RAF, for command, staff and
air training, and for policy regarding future aircraft and weapons; the Air Member
for Personnel; the Air Member for Supply and Organization; and the Controller
of Supplies (Air) of the Ministry of Supply.
Commands
The Royal Air Force is organized into Commands administered by the Air
Council:
At Home: Bomber, Fighter, Coastal, Transport, Flying Training, Technical
Training, Maintenance and Home (formerly known as Reserve)
Commands.
Overseas: Second Tactical Air Force (stationed in Germany as part of
Britain’s contribution to the NATO forces), the Middle East Air
Force (headquarters in Cyprus) and the Far East Air Force
(headquarters at Changi, Singapore).
Commands are subdivided into groups and wings, a certain number of squadrons
being allotted to each group or wing. Squadrons are subdivided into flights.
Equipment and Works
The main task now before the RAF is to build up the V-bomber force (the three
four-engined medium-range jet bombers Valiant, Victor, and Vulcan), with its
nuclear potential, to a state of high efficiency and preparedness. The first V-
bombers came into service during 1955. The twin-engined Canberra jet bomber,
which is in service in large numbers, has proved outstandingly successful.
Expansion of Fighter Command has been completed, but the proportion of all-
weather fighters will grow. All-weather squadrons were expected to receive their
first Javelins in 1955-56. Other squadrons are being re-equipped with Venom
night fighters and delivery of Hunters has proceeded steadily. Orders have been placed
for a development batch of the single-seater Gnat lightweight fighter, which, the
makers claim, can be constructed far more quickly and cheaply than a standard
fighter. Development of the P. / day-and-night interceptor, a prototype of which
has flown faster than sound in level flight and while climbing, is being pressed
forward. Work is in hand on the development of supersonic interceptor fighters
powered by turbo-jets and rocket motors in combination. A start has been made on
production of air-to-air guided weapons.
The system of control and reporting, which has been built into a highly efficient
organization, is being further improved and more closely linked with the radar
systems of Continental allies. A new type of radar, a conspicuous advance on earlier
types, has been developed. A reconstructed radar chain now covers the whole of the
United Kingdom. Hundreds of new installations have been built, and vital parts of
the system have been put deep underground and protected by massive thicknesses
of concrete.
Coastal Command is being strengthened by the formation of special flights for
short-range anti-submarine work, equipped with Seamezvs.
Transport Command is being re-equipped to provide increased mobility for the

strategic reserves of both land and air forces. Orders have been placed for the
Comet II, for use as a high-speed jet transport. This aircraft will be put into regular
use on the service to the rocket range at Woomera, Australia. The first Beverley
heavy transports were expected to be cleared for squadron service during 1955.
Deliveries of helicopters, which have proved their value during operations in Malaya,
are increasing, and a joint Army/RAF Helicopter Evaluation Unit has been formed.
During the last few years there has been a great deal of airfield development in
the United Kingdom to provide for the operation of the V-bombers and the new
fighters, and a major programme of airfields, depots and technical facilities has also
been carried out for units of the United States Air Force stationed in Britain.
Recruitment and Training
The Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire, trains cadets for per¬
manent commissions as pilots and navigators, while technical cadets are trained at
the Royal Air Force Technical College, Henlow, Bedfordshire. The training of
some technical cadets includes a three-year honours degree course at a university.
Royal Air Force Regiment cadets start at the Royal Air Force Regiment Depot at
Catterick, Yorkshire, and then spend 18 months at the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst (Camberley, Surrey).
It is the aim of the Air Council that all pilots and navigators shall be officers.
Most of them enter on direct commissions. Officers with direct commissions have
the choice of serving for eight or twelve years on the active list and going out with a
gratuity, or of staying in the Service until they qualify for pension. Flying training
lasts for up to 18 months. Most pilots are trained at the various flying schools in the
United Kingdom, but navigators are trained in Canada.
Officers in ground branches are usually found from people in civil life, some of
whom already hold professional qualifications, who enter the Royal Air Force on
short service commissions. Short service officers may be selected for permanent
commissions while in the Royal Air Force.
Airmen are recruited from the age of 17 J and may enlist for three, four, five, ten
or twelve years in a wide variety of trades, for most of which they will be given
training in the Service. After four years, they may apply for an engagement which
will last until they are 55 years of age and earn them a pension when they have
served for 22 years. Airmen may be promoted either as non-commissioned officers
or as technicians, and there are opportunities for them to obtain commissions. Boys
can come into the Service as apprentices or boy entrants and be trained in a trade.
Women’s Royal Air Force
Women play an important part in the work of the Royal Air Force and of its
reserve and auxiliary formations. The WRAF is a permanent and integral part of
the Royal Air Force and its members train with and work alongside airmen in the
same trades, serving not only in the United Kingdom but in Germany, the Middle
East, and the Far East. The maximum strength in 1955-56 is estimated at 7,500.
Auxiliary and Reserve Forces
The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists of units raised and maintained by
Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations. It includes flying squadrons (fighter
and air observation post), regiment squadrons and fighter control and radar
reporting units. Each trains and operates as a self-contained unit. In addition,
each flying squadron is linked with a regular fighter squadron so that pilots with
the necessary experience shall have the opportunity to train on the latest high-
performance aircraft.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
114
The Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve provides a pool of officers, airmen and
airwomen, who, like the personnel of the Auxiliary Air Force, train on a part-time
basis, both as individuals and units.
Part-time National Service men serve in the Royal Air Force Reserve of Officers
and Class H of the Air Force Reserve.
Royal Observer Corps
Over 17,000 men and women from all walks of life form the Royal Observer
Corps, a voluntary civilian organization, administered by Fighter Command,
devoted to the specialized task of identifying and reporting the movements of
aircraft. The corps originated in the first world war to report the movements of
German aircraft and zeppelins over Great Britain and was officially established in
1925. Recently it has undertaken the additional duty of giving warning on radio¬
activity and measuring its extent in the event of air attack with nuclear weapons.
The Air Training Corps
The ATC is open to boys between the ages of 14 and 18. Like the other pre-
Service formations, it seeks to inculcate citizenship as well as training for the RAF.
In 1955-56 the Corps had an estimated strength of 3,600 officers, 850 warrant
officers and 40,000 cadets.
HOME DEFENCE
The Statement on Defence 1955 emphasized the fact that against the thermo¬
nuclear attack of the future the best defence of the civil population is to try to
ensure that it never happens. But financial and other resources must continue to be
provided for a measure of insurance in the event of war. The new form of the threat
to security calls for a complete overhaul of home defence plans, but it is imme¬
diately clear that much can and must be done to mitigate the effects of a thermo¬
nuclear attack if one should occur. The need for rescue, fire-fighting and welfare
operations would be greater than ever. The presence of radioactivity would have
to be detected and measured and necessary warning given. The first call would have
to be met by the civilian services on the spot, but these, though vital, might not be
sufficient, and measures have been taken to provide help by mobile columns based
outside probable target areas and manned by members of the armed forces. Further
support would be available from all the armed forces in the country at the time,
whether regular or reserve, which were not immediately required for combat
operations. ,
The Minister of Defence is charged with planning the part which the armed
forces would play in home defence, and with co-ordinating the plans of the military
authorities with those of the civil authorities.
Organization of Civil Defence
Civil defence planning in the United Kingdom is the responsibility of a number
of ministers each of whom undertakes the duties which, in war time, would repre¬
sent a natural extension of his peace-time functions. As the development of
effective civil defence services involves much detailed planning at local level, the
central Government has enlisted the assistance of local government authorities, of
industry and of public bodies of many kinds, including voluntary organizations
such as the Voluntary^ Aid Societies and Women’s Voluntary Services.
DEFENCE
US
Under the Civil Defence Act, 1948, the Home Secretary is responsible for
co-ordinating all the Government’s civil defence preparations. The Secretary of
State for Scotland is responsible for all civil defence matters in Scotland.
In England and Wales, the Home Secretary is responsible for the civil defence
activities of the police and fire services and he administers the Civil Defence Corps
and the Industrial Civil Defence Service as well as such matters as war-time light¬
ing restrictions, air-raid shelter policy and the civil air-raid warning system. The
Civil Defence Department of the Home Office is under the charge of a Director-
General of Civil Defence, appointed by the Home Secretary. Other Government
Departments have direct responsibility for the civil defence applications of the
services which they control; for example, the Ministry of Health is responsible for
the hospital and first aid services, and the Post Office for telecommunications.
In Scotland, the Scottish Home Department deals with questions corresponding
to those dealt with by the Home Office in England and Wales, and the Department
of Health for Scotland is responsible for such matters as the hospital and first aid
services.
In Northern Ireland, the Civil Defence (Northern Ireland) Act, 1950, places
responsibility for civil defence matters on the Ministry of Home Affairs, which may
arrange for other Departments to undertake some functions on its behalf.
The co-ordination of civil defence planning in Great Britain necessarily involves
much work by interdepartmental committees on which all Departments with civil
defence responsibilities in Great Britain are represented, in order that plans and
programmes may be constantly reviewed to take account of changes in the scale and
nature of possible attacks.
For purposes of regional co-ordination, England and Wales are divided into
eleven Civil Defence Regions in charge of Regional Civil Defence Officers appointed
by the Home Office, whose duties include liaison with the armed forces and the
planning of combined exercises. There is no corresponding regional organization
in Scotland.
The Civil Defence Formations
To provide the personnel required in war for civil defence tasks, the following
formations, in which in peace time only part-time service is required, are raised
by voluntary recruitment of civilians, both men and women:
1. The Civil Defence Corps, which was created by the Secretary of State’s
Warrant in May 1949, to assist local and other authorities to carry out their
civil defence functions.
2. The Industrial Civil Defence Service, which comprises civil defence units
formed in industrial and commercial premises.
3. The Auxiliary Fire Service, to reinforce the fire services maintained by
local authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1947- (The Fire Service would
become a national organization in war.)
4. The National Elospital Service Reserve, limited at present to trained nurses
and persons willing to be trained as nursing auxiliaries to reinforce the
National Hospital Services. (In Scotland there is also an Ambulance
Section to provide the additional manpower for the war-time operation of
the Scottish Ambulance Service.)
5. The Special Constabulary, to reinforce the police forces in all police
functions. (All police officers receive training in civil defence.)
n6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Civil Defence Corps is recruited and organized by certain local authorities
(mainly the councils of counties and county boroughs, or large burghs in Scotland)
in local divisions. The local divisions are subdivided into five sections1 as follows:
Headquarters:
Wardens:
Rescue:
Ambulance
and Casualty
Collecting:
Welfare:
control of civil defence operations, communications, recon¬
naissance (including the identification of toxic agents),
guidance to the public, reporting the effects of air attack,
organization of street and village parties, movement of the
homeless, supplementary air-raid warnings,
rescue of trapped persons.
the manning of ambulances, stretcher bearing and first aid.
escort and welfare of homeless and evacuees, billeting, rest
centres, supervision and welfare of public in shelters, emer¬
gency cooking and feeding, public information centres.
Subject to restrictions regarding age and obligation to serve in the armed forces,
recruits for all formations are drawn from men and women who are willing to serve
as long as they are able and who will undertake to train approximately five hours
each month. They are not paid, but reasonable out-of-pocket expenses are
reimbursed.
Strengths in Great Britain at 31st March 1955 were:
1. Civil Defence Corps .. .. .. .. .. 358,365
2. Industrial Civil Defence Service (at 30th November 1954) 175,000

4. National Hospital Service Reserve . . . . . . 49,295
5. Special Constabulary (recruited since November 1949). . 43,592
Training
Members of the Civil Defence Corps are required to undertake the training
necessary to enable them to carry out the duties of an ordinary member of one of the
sections of the Corps. This training is known as ‘ standard training’. When a volun¬
teer has completed this stage, he may, if he wishes, and is considered suitable, be
given further training—known as ‘advanced training’—either to qualify him for
more responsible duties or to enable him to carry out some of the other tasks of his
section. All members of the Corps who have completed standard training, or any
advanced training for which they volunteered, are required to attend for about six
hours refresher training each year and to take part in exercises.
Civil defence instructors (except instructors in first aid) are trained either at one
of three central training schools or locally, under arrangements made by local
authorities in accordance with directions given by the Home Office or Scottish
Home Department. Courses and studies for senior officials concerned with civil
defence are held at the Civil Defence Staff College at Sunningdale, Berkshire.
1 Four in Scotland, where there is no Ambulance and Casualty Collecting section,
ambulance services being provided by the Hospital Service, and casualty collecting being
a warden duty. In Northern Ireland the Civil Defence Corps is organized directly by the
Ministry of Home Affairs and not by the local authorities. As in Scotland it consists of
four sections only, the Ambulance Service being a part of the Hospital Service.
DEFENCE
117
In June 1955 a Fire Service Tactical Training Centre was opened at Reigate,
Surrey. Here experiments are conducted in the use of new emergency appliances
and equipment, particularly in formations of mobile companies and columns, and
subsequently brigade instructors will be given short courses in these subjects.
Role of the Armed Forces
The local civilian services would be supported, in the event of war, by all the
formed and disciplined bodies of the armed forces available for home service. The
Civil Defence (Armed Forces) Act, 1954, provided that the duties of the armed
forces should include civil defence, and all members of the armed forces, including
the Home Guard, are to receive training in elementary civil defence duties as part
of their normal training.
The Commanders-in-Chief (United Kingdom) Committee, under the chair¬
manship of the Commander-in-Chief United Kingdom Land Forces, is respon¬
sible to the Chiefs of Staff for co-ordinating Service plans for home defence,
including Service assistance to the civil authorities.
To provide the necessary link between the local civil defence forces and the
armed forces, the Government has established a Mobile Defence Corps specially
trained in, and equipped for, rescue, ambulance, and fire-fighting duties. Initially
the aim is to build up during the next three or four years a force of 48 reserve
battalions—made up of men from the Army and the RAF—each with a minimum
strength of about 600.
Special Mobile Defence Corps rescue and fire training centres are being opened
with the intention that about 10,000 men shall receive a month’s whole-time
training each year. On completion of their active service these men will be posted to
reserve battalions as near as possible to their homes. They will carry out their
15 days’ annual reserve training with their battalions. The first two rescue training
centres, at Epsom, Surrey, and Millom, Cumberland, were taken over from the
Home Office in April and August 1955 respectively, and training of Army instruc¬
tors started during the summer, followed by further courses at Epsom for ex-
Territorial Army volunteers. From October 1955 National Service men were
received at Epsom and Millom for their month’s course of training in rescue work.
The general responsibility for the Mobile Defence Corps rests with the War
Office, but certain training depots and battalions are being manned by the RAF.
In addition certain RAF National Service reservists are being trained in fire¬
fighting so that in time of war the fire service (under central control) could expand
rapidly. For this purpose one training centre was opened by the Home Office in
July 1955 at Washington Hall, near Chorley, Lancashire, with accommodation to
train about ten thousand reservists a year for their first period of basic training. A
second training centre is being prepared for more advanced instruction.
IV. THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
BACKGROUND
The United Kingdom ranks about 75th in size among the countries of the world,
with about 0-18 per cent of the world’s land area. In population, with about 2 per
cent of the world’s inhabitants, it ranks ninth. In density of population it is fourth:
of the major countries, only Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands are more crowded;
and there are eleven times as many people to the square mile in the United King¬
dom as in the United States. In world trade, it ranks second. It takes about a fifth
of the world’s exports of primary products, and provides about a fifth of its exports
of manufactured goods.
The United Kingdom, from its own soil, provides only half of the food it
needs; and—apart from coal and some low-grade iron ore—it has few natural
resources; so it is the world’s largest importer of wheat, for instance, and of meat,
butter, fodder grains, citrus fruits, tea, and tobacco; also of wool, iron and steel
scrap, and hard timber. In return, it is the world’s largest exporter of ships and
textiles, and the second largest exporter of machinery and transport equipment of
all kinds. Few countries in the world have such a high proportion of the population
living in towns (80 per cent) or such a small proportion of the working population
engaged in agriculture (5 per cent).
The United Kingdom is also the central banker of the Sterling Area, an area with
a quarter of the world’s population. Many countries outside the sterling area use
sterling in their international transactions, and it has been estimated that about half
the world’s trade is conducted in sterling. By its membership of the Payments
Union of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation, the United
Kingdom provides a payments link between the sterling area and the countries of
Western Europe.
The short section on the national economy which follows gives a brief description
of its development up to the second world war; an account of the losses suffered in
the war; a short account of the main economic developments since the end of the
war; and, finally, a set of tables from the National Income statistics illustrating the
structure of the economy.
The Economy before 1939
During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able to support
a rapidly increasing population at a rising standard of living. It was Britain’s
commerce in cotton goods, above all, which gave it the leading position in world
trade; cotton cloth provided 40 per cent of its exports in 1851. It was in this
period also that the country became so largely dependent on imports: it has been
estimated1 that retained imports, which were only 12 per cent of net national
income at factor cost in 1820, rose to 28 per cent in 1870. (The 1954 figure was
26 per cent.)
The period from 1870 to 1890 was the high-water mark of British industrial
expansion as compared with that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914 grow¬
ing industrial competition from Europe and North America began to make itself
felt, but its effects on Britain’s staple export industries, particularly cotton textiles
and coal, were offset by the general rise in world trade, by the continued demand
1 Prof. E. A. G. Robinson, Economic Journal, September 1954, p. 458.
118
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 119
for British textiles from India and other eastern countries, and by the continued
high level of oversea investment.
The new problems confronting British industry and trade in the twentieth
century became apparent after the first world war. Textiles from India and Japan,
where labour costs were lower, established themselves firmly in the large eastern
markets, to a great extent replacing the higher-priced and often higher quality
British product. The extension of the world demand for coal was slowed down by
the increasing use of oil, while coal from the new European mines competed
severely with British coal.
In the old-established branches of the vehicles and engineering group of indus¬
tries (e.g., locomotives, ships and textile machinery) world demand fell away after
a brief post-war boom, and Britain failed at first to gain a compensating share of
the expanding world trade in the new types of engineering products (e.g., cars and
electrical goods). Most countries were tending towards self-sufficiency, and some
sought deliberately to protect nascent and even established industries by sheltering
them behind tariffs and (later) quotas and exchange restrictions.
Income from oversea investments and a substantial improvement in the terms of
trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) cushioned the effect of a
fall in the volume of exports, and imports remained high. The loss of export
markets led, however, to a contraction of Britain’s staple industries—coal, cotton,
iron and steel, and the older branches of engineering. The result was heavy
unemployment, the general rate of which averaged 14 per cent in the years 1921-39,
reaching a peak of 22 per cent in 1932, when the slump in world trade was at its
worst. In districts relying mainly on one of the staple industries, the rate was much
higher.
After 1932 an improvement in the levels of production and employment took
place, stimulated by an increase in home investment, by some revival in world
trade and, after 1935, by the armament programme.
Effects of the Second World War
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic capital by
about £3.000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and arrears of
industrial maintenance and replacements. It also resulted in a considerable altera¬
tion in Britain’s financial and trading position, which may be summarized thus:
1. Loss of oversea assets. Over £ 1,000 million worth of oversea investments—
including £428 million in North America—were sold to pay for war supplies.
The income from these assets had paid for a substantial part of pre-war
imports into the United Kingdom.
2. New oversea debts. New external debts, totalling £3,000 million, were
accumulated.
3. Terms of trade. The price of imported raw materials rose sharply after the
war, and by 1948 about one-fifth more goods had to be exported than in
1938 to bring in the same quantity of imports.
4. Reduced exports. By 1944, exports, curtailed as part of the war effort, had
fallen to less than one-third of their 1938 volume.
5. Smaller reserves. The real value of the gold and dollar reserves was reduced
to about half the pre-war level.
6. World dollar shortage. The physical destruction of the war led to an increased
dependence on the part of Britain, the rest of the sterling area and many
other countries on supplies of all kinds from North America. Dollar earnings
by non-dollar countries were inadequate to pay for these supplies.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Post-War Recovery
The Balance of Payments
The immediate need after the war was to increase exports; the need to do this
was the greater because the terms of trade turned against the United Kingdom
more or less continuously up to 1951. While this rebuilding of trade was going on,
the economy was supported by United States and Canadian loans and aid, which
between them paid for about one-fifth of the United Kingdom’s imports between
1946 and 1950.
The drive to increase exports was successful. By 1947 they had recovered their
pre-war volume, and by 1950 they were two-thirds as high again. From 1950
onwards they rose more slowly, with returning German competition; by 1954 they
were 80 per cent higher than pre-war. This recovery of exports was accompanied
by a change in pattern; engineering products provided a growing share of them,
and textiles a declining share; and there was no lagging behind in the development
of exports of new products, as there had been between the wars. Meanwhile, im¬
ports had been kept down. In i954import volume was still a little below that of 1938.
By 1950—with a current surplus of £300 million on the balance of payments—
post-war recovery appeared complete. But the outbreak of war in Korea in the
middle of that year set the British economy back in two ways. With the world-wide
rush to stock raw materials, it gave an especially sharp twist to the adverse move¬
ment of the terms of trade. And it forced Britain to begin rapidly to rearm. So in
1951 there was a current deficit of £403 million.
Import prices reached their peak in mid-1951 and then began to come down, and
the rearmament programme levelled off. In 1952, 1953 and 1954 there was again a
current balance of payments surplus. But most of 1954’s surplus was earned in
the first half of the year; and in the twelve months to mid-1955 the surplus was
comparatively small (see pp. 298-302).
Production and Employment
Throughout the post-war period, both industrial production and the real
national product have been increasing a good deal faster than in the inter-war years.
The average rate of increase in industrial production from 1946 to 1954 was 5 per
cent, and of the real national product, 3 per cent. From 1946 to 1952, most of this
increase in real output was taken, first by increased exports; secondly, by increased
investment, as the run-down of capital in the war was made good; and, thirdly, after
1950, by rearmament. From 1950 to 1953 the increase in defence expenditure took
about half the increase in the country’s total output.
Up to 1952, personal consumption did not rise much. There was a year-by-year
increase in the average weekly earnings of the ordinary wage-earner; but this
increase was roughly offset by increases in prices. (In the United Kingdom, as in
most other countries, there was a sharp increase in prices in the years after the war:
by 1952 prices were about 50 per cent above 1945.) From 1952 onwards, earnings
began to rise faster than prices, and the standard of living rose more rapidly.
It was also after 1952 that war-time controls which had been retained began to
disappear fast: raw material controls and building licences were abolished,
Government buying abroad was much reduced in scale, and the system of food
rationing was gradually abandoned.
Throughout the post-war period, high production has been accompanied by full
employment in all parts of the United Kingdom except Northern Ireland. From
1946 to 1954 the unemployment rate has averaged less than 2 per cent of the work¬
ing population (8£ per cent in Northern Ireland), whereas between the two world
wars it was never below 10 per cent.
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
121
Prospects
The United Kingdom’s main economic problems remain those of paying its way
abroad and restraining the upward trend of prices. Its share in world exports of
manufactures reached a peak in 1950 at 26 per cent. Since then, with the recovery
of Germany and Japan, it has fallen back to its pre-war share of about one-fifth.
Success or failure in maintaining the increase in the standard of living will depend
very largely on keeping a large enough share of world exports of manufactures to
finance the import bill.
THE NATIONAL INCOME 1948-54
Size and Source
In a comparison of national income per head in different countries (which
provides a very approximate measure of living standards) the United Kingdom
ranks in the second group, together with Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland,
Australia, and New Zealand, below only the United States and Canada. From 1948
t° I954 the gross national product (which is a measure of the total goods and services
produced) is estimated to have risen in real terms at a rate of about 3 per cent a year:
in I954 it was million at current prices and (with allowance made for
price changes) was 20 per cent higher than in 1948.
The predominance of industry in the United Kingdom economy is brought out
in Table 8. In 1948-54 manufacturing, mining and building were responsible for
well over two-fifths of the gross domestic product; agriculture provided 6 per cent.

To these supplies from home production, imports added, on average, rather
more than one-fifth.
Distribution
Out of the total supply of goods and services rather over a half, on average, has
been going into personal consumption, and a fifth into exports. Investment—in
122
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
industry, housing, etc.—has taken about an eighth of the total, and current expen¬
diture by central Government and local authorities—on education, health, etc.—
a slightly larger share. The figures are set out in Table 9.

There has been a significant change in the distribution of personal incomes (see
Table 10). The income of employees has increased more than the income from any
other source. In 1938 employees’ incomes were 60 per cent of the total of personal
incomes; by 1954 the share had risen to 70 per cent. In contrast, personal incomes
from rent, dividends and interest had fallen to 12 per cent from the 1938 figure of
22 per cent.

Since employees’ incomes are on the average lower than other incomes, their
increase, together with the redistributive effects of taxation, has resulted in concen¬
trating the bulk of personal income after tax in the ranges of income of £250 to
£1,000 a year and, compared with 1938, greatly reducing the share taken by the
highest incomes (see Table 11).

As total personal incomes have risen, the share of them taken by taxes has
declined; and although personal consumption of goods and services has increased
(in 1954 itwas 11 per cent up on 1948, in real terms) its share of total personal outlay
has declined to a little over four-fifths. These changes have been accompanied by a
large rise in savings, though these figures are particularly uncertain. Table 12 shows
how personal incomes were spent.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The way in which personal consumption was divided between different kinds of
commodities is shown in Table 13. This division is influenced by the incidence of
indirect taxes. Some foods are subsidized, and drink and tobacco are very heavily
taxed; expenditure on food is thus a lower percentage of personal consumption, and
expenditure on drink and tobacco a higher percentage, than might otherwise be
the case.

Government Income and Expenditure
The Government’s share in the total supplies available has been given in Table 9
as 16 per cent. But the percentage of total incomes which the Government takes is
higher, since public authorities raise a considerable part of their income, not to
spend it on goods and services, but to redistribute as pensions or subsidies. If the
total income of the central Government, local authorities and the National Insurance
Fund is compared with the total income received by everyone (including companies)
for work done, the percentage is about 40.
Table 14 gives a summary of the way in which public authorities—the central
Government, local authorities, and the National Insurance Fund—collected and
spent their incomes in 1954.

V. INDUSTRY
ORGANIZATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom is one of the most highly industrialized countries in the
world. Ten people work in mining, manufacturing and building for every one in
agriculture.
Location
The factors that have influenced the location of industry in Britain are many and
various. During the rapid industrialization of the nineteenth century, probably the
most important influence was the proximity of coal, then the major source of power,
particularly when it was associated with ease of access to other raw materials such
as iron ore in the West Midlands and salt (for chemicals) in Cheshire, and to the
coast which in turn offered easy access to imported raw materials and a quick outlet
for exports. In the course of the past hundred years, the pull exercised by coal has
been progressively weakened as improved means of communication and an alter¬
native source of power in electricity have been developed and have enabled
advantage to be taken of other sites—e.g., those near to big consumer markets and
plentiful supplies of unspecialized labour. During the inter-war period there was a
notable tendency for the ‘ new ’ industries such as motor vehicles, electrical goods
and rubber manufactures to develop rapidly in the South (especially in and around
Greater London) and the Midlands. On the other hand, this period was one of acute
depression for the older industrial areas which specialized in the great staple
industries coalmining, steel, shipbuilding, marine engineering and cotton. These
factors prompted official action which, since the war, has aimed at encouraging new
industrial development and diversification in the areas concerned and discouraging
further industrialization in congested areas such as Greater London and Greater
Birmingham.
Although industry is today widely dispersed, the areas of industrial concentration
are still, with one exception (London), the areas which saw the beginning of
Britain’s industrial greatness and which, with two exceptions (London and
Northern Ireland), are on or near coalfields. These areas and their main industries
are listed below. Four of them—Lancashire, South Wales, Tyneside, and Central
Scotland—contain Development Areas (see p. 129) where, as in Northern Ireland,
considerable success has been achieved by Government action to diversify the
industrial structure at the same time as prosperity has returned to their staple
industries.
Greater London. In addition to its building, food and drink industries, London is
the main centre in Britain of the clothing industry, of printing, of the manufacture
of furniture, of materials for the arts, of precision instruments and of many other
specialized goods. Small firms predominate in all these industries, so that the average
size of manufacturing firms in London is well below the national average. London is
also an important centre for light engineering and has some heavy engineering.
Indeed, London is so large and its industries so diverse that it is a centre, if not the
principal centre, for many of the broad groups of manufacturing industries, with
the notable exception of textiles.
Midlands. The main Midland industrial area consists of the great conurbation
centred on Birmingham and Wolverhampton which includes portions of Stafford¬
shire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire, where there is a wide variety of industry,
125
126
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
0 o
3 i-
INDUSTRY
127
128
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
including notably the manufacture of electrical and engineering goods and vehicles
but also jewellery and precision instruments, chemicals, rubber products and
domestic metalware. The smaller adjacent conurbation of North Staffordshire
centred on Stoke-on-Trent may be considered as a separate industrial area and is
devoted chiefly to the manufacture of pottery and china and to the mining of coal.
Derby, Nottingham, Leicester and Coventry are the principal industrial towns in
the rest of the Midland area. There are several small coal deposits scattered
throughout the area, while a large coalfield runs north and east of Derby and
Nottingham.
Yorkshire. The West Riding of Yorkshire still contains much the bigger section
of the British woollen and worsted industry, though Leeds is now more concerned
with clothing and a variety of steel and engineering products. The modern woollen
and worsted industry lies farther west, at Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield. The
city of Sheffield, in the extreme south of Yorkshire, is famous for its high-quality
steel manufacture, its cutlery, plate and tool industry and its heavy engineering.
There are extensive coalfields in the West Riding of Yorkshire.
South-east Lancashire. Manchester is the commercial centre of the cotton textile
industry. Most cotton yarn is spun in towns within a ten-mile radius of Manchester,
but weaving is mostly carried on somewhat farther to the north, in the Preston,
Burnley, Nelson, Blackburn and Colne areas. Manchester itself, besides having the
variety of industry typical of a large city, is one of Britain’s chief centres of electrical
and heavy engineering and dyestuffs. There are also coalfields in the Manchester
area. The whole region flanking the River Mersey is industrial as well as commercial.
Liverpool, besides being a port and produce market, is, after London, the greatest
centre of food preparation, while ship repairing is carried on there and both
shipbuilding and repairing on the other side of the river at Birkenhead.
South Wales. Coalmining, including the production of such special coals as steam
coal and anthracite, has been and remains the chief industry of South Wales. The
other basic industry is steel, including tinplate, in which extensive modernization
is in progress.
Tyneside. In Northumberland and Durham, near the River Tyne, coalmining is
the principal industry. This region also has steel and engineering industries; it is
one of Britain’s two greatest shipbuilding areas, the other being in Scotland. Most
of the shipyards are on the lower reaches of the rivers Tyne, Tees and Wear.
Central Scotland. The largest shipbuilding centre in Britain is on Clydeside. It
has a marine engineering industry and important neighbouring coalfields in the
Lothians, Fife and Lanark, although activity in this last field is now declining as the
seams are worked out. There is also a flourishing steel industry. The commercial
importance of Glasgow and the size and varied appointments of the great ships
produced on Clydeside have assured for this area a variety of manufactures. The
whole of the central lowlands of Scotland from the Clyde to the Forth is
industrialized.
Belfast Area. Another important shipbuilding area is Belfast, in Northern
Ireland, even though it has no local supplies of coal and iron. It has also an
engineering industry, primarily marine engineering, and there is a growing aircraft
assembly industry. The traditional industries of Belfast are linen, rope and tobacco.
Distribution of Industry Policy
Areas in Great Britain where there is likely to be a special danger of unemploy¬
ment may be scheduled by the Board of Trade as ‘ Development Areas * under the
INDUSTRY
129
Distribution of Industry Act, 1945. The purpose of this Act, and of the Distribu¬
tion of Industry Act, 1950, is to promote the growth of new industry and the
expansion of existing industry in the Development Areas. The main advantages
which these Acts give to Development Areas are that the Board of Trade may build
factories for letting to suitable industries and the Treasury may help by making loans
or grants to undertakings which are unable to secure finance through normal
channels. The Board of Trade factories are built and managed by Industrial Estate
Companies. The directors of these companies are unpaid and are appointed by the
Board of Trade, and their capital is provided from Government sources. The
companies include North-Western Industrial Estates Ltd., North-Eastern Trading
Estates Ltd., Scottish Industrial Estates Ltd., Wales and Monmouthshire Industrial
Estates Ltd., and the West Cumberland Industrial Development Company Ltd.
There are Development Areas in the following parts of England and Wales: the
mining and coastal areas of Northumberland and Durham; West Cumberland;
South Wales and Monmouthshire; Wrexham; South Lancashire; Merseyside; and
North-East Lancashire, which became a Development Area in March 1953. In
Scotland the industrial area in and around the Clyde Valley, the Dundee area, and
part of the Highlands have been scheduled as the Scottish Development Area.
The Government cannot direct a firm to go to any particular area or site. But, in
addition to the special powers in scheduled Development Areas, the Board of Trade
has statutory powers under the Town and Country Planning Acts, i947> t° ensure
that new industrial development throughout Great Britain is carried out consistently
with the proper distribution of industry. A certificate to this effect is necessary
before planning consent may be given by a local planning authority (see p. 358) for
a new industrial building or extension with an area of over 5,000 square feet.
New industrial buildings and extensions of over 5,000 square feet completed in
Great Britain between the beginning of 1945 and the end of 1954 totalled nearly
216 million square feet. Of this total, 33 per cent was in the Development Areas
which have, by contrast, 18 per cent of the country’s insured workers in manufac¬
turing industry.
Government assistance is not limited to Development Areas: it is given to other
areas of high unemployment not listed as Development Areas. The Buckie-
Peterhead area in north-east Scotland, which is heavily dependent on the fishing
industry and has a hard core of unemployment, is not a Development Area but
arrangements have been made for it to receive help through the Development Com¬
mission (seep. 373). The Commission has agreed to consider sympathetically requests
for help in building small factories for industrialists who are prepared to go there.
The Distribution of Industry Acts do not apply to Northern Ireland because the
matters they deal with are, under the Northern Ireland constitution, the concern of
the Northern Ireland Parliament, which has passed legislation to encourage indus¬
trial expansion and diversification. The Northern Ireland Government builds fac¬
tories and provides grants and loans for new industrial undertakings. As a result of
these efforts, over 170 firms have started production for the first time in Northern
Ireland or have expanded their employment since 1945 with Government assis¬
tance, and are already providing employment for nearly 26,000 workers. The
United Kingdom Government also helps Northern Ireland, in the same way as
it helps Development Areas in Great Britain, by giving preference in the matter
of Government contracts.
Organization
The British economy is a mixed economy, in which private and public enter¬
prise both play a substantial part. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century,
130
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the public sector tended to grow relatively to the private sector. This tendency is
connected largely with the increasing concern of Government with such matters as
health, education and housing. But up to 1950, and particularly in the decade
1940-50, there was also an increase in the State’s direct participation in productive
economic activities, although since 1951 this increase has been checked and in two
instances—steel and road transport—steps have been taken to return ownership to
private enterprise. State participation is effected mainly through special statutory
bodies set up to deal with a particular activity. Such bodies, though not part of a
Government Department, are under a considerable but varying degree of public
control (see pp. 136-7). The most important of these statutory bodies have been
the public corporations which operate major industries and services in the public
interest.
The public corporation in its twentieth-century form is, generally speaking, a
public body having a clearly defined and specific task. Its board of directors and its
staff are chosen for their experience and competence in a particular field; they are
not civil servants, and although they are accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, they are free from full and continuous ministerial control.
Certain of the corporations are self-supporting. Others receive Exchequer grants to
help them in carrying out the duties with which they have been charged.
Before the second world war a number of public corporations were established,l
designed to reorganize and to operate for the public benefit some service that
required co-ordination on a national scale or control by a body responsible for the
public interest. Their constitutions had no standard pattern and even their govern¬
ing bodies differed in the method of appointment and in composition.
Immediately after the second world war the Nationalization Acts set up public
corporations to run certain major industries and services, including coalmining,
inland transport, gas supply, electricity generation and supply and civil air trans¬
port. These post-war corporations are less varied in the composition of their
governing bodies, which are appointed by the responsible Minister, who has full
powers of dismissal.
The following corporations are now operating or controlling industries or
services:
The Bank of England (see p. 288).
The British Broadcasting Corporation (see p. 399).
Cable & Wireless Limited (see p. 250).
The British Transport Commission (see p. 217).
The Ulster Transport Authority (see p. 233).
The British Overseas Airways Corporation (see pp. 235-6 and 237-9).
1 The principal corporations appointed before the second world war were: (1) the
Central Electricity Board, established by the Electricity Supply Act, 1926, to rationalize
electricity generation and build and operate a main transmission system; (2) the British
Broadcasting Corporation, established in 1927 by Royal Charter to provide a national
broadcasting service; (3) the Electricity Board of Northern Ireland, established by the
Electricity (Supply) Act (Northern Ireland), 1931, to develop electricity supplies in
Northern Ireland outside the two County Boroughs; (4) the London Passenger Transport
Board, established by Act of Parliament in 1933, to operate the public transport system of
the London Metropolitan area; (5) the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board, estab¬
lished by the Road and Rail Transport Act (Northern Ireland), 1935, to acquire public
road transport services in Northern Ireland outside the County Boroughs; (6) the British
Overseas Airways Corporation, established by the British Overseas Airways Act, 1939, to
take over the operation of the two main existing air transport companies—Imperial
Airways and British Airways.

An analysis made privately in 1950 by a government statistician found that the
number of persons employed in the public sector of the economy as a whole
increased by 50 per cent between 1945 and 1950, so that by the middle of 1950,
22 J per cent of the total number of persons in civil employment were in the public
sector and 77 J per cent in the private sector. In manufacturing and building, private
enterprise still accounts for the major part of activity, employing, in 1950, 96 per
cent of the persons engaged in these industries. Also in terms of employment, only
about 30 per cent of the public utilities—gas, electricity, water and transport—was
the concern of private enterprise. In mid-1955 the position was still approximately
the same.
Mining and Quarrying
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining.
The coalmining industry of Great Britain is operated as a single co-ordinated
enterprise under the direction of the National Coal Board. The mining of iron
ore is in the hands of private companies, many of which, though retaining their
individual names and managements, were brought under public ownership by the
Iron and Steel Act of 1949. Under the Iron and Steel Act of 1953 (see p. 188) the
companies are in process of being returned to private ownership. Many of these
companies, in addition to extracting ore, are engaged in at least some of the manu¬
facturing processes of iron and steel production.
Other mining and quarrying (e.g., sand, gravel, chalk, limestone, salt, tin, slate,
oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private enterprise, usually owned and
operated by limited liability companies.
Manufacturing
Most manufacturing is still in the hands of private enterprise. Some exceptions
are locomotives and rolling-stock for use on British Railways, mostly built in work¬
shops owned and operated by the British Transport Commission, a considerable
quantity of arms and military equipment made in Royal Ordnance factories and
other factories operated by the Ministry of Supply, and some fighting ships built in
naval dockyards operated by the Admiralty. Some printing and bookbinding is
undertaken by staffs of the Stationery Office, while the repair, and to a limited
extent the construction, of Post Office equipment is carried on in factories run by
the Post Office. The companies primarily concerned with the manufacture of iron
and steel which were owned by the Iron and Steel Corporation, and subject to its
policy direction, are being returned to private ownership under the Iron and Steel
Act of 1953.
A survey of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more than
10 persons was made by the Ministry of Labour and National Service in January
1954; the results of the survey are shown in Table 15 overleaf.
Over a quarter of all employees in manufacturing industries are in establishments
employing from 100 to 500 persons. A high proportion of the biggest establishments
132
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
follows the Orders of the Standard Industrial Classification.
INDUSTRY
133
are in the heavy industries, while the average size of establishments in industries
making consumer goods is smaller than in manufacturing industries as a whole.
Comparisons with results obtained in earlier surveys on similar lines suggest that
there is a slow but significant trend towards an increase in the average size of
manufacturing establishments: in January 1954 establishments with 1,000 or more
employees were found to employ 2,363,000 persons, more than twice as many as
in 1935-
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of manufac¬
turing firms, as a single firm may own several establishments. There are no general
surveys of the size of manufacturing firms comparable with the survey of establish¬
ments. It is known, however, that in a few industries a small number of big com¬
panies are responsible for most of the total production. Shares in these companies
are usually distributed among a great number of holders and it is unusual for a few
large holders to have a controlling interest.
The way in which the work of production is divided within and between different
firms varies from industry to industry. In the cotton industry, for example, it is usual
for different firms to undertake the various main processes of production (spinning,
weaving, finishing), while in the woollen section of the wool textile industry all
these processes are commonly undertaken within the same firm. Some of the leading
establishments in the vehicles group of industries are primarily engaged on the
assembly of parts, many of which have been built for them under contract by
specialist firms.
Building and Civil Engineering
In building and civil engineering most of the work is undertaken by private
firms. Since the end of the second world war, most new houses have been built by
firms under contract to local authorities, but an increasing number are now being
built by private enterprise, mainly for owner-occupiers but some for sale. Some
10 per cent of local authorities employ direct labour for the construction of new
houses, while about 75 per cent use their own labour for repair and maintenance.
Building firms may be divided into those undertaking general building and civil
engineering work and those undertaking highly specialized work, many of which
operate outside as well as inside the building industry. Building is an industry of
small firms; between 25 and 30 per cent of building operatives work in firms
employing from 20 to 99 persons, while over 10 per cent work in firms employing
fewer than six persons or are self-employed.
Industrial Association
From the middle of the nineteenth century private industrial undertakings have
increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different purposes.
Some of the more important of these purposes may be classified as follows:
1. The provision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison
with Government, and representation of their members’ point of view.
2. The regulation of trading practices. Where this involves restrictions on
competition, the Monopolies Commission (see pp. 137-8) can be asked by
the Board of Trade to investigate the effect of such restrictions on the
public interest.
3. Negotiation with trade unions about wages and conditions of work.
Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover with varying complete¬
ness almost the whole of British industry but there are wide sectors of industry
134
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
where there is no collective agreement to regulate trading practices. Associations
which deal with labour matters generally consist of firms engaged in the same type
of manufacturing process. Organizations mainly concerned with representations to
Government, provision of common services or the regulation of prices are built up
round a product or an allied group of products. In an industrial sector concerned
wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may undertake all
the required functions.
There are about 270 national federations and probably about 1,600 other
employers’ organizations (mostly regional or local, and members or branches of the
national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of
work. Most of the national federations are in turn affiliated to the British Employers’
Confederation, the national body representing employers on labour questions affect¬
ing industry generally (see p. 263).
No comparable statistics exist for associations concerned with such matters as
the provision of common services, or the regulation of trade and prices. There are,
however, about 300 national organizations which are affiliated to the Federation of
British Industries (FBI), the national body recognized as the spokesman for British
industry on economic, commercial and production (as distinct from labour) ques¬
tions. The FBI has offices in the main industrial centres in the United Kingdom
and is very widely represented abroad.
A number of the organizations affiliated to the FBI also deal with labour matters
and are affiliated to the British Employers’ Confederation. The two organizations
work closely together on matters of common interest.
Other important national associations of employers are the National Union of
Manufacturers (NUM) and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. The
members of NUM are over 5,000 manufacturing firms, mainly small or medium
sized, and some 70 trade associations are affiliated to it. Like the FBI it has regional
branches. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce is the central
organization to which local Chambers of Commerce are affiliated. There are about
100 of these local Chambers. They are open to all kinds of producers and traders
and exist for promoting the interests of local industry and commerce. These last
three national organizations, all being concerned with industrial and trading
matters, often collaborate in the consideration of particular questions.
In Scotland, there is the Scottish Council {Development and Industry), represen¬
tative of Scottish local authorities, the trade unions, trade associations, Chambers of
Commerce and the banks. It encourages and assists the expansion of existing
industry, the growth of new industries, the economic utilization of Scotland’s
natural resources and the promotion of exports.
The British Institute of Management is the central national body for the promo¬
tion of good management in Britain. It conducts research into and acts as a centre
of information on management principles and techniques and is concerned with
the development of education and training at all levels of management and super¬
vision. The Institute receives a grant-in-aid from the Government, but it is financed
in the main by subscriptions from companies who support the Institute as
corporate subscribers.
Relations with Government
The system has grown up whereby as a general rule each industry has a particular
Government Department as its ‘ Production Department ’.
The main Production Departments and the main industries and services in
which they are interested are:
Whitehall, London, where many Government Departments have their headquarters.
A police constable in London uses a
police public telephone post; his
attention is attracted by a flashing
beacon on top. The public may also

The Treasury and the Ministry of Labour and National Service, though prominent
in economic matters, have no production authority duties.
During and after the second world war many operations of industry and com¬
merce were subject to Government control. Most of these controls have been
relaxed, but some remain. Thus the consent of the Treasury is required for the
issue of large amounts of fresh capital or for the purchase of foreign currency; and
that of the Board of Trade for the import or export of certain goods. The Board of
Trade also has certain powers to influence the location of industry (see p. 129), and
the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, acting through local planning
authorities, has powers to control the use of land (see pp. 356-61).
In the post-war period an effective control was that over the allocation, distribu¬
tion and use of raw materials. The degree of control was governed to a large extent
by the supply situation—an important factor in which is the availability of foreign
exchange—and varied from time to time. Thus, controls removed in the immediate
post-war years had to be reimposed in 1951 when the rearmament programmes of
the free world, superimposed on rising civilian demands, caused shortages of many
key raw materials, including zinc, lead, copper, nickel and steel. Since then, an
improving supply position has made it possible to relax all these controls.
All Departments which are production authorities, and some others, have a
responsibility for promoting increased productivity and efficiency in industry.
Production authorities, for example, encourage the establishment within each
industry and within individual undertakings of joint councils and committees in
which representatives of employers and of workers discuss together improvements
in methods and technique. They also work with and through various statutory and
voluntary bodies concerned with the same ends, and make grants to them in
appropriate cases. Such bodies include employers’ associations (see p. 134) and
K
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
136
trade unions (see p. 264); the British Productivity Council (see p. 140), a voluntary
body representing employers and trade unions; the various management and pro¬
fessional associations including the British Institute of Management (see p. 134))
the Council of Industrial Design (see p. 390), and the Development Councils which
may be set up under the provisions of the Industrial Organization and Development
Act, 1947, by Departments responsible for the industry concerned. The purpose of
the Development Councils is to provide firms in an industry with those services
(research, design, statistics, and personnel training) which individual firms cannot
afford out of their own resources. There are at present development councils for the
cotton industry {The Cotton Board), and for the furniture industry. The Department
of Scientific and Industrial Research (see p. 375) encourages and sometimes finances
industrial research and also itself conducts research useful to industry. The
national standards organization is the British Standards Institution, a voluntary
non-profit-making body, incorporated by Royal Charter. It is governed by a
General Council consisting of representatives of the main organizations of employers
and workpeople, the professional institutions and the larger Government Depart¬
ments, and it receives a Government grant.
The Board of Trade conducts information activities bearing on the efficiency of
British industry and in particular on methods of increasing industrial productivity.
It is responsible jointly with the Ministry of Labour and National Service for the
editorial policy of Target, a monthly productivity bulletin circulated to firms and
trade unions.
Technical advice is available for those firms which ask for it through such services
as the National Agricultural Advisory Service of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, and the Personnel Management Advisory Service of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service.
To ensure that industry is fully aware of Government policy and that policy is
framed with a full knowledge of industry’s needs and difficulties, a number of con¬
sultative bodies have been set up representing Government, employers’ associations
and trade unions. Among the more important of these are the National Production
Advisory Council on Industry (NPACI) and the National Joint Advisory Council
(NJAC). The NJAC consists of representatives of private employers, the boards of
nationalized industries and trade unionists under the chairmanship of the Minister
of Labour and National Service, and is concerned with matters affecting the rela¬
tions between employers and workers (see p. 267). The NPACI, which covers the
wider problems of industrial production, is under the chairmanship of the Chan¬
cellor of the Exchequer and includes representatives of the Regional Boards for
Industry and of certain Government Departments as well as of employers and
workers. Northern Ireland has its own Production Council, corresponding to the
NPACI, to the meetings of which it sends two representatives as observers.
These consultative bodies approach the study of problems from a broad national
point of view. There are in addition consultative bodies concerned with the special
problems of Scotland and Wales and of the English regions. The most important
of these are the Regional Boards for Industry whose main functions are to keep the
Government informed on industrial conditions in the nine English regions and in
Wales and Scotland, and to provide a link between central Government and local
industry.
Government and Public Corporations
The extent to which the responsible Minister has power over the working of the
Boards set up to run those industries which have been nationalized varies from
industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them. First the
INDUSTRY
137
Minister appoints the chairman and members of each Board, and secondly he has
power to give general directions as to how the industry should be run, but does not
interfere in day-to-day management. It is usually also laid down that the Board
shall give to the Minister any information, statistics, financial accounts, and so forth,
which he may require.
The most usual financial arrangement is that the Board is required to conduct its
business so that receipts at least balance outgoings over a period of years. The excep¬
tion to this rule is civil aviation; the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation
(subject to Treasury approval) has power to make grants to the two Airways
Corporations up to specified limits in the first years of their existence. The respon¬
sible Minister is usually empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to say what shall
be done with any surplus should the Boards make a profit. The Boards can also
borrow money up to certain limits, but require the consent of the responsible
Minister and the Treasury each time.
The Minister responsible for each nationalized industry must take steps to see
that the interests of the industry’s customers are protected. This is usually done by
the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider complaints and
suggesti°ns made to them and advise the Board or the Minister on the changes they
think desirable. It is recognized that these arrangements are still to a great extent
experimental.
In most other respects the nationalized industries have the same relations with
the Departments responsible for them as do the private industries; they look to them
for sponsorship and advice on productivity, and are subject to the same controls.
In order to ensure that parliamentary discussion of the nationalized industries is
informed and effective, a Select Committee on the Nationalized Industries was
appointed in March 1955* It consists of 13 Members of the House of Commons who
are ‘ to examine the Reports and Accounts of the Nationalized Industries estab¬
lished by Statute whose controlling Boards are wholly appointed by Ministers of
the Crown and whose annual receipts are not wholly or mainly derived from
moneys provided by Parliament or advanced by the Exchequer, and to obtain
information as to so much of the current policy and practices of those industries as
are not matters which:
(1) have been decided by or clearly engage the responsibility of any Ministers;
(2) concern wages and conditions of employment and other questions normally
decided by collective bargaining arrangements;
(3) fall to be considered through formal machinery established by the relevant
Statutes; or
(4) are matters of day-to-day administration.’
Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Under the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act,
1948, an independent Commission called the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Commission was established to investigate and report on matters referred to it by
the Board of Trade, which also appoints the members of the Commission. Broadly
speaking, a reference may be made where it appears that at least one-third of the
supply, processing or exports of any commodity is in the hands of a single firm or
of a number of firms which so behave as to restrict competition. Where the
Commission finds that these conditions do prevail and are contrary to the public
interest, and the industry concerned fails to implement the Commission’s recom¬
mendations, Production Departments are empowered by the Act to take suitable
remedial action. The Board of Trade is required to publish an annual report on
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
138
the working of the Act, including a list of the suggestions and requests made for
reference of matters to the Commission.
In October 1953 a Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission Act was
passed, the purpose of which was to strengthen the Monopolies Commission and
enable it to deal at any one time with a greater number of references. This Act
increased membership of the Commission from 10 to 25 and provided, among
other things, that its work might be divided among groups of members selected by
the chairman. At the end of 1954 the Commission comprised 16 members, and
groups of between eight and ten members had been appointed to consider a number
of matters referred to them.
By the end of June 1955 the Commission had been given references relating to
the following matters: dental goods, cast iron rainwater goods, electric lamps,
insulated electric wires and cables, matches and match-making machinery, insulin,
semi-manufactures of copper and copper-based alloys, printing of woven fabrics,
imported hardwood and softwood timber and plywood, buildings in the Greater
London area, certain electrical and allied machinery and plant, pneumatic tyres,
hard fibre cordage, linoleum, sand and gravel in central Scotland, certain industrial
and medical gases, standard metal windows and doors, some types of rubber foot¬
wear, electronic valves and cathode-ray tubes, and equipment for electric street
lighting. Reports had been made on the first ten of these matters. In the case of
dental goods, an Order made exclusive dealing and collective boycott unlawful; in
the other cases, remedial action was taken by the industry concerned, except in the
case of insulin, where the Commission found that manufacturers arrangements
operated in the public interest, the printing of woven fabrics where the Com¬
mission’s recommendations were (in June 1955) stih being considered, and semi¬
manufactures of copper and copper-based alloys where the Commission was asked
for a further report (since published in September i955)>
In December 1952 the Commission began an investigation into the general effect
on the public interest of certain widely prevalent practices; broadly speaking, its
inquiry covered arrangements between a number of traders to discriminate in favour
of, or against, a defined class of customer. The practices included those referred to
in reports of the Commission as ‘ exclusive dealing ’ and collective boycott . The
Commission’s report was published in June 195 5- On the basis of its recommenda¬
tions, the President of the Board of Trade announced the Government s intention
to introduce legislation to call for the registration of specified practices; thereafter,
if firms wished to continue operating such a practice, they would have to justify it
before an independent tribunal.
Production and Productivity
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, building and con¬
tracting, and gas, electricity and water) which, in 1954, was nearly 50 per cent
greater than before the war, increased rapidly in the immediate post-war years as
industry was turned over from war production, and manpower was released from
the armed forces. It had regained the pre-war level by 1946 and was 15 per cent
greater by 1948. The course of production, employment and productivity since
1948 is showm in Table 16, p. 140.
The slackening in production, employment and productivity in 1952 was due
mainly to a fall in demand at home and overseas which affected particularly the
consumer goods industries of textiles and clothing.
Over the post-war period as a whole the greatest increases in production have
been in the engineering, shipbuilding and electrical goods group, the vehicles group
industry

and the chemicals group, with increases since 1946 of approximately 60 per cent,
60 per cent and 70 per cent respectively.
The need to increase productivity has been a constant concern of Government
and industry. One important step was the formation in 1948 of the Anglo-American
Productivity Council, the main purpose of which was to promote productivity in
Britain through the exchange of ideas between various British industries and the
corresponding industries in the United States. ‘Productivity teams made up of
representatives of management, technical and workshop levels from British indus¬
tries, were sent to the United States for study and, on their return, their findings
were made public. , , . . r
When this Council was wound up after four years work, its task of helping to
promote higher productivity in Britain was continued by the British Productivity
Council, formally established in London in November 1952. This is an independent
body on which the following organizations are represented: the British Employers
Confederation, the Federation of British Industries, the Trades Union Congress,
the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the National Union of Manu¬
facturers and the nationalized industries. Its programme of action includes the
formation of Local Productivity Committees and the exchange of visits between
teams from different industrial firms for the purpose of studying common problems.
Management tt • j a
There are probably about 400,000 to 500,000 persons in the United Kingdom
who hold managerial posts in commerce or in industry.
During the present century, and particularly during and since the second wor
war, there has emerged in the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, a growing aware¬
ness of the importance of management as a subject requiring special skills an
knowledge; this has been stimulated partly by the need to raise productivity in
order to compete successfully in world markets, and partly by the conditions o
full employment and pressure upon supplies of basic commodities such as steel,
all combining to require the most effective employment of men materials and
machinery. Thus, there is now in the United Kingdom a considerable body of in¬
formation about, and interest in, such subjects as the uses of industrial engineer¬
ing (including work study, work simplification, plant layout and planned main en-
ance), the financial tools of management, such as cost accounting, and the techniques
of such matters as production planning and product standardization. In addition,
INDUSTRY
141
increased attention is being paid to human relations in industry, and to the im¬
portance of communication between management and labour.
A number of specialized management associations have come into being, requir¬
ing educational and other qualifications for membership, while, since the first world
war, the professional engineering institutions have included industrial administra¬
tion in the syllabus of their qualifying examinations.
During the second world war, the need was recognized for a central institution
to co-ordinate education, information and research in management subjects. Soon
after the end of the war a committee was appointed by the President of the Board
of Trade to formulate precise proposals for such an institution, and, following its
report, the British Institute of Management (see p. 134) was formed in 1947.
In 1954 the first Production Exhibition, sponsored by the Institution of Produc¬
tion Engineers, was held in London, and aroused considerable interest in the tech¬
niques and problems of management by demonstrating what could be achieved
by their proper application.
Facilities for management training at all levels are growing, though most man-
ageis are not members of any management body, and only a minority have re¬
ceived systematic training in the principles of management. One of the most
notable recent developments is the growth of work study training courses, whether
run by industries, firms, trade unions or technical colleges. Education for manage¬
ment is developing mainly in four ways:
(1) a national scheme operating through more than 75 technical and commer¬
cial colleges throughout the United Kingdom;
(2) an external examination system operated by the Institute of Industrial
Administration;
(3) independent courses conducted by universities and adult education centres,
including the Administrative Staff College at Henley-on-Thames;
(4) the training schemes of trade associations, trade unions and individual firms.
A growing interest is also taken in methods and techniques of training for all
types of managerial work in other countries.
Capital Development
In recent years gross fixed capital formation has accounted for about one-seventh
of gross national expenditure. In i954> its volume, as distinct from its value, was
17 per cent greater than in 1938 and about 30 per cent greater than in 1948.
The actual course of fixed capital formation in 1938 and between 1948 and 1954
(at current and constant prices) was as follows:
^ear 193® *948 1949 I95° 195I 1952 1953 1954
£ million (current
prices) 656 1,406 1,552 1,678 1,851 2,039 2,305 2,452
£ million (1948
prices) 1,559 1,406 1,513 1,570 1,545 1,546 i,74i 1,826
Thus, in real terms, investment did not increase in 1951 and 1952. The pressing
needs of defence and exports in these years made it necessary for the Government
to take measures to curtail investment. In 1953 it was possible to reverse this policy
of restraint, and incentives were provided in the 1954 Budget (see p. 282). In the
autumn of 1955 the pressure of internal demand made it necessary to supplement
other restraints by calling for moderation in capital outlay by public authorities,
and for private enterprise to move rather more slowly in implementing investment
programmes.

AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialized country relying on im¬
ports for half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and most impor¬
tant industries. It employs about 1 million people or 5 per cent of the labour force
and provides about 5 per cent of the gross national product, using 48 million ot the
60 million acres of land.
THE LAND AND ITS USES
The land in general is highly fertile, and current agricultural practices founded
upon an age-old tradition of good husbandry improved by the application of modem
INDUSTRY
143
scientific methods, result in some of the world’s finest pedigree livestock and a yield
per acre of grain crops among the highest in the world. In 1953, for example, pre¬
vious record yields for these and other crops in England and Wales were again
broken. Yields per acre were (in cwts.): wheat 24; barley 22-6; oats 21-2; rye 19-6;
(in tons) potatoes 8-7; sugar beet 12-8.
The agricultural industry is less subject to serious dislocation caused by extreme
climatic conditions than it is in some other countries; crops and livestock, for
example, are seldom subjected to the dangers of drought, or floods, or severe cold.
Nevertheless abnormal climatic conditions such as, in recent years, the severe
winter of 1946-47, the East Coast floods of 1953, and the wet summer of 1954, do
sometimes occur.
Types of Farming
There are about 535,000 agricultural holdings in the United Kingdom: 325,000
in England; 55,000 in Wales; 74,000 in Scotland; and 81,000 in Northern Ireland.
About three-fifths of the total holdings are under 50 acres in size, but 97,000 (18 per
cent) are over 100 acres and 15,500 (nearly 3 per cent) over 300 acres. In general,
farms in Britain are run as businesses, each by a single manager, usually the farmer
himself. Most farmers belong to one or more of the various organizations, such as
the National Farmers’ Union in England and Wales, which exist to represent their
collective interests, and also to agricultural co-operative societies, which provide
them with bulk-purchase and bulk-selling facilities.
In England and Wales out of a total of 29-8 million acres of agricultural land, 24-5
million acres are under crops and grass, the remainder being rough grazings.
Types of farming vary with difference of soil and climate. In general, the eastern
half of England is devoted predominantly to arable, and the western half of England,
together with Wales, to dairy farming. Pasture farming accounts for 37 per cent of
agricultural land, arable for 22 per cent and mixed farming for 29 per cent, the
remainder being unclassifiable or of little agricultural value. The chief crop is
wheat followed by barley, oats, mixed corn and potatoes. Market gardens are usually
found near towns, but much of the vegetable production is now on arable and mixed
farms. Fattening of animals for food is widespread but is carried on particularly in
the south-eastern and eastern counties and the Midlands, and stock-rearing is preva¬
lent in Wales and in the North of England.
In Scotland out of a total of over 15 million acres of agricultural land, 4J million
acres are under crops and grass, the rest being rough hill grazings (about 11 million
acres) or land only able to support deer and game. The chief crop is oats; next come
root crops for stock-feeding; potatoes, especially seed potatoes, and barley are also
important crops. The wheat area is small. In the south-west, dairying is the chief
branch of the industry, while cropping and fattening cattle are carried on mainly in
the east. The rearing of stock (especially sheep) is of importance in the hill areas.
In Northern Ireland the total of 2-97 million acres of agricultural land in 1953
included 2-28 million acres under crops and pasture. The land is intensively farmed,
the chief crops being potatoes, oats, flax, and ryegrass for seed. An average of about
80 per cent of Northern Ireland’s agricultural income is derived from livestock and
livestock products.
Horticulture accounts for one-sixth of the value of the agricultural output of the
United Kingdom. The war-time need for self-sufficiency and the shortage of other
foods led to a great increase in the acreage under vegetables, but return to a more
normal diet and the reopening of oversea sources of supply have brought about some
reduction of the area, though it is still much greater than before the war, due largely
to the great increase in the area of peas for harvesting dry. The acreage under fruit
144
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(see Table 18) remains at about the pre-war level, but the crops produced on that
area have been increased by about 60 per cent.
Although the commoner vegetables and fruit are grown to some extent all over the
country, there is a tendency for certain crops to be concentrated in specialized areas,
e.g., broccoli in Cornwall and Kent, carrots and rhubarb in Yorkshire, asparagus and
plums in Worcestershire, cherries in Kent, apples in Kent and Hereford, onions
in the Fen district, early strawberries in Hampshire, maincrop strawberries in Kent
and Norfolk, and tomatoes under glass in the Lea Valley. Early vegetables are
supplied from the Channel Islands.
During the war, the area devoted to flowers was drastically reduced by official
controls. It has taken the nursery industry some time to recover from the setback
but the acreage is now about the same as before the war. Early spring flowers are
grown in the Scilly Isles.
Smallholdings and Allotments
There are some 20,000 smallholdings provided by county councils and county
borough councils in England and Wales and by the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. Of these, some 11,000 are capable of providing a full-time
occupation for the tenant. These smallholdings are let only to people with practical
experience in agriculture, preferably agricultural workers, with the object of afford¬
ing them an opportunity to become farmers on their own account. Loans may be
made to the tenants of up to 75 per cent of the working capital they require.
Of the smallholdings provided by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, approximately 1,000 situated on 18 different estates are managed on the
Minister’s behalf by the Land Settlement Association Limited, which was originally
formed in 1935 to develop smallholdings for unemployed men from industrial
areas. The Association provides centrally on each estate various services for the
tenants’ use. These services include the supply of agricultural stores and requisites,
the operation of a machinery pool, and the packing and marketing of produce.
The Welsh Land Settlement Society, which was also formed to assist in the
settlement on the land of unemployed industrial workers, created one estate similar
to those of the Land Settlement Association and a number of profit-sharing farms,
which still operate.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central Govern¬
ment, which now owns and maintains some 452,000 acres of Land Settlement
Estates with over 4,200 holdings.
There are also rather more than one million allotments in the United Kingdom;
most of these are allotment gardens1 and about half are permanent statutory allot¬
ments provided by local authorities who have under the Allotments Acts the duty
to provide allotments, if practicable, wherever there is a need.
The growing of vegetables and fruit and the keeping of small livestock such as
poultry, rabbits, bees, pigs and goats by gardeners and allotment-holders is wide¬
spread in Britain. Voluntary organizations exist to provide advice, guidance and
trading facilities and generally to assist persons interested in the movement. The
National Council for Domestic Food Production, formed in 1951 by the Minister of
Agriculture, co-ordinates the work of these organizations and encourages the deve¬
lopment of domestic food production as a form of self-help, providing social and
recreational benefits.
1 An allotment garden is a piece of land not bigger than a quarter of an acre which is
wholly or mainly cultivated by the occupier for the production of vegetable or fruit crops
for consumption by himself or his family.
INDUSTRY
145
Scottish Crofts
Crofters are tenant farmers resident in one of the seven Scottish counties known
as crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness, Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty,
Sutherland, and Shetland—whose holdings are each rented at less than £50 a year
and are not more than 50 acres in area. In 1947 there were in these counties 20,918
crofts out of a total of 23,209 separate holdings. In 1952-53 the value of the annual
production of these crofts was £7.9 million, about half the total agricultural out¬
put of the seven counties and 5.66 per cent of that of Scotland as a whole. The
problems of the crofting areas—such as declining population and falling agricul¬
tural production—led to the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry in 1951.
In its report, published in 1954 (C?nd. 9091), the Commission recommended the
setting up of a Crofters Commission to regulate crofting in the crofting counties.
The recommendations were accepted by the Government, which passed the
Crofters (Scotland) Act, 1955, under which a Crofters Commission (see p. 154)
was appointed and started operations on xst October 1955.
Changes since 1870
In the middle of the nineteenth century Britain was largely self-sufficient in agri¬
cultural production. Then, wool, grain and, later, meat—all produced cheaply from
virgin lands overseas—were increasingly imported, and, as a result, the farming
industry had to adapt itself to the changing conditions by concentrating much more
on milk, eggs, pigs and horticultural produce. These changes in production and
types of farming in successive attempts to meet changes of fortune resulted in a
continuous trend away from an agricultural industry based mainly on grain to one
based more on livestock and livestock products, and, among crops, an increasing
emphasis on vegetables.
The arable area in Britain declined continuously from 1872 until 1939, except
during the first world war; the meat, dairy and poultry industries becoming in¬
creasingly dependent on imported feedingstuffs. The outbreak of the second world
war was, however, followed by an immediate reversal of farming practice, for short¬
age of shipping space for imports demanded a greatly increased home production of
crops for direct human consumption such as wheat and potatoes, largely at the
expense of livestock and livestock products other than milk. The post-war world
food shortage and Britain’s balance of payments problems made it necessary for
Britain to maintain increased grain production, but since 1947 an expansion of out¬
put of livestock, livestock products and animal feedingstuffs has been encouraged
concurrently with the maintenance of a high level of production of grain and other
crops.
Recent Trends
Recent trends in agricultural policy have resulted in greater emphasis on stock¬
rearing for meat and less stress on further increases in milk production.
The use of agricultural land for the various crops and the numbers of livestock
on farms in the United Kingdom since 1924 are shown in Tables 18 and 19 overleaf.
PRODUCTION
Before the second world war, Britain produced about 31 per cent of its food
supplies (in terms of calories for human consumption). By 1954 this had risen to
nearly 42 per cent. The comparable figures in terms of values are 36 per cent pre¬
war and about 49 per cent in 1953-54. Imports of food and feedingstuffs accounted

In 1947 plans were made to secure an increase in the volume of annual
agricultural net output to about 50 per cent above the pre-war level by 1952.
This objective was in fact achieved, the official index number (pre-war average
= 100) being 153 for 1952-53. A further objective to raise this to at least 160 by
1956 was announced in 1952 (Cmd. 8556). This objective was reaffirmed in 1954
{Cmd. 9104) and in 1955 {Cmd. 9406) although it is now unlikely that it will
be achieved until two or three years later. Still further expansion depends on the
continual success of the industry in reducing costs and improving quality, particu¬
larly of livestock products, and so reducing the cost to the Exchequer of carrying
out the guarantees under the Agriculture Act (see p. 149). The index number for
1954-55 is provisionally given as 153, compared with 155 for 1953-54. The decline
was due to particularly bad weather during the year. Table 21, overleaf, shows the
trend in production of some of the main products since the war.
The Government continues to look to the following means of increasing the net
output of the industry:
(1) more beef production; and more mutton and lamb (particularly if unit
costs of production can be reduced);
(2) continued and steady improvement in crop yields;
(3) a saving in the heavy bill for feed imports by:
{a) more ley farming, improved management and use of grass, and
{b) skill and economy in the use of concentrated feedingstuffs.
At the 1955 Annual Review (see pp. 149-51) the Government discouraged
further increase in the output of pigmeat by reducing the guarantee.

GOVERNMENT POLICY
The severe agricultural depression which followed the fall in the general price
level after 1920 resulted in 1931 in the beginning of a programme of financial assis¬
tance to agriculture, including tariffs, subsidies and quotas, which had a stabilizing
effect on the prices of grain, cattle and milk, developed the sugar beet industry and
encouraged cultivation of sub-marginal land (land which it is not profitable to
cultivate).
Commodity commissions were set up for wheat, sugar, livestock and bacon. These
were Government-appointed semi-independent organizations for administering
Exchequer subsidies or other forms of direct financial assistance for the production
of the commodity to which they related. In addition, to enable the home producer
to regulate the marketing of his produce, the Agricultural Marketing Acts of 1931
and 1933 provided for the establishment ofproducer-controlled commodity market¬
ing boards in Great Britain, and by September 1939 there were in operation eight such
INDUSTRY
149
boards concerned with the marketing of the following products—potatoes, hops,
pigs (for bacon), bacon, and milk (four boards).
In Northern Ireland the Agricultural Marketing Act (Northern Ireland), 1933,
empowered the Ministry of Agriculture to frame schemes for regulating the market¬
ing of agricultural products and for the establishment of marketing boards.
During the war and the post-war years agriculture was closely controlled by the
State and the functions of marketing boards, commodity commissions and similar
bodies were largely suspended. Farmers’ prices were fixed by the State for the
principal agricultural products, the majority of which were purchased by the State.
This was* coupled with close State control of food imports, many of which were
bought on Government account, the stabilization of food prices by means of sub¬
sidies, and a rigid system of food rationing for most of the principal food products.
In addition the State exercised a close supervision over the level and efficiency of
agricultural production.
In 1947 the Agriculture Act was passed which provided the main basis of post¬
war agricultural policy in England and Wales and the controls to implement it.
Similar Acts for Scotland and Northern Ireland were passed in 1948 and 1949
respectively. The implementation of the Agriculture Acts is the responsibility
respectively of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,1 the Department
of Agriculture for Scotland (see p. 56), and the Ministry of Agriculture in Northern
Ireland (often known collectively as the Agricultural Departments).
The principles of the 1947 Act were that the Government would provide the
industry with a system of guarantees which would ensure ‘ a stable and efficient
agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the nation’s food as in the
national interest it is desired to produce’. In return for this, the Act and its equiva¬
lents in Scotland and Northern Ireland gave the Government power to insist on a
minimum level of efficiency. Farmers and landowners are respectively required to
maintain a reasonable standard of husbandry and estate management. If they do
not do so, the Agricultural Ministers are able to issue directions, and in the last
resort to require a change of occupation or ownership (see p. 154).
The Acts provide for the holding of an Annual Review, usually in February, of
the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry. This is conducted
by the Agricultural Departments with the farmers’ representatives. In the light of
the review, price guarantees are determined for livestock and livestock products for
the next year and for crops to be harvested in the year following that in which the
review is held. The products concerned are: wheat, barley, oats, rye, potatoes, sugar
beet, fat stock, milk, eggs, and (since 1950 only) wool. Minimum prices for live¬
stock and their products are also fixed for two to four years ahead. Provision
is also made for special reviews to be held at any time if the Ministers consider
that there has been a sudden substantial change in costs or in other conditions.
There are powers to relate guaranteed prices to the levels of output of particular
products. These were used for the first time in 1954 for milk.
As world supplies of food and Britain’s own trading position have improved in
the last few years, the Government has gradually restored both the import of food
and all domestic trading in food to private business. All consumer rationing of food
ended in Britain on 3rd July 1954. But the basic policy of the Agriculture Act, 1947,
including guarantees to farmers, remained. In the words of the White Paper (Cmd.
8989) of November 1953 :
‘ Direct Government purchase of home-produced food can no longer be the sole

on 1st April 1955. For an account of the functions of the new Ministry see p. 42.

IS©
or main instrument for implementing the Government’s guarantees to farmers.
But the Government firmly adheres to the principles of the Agriculture Act, 1947 >
and fully accepts its obligation to make alternative arrangements to secure a stable
and efficient agriculture.’
Arrangements appropriate to each commodity have been devised in connection
with price guarantees and marketing organization.
Price Guarantee Arrangements
The guarantees since the 1954 Review are being given in four different ways.
1. Fixed guarantee prices, the general form of guarantee before the return to
free markets, continue to apply to sugar beet. The guarantees for milk and
wool are operated through the Marketing Boards. Guarantees of the Board s
receipts enable the Boards to fix producers prices in advance after making
allowance for wholesale marketing costs. For wool, there is an arrangement
for receipts in excess of the guarantee to be placed in a long-term price
stabilization fund; and for milk the guaranteed price is limited by reference
to a standard quantity so that if total sales off farms exceed this, the effective
level of the guaranteed price per gallon is reduced. The guarantee
arrangements are designed to encourage the Boards to market efficiently,
for example, the price guaranteed for milk is subject to slight adjustment
according to the level of price actually realized.
2. Minimum or support prices, below which the Government pays the difference
on sales taking place, apply to eggs and are designed to protect the farmer
from low prices resulting from periodic gluts. Potatoes from the 1955 har¬
vest have been dealt with in a similar way, but in Great Britain the support
price arrangements are operated on behalf of the Ministers by the Potato
Marketing Board.
3. Deficiency payments schemes, under which the Government establishes the
standard price and pays each producer the deficiency (if any) between
this price and the average realized market price multiplied by the volume
of his sales, apply to wheat, rye, barley and oats, but for barley and oats
the price deficiency is converted into a payment per acre. The method also
applies to fat cattle (except fat cows), fat sheep, fat lambs and fat pigs. The
guarantee is collective; it safeguards the incomes of producers as a whole
and the individual producer may get more or less than the standard price
(but see (4) below). Otherwise standard prices are similar in principle to
minimum prices, except that they have been fixed high enough to give a
more extensive type of protection.
4. Guaranteed individual prices, which guarantee a minimum price for each
individual transaction additional to the collective guarantee, are applicable
to fatstock (except fat cowrs).
At the 1954 Review it was realized that the effects of the changes made could not
be forecast precisely, since in a freer economy farmers’ receipts would depend less
on fixed prices and more on sales in a competitive market supplemented when
necessary by guarantees. The White Paper (Cmd. 9104) stated that while net agri¬
cultural income might be somewhat lower than it then was, the Government was
satisfied that the guarantees assured the industry a satisfactory level of income in
accordance with the 1947 Act. If the industry were to maintain its net income it
would have to reduce costs further and sell its produce competitively and in relation
to world food prices, and so continue to prosper with less assistance from the
Exchequer. At the 1955 Review it was revealed (in Cmd. 9406) that costs (mainly

fallen from £32°"5 million to £280 million. This fall was, however, due entirely
to adverse weather conditions. ]When adjusted for normal weather conditions net
income was estimated at £312 million for 1954-55, compared with £305-5 million
(similarly adjusted) for 1953-54.
Marketing Organization
T he marketing organization comprises marketing boards set up under the
Agricultural Marketing Acts and certain other arrangements.
Marketing Boards under the Agricultural Marketing Acts, 1931 to 1949. Market¬
ing Boards are producers’ organizations with compulsory powers to regulate the
marketing of particular agricultural products by producers. The schemes under
which they are constituted and operated must be approved by Parliament and
confirmed by poll of the producers concerned. A Board must normally consist of
from eight to 24 members; not fewer than two and not more than one-fifth of the
total number must be appointed by the Minister.
In general, the Government has declared its willingness to facilitate the setting
up of producer marketing boards although each commodity is considered sepa¬
rately on its merits. In appropriate cases, the Government is prepared to allow the
price guarantees to be operated through marketing boards.
Wool is marketed through the Wool Marketing Board and marketing powers
were restored to the Milk Marketing Boards on 1st April 1954, although for as
long as there remains an element of consumer subsidy the Government will con¬
tinue to be responsible for approving prices and distributive margins for milk.
A Potato Marketing Scheme for Great Britain came into force in May 1955. It
re-enacts and revises the pre-war scheme and has the same objectives, the stabiliza¬
tion of the market and the improvement and quality of marketing.
The Hops Marketing Board is responsible for marketing all hops, while the
Tomato and Cucumber Marketing Board has only limited regulatory powers.
The future of the Pigs, Bacon and Milk Products Marketing Boards, which have
been suspended under Defence Regulations since the outbreak of war, is under
consideration.
In Northern Ireland schemes for the marketing of two products, pigs and milk,
are at present in operation.
Consumers’ Committees to represent the consumers’ interests in regard to the
operation of Marketing Schemes were reconstituted in December 1953. They had
been set up in 1931 but did not meet during the war and immediate post-war years.
Other Arrangements. An interim scheme for eggs, whereby a National Egg
Marketing Organization was set up to advise the Minister of Food on orderly
marketing arrangements after decontrol on 26th March 1953, is expected to give
way to more permanent machinery in the form of a Marketing Board.
Since 1st July 1954, when Government purchase of home produced fatstock
ended, farmers have been able to sell their fatstock by auction at approved fatstock
markets, by private treaty and by grade and deadweight.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food administers direct deficiency
payments for cereals.
The guarantees under the Agriculture Acts do not apply to horticultural products.
The Government appointed a Committee in March 1955 to investigate present
methods of marketing horticultural products and to recommend improvements.

Food Subsidies and Production Grants
The cost of these guarantees to the agricultural industry is included in the general
subsidies on certain basic foods, whether home produced or imported.
Total subsidies on food (home produced and imported combined) for 1954-55
are estimated to amount to £339 million. The cost of these subsidies in 1955-56 has
also been estimated by the Departments concerned to amount to about the same
figure (see Table 22).
THE EXECUTION OF POLICY
Besides providing financial stability through guarantees to farmers (see p. 150)
the State promotes efficiency by means of various facilities, safeguards, schemes
and services. While the Government thus provides every incentive to the farmer to
farm efficiently, it reserves the right, as a corollary, to take disciplinary action if he
fails to do so.
County Agricultural Executive Committees
In England and Wales, County Agricultural Executive Committees (CAECs)
were set up under the Agriculture Act, 1947, with the duty of promoting agricul¬
tural development and efficiency. These superseded the County War Agricultural
Executive Committees set up at the outbreak of war in 1939. Each committee con¬
sists of 12 members. Five are appointed directly by the Minister, and seven from
panels nominated by the interests concerned, three being farmers, two landowners
and two workers. One of those directly appointed is a member of the county
council; the others are persons with special qualifications or with experience of local
agriculture. The committees are represented in areas within the county by District
Committees. The system of voluntary part-time liaison officers, to interpret
Government policy to the CAECs, was revived in 1952.
The arrangements differ in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, agri¬
cultural policy is carried out under the Secretary of State for Scotland through the
Department of Agriculture and 11 Area Agricultural Executive Committees. In
Northern Ireland each county has a Committee of Agriculture which acts mainly in
an advisory capacity to the Ministry of Agriculture. An Agricultural Executive
Officer working directly under the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture is
responsible for carrying out the Government’s agricultural policy in each county.
Security of Tenure
Successful farming is a long-term business and adequate security of tenure is
essential to the efficiency of the good farmer, especially where, as in Britain, a high
proportion of farmers are tenant farmers.1 Such security is ensured by legislation
but at the same time the Government has power to insist on good farming and to
discipline bad farmers, even if owning their land.
In England and Wales the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923, required at least
twelve months’ notice to be given to quit an agricultural holding and gave the
tenant a right to compensation for disturbance on leaving his holding; a tenant had
no statutory right of contesting the notice to quit. The Agricultural Holdings Act,
1 Returns made in 1950 for the purpose of the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization’s World Census showed that about 36 per cent of holdings in England and
Wales were wholly owned by the occupier; 49 per cent were wholly rented and 15 per cent
were part-owned and part-rented. The proportion of owner-occupiers is substantially higher
in the case of holdings of under five acres but does not vary appreciably from size group
to size group in the case of the larger holdings.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
154
1948, gave the tenant the right in normal circumstances to have the matter referred
to the County Agricultural Executive Committee (acting for the Minister); either
tenant or landlord could then appeal against the committee’s decision to an
Agricultural Land Tribunal (see below). The Scottish Act of 1949 applied similar
provisions to Scotland, with a right of appeal to the Scottish Land Court. There are
no farm landlords in Northern Ireland, where, under various Land Acts passed
between 1870 and 1925, every farmer is either the owner, or is in process of becom¬
ing the owner, of his holding.
But under the Agriculture Act, 1947, the Minister of Agriculture has the power
to place under supervision an owner or occupier considered guilty of bad estate
management or bad husbandry. This power he has delegated to the County
Agricultural Executive Committees. If the owner or occupier fails to show satis¬
factory improvement in his standard of management or of husbandry after twelve
months under supervision, or earlier if he has failed to comply with a direction, he
may be dispossessed. Dispossession of an owner means compulsory purchase.
Dispossession of an occupier means that his occupation is terminated and the new
occupier has to be approved by the Committee. An owner or occupier may appeal
to an Agricultural Land Tribunal against a proposal that he should be dispossessed.
Agricultural hand Tribunals
Agricultural Land Tribunals, which are independent bodies each consisting of a
chairman appointed by the Lord Chancellor (usually for three years), and two
members representing landowners and farmers appointed by the chairman from
panels drawn up by the Lord Chancellor after consulting representative bodies,
were originally set up in England and Wales in 1948 under the Agriculture Act,
1947. Their task is to hear and to decide cases in which decisions and proposals
(generally notices to quit or proposals to dispossess) of the Minister of Agriculture,
or of the County Agricultural Executive Committees acting on his behalf, are
referred to them at the request of one of the parties concerned. Under new regula¬
tions made in 1954 a Tribunal may, at the request of any interested party or at the
direction of the Court, refer questions of law to the High Court of Justice.
The Crofters Commission
On 1st October 1955 a Crofters Commission, set up under the Crofters (Scot¬
land) Act, 1955, began work at its headquarters at Inverness. The Act provides
for a Commission, to be appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, which
should consist of not more than six members, at least one of whom should speak
Gaelic, and which should include members with a knowledge of crofting conditions.
Its functions are to reorganize, develop and regulate crofting in the crofting coun¬
ties of Scotland (see p. 145), to promote the interests of crofters there and to keep
under review matters relating to crofting. In particular, when a croft becomes
vacant, the landlord is required to notify the Crofters Commission and to advise
it of his proposals for letting the croft. The Commission has power to approve or
veto these proposals, to require that a vacant croft be let as an enlargement to an¬
other croft, and generally to ensure that all vacant crofts are let in the best inter¬
ests of the crofting communities. For the same purpose the Commission has power
to dispossess absentee tenants who are, however, able to retain their croft houses
in certain circumstances. Aged persons who are unable to cultivate their land may,
with the Commission’s approval, give up their land while still remaining in occu¬
pation of their houses. The Commission has special power to carry out the re¬
organization of derelict or decaying ‘ townships ’ if a majority of the resident crofters
are in favour of the scheme. Such a scheme provides for the re-allocation of the
INDUSTRY
155
land in the township in a way which, in the Commission’s opinion, would lead to
the proper and efficient use of the land and the general benefit of the township.
The Act confers on the Commission powers for ensuring that crofters work their
crofts according to the rules of good husbandry. The Commission may act as agents
of the Secretary of State for Scotland in the administration of schemes for loans
and grants for the development of agricultural production on crofts and will be
responsible for approving regulations governing the use of common grazings.
These powers are designed to enable the Crofters Commission to ensure that
the fullest use is made of crofting lands. The Commission of Inquiry (see p. 145)
recognized that developments in other directions were necessary to ensure the
economic well-being of the crofting communities. Consistent with this, the Act
has conferred on the Crofters Commission the specific duty of collaborating with
other bodies in carrying out measures for the economic development and social
improvement of the crofting communities.
The Agricultural Land Commission
The Agricultural Land Commission was set up under the Agriculture Act, 1947.
Its functions are to manage and to farm lands vested in the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, or land for which he has become responsible, and to advise and
assist the Minister in matters relating to the management of agricultural land. The
Commission’s functions in Wales are delegated to the Welsh Agricultural Land
Sub-Commission. At 31st March 1954, 227,000 acres were under the control of the
Commission and almost all of this land was let to private farmers. Nearly half of the
land was agricultural land intermixed with other land used by the Forestry Com¬
mission. About one-sixth consisted of disused airfields and other land formerly held
by various Government Departments; another sixth comprised an estate accepted
by the Government in lieu of death duties; and the remainder was mostly land
acquired by the Minister to ensure its full and efficient use for agriculture. Early in
1954 the Minister decided, after consultation with the Commission, to sell land
managed by it wherever that could suitably be done, and sales are in progress.
In Scotland, the management of lands vested in the Secretary of State and the
duty of advising him on management matters are carried out by the Department of
Agriculture.
The Agricultural Land Service
This Service was formed in 1948 to take over the duties of the pre-war Land
Commissioner Service and also those of the Rural Land Utilization Officers
appointed during the war. The main functions of the Service are:
(1) to advise owners of agricultural land, whether landlords or owner-
occupiers, on estate management matters, including farm buildings and
other fixed equipment;
(2) to give professional advice to and carry out the instructions of the Minister,
the Agricultural Land Commission and County Agricultural Executive
Committees on all matters relating to agricultural land, including: the
purchase and sale of land by the Minister; the management of land owned
by or in the possession of the Minister; the exercise of the Minister’s
powers for securing good estate management and good husbandry and of his
functions under the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1948; the provision of
grant-aid under the Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts and of
marginal production assistance; and the provision and management
of smallholdings and allotments by local authorities;
156
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(3) to advise the Minister and local planning authorities on the agricultural
aspects of planning and the release of agricultural land for other develop¬
ment including afforestation.
In Scotland similar duties are carried out by officers of the Department of
Agriculture.
Agricultural Advisory Services
Free technical advice on all agricultural and horticultural matters is available to
every farmer and grower in England and Wales through the Ministry of Agricul¬
ture’s National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS).
Every county has a County Agricultural Officer in charge of advisory work and is
divided into districts in each of which there is a District Advisory Officer who acts
as a general adviser to farmers. The District Officer can call on an extensive system
of specialist advisers. Advisers in livestock husbandry, milk production, farm
machinery, poultry husbandry, and horticulture are available in each county; at the
12 provincial centres and sub-centres there are senior advisers in these subjects and
in crop and grassland husbandry, besides specialists in animal nutrition, bacteriology,
soil chemistry, plant diseases, and plant pests. These centres are equipped with
laboratories for the analysis of soils and feedingstuffs, and for the diagnosis of crop
pests and diseases. The advisers work in close consultation with the Ministry s
Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire.
In Scotland the advisory services, similar in scope to the NAAS, are based on the
three agricultural colleges. Northern Ireland has its own separate advisory service
which is closely linked with the research and experimental divisions (see p. 160).
Facilities are provided at the NAAS Experimental Farms and Horticultural
Stations in England and Wales and at Agricultural College Centres in Scotland for
field-scale extensions of research work and investigations of local problems.
Experiments are also carried out at provincial advisory centres and on commercial
The Agricidtural bnprovement Council (AIC) for England and Wales and the
Scottish Agricultural Improvement Council advise the Agricultural Departments
on the application of the results of scientific investigation to farming practice and on
problems requiring investigation. The AIC is also concerned with the problems o
estate management including buildings and fixed equipment.
Loan Facilities
In England and Wales long-term finance for agricultural properties is provided
by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation,1 established under the provisions of the
Agricultural Credits Acts, 1928 and 1932, which is empowered to grant long-term
loans on the security of properties (a) on first mortgage of agricultural land and
lb) in respect of major improvements to agricultural land and buildings.
The Corporation’s funds are derived mainly from the proceeds of various issues
of debenture stocks which are subscribed by the public and are repaid by the
operation of sinking funds. The Corporation’s reserves include a Guarantee Fund
for which it may raise money under the Agricultural Credits Act, 1928, and t e
Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1944,in the form of interest-free loans
from the Government up to a total of £2 -5 million. In Scotland loans on favourable
terms for agricultural purposes on the security of agricultural land in Scotland are
granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Limited,' a limited com¬
pany set up in accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural Credits (Scotland)

Act, 1929- Both the Corporations at present receive grants from the Treasury
towards any deficit in their respective annual Profit and Loss Accounts.
Landowners in England and Wales may also obtain loans for the purpose of
carrying out certain improvements to agricultural land and buildings from the
Lands Improvement Company. The amount of the loan is charged on the land
improved, in the form of a terminable rent-charge payable half-yearly for a period
not exceeding 40 years. These improvement loans require the sanction of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but the Ministry does not itself
provide the necessary funds.
Drainage and Water Schemes
The State makes substantial contributions towards the cost of land drainage and
water supply in Britain. In England and Wales, for example, under various Acts,
grants for farm drainage may be up to 50 per cent of the approved cost; for main
river drainage they can range up to 80 per cent. Farm water supply grants are at the
rate of 25 per cent of the approved cost where the connection is to a public main and
40 per cent where a private source is utilized. Separate legislation provides grants
for these services in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Crops and Grass
The aim of the Government is to see on each farm the most profitable balance
between crop and grass production, with, for the country as a whole, the main¬
tenance of a large arable acreage. Improved varieties and the use of new insecticides
and fungicides contribute to a continued steady improvement in the yield of cereals.
Research at the Grassland Research Station and elsewhere has directly influenced
agricultural practice in the production and use of grass. Improved management of
both permanent grass and temporary grass leys and the more effective utilization of
grass by means of ensilage or drying, together with the extended use of fodder crops,
such as kale, assist the general objective of economy in the use of concentrated
feedingstuffs.
Animal Husbandry
Britain is noted for its exports of pedigree livestock and since the end of the war
there has been a marked recovery of the export trade in livestock of high quality.
Cattle. It is mainly the beef breeds (e.g., Shorthorns, Herefords, Aberdeen
Angus) which have made a reputation overseas, but interest in British dairy stock is
increasing. The rise in milk consumption since 1940 has resulted in concentration
at home on dairy breeds, but in spite of the change-over to milk, many breeds have
maintained the dual-purpose type of qualifications. In Scotland, while milk pro¬
duction has expanded, an even greater increase in numbers of beef cattle has taken
place. Schemes for communal use of sires are in operation, with special schemes in
the Highlands and Islands for the loan of bulls and rams (free of charge) to com¬
munities of smallholders. Cattle-rearing in the United Kingdom is encouraged by
subsidies on calves reared for beef production and on hill cattle. Northern Ireland
sends to Great Britain all fatstock which is surplus to its own requirements.
In order to ensure sound breeding, bulls have to be licensed. Artificial insemination
(AI) centres, which are officially licensed, cover the whole of England and Wales.
One calf in every two now born in England and Wales is the result of AI. Licensed
centres are also operating in Scotland. In Northern Ireland AI is carried out at
centres under the control of the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture.
Under a plan introduced in October 1950 for the eradication of bovine tuber¬
culosis on an area basis, areas containing about 1 -8 million cattle have already been
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
158
cleared. Others are being cleared. At the end of 1954 there were 132,000 attested
herds (over 5 million cattle) in Great Britain. Northern Ireland has had an Attested
Herds Scheme in operation since 1949.
Milk. Milk distributors in Great Britain must be registered and regulations lay
down conditions under which milk is produced, handled, treated, stored and dis¬
tributed. Subject to licence, milk may be sold under special designations—
‘Pasteurized’, ‘Sterilized’, ‘Tuberculin Tested’ and also, in Scotland only,
‘ Certified’.
In areas specified by Orders it is obligatory to retail only specially designated
milk, and milk which is not sold as Tuberculin Tested (or as Certified, in Scotland)
must be heat-treated. Seventy per cent of the population live in specified areas.
Premiums are paid to producers of Tuberculin Tested milk and in respect of
attested herds. An allowance is paid for pasteurizing or sterilizing milk.
In Northern Ireland milk has been paid for on a quality basis since 1934. The
whole of Northern Ireland is now a ‘ safe milk’ area.
Pigs. Boars also have to be licensed. A national pig recording scheme was intro¬
duced in England and Wales in 1954, and five boar progeny testing stations are
being opened in Great Britain.
Poultry. To raise the standard of poultry stock there is a Poultry Stock Improve¬
ment Plan under which breeding stations and hatcheries are accredited and
approved. In December 1954 breeding stock in the Plan amounted to approximately
3-07 million birds in England and Wales. Similar schemes operate in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
Control of Animal Diseases
The Diseases of Animals Act, 1950, gives the Government wide powers for the
control of diseases. This control takes the form of compulsory slaughter (with
payment of compensation) of animals and poultry affected by certain notifiable
diseases (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease, and fowl pest) and the regulation of internal
movements of stock. The Act and the Orders made under it also restrict the import
of livestock and animal products. Research into animal diseases is carried on at
several centres, including one at Pirbright, Surrey, which has the world’s largest
collection of foot-and-mouth disease virus.
Veterinary Services
There is a comprehensive State Veterinary Service which, in Great Britain, is
administered by the Animal Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, and in Northern
Ireland by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture. It consists of a field staff,
research workers, and an investigation service which acts as a link between the field
staff, veterinary surgeons in private practice and the research laboratories. In
Scotland the investigation service is linked with agricultural teaching institutions
and is not part of the Government service.
Improvement of Livestock Rearing Land in Upland Areas
The Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts provide for grants for owners and
occupiers of livestock rearing land in upland areas who wish to put their farms into
sound working order. The object is to encourage the breeding and rearing of store
cattle and store sheep (i.e. cattle and sheep for further fattening, not for immediate
slaughter). Grants are at the rate of 50 per cent of the cost of work done. The total
INDUSTRY
159
amount available for grant in the United Kingdom is £20 million and this can be
increased by £2 million if necessary.
Marginal Production Schemes
Grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost can be given to occupiers of agricultural
land to help them in farming operations which would be temporarily uneconomic
without assistance but which would eventually enable them to increase production.
About £i\million is being provided for this kind of assistance in 1955-56.
In Scotland, the object of these schemes is to increase productivity in upland and
other marginal areas. Grants are available in certain conditions for cropping, direct
re-seeding, regeneration of rough grazings, reclamation of derelict land, erection of
temporary cattle shelters, temporary fencings and the construction of pit silos.
Mechanization
Mechanization has been one of the important causes of the increase in produc¬
tivity of labour on the land in recent years, and one of the aims of the policy of
guarantees to farmers under the Agriculture Act, 1947, was to give them an oppor¬
tunity to invest in capital equipment. Such investment is also encouraged by the tax
allowance on capital investment, which was increased in the 1954 Budget.
The estimated number of tractors (excluding small market-garden types) in the
United Kingdom in 1925 was about 21,000, in 1939 about 55,000, and in 1954 about
400,000. Britain probably has the greatest tractor density in the world, one tractor
per 45 acres of arable land. The increase in some of the newer agricultural machines
has been even more notable; thus it is estimated that about 30,000 combined
harvester-threshers were in use in the 1955 harvest; in 1939 there were only 150.
As so often happens in agriculture the solution of one problem creates another; in a
climate such as Britain’s, the widespread use of these combines gives rise to the
need for grain-drying and grain-storage facilities on a substantial scale. How to
provide these on sound technical and economic lines is a problem which is receiving
the closest attention by the many public and private interests concerned.
Considerable, but as yet not complete, success has attended intensive efforts to
solve the problem of mechanizing the cultivation and harvesting of root crops—
especially potatoes and sugar beet—which make so heavy a seasonal demand on
labour. The problem continues to receive close attention.
Great strides have been made in the development of a wide range of equipment
to assist the production of grass in the various forms—silage, hay and dried grass—
upon which British farm livestock very largely depends.
The National Institute of Agricultural Engineering carries out research, testing
and development work in agricultural engineering, and the Agricultural Machinery
Advisory Committee, representative of the industries and Government Depart¬
ments concerned, advises on requirements and on the supply of machinery and the .
development and production of new machines.
The home agricultural engineering industry in 1939 made goods to the value (ex
works) of no more than £^\ million. In 1954 agricultural machinery output was
valued at £108 million, over half of which represented exports (see also p. 190).
To meet the needs of farmers with insufficient equipment of their own, a sub¬
stantial number of tractors as well as other agricultural machinery is maintained by
County Agricultural Executive Committees in England and Wales and by private
firms of contractors.
RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
Agricultural research in Britain is planned and co-ordinated by the Agricultural
Research Council (see p. 377). This body has hitherto advised the Agricultural
i6o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Departments on scientific matters affecting the Agricultural Research Institutes
(ig in England and Wales, and 8 in Scotland listed in footnote,1 p. 37$)) grant-
aided by them, and itself controls 17 research centres (listed in footnote,2 p. 378).
In May 1955, the Government announced that the Council would in future be
responsible for making grants to the independent research institutions in England
and Wales, but not in Scotland, where this will remain the responsibility of the
Department of Agriculture for Scotland. So far as England and Wales is concerned,
the changed administrative arrangements, incorporated in an Agricultural Research
Bill introduced in November 1955, will be completed by 1st April 1956.
Research and advice are combined in the Provincial Agricultural Economics
Service of England and Wales. The service is attached to the universities and
organized in ten economic advisory centres. In Scotland the Department of Agri¬
culture has a Farm Economics Branch, and agricultural economists are on the staff
of the three Agricultural Colleges. Similar arrangements exist in Northern Ireland.
The Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland has its own research divisions
investigating problems of animal and crop production. The research divisions work
in close touch with the Ministry’s county staffs, and also provide technical advisorv
services for the farmer. A very close link has been forged between the Queen’s
University of Belfast and the research divisions, since certain officers of the latter
are professors and lecture in the University Faculty of Agriculture. Control is also
exercised by the Plant Disease Division in the disinfection of all flax seed sown
in Northern Ireland. A well-equipped Dairy Bacteriology Division keeps a watch¬
ful eye on the maintenance of the hygienic standards laid down for the production
and handling of milk. At Hillsborough, in County Down, the Northern Ireland
Agricultural Research Institute owns and operates a farm of some 500 acres. The
Institute is endowed from public funds, and therefore the officers of the Ministry s
Research Division are afforded facilities for carrying out their field experiments.
Another 500 acres at Hillsborough are devoted to forestry and are controlled by the
Forestry Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture. Thus there is a close integration of
research, education and advisory work in these research divisions.
Eight universities in England and Wales (Cambridge, Durham, Leeds, London,
Oxford, Nottingham, Reading, and the University of Wales), and three in Scotland
(Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen) provide degree courses in agriculture, which
are of particular value for intending research workers, advisory officers, teachers
and other specialists; in Northern Ireland a degree course is provided at Queen’s
University, Belfast. Two-year diploma courses are given at four Agricultural
Colleges and at two of the Farm Institutes in England and Wales; three Agricul¬
tural Colleges in Scotland give two- to three-year diploma courses. These are more
practical than degree courses and are intended mainly for farmers and farm
managers. These courses are also a preparation for the national diplomas in
agriculture, dairying, horticulture and poultry husbandry. In Northern Ireland
there are three Agricultural Colleges. The Ministry of Agriculture maintains a
Horticultural Centre at Loughgall, County Armagh, at which problems of special
interest to Northern Ireland are investigated.
There are 33 Agricultural and Horticultural Institutes in England and Wales run
by local education authorities. They provide courses in general agriculture, dairy¬
ing, poultry, horticulture and poultry husbandry. Courses are usually for one year
of 33 to 40 working weeks. Various short courses are run during the vacations, and
local education authorities provide a wide range of part-time instruction which also
meets the needs of the domestic producer. .
The exchange of information on research in other Commonwealth countries
takes place through the machinery of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux
INDUSTRY
l6l
and Institutes (10 Bureaux and two Institutes in the United Kingdom and one
Institute in Canada, see p. 385).
An important means of voluntary informal education in agriculture is provided
by Young Farmers' Clubs, which flourish in villages and towns throughout the
United Kingdom. There are in all some 1,500 clubs with about 67,000 members,
mostly between the ages of 10 and 25. Each club is self-governing but has the
support of an advisory committee of farmers and others. Clubs are combined in
county federations and in National Federations for England and Wales (founded
in 1932), Scotland (in 1937), and Northern Ireland (in 1929).
The National Federation of Women's Institutes is another important voluntary
organization, with over 8,000 Institutes in villages throughout England and Wales
and some 400,000 members. The aim of the movement is to improve rural
life and amenities, and the Institutes are interested in all subjects of agricultural,
social and cultural significance to country-women. In Scotland and Northern
Ireland, the Women's Rural Institutes have similar aims and interests.
Rural crafts and industries are fostered by the Rural Industries Bureau, founded
in 1921, which is financed almost wholly by grants from the Development Fund
set up under the Development Acts of 1909 and 1910. These Acts gave the Govern¬
ment power to make grants and loans from this Fund for certain specified purposes,
including the promotion of rural industries. The Bureau provides an information
and advisory service which helps country craftsmen in England and Wales to keep
abreast of new developments, while at the same time preserving their ancient skills.
Advice and instruction are given on the commercial as well as the technical aspects
of rural industries. The corresponding body in Scotland is the Scottish Country
Industries Development Trust, founded in 1935.
A Museum of English Rural Life was established by the University of Reading in
1951 as a national centre for the study of material connected with the history of the
countryside. It was opened to the public in April 1955.
A large number of Agricultural Shows held annually throughout Britain focus
the interest of farmers in modern practices and equipment. The chief ones are the
Royal Show, held since 1839 by the Royal Agricultural Society of England; the
Royal Highland Show, held since 1822 by the Royal Highland and Agricultural
Society; the Royal Ulster Show, held by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society;
and the Royal Welsh Show, held by the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society.
FISHERIES
Britain’s fishing industry falls into two main divisions: demersal and pelagic.1
There are also fisheries for oysters, cockles, mussels and whelks from the Thames
Estuary to the Wash, and on the Cornish and South Wales coasts; for lobsters and
crabs off the Scottish coasts and off the north-east, east and south coasts of England;
and for shrimps in the Wash, East Anglia, the Thames Estuary, and Morecambe
Bay on the north-west coast of England.
There were 26,244 fishermen regularly employed in Great Britain at the end of
1954. The landed weight of British-caught wet fish amounted to nearly 18,000 tons
per week; consumption of fresh, frozen and cured fish in Great Britain amounted
to about 16,510 tons landed weight per week.
1 Demersal fish (white fish) live on or near the sea-bed (e.g., cod, haddock, plaice,
whiting, turbot, and sole). Pelagic fish live in the intermediate waters or near the surface
(e.g., herring, pilchard, mackerel, and sprats).
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
l62
In Northern Ireland there were 650 regular fishermen and the landed weight of
British-caught fish was 129 tons per week. Northern Ireland consumes about one-
third of its own catches and exports the rest to Great Britain and to the Republic
of Ireland.
Fishing Ports and Markets
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Grimsby, Hull, Fleetwood,
Milford Haven and Lowestoft for white fish, and Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft
for herring; in Scotland the chief centres are Aberdeen and Granton for white fish,
which are caught all round the coast and particularly in the Moray Firth, and for
herring Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Shetland, Stornoway, the West Coast and the
Clyde; those in Northern Ireland are Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel.
London is the principal wholesale distributing centre and Billingsgate Fish
Market handles an average of 600 tons a day.
Sea Fishing
The chief means of catching fish are by the use of nets—trawl, seine, drift and
ring—and by lining. Trawling is carried on in distant, middle and near waters for
demersal fish throughout the year, and seasonally for herring. The deep-sea trawler
fleet comprised 952 vessels at the end of 1954. Seining is chiefly used on the nearer
grounds, the principal catches being haddock, cod, whiting and plaice; 594 Scottish
and 60 Northern Ireland vessels engage in seine net fishing during most of the year,
while from Grimsby, Fleetwood and Whitehaven 72 such vessels are in regular
operation.
Drift nets are mainly used for herring and pilchard by 407 steam and motor
drifters; ring netting, a method of catching herring, is used seasonally in certain
districts by about 145 motor-boats. Long lining on grounds too rough for trawling
is carried on by a limited number of vessels (mainly Scottish), while small and hand
lining still provide employment for a large number of crews in autumn, winter and
early spring; cod, whiting and mackerel are caught.
The quantity and value of fish landed in the United Kingdom during the year
ended 31st December 1954 were as follows:
Wet Fish (demersal and pelagic)
Great Britain: 931,919 tons valued at £43>246,692
Northern Ireland: 6,712 tons valued at £154,850
Shell Fish
Great Britain: value £1,310,065
Northern Ireland: value £16,476.
Exports of fish from the United Kingdom—fresh, frozen, cured or canned—in
1954 were valued at £5,889,918.
Freshwater Fisheries
The principal commercial freshwater catches are salmon, grilse, sea-trout and
eels. In Scotland and Northern Ireland fixed nets along the coast and sweep nets
in rivers and estuaries are used; in England drift nets are used for catching salmon
in the sea. In England and Wales the value of the salmon catch is approximately
£250,000 a year, in Scotland it amounts to about £1 million, and in Northern
Ireland to some £200,000. In Northern Ireland eels are captured by long lines
and by eel nets placed in river weirs.
Sporting fishing is by rod and line in lakes, lochs, rivers and streams. Salmon,
grilse and sea-trout are the most important species, and the fishing rights command
INDUSTRY
163
high rentals. There are also extensive fishings for brown trout. Other freshwater
fish taken, particularly in England, are roach, rudd, perch and dace. Fishing for
freshwater fish other than salmon and trout is of minor importance and figures of
catches are not available.
Promotion and Regulation of the Industry
Laws in Britain relating to fisheries and fish are principally directed to the follow¬
ing purposes: (a) protection of supply by measures against over-fishing, e.g., the
Sea Fisheries Regulation Acts, 1888 to i93°> and the Sea Fishing Industry Acts,
1933 to 1938; (b) promotion of the prosperity of the industry, e.g., the Herring
Industry Acts, 1935 to 1953, the White Fish Industry Acts, 1951 to 1953, and the
Fisheries Act, 1955 ; (c) protection of the quality of the product, e.g., the Food and
Drugs Act, 1938. The Government Departments mainly responsible for the admini¬
stration of laws in the first two categories and for the general sponsorship of
fisheries are the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Home
Department, and the Ministry of Commerce for Northern Ireland; the Ministry
of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland are concerned with questions
of nutrition and hygiene affecting fish and fish products. The safety and welfare of
crews of fishing vessels are provided for under the Merchant Shipping Acts, which
are administered by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.
The authorities concerned with fisheries research are the Ministry of Agricul¬
ture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Home Department and the Development
Commissioners (see p. 381).
Two statutory authorities exist to regulate and develop Britain’s fishing industry:
the Herring Industry Board and the White Fish Authority.
The Herring Industry Board
rl he Herring Industry Board was set up under the Herring Industry Act of 1935,
to reorganize, develop and regulate the herring industry; subsequent amending
Acts have also been passed. The Board is financed partly by Government grants
and loans and partly by levies and licence fees. It consists of a chairman and tw o
other members, all part-time and independent of the industry, who are appointed
jointly by the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food and the Secretary of State for the Home Department. The Board pro¬
motes sales of herring both at home and abroad, encourages and carries out schemes
of research and experiment into methods of fishing and processing, makes grants
and loans for the acquisition of new boats and engines, and loans for the purchase
of nets and gear, for the provision of processing plants, and for the reconditioning
of existing boats, and exercises a measure of control over the industry by means of
rules, directions and licensing. It operates a scheme for the reduction of herring to
oil and meal, using its own and commercial processing plants. In August 1951 the
Board was given powers to participate in the industry, including fishing for herring,
and purchasing, processing and selling herring; such powers, however, are to be
used only to secure proper provision for the needs of the industry and after consul¬
tation with the interests concerned. The Board is assisted by the Herring Industry
Advisory Council, representing various sections of the industry and consumers, and
by local officers who work at the ports during the fishing season, and who on
occasion act as port arbiters in disputes regarding herring sales. Sectional commit¬
tees may be set up to advise the Board on matters affecting a particular section of
the industry.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
164
The White Fish Authority
The White Fish Authority was set up by the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951. to
reorganize, develop and regulate the white fish industry. The Authority is financed
partly by Government grants and loans and partly by a levy on first-hand sales and
by registration fees. It is composed of five independent members, appointed jointly
by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Secretary of State for the Home Department, working in con¬
sultation with the industry and consumers through the White Fish Industry Advi¬
sory Council. The Authority has powers, similar to those of the Herring Board,
to carry on research and experiment, to encourage the formation and development
of voluntary arrangements in the industry on a co-operative basis, to promote
exports, to make grants and loans for the acquisition of new boats and engines,
and loans for the purchase of nets and gear for the provision and reconditioning
of processing plants and for the reconditioning of existing boats. Certain of the
Authority’s functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland have been delegated to a
committee consisting of Scottish and Northern Irish members.
Whaling
Whaling is mainly conducted by expeditions, each consisting of a large floating
factory ship accompanied by its attendant whale catchers and tankers, which annually
cover large areas of the Antarctic Ocean. It is regulated by the International Whaling
Commission, set up under the International Whaling Convention of 194b, which
controls the dates of the season and sets a limit on the catch of whales. The offices
of the Commission are in London.
The United Kingdom is the second most important country (after Norway) en¬
gaged in whaling, sending three expeditions to the Antarctic each year. In addition
whaling is also undertaken from a land station on South Georgia, a British island
in the South Atlantic. The value of the whale oil (the most important product)
obtained by the British expeditions in the i954-55 season amounted to nearly
£7 million.
FORESTRY
The greater part of Britain’s timber requirements is met by imports, valued in
1954 at £155 million. The Government is, however, devoting continuous effort
through the Forestry Commission to the long-term task of increasing the country s
timber resources which, over the centuries, and particularly as a result of overfelling
in the two world wars, have been seriously depleted.
Forest Areas
The last census of woodlands (1947-49) disclosed that the total area of woodland
in Great Britain amounted to nearly 3^ million acres,1 or 6-5 per cent of the land
surface. Of the total, 54 per cent lay in England, 37 per cent in Scotland, and 9 per
cent in Wales. The greatest density of woodland in Great Britain is m the north
and east of Scotland—for example, Moray had 21 -6 per cent of its land area under
woodland and Nairn had 19-1 per cent. Another region of high density lies in the
south-east of England—Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Kent and Berkshire. Mon¬
mouthshire, on the Welsh border, had 10-7 per cent of its land area under woodland.
1 This total—3,448,362 acres—excludes woods of under 5 acres which were estimated
at 187,000 acres.

trees of various ages.
Of the broadleaved species the commonest tree is the oak (24 per cent of all
species); with beech, ash, birch and sycamore following in that order. Of the coni¬
ferous species Scots pine is the most common (20 per cent of all species), but
Norway and Sitka spruces are plentiful, particularly in Wales.
Volume of Timber
Practically the whole volume of timber over 3 inches in diameter comes from the
High Forest and Coppice with Standards types. On this basis the census indicated
that in 1949 the timber volume of Great Britain’s woodlands amounted to some
2,650 million cubic feet, estimated to be made up of approximately 1,550 million
cubic feet of hardwood and 1,100 million cubic feet of softwood. The total annual
growth of timber was estimated at approximately 97 million cubic feet.
Ownership of Woodlands
The 1947-49 Census showed that 82 per cent of all woodlands in Great Britain
was owned by private individuals or by limited companies, trusts, corporations,
local authorities or Government departments other than the Forestry Commission.
The remaining 18 per cent was under the management of the Forestry Commission.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Forestry Commission
The Forestry Commission was established under the Forestry Acts, 1919-47, to
promote the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the produc¬
tion and supply of timber in the United Kingdom. From 1922, however, the
Forestry Commission’s authority related only to Great Britain, as the Northern
Ireland Ministry of Agriculture became the forest authority for Northern Ireland
(see p. 167). The Forestry Act, 1945, made the Minister of Agriculture and
Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland jointly responsible for forest
policy in Great Britain, but the Forestry Commission continued to carry out
forestry operations, research and training of foresters. The Forestry Act, I951,
placed on the Forestry Commissioners responsibility for the maintenance of an
adequate reserve of growing trees in Great Britain and gave them powers to
regulate the felling of trees by the issue of licences.
During the years 1919-541 the Forestry Commission acquired 2,038,100 acres
of land through the Forestry Fund (see p. 167), under the Forestry (Transfer of
Woods) Act, 1923, and by gifts. This total comprises 1,254,100 acres classified as
‘forest land’, which is either planted or will be planted in due course, and 784,000
acres of ‘other land’ which includes forest nurseries, rough grazing, agricultural
land and land unsuitable for planting on account of soil conditions and locality. The
total number of Commission forests in Great Britain at 3°th September 1954 was
479 of which 199 were in England, 201 in Scotland and 79 in Wales.
Policy
Great Britain’s forest policy, laid down in the various Acts, is to extend State and
private operations so as to establish, over 50 years, 5 million acres of well-managed
woodlands, made up of 3 million acres of new planting by the Commission and the
replanting by the Commission and private owners of 2 million acres of existing
woodland. The annual yield from these 5 million acres should be about 35 per cent
of the national timber requirements.
The restoration of privately owned woodlands is being assisted by the Dedication
Scheme and other schemes under which grants are paid. The Dedication Scheme
was initiated by the Forestry Act, 1947, and under it owners are invited to put their
land permanently to timber production and to manage their woods in accordance
with a plan agreed with the Forestry Commission. In addition to financial grants,
free technical advice is provided by the Commission.
Forestry Education and Research
The Commission maintains five Forester Training Schools: in England, at
Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, and at Lynford Hall, nea.r Thetford
in Norfolk; in Wales, at Bettws-y-Coed in Caernarvonshire; and in Scotland at
Benmore, Argyllshire, and Faskally, near Pitlochry in Perthshire. Northerwood
House, the Commission’s educational centre in the New Forest, Hampshire, is used
for practical courses for university students, landowners and agents, planning
officers, school teachers and others connected with forestry.
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities, suitable graduates
being recruited by the Commission as forest officers.
In 1946 Alice Holt Lodge, Famham, Surrey, was opened by the Commission as
a forest research station. Grants are made for research on special forestry problems
of a fundamental scientific nature to be carried out by universities and other institu¬
tions qualified to undertake such work. Expenditure on research and experiment in
1954 amounted to £222,000.

Finance
The Forestry Fund was established in 1919 and from it is paid all the expenditure
of the Forestry Commissioners. The fund is replenished by sums voted annually by
Parliament, receipts from forest produce, rentals and other sources. From 1920 to
I9S4 parliamentary votes totalled £62,436,800 and receipts £20,537,001. Payments
were £82,776,691.
National Forest Parks
The Forestry Commission has opened to the public eight National Forest Parks:
Argyll, Glentrool, Glenmore, and Loch Ard (renamed the Queen Elizabeth Forest
Park to commemorate the Coronation) in Scotland; Hardknott and Forest of Dean
in England; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park (adjoining the North¬
umberland National Park to the westward), which was declared in September 1955
and includes forests on the borders of Northumberland and Cumberland in Eng¬
land and of Roxburghshire in Scotland. The total area of the first seven forest
parks is 290,000 acres; the Border Forest Park covers about 100,000 acres. The forest
parks include planted areas and unplantable moorland and mountains. Camping
facilities are provided inmost of the parks, and the number of overnight stays at the
camping grounds was 75,000 in 1954.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
When the Government of Northern Ireland was formed in 1922, the new Ministry
of Agriculture became the forest authority working with similar powers and duties
to those conferred on the Forestry Commission by the Forestry Act, 1919. At that
time the Ministry took over some 4,000 acres for afforestation of which 700 acres
had been planted by the Forestry Commission.
The State forest area has grown steadily and at a greatly accelerated pace since
the end of the second world war. By 31st March 1955 some 70,000 acres had been
acquired of which nearly 40,000 acres had been planted. The present afforestation
programme provides for the creation within the next fifty years of an area of 150,000
acres of productive State forest with a sustained yield roughly equal to the present
yearly consumption of timber in Northern Ireland, i.e. some 30,000 Standards.
To fulfil this programme, a minimum annual planting rate of 2,500 acres has been
set.
The authority for implementing the State forest policy is the Forestry Act
(Northern Ireland), 1953, which has replaced earlier legislation. This Act provides
the Ministry with powers to acquire and manage land, and to provide financial and
technical assistance for private planting, and it introduces measures for the protec¬
tion of all woodlands, whether State or privately owned, against destruction by
over-cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and receipts
from forest produce, rentals and other sources. From 1922 to 1954 expenditure
totalled £2,120,000 and receipts were £830,000. Output and employment are
growing steadily. The area of exploitable private woodlands is at present some
20,000 acres, and private planting, which is gaining impetus, is assisted by schemes
for the supply of young trees at low cost from the Ministry’s nurseries, by grants
towards the cost of the establishment of new plantations, and by free technical
advice.
Northern Ireland Forest Park
In May 1955 Northern Ireland’s first forest park at Tollymore Park, Newcastle,
County Down, was opened to the public. Situated at the foot of the Mourne
M

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Mountains it covers an area of 1,200 acres. It contains an arboretum, comprising a
wide variety of native and exotic trees, and is rich in mountain, river and parkland
scenery. Caravan facilities and a camping site for youth organizations are available.
FUEL AND POWER
The main primary sources of the fuel and power used in Great Britain are coal,
petroleum, and water power, while the major secondary sources are electricity
(including hydro-electricity) and coal gas. Inland coal requirements are substan¬
tially met from within the country, but rising home demands have made it necessary
to reduce exports.
Nearly all petroleum is imported (most of it as crude oil) and refined within the
country, only a little being produced from coal, shale and local oil wells. The fuel
and power industries, with the exception of the petroleum industry and coal distri¬
bution, are mainly under public ownership.
The Government’s fuel and power policy has broadly three objectives: to obtain
more coal; to use the coal better; and to supplement supplies of coal with other
sources of energy—atomic energy as soon as possible, natural gas if it can be found
and oil forthwith.
The Government also aims to reduce air pollution, and a Clean Air Bill received
its second reading in November 1955- The Bill empowers local authorities, subject
to the approval of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, to declare
‘ smoke control areas ’, in which the emission of smoke from chimneys will constitute
an offence.
COAL
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organized coalmining
industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years longer than in any
other European country. British coal exports dominated the world coal market until
about 1910. By 1913—the peak production year—the industry was producing 287
million tons of coal, exporting 94 million tons and employing 1,107,000 workers.
The very- fact that the British coalmining industry was developed so early has
meant that many of the best seams of coal are now worked out; every year coal
has to be mined from deeper and thinner seams and there is a constant struggle to
maintain productivity at its present level.
The industry declined during the first world war owing to a shortage of man¬
power and to the shortage of plant and materials necessary for undertaking any
mechanical improvement. Moreover, alternative sources of energy and lower prices
in continental countries led to a later decline in exports, which had fallen to 67
million tons in 1925.
Attempts at securing economies through amalgamation date from the Sankey
Commission of 1919. In 1930 a Coal Mines Act established commissioners to bring
about the formation of larger and more efficient units. The Coal Act of 1938 trans¬
ferred ownership of the mineral coal to the State and made it the statutory respon¬
sibility of a Coal Commission to accelerate the integration of the industry by still
further reducing the number of separate undertakings. At the outbreak of the second
world war in 1939, however, this process was not far advanced.
Organization under Public Ownership
In 1942 the Government assumed full control of the industry s operations,
though the colliery undertakings continued to own the coal mines. In May 1946
INDUSTRY 169
the Coal Industry Nationalization Act received the Royal Assent. On 1st January
1947 the assets of the industry were vested in the National Coal Board, which was
appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power and became responsible for the
industry s management. Under the Act, the Board consisted of a chairman and
eight other members, but this provision was amended by the Coal Industry Act,
I949» and the Board now consists of a chairman and not fewer than eight or more
than 11 other members; the number of full-time members must not exceed eight
and there must be one, and may be two, deputy chairmen.
The Board’s main duties are:
(1) to work and get the coal in Great Britain to the exclusion of any other
person;
(2) to secure the efficient development of the coalmining industry; and
(3) to make supplies of coal available of such qualities and sizes and in such
quantities and at such prices as may seem to it best calculated to further
the public interest.
The Board is also charged with securing the safety, health and welfare of its
employees and the benefit of their practical knowledge and experience. The Board’s
policies must also be directed to ensure that its revenues shall be not less than its
outgoings properly chargeable to revenue account and taking one year with another.
There are minor exceptions to the Board’s exclusive monopoly to work coal in
Britain: for example, it may license private enterprise to work small mines in which
the number of underground workers does not greatly exceed 30. Production on
opencast sites, which had been the responsibility of the Ministry of Fuel and
Power, was transferred to the Board on 1st April 1952.
The Board is responsible for its own regional organization. The collieries, num¬
bering about 900, are grouped into 50 Areas which are the basic units for commer¬
cial management. The size of the Areas varies according to geological, geographical
and other technical considerations. The Areas are grouped into nine Divisions
which roughly correspond to the main coal-bearing regions (see p. 170). A Divi¬
sional Board for each Division supervises and co-ordinates the work of the Areas
within the Division, formulates divisional policy, and is answerable to the National
Coal Board, which is responsible for questions of national policy, finance and the
co-ordinating of major schemes of development. The day-to-day work of running
the collieries is under the direction of colliery managers.
Two Coal Consumers’ Councils have been set up under the 1946 Act: the
Industrial Coal Consumers' Council, members of which represent consumers, mer¬
chants and suppliers of coal, coke and manufactured fuel for industrial and other
purposes, involving supply in bulk; and the Domestic Coal Consumers' Council,
members of which represent similar groups concerned with coal for domestic use.
The most important function of the Councils, which are responsible to the Minister
of Fuel and Power, is the general consideration of the commercial arrangements and
activities of the National Coal Board, to ensure that the monopoly in the industry
set up by the 1946 Act shall have the maximum practical regard for consumers’
interests.
The Coal Industry Nationalization Act requires the National Coal Board to pub¬
lish an annual report and statement of accounts which are laid before Parliament.
At the end of 1947 (its first year) the National Coal Board showed a deficit of
£23-3 million, after paying compensation to the former mineowners and interest
on borrowed capital. In 1948, 1949 and 1950 there were surpluses of £1 -7 million,
£9-5 million and £8-3 million respectively. There were deficits of £1 -8 million and
£8-2 million in 1951 and 1952, a surplus of £0-4 million in 1953 and a deficit of
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
170
£3-8 million in 1954, the accumulated deficit since vesting day to the end of 1954
being £17‘4 million.
The National Coal Board raises capital by long-term borrowing direct from the
Exchequer, instead of through the issue of stock. There is a statutory limit of £300
million at present on such borrowing and special authorization is needed for borrow¬
ing over £40 million in any one year.
Production
It has been estimated that Britain has workable reserves of coal of 43,000 million
tons, more than enough at current rates of consumption to last for 200 years. But
certain types such as high quality coking coal will be exhausted long before then
unless they are eked out by blending with other types of coal.
The main coal-bearing areas are: (1) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottingham¬
shire field which produces about 40 per cent of the total output, (2) the Durham
and Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and (4) the Scottish field.
Other important coal-bearing areas are those of Lancashire and the West Midlands
(Staffordshire and Warwickshire). There are no coal-bearing areas in Northern
Ireland.
In the years immediately after nationalization the National Coal Board was able
to secure quick increases in production and productivity by applying an accumula¬
tion of ideas which had been neglected during two world wars and the years
of depression between the wars. As a result, deepmined production increased from
187-2 million tons in 1947 to 211 -9 million tons in 1951 despite a fall of over 12,000
in average manpower. Productivity overall increased from 1 -074 tons per manshift
to 1-2io tons per manshift. By 1951 this process had been carried almost to its
limits: by 1954 there had been only a slight further rise in production (to 214
million tons); that the rise was not larger was, however, partly due to the grant of
a second week’s paid holiday to miners in 1953. Future progress depends on the
development of machines for power-loading the coal at the face on to the face
conveyor belt (see p. 171), and on the reorganization of the haulage systems by
carrying out major reconstructions. The National Coal Board has launched a large
programme of major reconstruction and new sinkings, but no substantial benefits
will accrue before 1957.
Since the war the coal industry has suffered from a shortage of manpower. In
1954 manpower averaged 707,200—about 15,000 fewer than the industry needs.
Production of coal from opencast sites in 1954 was 10-i million tons of saleable
output, bringing the total production in 1954 to 224 million tons.
Labour Relations
Negotiations on wages and conditions of service are conducted through a Joint
National Negotiating Committee, consisting of 16 members appointed by the
National Coal Board and not more than 16 members of the National Union of
Mineworkers. Disputed issues are referred to a National Reference Tribunal
consisting of three permanent independent members and four assessors without
voting rights, two representing labour and two management. There are also
District Joint Negotiating Committees which deal with the application of national
agreements, settle any difficulties and differences that may arise at district level and
refer unresolved differences to the national committee.
The Coal Industry Nationalization Act requires the Board to enter into joint
consultation with its employees to discuss such matters as production, safety,
health and welfare. At almost every colliery there is a Consultative Committee in
which the workmen’s representatives are elected by secret ballot. The colliery
INDUSTRY
I7I
manager is chairman, and he nominates three colliery officials to be on the com¬
mittee. There are also Consultative Councils at the area, divisional and national levels
on which the Board and the four parties representing the people employed in the
industry the National Association of Colliery Managers, the British Association
of Colliery Management, the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies
and Shot-firers, and the National Union of Mineworkers—are represented.
Safety and Health
The safety and health of miners is the subject of comprehensive legislation, which
was consolidated and brought up to date by the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954 (see
p. 270). Responsibility for the enforcement of safety regulations lies with the Mines
and Quarries Inspectorate of the Ministry of Fuel and Power.
The National Coal Board has its own safety organization and, in accordance with the
Nationalization Act, follows a policy directed towards securing the safety, health and
welfare of its employees; examples of recent major advances in safety resulting from
voluntary action by the Board are the installation of fire-resistant conveyor belts,
the replacement of light alloy supports (which had been found to be liable to pro¬
duce dangerous sparks) and the widespread introduction of courses of training for
various classes of officials and workmen. The Board has also continued to strengthen
the medical services which existed before nationalization. Chief Divisional and Area
Medical Officers have been appointed and doctors have been appointed to large
collieries and groups of collieries. Medical centres are being set up at the pit-head.
Research into problems of safety and health is carried out at the Ministry of Fuel
and Power’s Safety in Mines Research Establishment, which maintains a close
liaison with the Mines Inspectorate and the National Coal Board’s research
organization.
Development and Research
Contraction and curtailment of development in the industry since the peak year,
1913, had led to a position in which less than one-third of current output was
coming from pits started in the twentieth century. Large-scale development was
therefore essential.
In 1950 the National Coal Board announced its long-term plan of development
for the industry involving the reorganization and increased mechanization of exist¬
ing mines and the sinking of new ones. The plan envisaged a capital investment of
£635 million at 1949 prices between 1950 and 1965, when it was estimated that the
annual output of coal would have risen to about 240 million tons. The plan was not
a rigid blueprint, room being left for modifications in the light of changing circum¬
stances and new knowledge. The plan was reviewed in 1954 and it was estimated
that a higher annual output, of about 250 million tons, would be needed by 1965.
Actual capital expenditure in the years 1950-54 was £258 million at current prices.
When the programme is completed, four-fifths of Britain’s coal will be coming
from virtually new mines.
The mechanical cutting and conveying of coal are now the general practice: in
I954> 85 per cent of total deepmined output was mechanically cut and 91 per cent
was mechanically conveyed. The loading of coal at the working face offers, at pre¬
sent, the next most important possibility for increased coalface mechanization. In
I9S4, !6 million tons were power loaded by nearly 400 machines, compared with
13 million tons in 1953 and 5 million tons in 1947.
In 1947 the National Coal Board took over, with other assets, the Coal Survey,
a national organization for surveying coal resources within Britain, and 70 labora¬
tories in the various coalfields, which it has since extended and modernized.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
172
In 1948 the Board established a central research organization at Stoke Orchard,
near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, to provide facilities for fundamental research in
the coalmining industry, as distinct from the day-to-day scientific control exercised
by the divisional and area scientific organization. A second central research organiza¬
tion for the investigation of underground problems was formed in 1952 by the
Board at Isleworth, Middlesex, and a Central Engineering Establishment is being
built near Bretby in Derbyshire for developing new machines and equipment.
The Board also subscribes to a number of autonomous research associations in
receipt of grants from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR,
see p. 375), including the British Coal Utilization Research Association, the British
Coke Research Association and the Coal Tar Research Association. In addition
much of the work of other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research Establish¬
ment of the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the Fuel Research Station of DSIR,
is closely related to the Board’s problems.
PETROLEUM
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young, a
Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from natural
mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish shale deposits,
yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858.
Indigenous Production
Sources of crude oil within Britain (including shale oil) supply altogether less
than one per cent of total United Kingdom requirements, the remainder being
imported from overseas.
Current output of shale oil is drawn from 11 shale mines and two opencast
quarries, retorted in four crude oil works, and the crude products are refined in a
central refinery at Pumpherston, near Edinburgh. Output of shale reached a peak
of 3-4 million tons in 1913, but the cost of the processes and other economic diffi¬
culties led to a reduction of output. This at present averages 1 -4 million tons a year,
yielding in 1954 some 99,600 tons of crude shale oil. From the latter some 78,800
tons of refined products were obtained. In 1954 some 108,200 tons of motor and
aviation spirit were obtained from coal by hydrogenation, and 198,000 tons of
refined benzole from coke ovens and gas works. Prospecting for crude petroleum
has so far led to the establishment of two oilfields in Nottinghamshire (small
amounts of oil were found in further borings at Plungar in Leicestershire in 1953),
one in Lancashire and one very small field in Scotland. Production of crude oil in
1954 was 59,100 tons.
International Trade
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the Middle
East, Far East and Caribbean areas.
Today they produce one-third of all oil entering into international trade, with a
tanker fleet (part-owned by them and part on charter) amounting to nearly one-
third of the world’s tanker tonnage. (United Kingdom registered tanker tonnage is
nearly one-fifth of the world’s total.)
Consumption
Consumption of petroleum products in the United Kingdom has risen from
almost one million tons in 1900 (mostly kerosene for lamps, and lubricants) to over
21 million tons in 1954 (predominantly gas, diesel and fuel oils and motor spirit).
INDUSTRY
173
Refineries
Up to 1939 three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum products
was refined overseas, in accordance with the view, commonly held in the world oil
industry at that time, that it was more economical to refine at the source of produc¬
tion. Since the second world war, however, the industry has come to favour the
siting of refineries in the consuming areas. In this it has had Govermnent support,
both because of the need to save foreign exchange and because of the extra employ¬
ment and other advantages to the economy resulting from the new development.
The expansion programme in the United Kingdom carried out by the major oil
companies was a substantial one, costing over the years 1947 to 1954 very nearly
£200 million.
At the end of 1954 refinery capacity in the United Kingdom amounted to almost
29 million tons per annum; actual production of refined products rose from about
5 million tons in 1948-49 to 25 -6 million tons in 1954. Exports of refined products
became possible, and their value reached over million in 1954, while in the
same year imports of refined products were valued at £87 million compared with
£141 million in 1951.
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
Public supply of electricity was first provided at Godaiming, Surrey, in 1881,
though there were earlier demonstrations of its use to consumers such as the
former Metropolitan Board of Works in the lighting of the Thames Embankment.
From the earliest days a measure of public control has been a feature of the industry,
and the Electric Lighting Act of 1882 authorized the Board of Trade to grant
licences for the establishment of electricity undertakings by local authorities or by
companies (which the local authorities might compulsorily purchase after a given
period of time) to supply consumers in given areas. By the turn of the century
technical developments, including the introduction of the electric motor as a source
of motive power, had led to a large increase in the scale of distribution of electricity,
and a variety of independent supply systems had grown up all over the country.
It was not until after the first world war that steps were taken to reorganize the
industry on a national scale in order to realize the benefits of concentration, inte¬
gration and standardization in electricity supply. In 1919 the Electricity Com¬
missioners were set up as a supervisory body and to promote reorganization through
voluntary agreement. Then in 1926 the Central Electricity Board was established
to co-ordinate more efficiently the generation of electricity. Its main duties were to
concentrate the output of electricity in certain stations, selected for their efficiency
and low operating costs and to connect these selected stations with one another and
to local distribution undertakings by means of a national system of main trans¬
mission lines, known as the Grid. Thenceforward steady progress was made in
putting this plan into effect and, by March 1948, 143 selected stations, out of some
300, were supplying 95 per cent of the electricity generated for public supply.
Organization under Public Ownership
With the exception of a few small non-statutory undertakings accounting for less
than one per cent of the electricity consumption, the public supply of electricity in
Great Britain is now exclusively in the hands of public corporations: in England
and Wales the Central Electricity Authority is responsible for generation and
12 Area Boards for distribution; and in Scotland the North of Scotland Hydro-
Electric Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board are each responsible for
generation and distribution in their respective areas. In Northern Ireland, elec¬
tricity is supplied by two municipal undertakings and one public board.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
174
Under the Electricity Act of 1947, a central authority, then known as the British
Electricity Authority, and 14 Area Electricity Boards, took over in April 1948 the
assets of former municipal and private electricity supply undertakings throughout
Great Britain, except in the area already served by the North of Scotland Hydro-
Electric Board (see below). Under the Electricity Reorganization (Scotland) Act of
1954 the Authority’s functions in Scotland were taken over on 1st April 1955 by the
South of Scotland Electricity Board (see below) and the name of the Authority was
changed from British Electricity Authority to Central Electricity Authority.
In March 1955 there were 199,400 persons employed in electricity supply in
Great Britain, of whom 23,500 were women.
England and Wales
The Central Electricity Authority is appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power
and consists of a chairman, two deputy chairmen, and six to eight part-time
members. The Authority is responsible to the Minister for the general policy of the
whole electricity supply industry in England and Wales. Its main function is to
develop and maintain an efficient co-ordinated and economical system of electricity
supply and it is responsible for the generation and bulk supply of electricity to the
Area Boards.
The Area Boards (of which there are at present 12) are responsible for the distri¬
bution of electricity in England and Wales. Each consists of a full-time chairman
and deputy chairman and four to six part-time members, appointed, like the
members of the Central Authority, by the Minister of Fuel and Power.
Area Consultative Councils have been set up in the area of each Area Board to
represent the interests of consumers. They each consist of between 20 and 30
members, of whom between 50 and 60 per cent are nominated by local authority
associations. The chairman of each Area Consultative Council is an ex-officio
member of the corresponding Area Board. There are also Consultative Councils for
each of the districts of the two Scottish Electricity Boards and the chairman of each
is a member of the respective Board.
As an administrative arrangement for the local management and operation of
power stations and the Grid (see p. 178), the Authority has established Generation
Divisions, of which, at present, there are eleven. The areas they cover correspond
in general with those of the Area Boards, except in north-west England and North
Wales where one Generation Division coincides with the territory of two Area Boards.
Finance. The Central Authority and Area Boards taken together have made a
consolidated net surplus on their operations in each of the years since they were
established. Up to and including the financial year 1954-55. these surpluses
amounted in the aggregate to over £60 million.
Labour Relations. Under the Electricity Act, 1947. the Central Authority is
required to devise a satisfactory procedure for collective bargaining and joint con¬
sultation with its employees. In each of the three main groups of workers (admini¬
strative, technical, and manual), there is a separate National Joint Industrial Council
or Board, which negotiates terms and conditions of employment. A National Joint
Advisory' Council drawn from management and employees has been set up to
discuss questions of health, welfare and safety of all groups of employees. There are
also separate district councils and local works and advisory committees forming part
of the negotiating and conciliatory machinery.
INDUSTRY
175
Scotland
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was set up in 1943 as a non-profit-
making body to develop the water-power resources of the Highlands and Islands
and to distribute electricity in the more sparsely populated parts of Scotland not
covered by existing undertakings. It is a non-functional board, consisting of a
chairman, deputy chairman and not fewer than three nor more than seven other
members, who are all part-time members without departmental responsibilities,
appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The Act of 1947 made the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board solely respon¬
sible to the Secretary of State for Scotland for all generation and distribution in its
area. This area was extended under the Act to include that part of Scotland north
and west of a line running roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to a
point just north of Newburgh on the Firth of Tay. In the rest of Scotland, the
Central Authority, then known as the British Electricity Authority, together with
the South-East and South-West Scotland Electricity Boards, was responsible to the
Minister of Fuel and Power in all electricity matters.
On 1 st April 1955, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, answerable to the
Secretary of State for Scotland, took over the Central Authority’s functions in
Scotland, and also the functions of the two Scottish Area Boards, which were
dissolved. The Board consists of a chairman, deputy chairman, two full-time and
five part-time members. Under the Electricity Reorganization (Scotland) Act, 1954,
the Minister of Fuel and Power retained only three functions in regard to electricity
in Scotland, namely, to act jointly with the Secretary of State in regard to staff
pensions and safety measures, and to remain solely responsible for the certification
of meters.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the bulk of electricity is acquired by the Northern Ireland
Joint Electricity Committee set up by statute in 1948, for sale to statutory distribu¬
tion undertakings. Of these the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland distributes
electricity throughout the country with the exception of the cities of Belfast and
Londonderry, where it is carried out by municipal undertakings.
Generation
Almost the whole of Britain’s electricity is produced in coal-fired steam genera¬
ting stations. Abundant supplies of coal together with good rail and water transport
for moving it, in contrast with the remote and scattered location of relatively small
water-power resources, led to this preponderant development of electricity supplies
from thermal generating stations. The development of hydro-electricity on any
scale is comparatively recent.
The setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in 1943 marked
the beginning of a new era of intensive water-power development in the Highlands
of Scotland. A development scheme drawn up by the Board in 1944, showing the
water-power resources which it proposed to examine, listed 102 hydro-electric
projects with an estimated annual output of 6,274 million units of electricity. The
ultimate output of Highland hydro-electric power is expected to be substantially
higher and eventually may exceed 10,000 million units. In 1954, 1,184 million units
were generated from this source compared with 322 million in 1949.
In 1954, 70,993 million units (one unit=one kilowatt-hour), or 96-8 per cent of
the public supply in Great Britain, was generated at steam stations, 2,237 million
units, or 3 -o per cent, from water power, and 143 million units by other means, e.g.,
diesel and waste heat and refuse destruction. The high rate of expansion of output,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
176
which has been a feature of the industry since its earliest years, has been continued
since the war. Total production in 1954 showed an increase of 17-8 per cent over
1952, and of nearly 96-8 per cent over 1945.
Generating capacity of the public supply industry (including hydro-electricity) in
Great Britain as a whole at the end of 1954 totalled 20,650 megawatts (maximum
continuous rating) compared with 12,546 megawatts at the end of 1946. The
Central Electricity Authority is planning a large-scale programme of capital invest¬
ment for the regions it controls, which makes provision for an increase, between
the years 1955 and i960, of 10,300 megawatts (sent out).
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where the total generating capacity of
391 megawatts is in coal-fired thermal stations) amounted to almost 823 million
kilowatt-hours in 1954, when the maximum load sustained was 317 megawatts.
Further plant installations totalling 180 megawatts are in progress or authorized,
and extensions to this programme are under review. The growth of load is at
present of the order of 30 megawatts a year.
The Central Authority is the largest consumer of primary fuel in Britain and in
the year ended 31st March 1955 it used approximately 40 million tons, consisting
mainly of coal. Average thermal efficiency of steam stations (i.e. the ratio of power
output to the coal consumed) rose from 20-86 per cent in 1947-48 to 23 -85 per cent
in 1954-55 as new plant was brought into use.
To meet increasing demands for electricity and to save coal, generation from
alternative fuels is being actively promoted. The chief alternatives are expected to
be oil and nuclear energy. As regards oil, dual firing apparatus able to use either
coal or oil is being fitted to a new power station at Marchwood, on Southampton
Water, and similar apparatus is to be installed in other power stations similarly
situated on river estuaries and thus able to be fed conveniently from nearby oil
refineries.
Nuclear Power Stations
As far as is at present known, nuclear energy, derived from fissile material in
nuclear reactors, will, by providing fuel additional to coal and petroleum for
steam raising, supply power in the form of electricity. Stations will be built both
by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and the Central Electricity
Authority.
Work started in the summer of 1953 on an experimental nuclear power station
capable of generating 92,000 kilowatts of electricity (enough to supply a medium¬
sized town) at Calder Hall, near Windscale, Cumberland. This will be the world’s
first large-scale atomic power station. In March 1954 the Government announced
its decision to build a full-scale breeder reactor (which would produce more
fissile material than it consumed) at Dounreay in Caithness, Scotland. Work on
this project has started.
In February 1955 a White Paper (Cmd. 9389) was published setting out in some
detail a provisional programme of nuclear power for the United Kingdom covering
the ten years 1955-65, and giving an indication of probable developments in the ten
years after that. In the first ten years £300 million is to be spent on 12 nuclear power
stations which by 1965 will be capable of generating between 1,500 and 2,000 mega¬
watts of electricity. Table 24 shows how this programme is expected to work out.
By 1965 the 12 nuclear power stations, which will be built to the order of the
Central Electricity Authority with the advice of the Atomic Energy Authority,
might be saving five to six million tons of coal a year and the new capacity coming
into operation should meet one-quarter of the country’s annual requirement of
new generating capacity.
INDUSTRY
177
On 13th June 1955 the Minister of Fuel and Power announced that, in addition
to this programme, six more reactors were to be built by the Atomic Energy
Authority to provide plutonium for military purposes and power for civil purposes.
Two of these would be on the Calder Hall site and the remaining four at Annan,
Dumfriesshire, Scotland. Power from these would be developed ‘ during the life¬
time of the present Parliament*.

* It was announced in October 1955 that the Central Electricity Authority proposed to
build its first two nuclear power stations at Bradwell in Essex and at Berkeley in
Gloucestershire.
The £300 million investment will not be altogether an additional demand on the
economy, as nuclear power stations will be built instead of other types of station on
which the Central Electricity Authority had been expecting to spend some £ 1,200
million between 1955 and 1965. The National Coal Board should also be able to
reduce its investment programme at the end of that time below the total that would
have been necessary in the absence of nuclear power.
The cost of electricity generated in nuclear power stations is estimated in the
White Paper at about o -6 pence per unit—the same as the probable future cost of
electricity generated by coal-fired power stations, assuming a reasonable value for
the plutonium produced as a by-product. Later stations should show a great
improvement in efficiency but the value of plutonium will probably fall consider¬
ably during their lifetime. Even so, their higher efficiency should enable them to
remain competitive with other power stations.

Nuclear power stations are being planned by the Electricity Authorities and will
be built for them by the private manufacturing firms which normally build power
stations at present. The Atomic Energy Authority is recognized as the expert body
on the nuclear components of such power stations. The Central Electricity
Authority has set up a nuclear power branch of its engineering department; the
South of Scotland Electricity Board is preparing for the establishment of nuclear
reactors in Scotland; and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Commerce has
appointed an engineer in charge of plans for the use of nuclear energy in the
generation of electricity.
Transmission and Distribution
Main electricity transmission lines—the Grid—cover most of the country. Those
of the Authority totalled 5,642 route miles (8,153 circuit miles) at 31st March 1955,
of which 41 miles were operated at 275,000 volts, 5,098 miles were operated at
132,000 volts and the remainder at 66,000 volts and below. In the North of Scotland
district there were 1,130 circuit miles of main transmission lines at the end of 1954,
all operated at 132,000 volts. Control of energy movements on the Grid in England
and Wales is managed through the eight operational areas, set up by the Authority
for that purpose and distinct from the divisions in which the generating side of the
industry is organized; each area has a central control station and the operations are
co-ordinated by a control station in London. The Grid in Scotland is operated from
the North of Scotland control centre at Tummel Bridge and the South of Scotland
control centre at Glasgow.
The new Supergrid of main transmission lines at 275,000 volts will assist in
meeting the growing demand for electricity during the next 20 years with the
greatest economy and will make the British electricity supply the most closely inte¬
grated power network in the world. The first stage was completed in 1954. The
Authority is also undertaking in conjunction with the corresponding French organi¬
zation—Electricity de France—experimental trials with the object of linking British
and French Grid systems by submarine cable in order to take advantage of different
peak periods in the two countries.
The Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers electricity acquired mainly
from the Authority, but in part from other sources, e.g., collieries. There were
15 million consumers in December i954> an increase of approximately 5 million on
those supplied in March 1939. Industrial users are the group of consumers with the
highest consumption (32,029 million units in 1954), and demand from this sector
is increasing rapidly. The principal domestic uses of electricity are for lighting,
cooking, and for space and water heating, but the demand for numerous other
domestic purposes is increasing.
The development of electricity supplies for rural areas has been facilitated by the
change in the structure of the industry under the 194? Act. During the year ended
31st March 1955 supplies were provided for a further 14,749 fanns which raised the
total to over 167,000.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board has also pressed ahead with the
distribution of electricity to consumers in the North of Scotland. At the end of 1954
there were 322,127 consumers of electricity in the Board’s district and 41 per cent
of the farms and 46 per cent of crofts (see p. 145) in the district had a supply of
electricity.
Development and Research
The comprehensive capital development plan to bridge the gap between ever-
increasing demand and supply is limited by shortages of equipment and finance.
INDUSTRY
179
Borrowing by the Central Electricity Authority and Area Electricity Boards was
limited to a maximim of £700 million by the Electricity Act, 1947. By 30th June
1954, borrowings had been authorized up to a total of £635 million. Under the
Gas and Electricity (Borrowing Powers) Act, 1954, these powers were extended
to £1,400 million. The capital investment requirements of the Authority and Area
Boards in 1954-55 were about £203 million. The investment plans of the Authority
will be considerably modified by the programme of nuclear power development,
outlined on pp. 176-8, inasmuch as it is conceivable that, from the middle of the
1960s, no more coal-fired stations will be built and all new plant will consist of
nuclear-powered stations.
Borrowing by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board is limited by the
Electricity Act, 1947, as amended by the Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland)
Act, 1952, to a maximum of £200 million. Borrowing by the South of Scotland
Electricity Board is limited by the Electricity Reorganization (Scotland) Act, 1954,
to a maximum of £75 million.
The Electricity Boards undertake research on their own account and help to finance
research through their membership of the British Electrical and Allied Industries
Research Association, an organization to which manufacturing firms and large con¬
sumers of electricity also belong and which was established before the supply indus¬
try passed into public ownership. This Association is one of the 41 autonomous
research associations in receipt of grants from the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research. The Central Electricity Authority has an Electrical Supply
Research Council including independent experts to advise it and its Area Boards,
and can consult the Minister of Fuel and Power’s Scientific Advisory Council on
problems affecting the supply and use of electricity. Direct research on a laboratory
scale takes place at the Central Electricity Laboratories at Leatherhead, Surrey, ex¬
tensions to which were opened by the Authority in July 1950. Examples of research
include gas turbine generation and experiments in the use of wind power for
generation.
GAS SUPPLY
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London, was
first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke
Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London. In the early years
of the industry, gas was used almost exclusively for lighting and was provided by a
growing number of company and municipal undertakings. Then, after the middle
of the century and the invention of the Bunsen burner in 1855, gas was used
increasingly as a source of heat for many purposes such as domestic cooking and
space and water heating, in addition to a number of industrial uses. After 1880,
however, gas for lighting purposes was subjected to increasing competition from
the new electricity supply industry; but the invention of the Welsbach incandescent
mantle in 1887, which raised the efficiency of gas lighting very considerably, enabled
the industry to hold its own while the supply of gas for purposes other than lighting
increased.
The gas industry in its present form developed in the main during the period
between the wars when increasing competition from electricity had to be met and
when changes in social habits and outlook were taking place. The industry under¬
took a large-scale programme of modernization of production and distribution and
launched widespread sales promotion campaigns especially for the numerous uses
of gas in the home. By 1939 the industry had become mainly a supplier of heating
instead of a supplier of lighting.
j8o BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Organization under Public Ownership
Under the Gas Act, 1948, the gas industry was brought under public ownership
and control on 1st May 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269 belonged
to local authorities, were vested in 12 Area Gas Boards. Together they cover the
whole of Great Britain and are charged with a statutory duty to develop and main¬
tain an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of gas supply to domestic,
industrial and other consumers. The national body is the Gas Council, which is
appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power and is responsible inter alia for
advising him on questions affecting the gas industry. It is a co-ordinating council,
not a trading body. It consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman and
the 12 chairmen of the Area Boards.
The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and operational
responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies of the other
publicly owned corporations, are charged inter alia with the responsibility of manu¬
facturing and distributing gas to consumers. Their powers differ from those of the
Electricity Area Boards, which are limited to the distribution and sale of current,
while the central executive body—the Central Electricity Authority—is charged
with the duties of generation and transmission. Each of the Area Gas Boards, which
like the Gas Council are appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power, consists of a
full-time chairman and deputy-chairman, in some cases one, and in one case two,
full-time members, and always five or six part-time members including the chair¬
man of the Area Consultative Council. There is no common pattern of organiza¬
tion ; each Board is fully independent and has devised its own subordinate structure.
A link between the industry and the consuming public was established under the
nationalization scheme by the creation of a Consultative Council in each board area.
These councils consist of not fewer than 20 and not more than 30 members, of
whom between 50 and 75 per cent are chosen from panels of persons nominated by
the local authority associations.
In Northern Ireland the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a number
of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
As has been said, the Gas Council is not a trading body, but the operations of the
Area Boards have resulted, up to 31st March 1954, in an aggregate disposable
surplus of over £8" 5 million.
labour Relations. Under the Gas Act, 1948, the Gas Council is responsible for
arranging satisfactory procedures of collective bargaining and a system of joint con¬
sultation with its employees. There are separate Joint Industrial Councils at the
national level for manual workers and salaried staffs, and subordinated regional
councils and local committees. At national and regional levels the councils combine
negotiating and consultative functions, but there are in some cases separate Con¬
sultative Committees at the local level.
Production
In 1954 in Great Britain 27-2 million tons of coal were carbonized by gas under¬
takings and 26-7 million tons by coke ovens operated outside the gas industry.
About one-quarter of the output of gas from coke ovens is sold to gas undertakings
for general distribution; the remainder is mainly consumed at the ovens or at
collieries or steelworks.
In 1921, 250,300 million cubic feet of gas was manufactured by authorized gas
undertakings or acquired from coke ovens, and the number of consumers was 7-6
million. By 1954 gas manufactured and acquired from coke ovens for distribution
had risen to 586,800 million cubic feet and the number of consumers had risen to
INDUSTRY l8l
about 12-5 million, an increase of 135 per cent in the volume of gas available and
of about 65 per cent in the number of consumers.
In 1954, the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was 7,615 million
cubic feet, most of it for household use.
The total number of persons employed in the gas industry in December 1954
was 143,000, including 13,000 women. There has been an increase of 7,000 in the
number of workers since September 1948.
Consumption
More than half of all gas produced is sold for household use and the remainder
for industry, commerce and public services.
Domestic Use. While an accurate statistical analysis of the domestic load is not
possible, evidence given before the Ridley Committee (on Fuel and Power Policy),
appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power in 1951, suggested that about 70 per
cent of the domestic load was used for cooking, the remaining 30 per cent being
spread over space heating, water heating and other installations. Most homes in
Britain are now supplied with gas, except in some rural areas where, owing to diffi¬
culties in storage and transmission, gas is not economic. These difficulties have
been overcome to some extent by the use of local high-pressure storage tanks, but
this development is unlikely to grow owing to the steady extension of rural elec¬
tricity supplies. Bottled gas, derived from petroleum, is widely used in rural areas.
Industrial and Commercial Use. Gas is used extensively in industries which require
a simple control of temperature to a fine degree of accuracy. Among such industries
are pottery and certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products.
Industrial use of gas increased greatly during the second world war and reached
103,000 million cubic feet in 1943. By 1954 industrial consumption is estimated to
have reached 148,000 million cubic feet.
By-products
With the rapid increase in the volume of gas produced, the problems of the
disposal of substances which were regarded originally as the ‘waste’ products of
the carbonization of coal (notably tar, benzole, sulphur and ammonia) became
increasingly important.
Production of coke at gas works in 1954 was 12-3 million tons, and at coke ovens
17-9 million tons. The gas industry and coke ovens jointly produce over 2-9 million
tons of crude coal tar and about no million gallons of crude benzole a year. These
products, together with those of the sulphur and ammonia type, provide a source
for the manufacture of a long and ever-growing list of essential derivatives which
includes dyestuffs (of which Britain now produces more than 80 per cent of its
requirements), fertilizers, plastics, germicides (the sulphonamides and sulphanila-
mides), insecticides, refrigerants, perfumes, and synthetic yarns.
With further research and development, more especially in the field of organic
chemistry, the production of coal carbonization derivatives is becoming of increasing
importance to the economy of the industry.
Development and Research
The chief objects of capital expenditure in the years immediately after the war were
to overtake arrears of plant renewal. Plans for further expansion were approved by the
Minister of Fuel and Power in 1954 and are outlined in the Gas Council’s publica¬
tion Fuel for the Nation.
Under the Gas Act, 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas
Boards was limited to £250 million. Borrowings to a total of £235 million had been
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
182
authorized up to 30th June 1954. The Gas and Electricity (Borrowing Powers) Act,
1954, extended these borrowing powers to £450 million.
Capital expenditure in the year ended 31st March 1955 was £55 million, com¬
pared with £46 million in 1952-53 and £36 million in 1950-51.
The post-war structure of the industry has already permitted considerable integra¬
tion by the linking of undertakings for the transmission of gas (through gas grids
and long-distance mains), enabling production to be concentrated in the most
efficient units. Progress is also being made in interconnections for the reception
of gas from coke ovens, notably in Wales, Durham and Yorkshire.
Supplies of suitable coal to meet a steadily increasing gas consumption are becom¬
ing more difficult to obtain. Investigations into alternative sources of gas are being
actively undertaken by the Gas Council. Gases from oil refineries (butane or pro¬
pane) are used in several installations in smaller towns remote from large gas works
or the grid systems. Progress has also been made with the possible use of methane,
drained from coal mines. In agreement with the National Coal Board, Area Gas
Boards have agreed to schemes for using methane from Point of Ayr Colliery in
North Wales and from Haig Pit at Whitehaven, in Cumberland.
Three oil gasification plants are at present in operation and 14 additional plants
are on order. These plants will be capable of producing 25 million cubic feet of gas
per day and of saving half a million tons of carbonizing coal a year. In addition the
South Eastern Gas Board and the British Petroleum Company are jointly examining
the practicability of building a plant to convert petroleum products from the com¬
pany’s Kent oil refinery to town gas of acceptable quality. It is expected that the
initial installation would convert some 50,000 tons of petroleum products a year to
gas and would have a daily output of 15 million cubic feet of gas.
The Gas Council is investing £1 million in a five-year survey for natural gas
within Britain. A technical mission has visited the United States to study the possi¬
bility of transporting liquefied natural gas from areas such as the Middle East where
it is running to waste.
The research organization established by the Gas Council consists of a research
committee which advises the Council on policy and sees that it is carried out, and
two research stations, one in London and one at Solihull, near Birmingham. Re¬
search is also carried out on behalf of the Gas Council at Leeds University and by the
British Ceramic Research Association (an autonomous research association grant-
aided by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research). Further, the Council
and Area Boards support a number of research associations, the work of which has
a bearing on the gas industry. These include the Coal Tar Research Association, the
British Coal Utilization Research Association and the National Benzole Association.
The underlying aim of the Council’s research programme is to ‘make the most
economic use of the natural resources available to the nation, whether by improve¬
ments in existing processes of gas manufacture, by seeking new processes or new
sources of supply of gas and by the extraction and use of other products of gas¬
making’.
FUEL EFFICIENCY
The Government has for a number of years sought to promote efficiency in the
use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, and has been assisted by
various bodies representative of producers and consumers.
The Coal Utilization Council consists of representatives of the National Coal
Board, coal distributors and coal appliance manufacturers. It was formed in 1932
to give information and advice on the best use of solid fuel, including the choice of
INDUSTRY
i83
installation and operation of solid fuel appliances, to domestic consumers and re¬
tailers of appliances. During the second world war the reduction in coal production
and the demands of war industry made economy imperative. When the Ministry
of Fuel and Power was formed in 1942, an industrial fuel advisory service with
regional branches was incorporated within it. In 1943 the Women’s Advisory Council
on Solid Fuel, consisting mainly of representatives of appliance manufacturers,
women’s organizations and others interested in the housewife’s point of view on
domestic fuel arrangements, was formed to advise women on the use of solid fuel
for heating and cooking.
Further measures have been taken during the last three years. Under a scheme
introduced in 1952, loans on favourable terms are available from the Exchequer
to industrialists for financing approved fuel-saving schemes. At present these loans
are interest-free for the first two years, repayment may be spread over a maximum
period of twenty years and no security is required. In October 1953 a non-profit-
making company, known as the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service, spon¬
sored by the British Productivity Council (see p. 140), was formed to promote
fuel-saving in industry. This company, which largely replaced the industrial fuel
advisory service of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, came into operation on 1st May
1954. It provides advice and services to all non-domestic fuel users in a variety of
forms, from ‘spot’ inspection to full-scale heat and power surveys and regular visits
on a contract basis. A survey into the generation and use of steam carried out by
the Ministry has been employed to show the possibilities in the increased uses of
back-pressure steam in the generation of electricity. The electricity and gas in¬
dustries, the largest consumers of primary fuel, are succeeding each year in
obtaining more energy from each ton of coal they use by increasing the thermal
efficiency of their plants.
WATER SUPPLY
Britain has a sufficient rainfall to ensure enough water to supply all its domestic
and industrial requirements. Water problems are mainly concerned with abstrac¬
tion, storage, treatment and distribution. Supplies are obtained partly from surface
sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds
and river intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits
and boreholes. Unlike other public services in Great Britain, such as electricity and
gas, water supply remains in the hands of a large number of water undertakings of
different kinds. Ministerial responsibility for national water policy rests with the
Minister of Housing and Local Government in England and Wales, with the
Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland and with the Minister of Health and
Local Government in Northern Ireland.
Development of Water Supply in England and Wales
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies
became a general public service and then only after long and bitter controversy. It
was largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick and his colleagues, who demon¬
strated the dangers to pure water supply and sanitation brought about by the new
industrialization, that the Public Health Act, 1848, became law in England and
Wales and laid the basis for a long series of statutes dealing with public health.
From the middle of the nineteenth century onwards a number of separate large
water undertakings were set up to provide adequate supplies of pure water to the
expanding urban population, and the water supply system developed rapidly,
although in piecemeal fashion and with some overlapping and waste.
N
184 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
To meet the urgent need for co-ordination and long-term planning, the Minister
of Health (till 1951 the responsible Minister) was assisted from 1923 onwards by an
Advisory Committee on Water, and a number of Regional Advisory Water Com¬
mittees were set up for important areas having common water problems.
Organization of Water Supply in England and Wales
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water supplies
are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this either by setting up a
water undertaking themselves or by ensuring that private statutory companies are
providing an adequate supply. The householder receives his domestic water supply at
a comparatively small charge, varying in different areas, which he pays by way of a
water rate levied, like other rates (see p. 68), on the value of his house.
By the Water Act, 1945, the Minister of Housing and Local Government now.
has powers to promote the conservation and proper use of water supplies in Eng¬
land and Wales. The same Act provided for a Central Advisory Water Committee
to advise the Government on general questions relating to water and dealt with the
local organization of water supplies and the powers and duties of local authorities
and water undertakings. Local authorities were required to supply piped wholesome
water to every part of their districts where there were houses or schools, unless it
was impracticable to do so at reasonable cost. They were also required to maintain
wells, springs and water mains, and to ensure that supplies were free from
pollution.
Since the Water Act was passed, more than 100 smaller water authorites in
England and Wales have been absorbed by larger authorities or by the creation of
joint boards. The principal object of such amalgamation is the constitution of more
efficient units in the water supply industry.
In March 1955 in England and Wales there were 901 local authority water
undertakings, 56 joint water boards (including bulk supply boards) and 13 joint
water committees, 98 statutory water companies, 33 non-statutory water com¬
panies, and 4 private proprietors with statutory powers. A considerable number of
private proprietors without statutory powers also provide small supplies. Water
undertakings vary greatly in size; of the statutory undertakings, some 2J per cent
supply about half the population.
The Metropolitan Water Board, which is probably the largest single water under¬
taking in the world, supplies about 330 million gallons daily to about million
people in the London area. The Board was established in 1903, and in the following
year took over the undertakings of eight water companies which were supplying the
London area. It consists of 66 part-time members who are the elected representa¬
tives of the various local authorities within the Board s area of operations, together
with one representative each from the Thames and Lee Conservancies. H he chair¬
man and vice-chairman are chosen by members of the Board for their experience
in water undertakings.
Present Supplies in England and Wales
Today, piped water supplies reach some 95 per cent of the total population of
England and Wales. More than 70 per cent of persons living in rural areas have
piped water supplies or are within easy reach of water mains.
The water storage capacity in England and Wales has been increased by 25 per
cent since 1945 and is now rather more than 239,000 million gallons, or enough to
supply those countries for more than 100 days. Over 31,000 miles of water mains
have been laid since 1945, and statutory water undertakings together supply about
INDUSTRY 185
I)75° million gallons a day or about 40 to 45 gallons per head of the population
(including water supplied to industry). They spend about £22 million a year on
capital development, financed mainly by loans, the interest on which, together with
running costs, is paid by the undertakings from a total annual income of some
£5° million. This income is derived from local water rates or charges levied on
domestic consumers calculated as a proportion of the annual rateable value of their
property and from prescribed charges for supplies as recorded by meter in the case
of most industrial users. In addition to supplies from water undertakings, large
quantities of water are taken by industry from rivers or underground sources.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts was assisted by an initial grant
°f million under the Rural Water Supplies Act, 1934; further grants of up to
£45 million (in England and W ales) were provided under the Rural Water Supplies
and Sewerage Acts, 1944 and 1951. By February 1955 schemes costing £22 million
had been completed with the aid of grants under these Acts, and schemes worth
£61 million were in progress. The Act of November 1955 provides for another £30
million for grants.
1 he steady growth of towns in England and Wales has meant increased demands
for water, and in so far as such growth involves covering the ground with imper¬
vious material, so that water which previously would have percolated through to
underground natural reservoirs is now carried off in drains and rivers, some
diminution in water supplies may result. On the other hand, improved methods of
purification in recent years have resulted in greater use being made of water drawn
from the lower reaches of rivers.
The Ministry has completed some 30 surveys of existing water requirements and
of supplies covering the whole of England and Wales, which provide a basis for
planning possible future developments.
Water Supply in Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scotland public water undertakings are carried on entirely by local authorities,
who supply over 95 per cent of the total population. The water problem in Scotland
is broadly similar to that in England and Wales save that less reliance needs to be
placed on underground sources. Scotland has separate legislation, the Water
(Scotland) Acts, 1946 and i949> which provide, among other things, for the setting
up of the Scottish Water Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary of State for
Scotland, who is the responsible Minister; a uniform system of rating for water
throughout the country; and grant assistance for rural local authorities up to
£20 million (increased by £10 million by the Act of November 1955, see above).
By March 1955 schemes for rural areas costing £3'4 million had been completed
with the aid of such grants, and schemes worth £12'5 million were in progress.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of fairly uniform soft water. Gravitation
water systems supply the large towns. The Water Supplies and Sewerage Act
(Northern Ireland), 1945, places certain statutory obligations on local authorities
with regard to water supply and provides grants towards the cost of improvements.
River Management
The 32 River Boards set up under the River Boards Act, 1948, carry out the
functions and co-ordinate the various aspects of river management in England and
Wales previously performed by a large number of separate authorities.
Each River Board covers a River Board Area. The River Board Areas together
comprise the whole of England and Wales, except the Thames and Lee Catchment
areas (which are under the jurisdiction of the Thames and Lee Conservancy
j85 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Boards1 respectively), the administrative County of London, ana areas adjoining
that county not included in any catchment area.
River Boards are composite bodies representing local government, agricultural
and fishery interests, and most of their expenses are apportioned among the councils
of the counties or county boroughs concerned in them in proportion to the rateable
values of property in the River Board Area.
River management in Scotland and Northern Ireland has not been concentrated
to the same extent.
It is an offence for any person to permit any polluting matter, solid or liquid,
to enter a river. The Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1951, revised and
strengthened previous legislation for the prevention of river pollution in England
and Wales. Enforcement of the Act is vested in the River Boards and the Thames
and Lee Conservators. There is a similar Act for Scotland.
Water Survey and Research
A survey is being carried out to provide Government Departments, watei under¬
takings, industry, agriculture and other water users with information on the yield,
behaviour and quantity of the nation’s water resources. The field work on surface
water is being undertaken mainly by the River Boards under the guidance of the
Ministry of Housing and Local Government and the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. The other two aspects of the survey, rainfall and underground
water supplies, are the responsibility of the Meteorological Office (see p. 43) and
the Geological Survey and Museum respectively. There are arrangements for
consultation between the interested bodies. .
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and In¬
dustrial Research is engaged in investigating problems connected with the treatment
of water for domestic and industrial supply, the treatment and disposal of sewage and
industrial waste waters, and the effects and prevention of pollution of surface waters
and undergroundwater. The Laboratory maintains close contactwith other interested
Government Departments, with municipal and other public authorities, and with
industry. Research is carried out with general supervision and advice from the
Water Pollution Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research. The Board was set up in 1927 and its members are appointed by the
Lord President of the Council.
SOME MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
The United Kingdom’s manufacturing industries provide an exceedingly wide
range of products many of which play a major role in world trade. In terms of net
output and exports the most important groups of industries are those concerned
with the manufacture of metals and metal products, though the textile and chemical
industries are also of considerable significance. Some impression of the relative
importance of the different groups in terms of net output is given in Table 25,

An important feature in the expansion of United Kingdom exports since the
second world war has been the development of new types of commodities, meeting
new and growing needs. In many cases, the industries making them are based on
inventions or discoveries made during or after the war; in others, the basic research

had been done before the war, but production on a commercial scale was not under¬
taken until later. The development of gas turbine aircraft, radar and penicillin are
well-known examples of these new industries.
METAL MANUFACTURE
The metal manufacturing industries employed 564,000 persons at the end of
I954- Nearly four-fifths of these were engaged in the production of iron and steel.
Iron and Steel
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards and was responsible for the technical development
which led to the great expansion of steelmaking in the second half of the nineteenth
century. Today Britain is one of the world’s four largest producers of steel and is
renowned for the quality of its special and alloy steels. In 1954 direct exports of
steel amounted to 2-4 million tons at a value of £137 million, in addition to indirect
exports through the sales of the steel-consuming industries; export sales of the
vehicles industries (which are the major consumers of steel) amounted to some
£402 million in 1954 (see p. 193).
The modernization of the industry, begun in the late ’thirties, was interrupted by
the war. A post-war development plan was drawn up in 1945 by the British Iron
and Steel Federation, the main trade organization of the industry. This plan, which
was generally approved by the Government in 1946, aimed to modernize steel¬
making capacity in Britain and to increase it to 16 million tons a year by the early
1950s. This objective was exceeded with the production of 16-4 million tons in
I952> i7'6 million tons in 1953 and 18-5 million tons in 1954. Work on the greater
part of a further development plan to raise the country’s steel production to at least
22 million tons by 1957 is well in hand. Notable projects completed under the first
plan include the Abbey Works at Margam, the tinplate works at Trostre (both in
South Wales) and the new sintering process incorporated in the Seraphim extensions
at Scunthorpe, in Lincolnshire, where the largest blast furnace in Europe was
installed in 1954.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
188
About 450,000 people were employed in those industries generally regarded as
iron and steel manufacture at the end of 1954. Of these: 21,400 were engaged in
work at blast furnaces; 222,300 in iron and steel smelting and rolling; 126,900 in
jj-Qn foundries; 14,000 in tinplate manufacture; 20,000 in steel sheet manufacture,
and 45,500 in iron and steel tube manufacture.
South Wales and the north-east coast of England are the United Kingdom’s
two largest steel-producing areas, together responsible for an annual production
of over 8 million tons. South Wales is engaged mainly in the production of flat
products, and is especially noted for its tinplate production. In the north-east
coast area of England, production is concentrated on heavy sections and rails, and
plates for the shipbuilding industry. Scotland, with an annual production of oyer
2 million tons, finds its chief internal markets in the shipbuilding and engineering
industries of the Clyde Valley. Sheffield is known all over the world for its special
and alloy steels. . . ,
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public supervision
since 1932, when a Government-appointed body, the Import Duties Advisory
Committee, gave special attention to the reorganization of the industry. During the
second world war detailed control was exercised by the Iron and Steel Control of
the Ministry of Supply and, from 1946 to 1949, the industry was supervised by an
Iron and Steel Board responsible to the Minister of Supply. On 15th February
1951 the greater part of the industry came into public ownership by virtue of the
Iron and Steel Act, 1949. On that day the securities of about ninety iron and steel
producing companies were transferred to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great
Britain established under the Act, although the companies retained their separate
identities and managements and the control of their subsidiaries.
The 1949 Act was repealed by the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, which established
an Iron and Steel Holding and Realization Agency with the duty of returning these
companies to private ownership. By September 1954 about one-third of the de¬
vesting programme had been carried out. The 1953 Act also provided for the
establishment of an Iron and Steel Board to exercise a general supervision over the
iron and steel industry with a view to promoting an efficient, economic and adequate
supply of iron and steel products under competitive conditions. The Board was
appointed by the Minister of Supply in June 1953 and includes, in addition to the
chairman and two other full-time members, a number of part-time members drawn
from steel producers, steel consumers and trade unions. The Board has particular
powers in relation to research and development, the procurement of raw materials
and prices for sales in the United Kingdom.
Under an Agreement dated 21st December 1954 the United Kingdom Govern¬
ment entered into a special relationship with the European Coal and Steel
Community.
Non-ferrous Metals
Non-ferrous metals industries in Great Britain employ about 114,000 persons
and contribute roughly £100 million to net national output. Apart from a little
mining of lead, tin and tungsten, the industry consists of factories for smelting and
casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and drawing of base metals, of which
the most important are aluminium, copper, lead, zinc, tin, nickel and magnesium.
Some of these and other non-ferrous metals, such as molybdenum and tungsten,
are used in steel alloys, and science is finding new uses for non-ferrous metals of all
kinds which are vital to industries as diverse as, for example, production of nuclear
energy (uranium), jet aircraft engines (aluminium, columbium, magnesium,
titanium), and electronic apparatus (selenium, tungsten, germanium).
INDUSTRY
189
In *954 direct exports of non-ferrous base metals amounted to a value of £56
million, of which copper and its alloys accounted for £23 million and aluminium and
its alloys for £12 million.
SHIPBUILDING AND MARINE ENGINEERING
Ships built in British yards for foreign owners in 1954 were valued at £50-4
million, compared with £39-6 million in 1953.
Britain has for centuries been one of the most important shipbuilding countries.
Modern shipbuilding dates from the middle of the nineteenth century, when the
iron and steam-driven vessel replaced the earlier sailing ship. Britain led the way
in the substitution of steel for iron and in the development of the steam turbine,
and within the last few years has produced the first ships to be powered by gas
turbines. Between 1890 and 1913 Britain produced more than half the world’s new
tonnage, and in 1920 she launched over two million tons, still the peace-time record
for the industry. Bhe problem of surplus capacity and periodic heavy unemploy¬
ment appeared in all shipbuilding countries during the inter-war years. During the
second world war the industry was fully occupied in building and repairing war¬
ships and merchant ships of all kinds, and a high level of activity in the building and
repair of merchant ships has continued since 1945.
Shipbuilding is mainly an assembly trade, and Britain’s economy is well equipped
to meet this demand, with a highly developed iron and steel industry to provide
plates, sections and angles, a modern marine engineering industry, and a widely
diversified pattern of general industry to supply the numerous components that go
to the making of a ship.
Well over three-quarters of the tonnage of ships built in the United Kingdom is
produced in four areas:
1. On the River Clyde in Scotland (where the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth
wrere built in the inter-war years).
2. On the north-east coast of England—along the lower reaches of the Rivers
Tyne, Wear and Tees, and at West Hartlepool.
3. On the north-west coast of England—on the River Mersey and at Barrow-
in-Furness.
4. At Belfast, in Northern Ireland, where the largest individual shipyard is
situated, and where the Southern Cross, a passenger liner of revolutionary
design, was launched in 1954.
In each of these areas there is capacity for building warships and all types of
merchant ships from large passenger liners and tankers to small sea-going ships
such as coasters and cross-Channel steamers. Ships are also built in the Southampton
area, in the Isle of Wight, and along the estuaries of the Rivers Forth and Tay, in
Scotland, while numerous places along the coast build fishing vessels, yachts,
harbour craft and barges.
Repair yards and dry docks are situated in all the great ports and there are
important repair facilities in all the shipbuilding areas.
There are many firms engaged in shipbuilding, although nearly half the output
of new ships is concentrated in the hands of about a dozen.
In the years 1946 to 1948 British shipyards launched half the world’s total new
tonnage. Since then, with the recovery of the shipbuilding industries in Germany
and Japan and the rebuilding of shipyards in some European countries after their
destruction in the war, the British shipyards have built a rather smaller proportion
of world tonnage, though total output from the shipyards has been fully
I90 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
maintained. The construction of tankers still accounts for about half the total
tonnage under construction in United Kingdom yards.
At the end of 1954 there were about 205,000 employees in the shipbuilding and
repairing industries, including those employed in naval dockyards. In addition,
there were 80,000 employed in marine engineering.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
Mechanical engineering embraces a vast range of products including agricultural
machinery, boilers and boilerhouse plant, machine tools, stationary engines, textile
machinery and accessories, ordnance and small arms, constructional engineering
goods, office machinery, cranes and conveyors. The total number of persons
employed in mechanical engineering at the end of 1954 was about 1,066,000 and the
value of exports in 1954 was about £450 million.
Agricultural Machinery
The agricultural machinery industry now employs about 50,000 people with an
annual output valued at over £100 million. In 1954 it produced, among other
implements, 167,000 tractors, 37,000 mouldboard ploughs, 11,200 disc harrows,
20,000 mowers, 6,100 combine harvesters, and 10,200 milking machines. Britain,
where production dates virtually from 1933 when the English Ford Company
produced 2,788 tractors, now has the largest annual output of tractors in Europe
and the second largest in the world, exports the greatest proportion of its output
and is the second largest exporter in the world. Exports of agricultural and track¬
laying tractors in 1954 were valued at £50 million compared with £31 million in
1950. Exports of other agricultural machinery were valued at £16-2 million in 1954
compared with £12‘8 million in 1950.
Boilers and Boilerhouse Plant
Boilers and boilerhouse plant manufactured in the United Kingdom have many
industrial, commercial and domestic applications. Water tube boilers of advanced
design are produced by the industry in large quantities for home power stations and
for export. Exports of water tube boilers in 1954 exceeded a value of £14 million. The
industry is closely concerned with the development of equipment for nuclear power
stations and, in association with electrical machinery manufacturers, is preparing to
manufacture and export all the component parts of nuclear power stations.
Shell boilers are used for steam raising and heating purposes in factories and in
commercial and domestic buildings. Production of these boilers during 1954 was
valued at £10 million, of which more than £2 million worth was exported.
The total number of persons employed in the manufacture of boilers and boiler-
house plant at the end of 1954 was 31,000. . ,
Items of steam-raising plant accessories produced include: plain and corrugated
boiler furnaces, forced draught boiler furnaces and grates, stokers, fuel economizers
and fireheaters, superheaters and desuperheaters, pulverizers, coal and ash hand¬
ling plant, soot blower equipment, steam pipework, and feed water heaters. 1 he
value of production in 1954 for the industry as a whole was £16 million, of which
£2-8 million worth was for export.
Machine Tools
The efficiency of a nation’s major manufacturing industries, and the consequent
prosperity of the nation, depends to a large extent on the vitality of its machine tool
industry. Britain was an early pioneer in the machine tool field, producing some of
the first basic types of machines in the late eighteenth century, and this pioneering
INDUSTRY
191
spirit still prevails today. In the development by a number of leading United King¬
dom manufacturers of ‘transfer lines’, and in the current research into the use of
electronic control in the machine tool field, Britain is already looking forward to
the not too distant future when the automatic factory may become, not merely a
possibility, but a fact. In more conventional designs, also, United Kingdom manu¬
facturers are constantly seeking improvements, and there are big outstanding orders
for both home and export, particularly in the range of borers, grinders, lathes and
presses.
The machine tool industry consists largely of small independent firms with a
high proportion of private companies; it employed an average of 44,000 workers
in 1954. The industry is centred mainly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire,
and to a lesser extent near London and Glasgow. The Machine Tool Trades Asso¬
ciation of Great Britain is the representative body of most of the machine tool
manufacturers and importers and is responsible for the International Machine Tool
Exhibitions held in Britain every four years. The next exhibition will take place at
Olympia (London) in June 1956.
The value of production of metal-working machine tools has risen from £6 million
in 1935 to £66 million in 1954. Exports in 1954 amounted to a value of £18 million,
while orders on hand at the end of 1954 totalled £81 million, of which £21 million
worth were for export. Production of woodworking machine tools in 1954 was
valued at £5 million, of which £2 million worth was exported, with outstanding
orders of a further £2 million.
Steelworks Plant
Britain occupies a prominent position among the steel-producing countries of
the world and, therefore, needs a flourishing industry to manufacture plant for the
steel industry. About 40 firms produce equipment for manufacturing steel at all
stages. In 1945 six of these firms, capable of supplying the entire range of steel¬
making plant, formed a company under the name of the Metallurgical Equipment
Export Company Limited (MEECO), to co-ordinate their export activities and to
make it easier for foreign companies to buy steelworks plant from the United King¬
dom. Since its formation the group has co-operated to carry out a number of large
contracts for equipping steelworks in Sweden, Norway, Spain and France.
Production of steelworks plant in 1954 amounted to a value of £8 million, of which
£4 million worth was exported. Orders in hand at the end of 1954 amounted to £16
million, of which £5 million worth was for export.
Textile Machinery
One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries is the textile
machinery industry which developed rapidly after the introduction of mechanical
spinning and weaving towards the end of the eighteenth century. The industry
now gives employment to about 66,000 people and comprises some 600 firms
making every kind of machine and accessory for processing all types of natural
and synthetic fibres. It enjoys a world-wide reputation, not only for the high
quality of its products but also because it can offer a complete and modern range
of equipment consisting of: spinning machinery, including machinery for all the
preparatory processes; winding machinery and machinery for other processes prior
to weaving; weaving machinery; knitting, hosiery and lace machinery; printing,
dyeing and other finishing machinery; bast and leaf fibre machinery, of which the
United Kingdom is still by far the world’s largest supplier; and all types of mill
stores and textile machinery accessories. In 1954 exports were valued at over £39
million.
192
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
To keep its high place as a traditional supplier of textile machinery, the research
and design departments of the industry are continuously engaged on research into
new and improved methods of textile processing, and are developing machines
which speed up production for an increasing variety of yarns and fabrics, including
the newer synthetics. A notable recent development, claimed to be one of the most
important in the wool textile industry for one hundred years, is the new ‘Auto¬
leveller ’ for worsted roving preparation, which came into full-scale production in
September 1954.
Prefabricated Buildings
The British prefabricated buildings industry, based on long experience dating
back in various forms to before 1830, has contributed to solving the problem of
housing shortage not only in Britain but in many other countries. In 1954 exports
were valued at £2-8 million.
Contractors’ Plant
Production in the United Kingdom before the war was mainly concerned with
small excavators, concrete mixing machinery and road surfacing plant, including
road rollers. But now many new machines, especially for earth-moving, are in
production. Examples are industrial crawler tractors, motor graders, scrapers,
trenchers, dozer equipment, dumpers, rippers and rooters.
Whereas output in 1935 was valued at only £2 million, in 1954 it reached nearly
£25 million, of which nearly £11 million worth was exported.
Recent developments in the manufacture of the heaviest types of crawler tractors,
rear and bottom dumpers, motor scrapers, soil stabilizers and mobile crushers will
ensure the continued expansion of this industry.
Refrigeration Machinery
This industry falls broadly into three classes—domestic, commercial and indus¬
trial. It has made remarkable strides since the end of the second world war. Although
before the war production of commercial and industrial refrigeration machinery
was well established, domestic refrigeration production, now large, was then quite
small.
The 200 firms engaged in the industry employ some 12,000 -workers and produce
annually goods worth about £28 million (nearly ten times the value of production
in 1935), of which about £15 million worth is exported. A full range of refrigeration
machinery and equipment is available.
Office Equipment
The office equipment industry is now second in size only to that of the United
States and provides an example of remarkable expansion since the second wrorld
war. The value of its output is now over £40 million a year compared with about
£2 million in 1939, and its exports of office machinery alone were valued at £12-2
million in 1954, of which over £2 million worth went to North American dollar
markets.
Petroleum Equipment
Exports of specialized petroleum equipment were extremely small before the
second world war. The substantial growth in Britain’s post-war export trade in
petroleum equipment is a reflection of the remarkable expansion in the oil industry
throughout the world. In 1954 British firms received orders for oil equipment
valued at £80 million compared with £67 million in 1953. The equipment included
INDUSTRY
193
drilling and production equipment, tubes, pipe fittings and valves, drums, drum-
sheets and tinplate. A large but unspecified part of these orders was for use over¬
seas. Apart from the United States, Britain is now the world’s chief supplier of oil
equipment.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
The United Kingdom electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufac¬
ture, installation and operation of a wide variety of electrical equipment, ranging
from giant generators to small domestic appliances. It has produced all the equip¬
ment for the United Kingdom’s great post-war power station programme and is
an important supplier of equipment designed to increase the productivity and effi¬
ciency of United Kingdom industry as a whole. At the same time it exports large
quantities of power station equipment and other electrical machinery and appliances
to many parts of the world. In terms of monetary value it is the second largest
exporter of goods from the United Kingdom and one of the two largest exporters
of electrical goods in the world. The industry is preparing to manufacture and
export equipment for nuclear power stations.
Altogether the industry employs a labour force of more than 600,000.
Electronic Equipment
One of the newest and most vigorous branches of the industry is the manufacture
of electronic equipment, including sound radio and television receiving sets, under¬
water television apparatus, navigational aids, electronic computers and electronic
military equipment. Much of the pioneer work in this industry, e.g., the invention
of radar and the initiation of the first public television transmission, was under¬
taken by British scientists and engineers. About 125,000 people are now employed
and the value of annual production is about £140 million, of which about £30
million worth is exported.
Electric Wires and Cables
This industry is concerned with the manufacture of cables and wires, including
submarine cables, for the distribution of electric power and for the telephone and
telegraph network.
At the end of 1954 employment totalled 61,000. During 1954 the United King¬
dom produced £95 million worth of insulated wire and cable, of which £23 million
worth was for export.
VEHICLES
Of the metal-using industries the vehicles group makes the largest contribution to
the export trade (some £402 million in 1954). At the end of 1954 it employed
1,176,000 people, including 324,000 in the manufacture of motor vehicles and
cycles, 239,000 in the manufacture and repair of aircraft, 165,000 in the manufac¬
ture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles and aircraft and 165,000 in the
manufacture and repair of locomotives, railway carriages and wagons.
Motor Vehicles
In size and value the vehicles industries are headed by the motor vehicles indus¬
try, which comprises the manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles other than
tractors. Exports in 1954 (including parts) were valued at £239 million. Britain is
the world’s largest exporter of these products, and has been responsible for some
of the latest technical advances, such as the application of the gas turbine engine
to motor car propulsion, for which at least four British manufacturers have patents.
194
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
On the production side, some of the new assembly plants in Britain, electrically
controlled and using the minimum of labour, may stand comparison with similar
plants anywhere in the world for efficiency and reliability.
Output rose rapidly between 1948 and 1950, fell back in 1951 and 1952, and
climbed again in 1953 and 1954. In 1954 the United Kingdom produced the record
total of 769,000 passenger motor cars and chassis, of which 52 per cent were for
export, and 260,000 commercial vehicles and chassis, of which 49 per cent were
for export.
The industry is located mainly in the Midlands, in London and in south¬
east England, but is represented in most regions. Motor vehicle producers may be
divided into four main groups: (1) the ‘Big Five’, which control between them 12
establishments producing over 90 per cent of the output of cars and light vehicles;
(2) specialist producers of cars; (3) specialist producers of cars and commercial
vehicles; (4) manufacturers of commercial vehicles excluding the ‘Big Five’ and
specialist producers. The largest firm in the first category, the British Motor Cor¬
poration, was formed by a merger of the Austin and Nuffield Companies in 1952,
with the object of obtaining economies and standardization. With assets totalling
£108 million, the British Motor Corporation is the fourth largest motor manufac¬
turing group in the world, representing some 37 per cent of British output of cars
and commercial vehicles. Capital expansion plans involving more than £120 million
over the next five years were announced by the leading manufacturers in October
I9S4-
The principal trade association in the industry is the Society of Motor Manufac¬
turers and Traders (SMMT), founded in 1902, which holds in London a Motor
Exhibition annually and a Commercial Motor Exhibition every two years.
Research is carried out at Lindley, Warwickshire, by the Motor Industry Re¬
search Association, an autonomous body founded in 1946 and partly financed by
the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) but mainly by the
industry and the SMMT; and also by DSIR’s Mechanical Engineering Research
Laboratory at East Kilbride, Scotland.
Motor Cycles and Pedal Cycles
In 1954 the United Kingdom’s output of motor cycles totalled 180,000 of which
39 per cent was for shipment overseas. The total value of United Kingdom produc¬
tion, including parts and accessories, was £24 million. Exports totalled almost £10
million in value.
Output of pedal cycles in 1954 totalled 3,300,000, of which 66 per cent was for
export. The value of exports of pedal cycles and parts and accessories in 1954 was
£25 million.
Aircraft
British contributions to aeronautical science have been numerous from the early
nineteenth century, when Sir George Cayley founded the science of aerodynamics,
to the twentieth century, when the use of a gas turbine for jet propulsion, for which
Sir Frank Whittle was granted a patent in 193°. came to fruition with the flight of
the first jet-propelled aircraft on 15th May 1941. Since the second world war, the
United Kingdom aircraft industry (which dates from 1905) has concentrated mainly
on the development and production of gas turbine aircraft for civil and military
purposes, although a range of piston-engined types is still produced. Over the
period 1951-54 the United Kingdom produced i,93° civil aircraft. In 1954
the value of United Kingdom exports of aircraft and aircraft parts (excluding
engines and electrical parts and appliances) was £31 million.
INDUSTRY
195
A new private company entitled Air Finance Ltd. (see p. 293) was formed in
September 1953 to assist aircraft manufacturers to promote exports.
The manufacture and repair of aircraft employs 239,000 people compared with
146,800 in 1948, 1,800,000 in 1944 (the war-time peak) and 36,000 in 1935.
The representative body of the United Kingdom aircraft industry is the Society
of British Aircraft Constructors, founded in 1916. Its annual exhibition and flying
display held at Farnborough is a fixture of international importance.
The greater part of fundamental research on problems of aerodynamics, struc¬
tures and engines is carried out by the Ministry of Supply. Much of this research is
carried out at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough and at the
National Gas Turbine Establishment also at Farnborough. This work is done in
collaboration with the industry and results are made known to manufacturers, who
are in close and constant touch with the Ministry’s establishments. In addition, the
National Physical Laboratory undertakes research on aerodynamics. The actual de¬
sign, construction and initial testing of aircraft are, however, carried out by the manu¬
facturer. British technical achievements in recent years include the by-pass type of
engine (the first distinct step forward in the evolution of the aircraft gas turbine
engine), the delta wing, and the first experimental machines to be capable of vertical
take-off from a normal horizontal position and of supersonic speed in level flight
and while climbing.
Railway Vehicles
Britain was the first country to develop the locomotive railway and British
engineers pioneered railway development in most parts of the world.
Locomotive production in Britain has come to be divided into two separate
sections: one of these comprises the locomotive works of British Railways, and is
engaged in building and repairing locomotives and rolling-stock for their use; the
other consists of private firms providing locomotives of all types for export, and
steam, diesel shunting and industrial types for home use. At the end of 1954 about
81,000 persons were employed in locomotive manufacture and 84,000 in the manu¬
facture and repair of railway carriages and wagons.
In 1954 the United Kingdom produced 583 steam locomotives, of which 278
were for export, and 687 diesel and diesel-electric locomotives, of which 377 were
for export. In addition, 6 electric locomotives were produced for United Kingdom
main line railways. Output of coaching vehicles (including rail motor vehicles) in
the same year amounted to 2,400, and output of wagons to 62,000. The total value
of United Kingdom exports of railway vehicles in 1954 was £44 million.
MISCELLANEOUS METAL PRODUCTS
At the end of 1954 the number of persons employed in the industries coming
under this heading was as follows:

Some of these industries are of considerable export importance. For example, in
1954 the United Kingdom exported £17-9 million worth of implements and tools
(excluding machine tools).

At one time the production of cutlery was spread fairly widely throughout
England, but gradually it centred in the river valleys around Sheffield. When steam
replaced water as the motive power, the industry began to move in towards the
centre of Sheffield. The production units were very small and the industry was built
up on the high degree of skill of its craftsmen. The introduction of modern
machinery has largely replaced hand forging, and mass production methods are now
used by some firms in producing the cheaper range of products. The highest
quality wares, however, are still produced by the skilled craftsmen. Although in
recent years there has been some increase in the size of the production units, they
remain mainly small, and, of the 400 firms manufacturing cutlery, some 200 still
employ fewer than ten persons.
The annual output of the industry is now valued at about £8-g million, of which
£4 million represents exports, mainly to Australia, Canada, the United States, and
South Africa.
Domestic Hollow-Ware
This industry is mainly located in the Midlands, although some production is
also carried out in Lancashire, Yorkshire, South Wales and London. Hollow-ware
production covers a wide range of goods and these are roughly divided into six
classes: wrought steel (including galvanized, enamelled and tinned), aluminium,
tin and terne plate, cast iron, copper and other metals. There is, however, an
increasing development in the comparatively recent production of plastic hollow-
ware. There are some 300 firms known to be manufacturing domestic hollow-ware
and these vary considerably in size.
The annual production is valued at about £19’3 million, of which £4-9 million
represents exports, mainly to Commonwealth countries. Although aluminium
hollow-ware accounts for the greater value of total production, export sales are
highest for enamelled ware.
Hand Tools
The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest industries of the United
Kingdom. From the time when prehistoric man first learned how to fashion tools
from iron, hand tools of an ever-increasing diversity and precision have been made
in Britain, and today, over 400 different types—in many thousands of sizes and
patterns—are made in its factories.
Production of hand tools falls broadly into the following groups: agricultural
and other heavy edge tools (including scythes and sickles); engineers’ and mechanics’
tools (including jacks and spanners); light edge tools (builders’ and joiners’ tools);
files and rasps; saws (hand, tenon and cross cut); and pliers, pincers and nippers.
There are about 400 firms, employing more than 18,000 operatives, in the
industry. Approximately 65 per cent of the total production comes from the
Sheffield area, 30 per cent comes from Birmingham, and most of the remainder
from London and Lancashire.
The industry has expanded considerably since before the second world war,
output having risen from a little over £5 million in 1937 to an estimated level of
about £25 million in 1954, of which about £12 million worth was exported. Two-
thirds of the exports go to Commonwealth countries.

CHEMICALS
It is difficult to define the chemical industry since, with the increasing dependence
of industry generally on synthetic raw materials, its scope is continually widening.
But on the broadest definition the industry includes the manufacture of such
products as acids, alcohols, alkalis, industrial gases, explosives, fertilizers, dyestuffs,
soaps and detergents, plastics materials, paints and pharmaceuticals. Manufacturing
these and other products, the chemical and allied trades employ about half a
million people and contribute about a tenth of the total output of all manufacturing
industry. Exports of chemicals are also substantial, amounting in 1954 to a value
of £204 million, or some 7! per cent of total United Kingdom exports.
British pioneers made great contributions to the science of chemistry, as the
names of Robert Boyle, Joseph Priestley, Michael Faraday and John Dalton testify.
Contemporary British chemists who maintain the tradition include Sir Robert
Robinson (who has done outstanding work on vitamins and hormones), and
Dr. A. J. P. Martin and Dr. R. M. Synge (who were awarded the Nobel prize in
1952 for their work in developing chromatography, a method of separating chemical
substances).
Matching progress in science and the increasing demands of other industries, the
British chemical industry has expanded considerably during the present century.
More particularly, recent years have seen a rapid growth which has brought the
industry’s volume of production up to more than two and a half times its pre-war
level. This post-war expansion has been most marked in two fields—production of
plastics materials generally, and the large-scale manufacture of a wide range of
organic chemicals from petroleum. In the latter field, nearly £44 million has already
been invested in seven major petroleum chemicals plants and plans for a further
considerable expansion are in hand.
Heavy Chemicals and Dyestuffs
The heavy chemicals sector covers a wide range of acids, alkalis, alcohols, gases
and other basic chemical substances, many of which are fundamental to other
branches of the chemical industry as well as to other industries. One of the main
products, sulphuric acid, is now manufactured to an increasing extent from
indigenous deposits of anhydrite (calcium sulphate) instead of from imported
sulphur. Since the war there has also been a greatly expanded production of raw
materials for the manufacture of synthetic detergents, while trichlorethylene has
been in big demand in the engineering trades for mechanical degreasing plants. The
dyestuffs industry also continues to add to the already vast and comprehensive
range of its products, many of them developed from pioneer British discoveries in
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Exports of synthetic organic dyestuffs and
pigments reached in 1954 the record level of £11 -3 million.
Plastics
The first plastic, ‘Parkesine’, was produced in Britain in 1865 by Alexander
Parkes. Modern plastics originating in Britain include ‘Perspex’, polythene and
‘ silicones ’. (Silicones, which were discovered by Professor Kipping at Nottingham,
were developed in the United States and are now being made at two new British
factories.) Since 1939 there has probably been a sixfold increase in the overall pro¬
duction of plastics materials, although expansion during the last few years has been
concentrated on polythene (used in cable coverings, packaging and domestic
mouldings), polystyrene (a cheap non-inflammable material used for toys, light
mouldings and, more recently, in durable consumer goods), and polyvinyl chloride
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
198
(known as PVC, and made into industrial conveyor belting as well as a variety of
other consumer goods such as raincoats and curtains). Total exports of plastics
materials were higher than ever before in 1954, amounting in value to over
£20 million.
Fertilizers
The production of fertilizers owes much to the pioneer work of the British
scientists, Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert, and the research now carried on
in the United Kingdom at Rothamsted and at the Macaulay Institute, Aberdeen,
is of world-wide importance. In 1954 total exports of fertilizers were valued at
£7 million.
Pesticides
Important British discoveries in the last fifteen years have led to major develop¬
ments in the production of selective weed-killers such as methyl chloro phenoxy
acetic acid (MCPA), and of insecticides based on benzine hexachloride (BHC).
Oversea markets take the major proportion of United Kingdom production of these
and other well-known pesticides such as DDT, systemic insecticides and copper
sulphate, exports of which amounted in all to some £9 million in 1954.
Pharmaceuticals and Perfumery
About three-quarters of the pharmaceutical products sold today have been
introduced in the past twenty years. These products include sulphonamides, anti¬
biotics (e.g., penicillin), hormones, anti-malarial drugs (e.g., paludrine), liver
extracts, anti-histamines and anti-tubercular drugs. About £2 million a year is
spent, on research. Total exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products
amounted to a value of £33 -6 million in 1954, while exports of perfumery and toilet
preparations, including soaps and detergents, were £20 g million in value.
Isotopes and Radioactive Materials
Isotopes and radioactive materials, used in medicine, agriculture and industry,
are a by-product of nuclear reactors, and in the United Kingdom they are produced
at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell and dispatched from
there and from the Radiochemical Centre at Amersham (see p. 380). In 1954
Britain produced 19,531 isotopes, compared with 135 in 1947, and exported 7,252
of them (more than all other countries put together) to 41 countries including
Canada and the United States. An important factor in the growing sales of isotopes
has been their reasonable price; the average value of each dispatch from Amersham
in 1954 was £20. From 15th August 1955 the prices of two of the most important
radioactive isotopes used in medicine—iodine 131 and colloidal gold 198—were
reduced by the Atomic Energy Authority as a result of improved manufacturing
efficiency and continuing growth in demand.
TEXTILES AND CLOTHING
The value of exports in the textiles and clothing group as a whole, including
manufactures of wool, cotton, linen, jute, silk, rayon and synthetic fibres, lace,
hosiery, woven apparel and carpets, amounted in 1954 to £358 million, or 13 per
cent of total United Kingdom exports. About i| million people were employed in
these industries in December 1954, including about 300,000 in the cotton textile
industry, 212,000 in the wool textile industry, 91,000 in rayon and nylon production
and weaving and silk, 93,000 in textile finishing, etc., 126,000 in hosiery and other

Cotton
Spinning and weaving of cotton for the making of fustian with a cotton weft and
linen warp began to assume importance in the United Kingdom in the sixteenth
century; but it was the invention of mechanical spinning and weaving in the second
half of the eighteenth century that led to cotton becoming Britain’s chief consumer
goods industry and cotton piece-goods its largest export during the nineteenth
century.
In the twentieth century increasing foreign competition and the tendency of
many countries, notably India, to set up their own textile industry cut progressively
into British markets. During the second world war numbers of mills were closed
and, though many have since been brought back into production, the industry still
employs only about two-thirds as many workers as in 1937. It remains, however,
one of Britain’s largest consumer goods industries, and plays an important part in
the export trade.
Since the war a vigorous drive for quality and efficiency has been pressed forward
by the industry with support and assistance from the Government. Important in
this drive are the Cotton Board, a statutory body with the constitution and powers
of a Development Council, and the British Cotton Industry Research Association
(Shirley Institute), founded in 1919 for promoting scientific and technical research
in connection with cotton and its utilization. The industry now uses a considerable
and increasing amount of rayon as well as cotton, and its dependence on imported
raw material has thus been reduced.
Most of the industry is located in south and east Lancashire, Manchester occu¬
pying a special position as its commercial centre.
There were about 168,000 persons employed in the spinning and doubling section
of the industry in December 1954 and 122,000 in weaving. About two-thirds of the
workers in the industry are women.
Production rose steadily from 1945 until the end of 1951, when the industry
began to feel the effects of the world textile recession. It did not begin to recover
until the second half of 1952; and in 1954 it was still well below the 1951 post-war
peak figure, which was itself below the 1937 level.
In 1954 exports of cotton yarn and woven fabrics were valued at £112 million,
or about 4 per cent of total United Kingdom exports.
Wool
The wool textile industry is the most ancient of Britain’s staple industries and has
been an important source of wealth since medieval times. There are two main branches
—woollen and worsted. While over 80 per cent of woollens and over 90 per cent
of worsteds are made in Yorkshire, Scotland and the West of England have retained
their importance as specialized producers of high quality woollen cloth. The
woollen side of the industry is normally organized on a vertical basis, with each firm
undertaking the full process of manufacture from raw material to finished product,
but for a variety of reasons the worsted industry is mainly organized horizontally—
combing, spinning and weaving being done by separate firms. Small firms employ¬
ing fewer than 300 workers predominate in the industry. Output reached a post¬
war peak at the end of 1950. In common with other textile industries, there was a
downward trend for most of 1951, and the first half of 1952 was a period of much
reduced activity, but production recovered thereafter.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The wool industry remains one of Britain’s leading export industries; the total
value of exports of wool tops, woollen and worsted yarns and woven fabrics in 1954
was about £nB million, of which about £25 million represented exports to the
United States and Canada. In addition there were considerable exports of wool in
various forms including carpets and clothing.
Research is carried on mainly by the Wool Industries Research Association,
which is financed partly by a statutory levy on the industry and partly by a grant
from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
Other Textiles
Linen has been made in Britain for more than a thousand years and it is believed
that the art of linen weaving was already being practised during the seventh cen¬
tury. Today it is an industry of small firms, chiefly in Northern Ireland (the greatest
linen manufacturing region in the world). The principal raw material of the industry
is flax, which is mainly imported (the chief supplier is Belgium), but in England and
Scotland particularly a certain amount of soft hemp and jute is used. In Scotland
the industry is concentrated in the eastern part of the country and specializes in the
production of coarse linens and light canvas, probably because of its association
with jute and hemp. Technical problems are investigated by the Research Institute
of the Linen Industry Research Association, formed in i9I9- Exports in 1954 were
valued at £12 million, the United States being the chief market.
Jute, most of which comes from India and Pakistan, is the raw material for a
considerable industry centred in Dundee. Jute cloth is used for sacks and bags,
tarpaulins and backing for linoleum; yarns are sold for carpet backing and for
twine and cordage.
Silk exports were valued at about £1 million in 1954- Raw silk is supplied mainly
from Japan and Italy.
Rayon is produced from cellulose, either in the form of woodpulp or cotton
Enters. Its early development took place to a large extent in Britain. Production is
spread throughout the Midlands and Lancashire, with outposts in other areas.
There are nine companies engaged in the production of rayon, five producing only
viscose, three producing only acetate, and one both viscose and acetate. Technical
problems are studied at the research station of the British Rayon Research Associa¬
tion at Wythenshawe, Manchester.
Nylon is produced from a combination of chemical substances, most of which are
obtained from indigenous raw materials. It was introduced in the United States in
1938 and came into use in Britain in the second world war for parachutes. It is now
in large-scale production in Britain for general textile and industrial purposes.
Annual capacity at the end of 1955 Is expected to be about 30 million pounds.
‘ Terylene’, a product of research in the laboratories of the Calico Printers Asso¬
ciation, Manchester, is at present being made in Britain by Imperial Chemical
Industries Ltd (ICI). A £20 million plant at Wilton, Yorkshire, is now in limited
production and is expected to be fully in operation in 1957- ICI is also setting up a
‘Terylene’ plant in Canada, and the fibre is to be made under licence in France,
the German Federal Republic, Italy and the Netherlands.
‘Ardil’ and ‘Fibrolane' are protein fibres with wool-like properties. ‘Ardil’ was
evolved in the Scottish laboratories of ICI Ltd. Experimental quantities were first
produced in 1938 and a plant with a capacity of about 20 million pounds a year,
started in 1949, is now in production. ‘ Fibrolane ’ is manufactured in commercial
quantities by Courtaulds Ltd.
Since the advent of rayon in its various forms and, more recently, of the new
INDUSTRY

synthetic fibres, British textile manufacturers have been developing a number of
ways of blending these with natural fibres and with each other. By this means they
can produce economically fabrics and garments with attractive and useful new com¬
binations of texture, colour, and finish, and with moisture-absorbent, hard-wearing
and crease-resisting properties.
FOOD, DRINK AND TOBACCO
At the end of 1954 the number of persons employed in this broad group of
industries was as follows:

Total .. .. 880-7
From the export point of view the most important products of these industries are:
whisky (exports of which had a total value of £39 million in 1954); refined sugar
(£27 million); tobacco and tobacco manufactures (£22 million); and chocolate,
chocolate preparations and sugar confectionery (£16J million). Whisky is one of
the United Kingdom’s largest individual dollar earners. Scotch whisky, which was
first distilled at least as far back as the fifteenth century, is now of world-wide
popularity. Modern whiskies are blends of twenty or more different kinds, some
made from malted barley, others from other grains.
Bread and Flour Confectionery
About 90 per cent of the bread eaten in Great Britain is price-controlled national
bread. It is sold at below the economic price and bakers receive a subsidy to make
good the difference. The average weekly consumption of bread per head of popula¬
tion is slightly under 3J pounds. In England and Wales particularly, the small
‘family’ type of baker, producing bread by hand or by semi-mechanical methods,
is still very prevalent, but there is an increasing trend towards large-scale produc¬
tion in fully mechanized bakeries. In the smaller bakeries, flour confectionery is
usually allied to bread production but there are many large specialist manufacturers,
particularly of slab cake. Exports of flour confectionery in 1954 amounted to 617
tons, having a total value of £169,517.
Cocoa, Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery
The chocolate and sugar confectionery industry is composed of a small number
of very large manufacturers and a large number of small manufacturers, and the
202
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
products of the industry are highly competitive and heavily advertised. Approxi¬
mately 97 per cent of the production of chocolate and sugar confectionery in the
United Kingdom and the whole of the output of cocoa powder, cocoa butter and
chocolate covering is produced by about 600 manufacturers and the remaining 3 per
cent of chocolate and sugar confectionery output is produced by about 1,200 small
firms. The main ingredients used by the industry for the manufacture of chocolate
and sweets are sugar, glucose, oils and fats, milk, and cocoa beans, and there are
virtually no restrictions at the present time on the purchase of these materials in
the United Kingdom. Production of chocolate and sugar confectionery continues
to expand, and in the year 1954 over 633,000 tons of finished goods were manu¬
factured for sale in the home and oversea markets compared with about 580,000
tons in 1953. Total home trade sales of chocolate and sugar confectionery to the
general public in 1954 were equivalent to 8-5 ounces per head of the population per
week as compared with 8-i ounces in i953> 5'7 ounces in 1952 and 7 ounces per
head before the war. The value of the industry’s total export of chocolate and sugar
confectionery and cocoa products in 1954 amounted to approximately £i6J million
and constituted a record. In the same year exports of these commodities to the dollar
markets had a total value of £5 J million; this figure was also a record. The industry
employs over 113,000 men and women in the manufacture of chocolate and sugar
confectionery and cocoa products for both the home and export trade.
Brewing and Malting
Brewing. There are some 300 separate breweries located throughout the United
Kingdom, of which the main centres are London, south Lancashire, Burton-on-
Trent (Staffordshire), Birmingham, and Edinburgh. In the main, brewers distribute
their beer for consumption within 30 miles of the brewery, but some of the largest
brewers send their beer all over the country. Much of the beer is consumed in
draught but in recent years the demand for bottled beer has increased and is now
probably as much as one-third of total consumption. Bottling is carried out
by both brewers and independent bottling establishments. There are no short¬
ages of the industry’s raw materials, which are malt (chiefly made from home¬
grown barley), sugar and hops. Consumption is declining, probably because of the
high rate of duty. Nevertheless in the year ended 3Ist March 1954 duty of £255'3
million was paid on 25 ’2 million bulk barrels. Since the war the industry has main¬
tained a useful export trade, which in 1954 was valued at £2‘8 million.
Malting. There are in the United Kingdom about 900 malting units. Some of
these are operated by brewers who make part of their own malt. The remainder are
operated by maltsters who produce chiefly for the brewing industry but also supply
the distilling industry and some food industries, such as bakery, vinegar-making
and malt extracts. There is also a limited production for the textile industry. These
units are mainly situated east of a line drawn from Edinburgh through Burton-on-
Trent (Staffordshire), to Lyme Regis (Dorset), that is, in the chief barley-growing
areas. Of the total malting capacity, 60 per cent is in the eastern half of England,
13 per cent in Staffordshire (nearly all at Burton-on-Trent and in the neighbour¬
hood), 12 per cent in Scotland (mainly Edinburgh) and 15 per cent in the remainder
of the United Kingdom.
Malting usually takes place in the cooler months following the harvest but with
the aid of air-conditioning plant some units can operate throughout the year. Grain
is the only raw material used by the industry and while there are no restrictions on
imported grain, maltsters chiefly use home-grown barley, especially grown for the
purpose. Exports of malt in 1954 were valued at £f2 million.
INDUSTRY
203
Tobacco
In recent years, over £800 million annually has been spent in Britain on cigarettes
and other tobacco goods (of which over two-thirds was revenue). The tobacco manu¬
facturing industry meets virtually the whole of this home demand and, in addition,
exports worth over £22 million are shipped annually to a large number of oversea
markets. Over 42,000 people are employed in the tobacco industry, which is con¬
centrated in Nottingham, Bristol and London. The industry uses nearly 300 million
lb. weight annually of raw tobacco, all of which is imported. The main sources are
the United States, Rhodesia, India and Canada, in that order.
Most of this tobacco goes to make cigarettes and pipe tobaccos. There is, in addi¬
tion, production of cigars and snuff; cigars, chiefly Cuban and Jamaican, are also
imported.

Notes on some of these industries are given below.
Brickmaking
Introduced by the Romans, brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries, and
something like 2,000 different varieties of building bricks are produced in the United
Kingdom today. These are made in over 1,000 active works which range from small
seasonal yards using traditional hand methods to highly mechanized plants some
of which are among the largest and most efficient of their kind in the world. The
industry has made a vigorous recovery from the reduced activity enforced on it
during the war years, and its total output now exceeds 7,000 million bricks a year.
Very little of this output is exported, as the current high levels of building activity
in the United Kingdom demand nearly all the industry can produce.
Refractories
Refractories occupy a key position among the basic industries of Britain, for
without the materials of furnace construction few, if any, high temperature pro¬
cesses, as carried out at present, would be possible, and the development of metal¬
lurgical, glass, ceramic and fuel industries would have been hampered. Recent
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
204
developments in the fields of atomic energy and jet propulsion are also creating a
demand for new and improved refractory ceramics. Not only do refractories have
to resist heat and protect the furnace structure, but they are also expected to resist
the chemical attack of slags and fluxes, to withstand temperature changes without
fracture, to contain hot and erosive charges, and to radiate and transfer heat.
Refractories are essential in the operation of blast furnaces, steel furnaces and
other metallic furnaces; in the refining and manufacture of copper, zinc, aluminium
and other non-ferrous metals; in coke ovens; in the production of electricity; in the
construction of locomotive fireboxes and ships’ boilers; in the production of glass
and cement; in the building of kilns for all the ceramic industries; and in many
chemical processes.
Refractories are made in the form of bricks and in a wide range of other shapes,
according to the requirements of the furnaces and processes in which they are to
be used. They also take the form of cements and compositions. Most of the raw
materials required for the production of refractories, e.g., fireclay, silica and dolo¬
mite, are indigenous; and most of the magnesite is obtained from seawater. Other
raw materials used in much smaller quantities are imported, e.g., chrome, kyanite
and bauxite. ,
The chief centres of the industry are in the Midlands, west Yorkshire, north¬
east England, Scotland, and Wales, but there are also undertakings in other parts
of the United Kingdom. The principal trade association is the National Federation
of Clay Industries, founded in 1928.
Production of refractories of all kinds has averaged about 2 million tons a year
since 1948, mainly for home consumption. Exports in 1954 were valued at about
£2^ million.
Pottery
The pottery industry is one of the oldest craft industries in Great Britain, the
making of domestic pottery dates back to before the Roman occupation. The chief
raw materials, china clay, ball clay and china stone, are to be found mainly in Devon
and Cornwall where known deposits of high quality are expected to last for at least
100 years. .... r o 1
The Stoke-on-Trent area in Staffordshire, comprising the six towns ot btoke,
Burslem, Tunstall, Hanley, Fenton and Longton, is the centre of the industry and
contributes between 75 and 80 per cent of total production. Important factories are
also to be found in Worcester, Derby, Bristol and Poole.
Before the second world war about one-third of the production of domestic
pottery was sold overseas. Of the £31 million worth of pottery produced in 1954,
nearly one-half was exported; bone china accounts for about one-third and earthen¬
ware for two-thirds of these exports. The chief markets are North America. Australia
and South Africa. About three-quarters of all bone china exports go to Canada and
the United States, and while dollar exports of decorated earthenware are about the
same in value, they form a smaller percentage of production.
The modem industry benefits from a tradition of good design and craftsmanship,
made world-famous by a long line of great British potters, which is the basis of the
large oversea and domestic demand for its products. Among the famous makes of
British pottery are: Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton, Minton,
Royal Crown Derby and Coalport.
Sanitary Drain Ware
Other branches of the clay industries produce sanitary ware and stoneware pipes.
Sanitary ware comprises fixtures such as sinks, bath tubs, lavatories, closet pans and
INDUSTRY

similar products. Metals and plastics are now being increasingly used, but there is
still a very large production of sanitary ware in fireclay, earthenware and, to a lesser
extent, vitreous china. The products are of a high technical standard for which there
are exacting British Standard Specifications. Stoneware pipes, also, are made to
exacting specifications for carrying away sewage and other corrosive drainage in
sanitation schemes. These pipes are made from clays rich in silica, highly vitrified
and salt-glazed. They are produced in several districts, mainly by extrusion presses
which have superseded the potter’s wheel. Exports of sanitary and drain ware in
1954 were valued at a total of £3-1 million.
Plate and Sheet Glass
Britain has a large and efficient glass industry with a wide diversity of products.
The section of the industry devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in
their various forms is organized for quantity production, and the development of
modern methods has enabled the industry to cater for an increasing range of re¬
quirements. Glass can now be supplied in sheets of great size and can be made
almost unbreakable. Its use for internal decoration and as a finish for internal and
external walls has greatly extended in recent years. Large quantities of safety glass
are produced for the motor industry. Exports of plate and sheet glass of all types
had a total value of £7-2 million in 1954.
Cement
The cement industry of the United Kingdom is chiefly concerned with the
manufacture of Portland Cement. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented in 1824,
this material and the methods of its production have been the subject of continuous
technical improvement and intensive research. Cement is today one of Britain’s key
industries for all building and civil engineering. The capacity of the industry has
increased substantially since the war. Annual output reached 7 7 million tons in
1938. By 1954 it had become 12 million tons, and it continues to expand. Despite
a high and rising level of home demand, the industry maintains its position as the
largest exporter of cement in the world with markets in over 40 countries. In 1954
the value of these exports totalled £10-9 million.
Scientific Instruments
Scientific instruments, including compasses and microscopes, were made com¬
mercially in Britain at the beginning of the seventeenth century and probably earlier.
During the second world war there was a marked expansion of the industry to
meet defence needs. Since 1945 its production has further increased to meet the pent-
up demands from home and overseas for instruments for use in research and in indus¬
try, where their extended use has become recognized as essential to efficiency. Some
89,000 people, mostly skilled craftsmen, are now employed. In 1954 goods of a wide
variety, including photographic, cinematographic and commercial types of instru¬
ments and apparatus, to the value of approximately £31'4 million were exported
directly, excluding indirect exports of instruments as part of plant and equipment.
Jewellery, Gold and Silver Ware
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware is an industry in which British
craftsmen are heirs to a great tradition. The quality of the metal in gold and silver
wares made or sold in the United Kingdom is guaranteed by a ‘hall-mark’. The
law requires that gold and silver plate shall not be sold until it has been hall¬
marked at one of the Assay Offices. These are in London, Birmingham, Chester,
Sheffield, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
206
The importance of maintaining definite standards of fineness for wares of gold and
silver has always been recognized, and the Goldsmiths’ Company in London has
carried out the assay and hall-marking of such wares since 1327 when Edward III
gave the Company its first charter.
At the end of 1954, 28,000 persons were employed in the manufacture of
jewellery and plate and in the refining of precious metals.
Leather and Footwear
The British leather and leather footwear industries are among the most important in
the world and Britain is the world’s largest exporter of both leather and leather foot¬
wear. The value of exports in 1954 totalled £12 million and £8 million respectively.
Despite the growing use of rubber and of plastics and other synthetic materials in cloth¬
ing, footwear and personal articles, leather possesses intrinsic qualities which enable it
to hold its own. Both industries are striving to maintain and improve their competi¬
tive position and they are assisted by the work of the British Leather Manufac¬
turers’ Research Association and the British Boot, Shoe and Allied Trades Research
Association, which are furthering the application of technology in these industries
based upon traditional craft.
At the end of 1954, about 63,000 persons were employed in the leather and
leather goods industries, while 121,000 were employed in the manufacture of boots
and shoes.
Paper and Board
The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until 1678,
but records show that some paper was produced as far back as the year 1492. Until
1803 all paper had been made by hand, but in that year a machine was invented to
produce paper in a continuous web. In the succeeding half-century various pro¬
cesses were developed for producing woodpulp, and it was during this period that
esparto grass was first used as a paper-making material.
Today there are many different materials used in the manufacture of paper and
board: i.e. woodpulp, esparto grass, straw, waste of hemp, flax and jute, rags and
waste paper; and the consumption of these materials now totals some 3-3 million
tons a year, of which about two-thirds comes from abroad. The other third consists
mainly of domestic waste paper, and consumption of this material, mostly in the
production of board and the cheaper types of paper, is over one million tons a year.
Total production in 1954 of all types of paper and board (including newsprint)
amounted to over 3 million tons, the highest figure ever reached, compared with a
pre-war figure of 2-6 million tons. Of this, newsprint accounted for 612,000 tons
as against 800,000 tons pre-war. Exports for the same period amounted to 277,000
tons valued at £33 million, an increase of about 400 per cent by value over 1938.
Included in this amount is 127,000 tons of newsprint with a value of £7 million.
The bulk of the export trade is to countries in the sterling area, mainly to Australia,
South Africa, New Zealand and the Irish Republic.
During the second world war, the industry suffered a serious setback by the loss
of many paper-making machines through enemy action, but in spite of this it has
made a great recovery by the installation of new machines and the modernization
of existing plant. Today the industry comprises some 209 mills producing almost
every type of paper and board, including the world s largest paper machine pro¬
ducing a web of newsprint 302 inches wide. There are also many firms engaged in
the conversion of paper and board for various purposes. In addition, the industry
has considerable interests abroad, with pulp and paper producing mills in the
INDUSTRY 207
United States, Canada and other parts of the Commonwealth, and in the Scandi¬
navian countries.
There has been a considerable amount of research on raw materials and their
economical use, new and more efficient methods of generating steam have been
introduced, and there is now a much wider use of technical knowledge at the various
mills. Already expansion schemes running into many millions of pounds sterling
have been announced with the result that within the next few years there will
be a large increase in production of paper and board, and especially of newsprint.
Rubber
The United Kingdom rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the world,
dating from 1819 when Hancock, the inventor of the first method of processing raw
rubber on a commercial scale, set up a factory in London. He afterwards colla¬
borated with Macintosh, the inventor of water-proof garments, and it was another
Scotsman, Dunlop, who in 1888 devised the pneumatic tyre as it is now used. At
the present day, tyres and tubes represent more than half the total output of the
industry. More recently British firms have pioneered cellular rubber products, and
they also make a great variety of other rubber manufactures, such as rubber foot¬
wear, belting, cables, hose and thread.
The industry is second in size only to that of the United States, employing some
120,000 workers and consuming 11 per cent of the world’s total consumption of
natural and synthetic rubber. There are some 800 firms scattered widely throughout
the country. In 1954 they exported £36-5 million worth of goods, two-thirds of
this being tyres and tubes. This figure does not take into account the large indirect
exports on motor vehicles.
Although the industry is highly mechanized there is still room for craftsmanship,
as in the building of a tyre, where perfect quality depends on the skill of the
individual. To maintain the technical superiority of the industry, advanced experi¬
mental work is carried out at the Shrewsbury laboratories of the Research
Association of British Rubber Manufacturers.
VI. TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS
SHIPPING
Nearly 20 per cent of the world’s shipping tonnage of 100 gross tons and over is
registered in the United Kingdom, which has the largest merchant navy in active
employment. A greater tonnage—27 million—is registered in the United States but
over half of this is in the Reserve Fleet. United Kingdom ships probably carry over
one quarter of the world’s international sea-borne traffic in passengers and goods,
and ply regularly on the routes linking the countries of the Commonwealth (see
back end-paper map) and also to most of the main ports throughout the world.
As an invisible export, the earnings of the United Kingdom shipping services make
one of the largest contributions to the United Kingdom’s balance of payments; in
1954 this contribution was £132 million. That figure excludes the earnings of the
tanker fleet, but takes account of payments for the carriage of United Kingdom
imports in foreign ships and the disbursements which foreign ships make in United
Kingdom ports.
THE MERCHANT FLEET
As at 30th June 1954, a total of just over 19 million gross tons of merchant
shipping (100 gross tons and over and excluding sailing ships and barges) was
registered in the United Kingdom. In 1939 the tonnage was 17-9 million and in
1930 was at its highest level of 20-3 million.
Notable trends in the composition of the merchant fleet in recent years have been
the fall of tramp tonnage—by one million tons since 1935 to just over three million
tons—the growth of tanker tonnage, and the commissioning of vessels specially
built to carry ore, sugar and other commodities in bulk. Including Admiralty and
other tankers, the United Kingdom accounts for nearly five million gross tons or
20 per cent of the world’s total tanker tonnage.
Propulsion
The amount of coal-fired tonnage has fallen in recent years to only a little more
than one million tons. Oil has taken the place of coal in steamships, while steam
has continued to give place to the diesel engine, about 40 per cent of all tonnage
being diesel driven in 1954. The latest development is the investigation being made
into the use of gas turbines in ships. In March 1952 the first crossing of the Atlantic
using this form of propulsion was made by the tanker Amis.
Age Distribution
The age distribution of the fleet as a whole and of tanker tonnage separately is
shown in Table 26.
Size Distribution
The size distribution of ships is given in Table 27. About 52 per cent of liner
tonnage—passenger and cargo—is in the 6,000-10,000 tons group, and over 68
per cent in the 6,000-15,000 tons group. Tankers are predominantly in the 8,000-
15,000 tons group, with a tendency to increased size. Tramps are under 8,000 tons

and mainly over 5,000. Fifty per cent of vessels in the coasting and home trades
are in the 1,000-3,000 tons group, only 17 per cent being over that size.
There are four ships of 30,000 tons and over. These are the Queen Elizabeth
(83,000 tons), the Queen Mary (81,000 tons), the Mauretania (35,667 tons), and the
Caronia (34,000 tons) operated by the Cunard Steamship Company on its trans¬
atlantic services.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SHIPPING ORGANIZATIONS
Excluding Government-owned tankers, cable ships, passenger ships used as
troopers and emigrant ships, and ships owned by the British Transport Commission
(see p. 222), the business of merchant shipping in peace time is in the hands of
private enterprise. The main organizations concerned with the activities, interests
and common problems of the industry are as follows:
The Corporation of Lloyd's
This body, which was founded in the seventeenth century, is a society of under¬
writers whose main business is marine insurance (see also p. 294).
Lloyd's Register of Shipping
Lloyd’s Register is an organization, distinct from the Corporation, which surveys
and classifies ships with particular regard to their safety and operational efficiency.
It will accept responsibility for surveying and giving technical advice on vessels of
all flags from the initial stages of building, at regular intervals during their service,
and after casualties. A satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an under¬
writer that he may accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between
the Register and the Corporation of Lloyd’s.
Shipowners' Organizations
The representative bodies speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for the
most part, owners of fishing vessels) are the Chamber of Shipping and the Liverpool
Steamship Ozvners' Association. The General Council of British Shipping co-ordinates
the views of the shipping industry as a whole on all matters of major policy.
There are a number of local associations of shipowners centred around the main
port areas. There are, for example, the Bristol Steamship Owners' Association, the
London General Shipowners' Society, and the North of England Shipowners' Associa¬
tion. Others represent companies specializing in a particular trade or type of cargo.
Employers' Organizations
The Shipping Federation and the Employers' Association of the Port of Liverpool
are the employers’ organizations concerned with labour relations and the regula¬
tion of employment throughout the Merchant Navy. They are responsible for the
administration of the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, under which
shipowners engaging crews for ships of 200 tons and above engage them through
the Merchant Navy Establishment Administration unless they are prepared to offer
two-year Company Service contracts. The Shipping Federation is also responsible
for the day-to-day operation of the National Sea Training Schools set up for the
purpose of training ratings for the deck and catering departments and as firemen.
Seafarers' Organizations
Shipmasters are represented by the Mercantile Marine Service Association; navi¬
gating officers, engineer officers, apprentices, cadets, pursers and ships’ surgeons by
the Navigators and Engineer Officers' Union; and radio officers by the Radio Officers'
Union. Some engineer officers are represented by the Marine Engineers' Association,
and uncertificated engineer officers by the Amalgamated Engineering Union. The
interests of the deck, engine-room and catering ratings are represented by the
National Union of Seamen.
The National Maritime Board
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representatives
of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations of wages and
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
211
conditions of service in the Merchant Navy, although, except by special arrange¬
ment, National Maritime Board Agreements do not apply to vessels under 200
gross tons, or to certain other ships, including tugs and salvage vessels. Detailed
working of the Board is carried on by a number of ‘ panels ’ representing the various
interests of those forming the seafarers’ part of the Board.
Conferences
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a series
of ‘ conferences ’ designed to secure standardization and stability of rates, and to
maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle of a confer¬
ence is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or passenger fares
from each port of departure. Each conference meets from time to time to review
and revise existing rates, or to compile new ones. Some of the conferences may
be connected by rate agreements, or may have joined together to form wider
groupings.
The Baltic Exchange
British tramp shipping, and indeed the tramp shipping of the world, is offered
and engaged for charter hire in London’s Baltic Exchange, where ship brokers and
owners meet and arrange contracts for the movement of all types of cargo between
any ports in the world.
RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT
The relations of the State with merchant shipping go back as far as 1381 when
the first of a series of Navigation Acts was passed. In the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries these Acts were designed to give British ships a monopoly in the carriage
of goods to and from Britain and its Colonies. The last of them was repealed in 1849
under the influence of free trade ideas. But the same period found the State taking
an increasing interest in the shipping industry, particularly in matters of safety and
welfare. Today, the Government Department chiefly concerned is the Ministry of
Transport and Civil Aviation. In the sphere of safety, it is responsible for such
matters as seeing that the load-line, which shows the depth to which a ship may
be safely loaded, is correctly indicated; that every ship has adequate life-saving,
fire-fighting and radio equipment; and that the necessary standard of safety is main¬
tained in passenger ship construction; and, in addition, it administers the Coast¬
guard Service. The Ministry is also responsible for the issuing of certificates of
competency to masters, navigating and engineer officers, able seamen and lifeboat-
men, and for the certification of ships’ cooks. It also regulates such matters as crew
accommodation on board ship, scales and quality of provisions, and the carriage of
medical stores. It is responsible for running the Mercantile Marine offices at United
Kingdom ports, the Superintendents of which have statutory duties in connection
with the engagement and discharge of crews, and for the General Register and
Record office of Shipping and Seamen, where ships’ logs and lists and central
registers of shipping and seamen are kept. The Ministry is represented on the
Merchant Navy Welfare Board (see p. 214) and on the Merchant Navy Training
Board (see pp. 212-3). It has important duties under the Oil in Navigable Waters
Act, 1955, which enables effect to be given to the International Convention for the
Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oii of 1954 and re-enacts, wdth amendments,
the main provisions of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1922, which prohibited
the discharge of oil into United Kingdom territorial waters. The Act designates
212
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
areas of the sea outside United Kingdom territorial waters within which United
Kingdom registered ships must not discharge oil of a persistent character. It also
enables the Minister to require ships to be fitted with equipment for preventing
or reducing oil pollution and makes provision for the installation of facilities in
United Kingdom ports for the reception of oil residues from ships.
Apart from these administrative functions, the Ministry maintains a close and
friendly liaison with the shipping industry on matters of policy and problems rela¬
ting to imports and exports and also special passenger requirements.
Abroad, certain parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts, in particular those provi¬
sions dealing with the engagement and discharge of crews outside the United King¬
dom, are administered by H.M. Consuls and by officers of Commonwealth and
Colonial Governments.
Lighthouses, Pilotage and Rescue
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation administers the Coastguard Ser¬
vice. This is primarily a life-saving organization which keeps watch at danger points
around the coast for vessels in distress and renders assistance either by means of
rocket life-saving apparatus or by informing other authorities who may be in a
position to give help. There are some 170 stations manned by 560 regular Coast¬
guards together with a further 150 stations manned in bad weather by civilian
volunteers forming the Coast Life-Saving Corps. Members of the Corps, which is
about S.ooo strong, also operate the rocket life-saving apparatus. There is close
liaison between the Coastguard Service and the Royal National Lifeboat Institu¬
tion. The latter maintains lifeboats around the coast of the United Kingdom; it is
supported entirely by voluntary subscriptions, and depends largely for its operation
on voluntary workers.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House which received its first Royal
Charter in the sixteenth century. It is also the chief pilotage authority in the United
Kingdom, having the management of all matters relating to pilots and pilotage in
the London area, the English Channel and certain other coastal districts of the
United Kingdom. (Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility
respectively of the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses and the Commissioners
of Irish Lights.) This Corporation is administered by a Board of ten Elder Brethren
elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.
THE MERCHANT NAVY
Strength
The number of masters, officers and men (excluding Asiatic seamen serving on
articles of agreement opened in Asia) making up the strength of the British Merchant
Navy in December 1954 was about 148,600. In addition about 45,000 Indian, Paki¬
stani and other Asiatic seamen serve regularly in British ships.
Training
Nautical training in the United Kingdom has two distinct objectives, first to give
intending entrants into the Merchant Navy an introductory training before going
to sea—this is commonly known as ‘pre-sea training’ and secondly, to prepare
those, who have already performed the requisite sea-service qualifying them for
admission to the examinations, for the various statutory and other certificates
granted by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.
The Merchant Navy Training Board has been set up to consider and make
recommendations concerning the training of the various classes of boys and men
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
213
who enter the different departments in the Merchant Navy. It rests with the shipping
industry itself and the appropriate Government Departments, however, to decide
whether any particular recommendation should be adopted.
The main function of the Board is in promoting, encouraging and guiding the
instruction and studies at sea of apprentices and cadets who are preparing for their
examinations for certificates of competency as second mate.
Pre-sea training is not compulsory for those who go to sea as apprentices or
cadets but most shipping companies will, in practice, accept only those who have
undergone such a course. There are a number of residential and non-residential
training establishments (some of which are public schools) which provide courses
of varying length. The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation allows a proportion
of the time spent in approved establishments to count towards the period of sea
service which the apprentice or cadet is required to perform before becoming eligible
to take the examination for a second mate’s certificate. Navigating officers become
eligible for examinations for first mate’s and master’s certificates after further
periods of qualifying sea service.
Sea-going engineer officers usually receive their basic training in engineering by
serving a suitable apprenticeship of not less than four years in engineering work¬
shops ashore, although part of this period may be spent at approved courses in
mechanical engineering. An alternative scheme of training has, however, recently
been introduced under which shipping companies themselves select apprentices
for a special course of training consisting of a two-year diploma course in a techni¬
cal college, followed by eighteen months’ training at sea and finally twelve months’
training in an engineering workshop ashore. Sea-going engineer officers are first
employed as junior engineers: they become eligible to take examinations for
second and first class certificates of competency after performing periods of
qualifying sea service.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of proficiency in wireless tele¬
graphy issued by the Postmaster-General on the results of an open examination.
All boys who wish to join the Merchant Navy as deck or junior catering ratings
must undergo a course of pre-sea training. The majority receive their training at
the National Sea Training Schools but courses are also provided by certain
private organizations and by a number of local education authorities.
A seaman may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom registered
ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B., granted by the Ministry
of Transport and Civil Aviation. To obtain this certificate a seaman must, among
other qualifications, have served three years at sea on deck, have attained a certifi¬
cate of proficiency as lifeboatman and have passed an oral and practical qualifying
examination. This qualifying examination for the certificate may, however, be
taken on reaching the age of 18 after twelve months’ service at sea as a deck rating,
and those who pass may be issued with an efficient deck hand certificate, which
enables the holder to serve at sea in a similar capacity to an A.B.
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of petty officer. Service
as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examination for a
second mate’s certificate.
Conditions of Employment and Welfare
Wages and conditions of employment are negotiated by the National Maritime
Board (see p. 210). Minimum wages and holidays with pay are guaranteed for both
officers and ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme,
introduced by the Board in 1947, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take two-year
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
214
contracts, not only with individual shipping companies but with the industry as a
whole, and get special benefits, in addition to the normal unemployment insurance
benefit when they are ashore between voyages.
The Merchant Navy Welfare Board, on which are represented officers’ and
seamen’s unions and associations, shipowners, voluntary societies, the Ministries
of Transport and Civil Aviation, Labour and National Service, Pensions and
National Insurance, and the Colonial Office, has been responsible since 1948 for
the control and co-ordination of the welfare services for merchant seamen in the
United Kingdom and of British merchant seamen abroad.
In the United Kingdom, the Board runs 15 Port Welfare Committees and has
regional seamen’s welfare officers in Glasgow, Liverpool and South Shields. It
manages directly a number of Merchant Navy houses and clubs, and many others
are run by voluntary societies. In oversea ports the voluntary societies run some
300 clubs for British merchant seamen.
PORTS
There are over 300 ports in the United Kingdom. The ten largest are shown in
Table 28, which lists them in order of tonnage of shipping arriving and departing
and does not relate to the volume of cargo handled. Most ports, other than those
owned by the British Transport Commission, are represented on the Dock and
Harbour Authorities’ Association, formed in 1917 to represent the common interests
of port authorities in their relations with Government, shipowners and traders.

The Port of London, with 69 miles of waterway and over 4,000 acres of dock
estate, handles more tonnage annually than any other port in the world except New
York. Goods of every imaginable kind, from meat to marble, from plywood to
perfume, pass through the docks. Imports are distributed all over the United
London Airport, showing

Counties which have a population of some 11J million persons.
Liverpool—with Manchester, an inland city made into a port by the construction
of the Manchester Ship Canal—serves the industrial Midlands, Lancashire and
Yorkshire. Grain is prominent among the imports of Liverpool, which, including
Birkenhead on the opposite bank of the Mersey, is the second largest milling centre
in the world. Tobacco is another major import and is stored in what is probably the
world’s largest warehouse. Liverpool is also important for transatlantic passenger
traffic and short sea-route and coastwise trading. Manchester’s chief import is raw
cotton.
Southampton, largest of the Channel ports, is the chief port for ocean passenger
traffic. It owes its importance to its double tides and easy access from London.
A considerable volume of oil is now handled for the refinery at Fawley.
Newcastle upon Tyne and the other Tyne ports serve the industrial North-East
and comprise the most important coal-shipping and largest ship-repairing centre
in the country.
Hull, on the Humber estuary, serves particularly the industrial centres of York¬
shire and the Midlands. Middlesbrough imports iron ore for, and exports iron and
steel from, the local iron and steel industries.
Swansea has the largest trade of the group of ports serving South Wales. As
well as coal, Swansea exports the steel and tinplate manufactured in its immediate
neighbourhood, but its rapidly increasing importance derives largely from the oil
which it imports and exports for local refineries.
Bristol and Avonmouth serve the industrial Midlands as well as the highly
industrialized city of Bristol itself, and have also a large coastal trade.
Glasgow, the principal Scottish port, serves as an entrepot centre for the industrial
area dependent on the Lanarkshire coalfields.
Grangemouth, also in Scotland, handles mainly crude oil for the local refinery,
and also imports timber and paper-making materials.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and handles the main Irish
Sea traffic.
Ownership
The ports, in some cases docks only, previously owned by the main-line railway
companies are now under national ownership and are administered by the British
Transport Commission (see p. 217). The Commission owns about 30 per cent of
Britain’s dock accommodation with a total of over half a million feet of quays. A few
of the Commission’s ports are docks developed by former canal undertakings such
as the Aire and Calder Navigation which developed Goole. The rest are those
formerly owned by the railways. In some cases—e.g., at Southampton and
Middlesbrough—the railways owned the main docks in ports where the statutory
authority was a harbour board. In other cases—e.g., at Grangemouth, Garston and
Grimsby—the port was largely developed by the railway company which was itself
the statutory harbour authority. Some railway-owned ports were, and still are,
mainly used for the railways’ cross-channel services: Folkestone, Harwich, New-
haven, Fishguard, Holyhead, and Heysham are in this category. Among other ports
owned by the Commission are Hull, Swansea, Newport, and Cardiff. In 1954,
nearly 67^ million tons of cargo were handled at the Commission’s docks and
harbours, at which, at the end of the year, about 21,000 people were employed.
P
2I6 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other ports are controlled by a public trust on which are represented users of the
port (such as shippers, importers and shipping companies) and other bodies such
as Government Departments and local authorities. Examples are London (con¬
trolled by the Port of London Authority), Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour
Board), Belfast (Belfast Harbour Commissioners) and Glasgow (Clyde Navigation
Trust) The Port of London Authority has 28 members. Ten of the members are
nominated as follows: by the Admiralty (1), the Ministry of Transport and Civil
Aviation (2), the London County Council (4), the Corporation of the City of
London (2), and the Corporation of Trinity House (1). Eighteen of the members
represent various port users: shipowners (8), merchants (8), owners of river craft
(1), and public wharfingers (1). The Authority’s duties include the maintenance
of ’adequate river channels, the regulation of traffic, the provision and upkeep of
moorings and the licensing of wharves and structures in the area under its control.
A few ports—Bristol is the most important example—are owned by the town
or city council and controlled entirely by a committee of the council.
Finally, there are about 100 ports which are privately owned. Manchester is the
only major port so owned—by the Manchester Ship Canal Company and here
the Manchester City Council exercises considerable control by appointing 1 x of the
Company’s 21 directors.
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the mam, set
down in private Acts of Parliament which relate specifically to the ports concerned.
Labour
There are about 150,000 people employed in the operation of British ports. Just
under half of these are administrative, clerical and technical staff, and pilots, lighter¬
men, customs officials and so on. Over half are the dock workers (formerly and still
popularly called ‘ dockers ’) who do the physical work of handling cargo.
Shipping arrivals and departures do not all conform to a regular schedule, wim
the result that there is sometimes too much work for the dock workers available,
sometimes too little. Dock labour was therefore largely casual labour until 1941 >
when war-time schemes were introduced to control the port registers of employers
and workers. The war-time schemes were superseded in 1947 by a permanent
scheme administered by the National Dock Labour Board. Workers on these registers
now receive a guaranteed minimum wage even when there is not enough work for
all of them. The Board consists of a chairman, vice-chairman, and eight members
appointed by the Minister of Labour and National Service, four to represent
employers’ and four to represent dock workers.
INLAND TRANSPORT
In 1954 the number of passenger journeys made by public transport (road and
rail) in the United Kingdom was about 17,000 million, just under one per day for
every person in the country. In addition, about 3 million motor cars and over one
million motor cycles were licensed for use on the roads. The annual mileage of most
of these vehicles is believed to be between five and ten thousand. Journeys by public
transport are mainly short and a great many of them are to and from places of work.
The resultant concentration of travel in the morning and evening ‘ rush hours consti¬
tutes a formidable problem in London and other centres of industry and commerce.
The extent of freight traffic in the United Kingdom can be roughly gauged from
the fact that in 1954 British Railways carried over 22,000 million net ton miles of
1 Net ton miles are calculated by multiplying the tonnage carried by the actual distance
it was carried.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 217
goods, while there were nearly a million goods vehicles on the roads, the aggregate
net ton mileage of which is believed to be little less than that of the railways.
The dense traffic of the United Kingdom is carried mainly by road and rail,
though some freight is carried by canal. There are in the United Kingdom some
52,000 miles of railway track and nearly 200,000 miles of road, of which only about
one quarter may be classed as main roads. The railway network was developed
mainly in the nineteenth century from 1840 onwards (and there are now more
railways per square mile in Britain than in any other country, except Belgium),
while the building of new roads and the widening and strengthening of old ones to
accommodate the increasing motor vehicle traffic has been, and still is, a feature of
the twentieth century.
The State has for a long time exercised considerable control over public transport
operators, and the scope and degree of regulation in the interest both of public
safety and of efficiency has increased throughout the twentieth century.
THE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION
The Transport Act, 1947
On 1 st January 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act,
1947, most of Great Britain’s1 inland transport system, other than road transport,
passed into public ownership. On that date, the railways, all railway-owned steam¬
ships, docks, hotels and road transport interests, most of the country’s canals
(including all those owned by the railways) and the whole of London’s passenger
transport system came under the control of the British Transport Commission, a
public corporation which was given the duty of providing an efficient, adequate,
economical and properly integrated system of public inland transport and port
facilities for passengers and goods. In addition, the Commission was to arrange for
the gradual acquisition of privately owned long-distance road haulage firms.
Road passenger transport outside London was not taken over, but the Commis¬
sion was given power to prepare area schemes for co-ordinating passenger services
by road and rail, including power to acquire road passenger undertakings for this
purpose. A considerable amount of road haulage, several waterways and many docks
were left outside the Commission’s scope.
By the 1947 Act, the Commission was made responsible to the Minister of
Transport (now the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation) who, in turn, is
responsible to Parliament. The Minister was to appoint the members of the
Commission, and was empowered to give general directions to the Commission in
the national interest and to approve the general outline of programmes of major
development and of training, education and research. With the consent of the
Minister, the Commission was given borrowing powers up to £275 million,
increased to £600 million in 1955. An annual report and statement of accounts was
to be submitted to the Minister who would lay it before Parliament. Jurisdiction
over transport charges of all kinds was given to the Transport Tribunal (formerly
the Railway Rates Tribunal established in 1921): all charges schemes proposed by
the Commission were to be approved by the Tribunal. Transport users were to be
given an opportunity of putting forward criticism and constructive suggestions for
improving transport services through a Central Transport Consultative Committee
for Great Britain and Area Transport Users’ Consultative Committees, including
one each for Scotland and Wales. The members of these Committees were to be

(Northern Ireland), 1948 (see p. 233).
2Ig BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
appointed by the Minister, after consultation with the interests concerned, to
represent commerce, industry, agriculture, labour and local authorities. The
Minister would also appoint members from persons nominated by the Commission.
Eleven area committees have in fact been set up. They report to the Central
Committee and the Commission, and the Central Committee reports to the Com¬
mission and the Minister who may give directions to the Commission upon any
recommendation of the Central Committee. (Since 1953, the Scottish and Welsh
committees also report direct to the Minister, who may give directions upon their
recommendations.) . ,
As agents of the Commission, six executives were appointed to run ditterent
parts of the system it took over: (i) the Railway Executive, to be responsible for the
railways, which were organized in six regions; (2) the Road Transport Executive,
which in June 1949 was renamed the Road Haulage Executive, to operate long¬
distance road transport which was organized in eight geographical divisions ; (3) the
Road Passenger Executive, which was set up in June 1949 as a planning and
advisory body to promote area schemes for the co-ordination of road passenger
transport services; (4) the Hotels Executive to run the railway hotels and catering
services- (5) the London Transport Executive to operate road and rail passenger
transport in the London area; and (6) the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive
to be responsible for canals and the former railway-owned docks.
The Transport Act, 1953
Changes in the organization briefly outlined above have been put into effect
under the Transport Act, 1953.
The broad purpose of this Act was described by the Minister of Transport,
speaking for the Conservative Government during the second reading of the Bill.
He said: ‘We believe that competition gives a better service than monopoly. Vs e
believe that the best way to have a good service is through decentralization, and
that independent private enterprise, or in the case of the railways, regional enter¬
prise, is the best way to achieve this decentralization.
The main provisions of this Act were accordingly directed to returning road
haulage to private enterprise by arranging for the disposal of most of the Commis¬
sion’s road haulage undertaking, and to increasing the competitive efficiency of the
railways. To this end the Commission was ordered to submit a scheme of railway
organization and decentralization including the abolition of the Railway Executive;
it was also given more latitude in fixing railway charges.
Other important provisions of the Act were as follows:
1. The Commission’s power to make area schemes for the co-ordination of
road and rail passenger services and trade harbours schemes was revoked.
2. The Commission’s maximum membership was increased. It now consists
of a chairman and up to 14 members, all of whom may be part-time.
All the Commission’s Executives, except the Road Passenger Executive which
had been abolished in October 1952 and the London Transport Executive which
has been retained, were abolished as from 1st October 1953*
Present Organization
After various interim arrangements, the Commission adopted the following
organization as from 1 st January 1955. . .
The Commission remains a policy-making and not a managing body. It works
through six policy-making Committees each dealing with one particular subject in
relation to all the Commission’s activities, and through Sub-Commissions which
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
219
are not policy-making but each of which takes a special interest on behalf of the
Commission in the activities of one of the ‘ Divisions ’ (see below) and serves as a
clear and easy channel of approach to the Commission. Committees and Sub-
Commissions are composed of members of the Commission. There is also a General
Staff which channels all communications from Divisions, railway areas and London
Transport, after such co-ordination as may be required, to the appropriate
Committee or Sub-Commission.
The separate activities of the undertaking are called Divisions, except in the case
of London Transport which, as already noted, has retained its Executive. There are
seven Divisions: British Railways, British Road Services, Tilling (bus) Group,
Scottish Omnibus Group, British Transport Docks, British Transport Water¬
ways, and British Transport Hotels and Catering Services. The Divisions con¬
cerned with road services, docks and waterways are managed by Boards of Manage¬
ment, the two bus groups retain their group status for the purpose of management,
and the hotels and catering services are run by a General Manager without a
Board. Management of British Railways is in the hands of six Area Boards (the
areas corresponding with the former regions) which leave day-to-day management
to the General Managers of the areas. The Boards are appointed by the Commission
and consist of not more than seven persons, one or more of whom must be a member
of the Commission and the rest drawn in part from outside the industry but not
representative of any particular interest. Certain railway matters are reserved to
the Commission, including the design, manufacture and standards of maintenance
of locomotives, rolling stock, permanent way and signalling; major labour relations;
the general level of charges and the broader aspects of financial control; and general
commercial policy. These matters are dealt with by the British Railways Division,
which consists of a Central Staff for British Railways, the General Managers’
Committee and the British Railways Committees. The Railways Sub-Commission
is available to give quick decisions on behalf of the Commission to the Division’s
staff and to resolve at once any problems which arise between it and the regions.
Financial Results
During 1954, the Commission earned a working surplus of £45-5 million (see
Table 29 overleaf), but this was insufficient to meet interest and other charges and
the net result was a deficit of £11-9 million (compared with a surplus of £4-2
million in 1953) which brought the cumulative deficit during the Commission’s
seven years of working to £39 million. The working surplus in 1954 was £13-9
million less than in 1953 due to a fall in the net traffic receipts of British Railways.
The Commission explains the deterioration by the fact that fares and freight charges
were never able to catch up with rising costs in the shape of higher wage and price
levels.
RAILWAYS
In 1954, 99i»i93,o°0 passenger journeys were made on British Railways, which
also carried 283,498,000 tons of freight.
Britain was the pioneer of railway development, which provided the improved
transport essential to industrial and commercial expansion.
Railroads were in use around pits and iron works before the end of the sixteenth
century. Trucks were mainly drawn by horses. The first railroad to carry goods for
the public was the Surrey Iron Railway built between Wandsworth and Croydon in
1801 to 1803. In 1812, William Hedley, a colliery engineer, following up the work
of William Symington, William Murdock, Richard Trevithick and others, showed
how locomotives could be used on railroads. About the same time, George

Stephenson began to improve locomotive design. In 1825 the Stockton to Darling-
tonPrailway was opened and became the first public railroad on which locomotives
were used. The first public line built expressly to use only locomotive haulage was
the Liverpool and Manchester railway of 1830. Stephensons Rocket was t
chosen locomotive, as a result of a competition in 1829. From that time, the poten¬
tialities of the locomotive railway began to be fully developed.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
221
At first, railway projects were mainly local, promoted by groups of people con¬
cerned with the needs of particular areas. Parliamentary sanction had to be sought
for each project. The general opinion was that the company would provide the
track but would not necessarily act as carriers. Private carriers often ran their
vehicles over the companies’ lines. But the realization that for reasons of safety and
efficiency the company must have all traffic under its own control was endorsed by
a Parliamentary Committee in 1839. Railway building was particularly rapid
between 1840 and 1875, with a short lull following the collapse of a speculative
railway boom in 1846. This period also saw the beginning of a process of amalgama¬
tion in order to achieve the economies of concentration and large-scale operation.
The State began to intervene. Thus in 1846 an Act of Parliament prescribed a
standard gauge of 4 feet 8J inches for all new lines except extensions of the Great
Western Railway which had a gauge of 7 feet. Not until 1892 was the Great
Western gauge completely converted to the standard gauge. In 1850 statutory
recognition was given to the Railway Clearing House which began in 1842 and had
the function of facilitating through traffic by providing for the adjustment of
balances between companies. The Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1854 laid upon
the companies the obligation of providing reasonable facilities, especially for through
traffic, and of avoiding undue preference between users. In 1873 jurisdiction under
this Act was given to a body of three Railway Commissioners, renamed the Railway
and Canal Commission in 1888. The Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888 drew
up a standard freight classification and schedules of maximum freight charges
which came into operation in 1893. A company wishing to increase these rates had
to justify itself to the Railway and Canal Commission.
During the 1914-18 war the railways were controlled by the Government, acting
through a Railway Executive Committee consisting of the general managers of
some of the larger companies. This arrangement made clear the advantages of con¬
centration and it was decided that the handing back of the railways to the companies
should be accompanied by a comprehensive reorganization. By the Railways Act of
1921, 123 companies were amalgamated into four large groups the London,
Midland and Scottish; London and North Eastern; Great Western; and Southern.
A new tribunal, the Railway Rates Tribunal, was established to take over the Rail¬
way and Canal Commission’s jurisdiction over charges and questions of undue
preference. It was to carry out an annual review of standard rates and fares which
were to be adjusted with reference to the principle of maintaining to the companies
a standard net revenue equivalent to that of 1913.
In the inter-war years, the railways suffered both from the general industrial
depression and from the growing competition of road transport, and the standard
net revenue was never earned. Efforts were made to improve services and efficiency.
In 1928 powers were obtained from Parliament to own and operate road services.
But the railways were at a disadvantage in competing with road hauliers; the latter
were not, as were the railways, bound to accept all traffic; their rates were flexible and
did not need to avoid undue preference, and they were not heavily capitalized under¬
takings. In 1938, the railways put forward ‘ Square Deal ’ proposals calling for relief
from statutory regulation of charges and for freedom to decide for themselves the
rates for merchandise carried. The campaign was interrupted by the outbreak of
war in 1939 when the railways again passed under the control of the Government,
acting, as in the 1914-18 war, through a Railway Executive Committee.
After the war came the Transport Act of 1947 bringing the railways under public
ownership, operated on behalf of the British Transport Commission by a Railway
Executive as a single enterprise known as British Railways with six regional sub¬
divisions—London-Midland, Western, Eastern, Southern, North Eastern, and
222 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scottish—corresponding broadly to the former compames. The reorganization
following the Transport Act of 1953 is outlined on pages 218-19.

At the end of 1954 there were 384 railway refreshment rooms, of which 64 were
operated by tenants and 320 by British Transport Hotels and Catering Services
which also operated 36 hotels. Two hotels were operated by tenants. Hotels and
catering services staff numbered i5,37I*
Development of British Railways
During the first seven years of the British Transport Commission’s life to the
end of 1954, capital expenditure on British Railways amounted to £286 million.
Much of this was accounted for by maintenance, including arrears of maintenance
inherited from the war period, and renewal of rolling stock. But several new lines of
development were undertaken, including the electrification of the line between
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
223
Main Lines to be Electrified
Wath, Sheffield and Manchester—the first electrification of a main line in Britain
for freight as well as passenger traffic—and the introduction of diesel rail cars in
West Yorkshire. Existing development projects have now been incorporated in a
£1,200 million modernization and re-equipment programme announced by the
Commission in January 1955, which is based on the premise that work on its main
components will be capable of being started within five years and completed within
fifteen. The Commission expects that the result will ultimately be to improve the
financial position of the railways by at least £85 million a year. The programme is
to be financed partly from internal sources and partly by the issue of Transport
Stock for which a Treasury guarantee will be available.
Major features of the programme are the remodelling of freight services and the
progressive displacement of steam by diesel and electric traction. As regards freight
services, operations are to be completely reorientated so as to speed up movement,
224 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
reduce costs, provide direct transit for main streams of traffic and to attract to the
railway a due proportion of the full-load merchandise traffic which would otherwise
pass by road. Larger wagons are to be introduced, continuous brakes are to be
fitted to all wagons, and marshalling yards, goods stations and handling facilities
are to be improved. As regards traction, electricity is regarded as the ideal alterna¬
tive to steam, especially where traffic is dense, but the substantial engineering work
involved in converting a length of line to electric traction imposes a limit on the
amount of main-line electrification that can be completed during the x 5-year period.
Thus, during that period, it is proposed to electrify two major trunk routes—from
London (King’s Cross) to Leeds, and from London (Euston) to Birmingham,
Liverpool and Manchester; to extend the existing electrification from London
(Liverpool Street) to Ipswich, including some branch lines; and to complete the
electrification of the main routes of the Southern Region east of a line from
Portsmouth to Reading. On the rest of the main-line services it is proposed to
introduce diesel traction as quickly as possible. The programme also provides for
track improvements, signalling improvements including an extension of automatic
train control, and the introduction of multiple-unit diesel trains in many areas.
In May 1955 the Commission announced the major development projects it
expected to begin during 1955 and 1956 as the first instalment of the modernization
plan, and the first orders for diesel locomotives were placed in November 1955.
ROADS
The road system is complex and to a large extent haphazard. For centuries after
the Romans left Britain, road building and maintenance were left mainly to the
parish which was naturally concerned only with local needs. The most effective
intervention by the central Government was in the seventeenth century with the
institution of turnpike trusts. The maintenance of a length of road was p aced in
the hands of a trust, made up of private individuals, empowered to levy tolls at the
gates it erected at the limits of its jurisdiction. Early in the mneteenth century there
were 1,000 of these trusts administering some 22,000 miles of road. I he same
period was also notable for improvements in construction associated with the names
of Telford, who emphasized the importance of solid foundations, and Me Adam,
who demonstrated the value of an arched surface of broken stone or flint. Turnpike
roads made it possible for coaches to reach an average speed of 12 miles an hour.
But transport by river and canal retained the advantage in handling bulky traffic,
and as the nineteenth century progressed, the railways almost drove long-distance
road transport out of existence. Roads held their own in towns where horse-drawn
omnibus services were developed and then horse tramways, the first of which were
introduced into London and Birkenhead in the early 1860s. Towards the end of the
nineteenth century the tramways were electrified and largely taken over by loca
authorities. London’s trams have now disappeared, as have those of many other
cities and towns. . . , , „
While tramways were still being developed, there came the internal cornbustio
engine and the rapid increase in the number of motor cars. In 1909, the Govern¬
ment set up a Road Board to assist in providing new and better roads to meet the
needs of the new traffic. In 1919 the Board’s responsibilities were taken over by the
newly created Ministry of Transport. . , . , -i r
In 1954, Great Britain had 187,040 miles of public highway, over two miles for
every square mile of territory. There were 8,270 miles of trunk roads 19,585 miles
of Class I roads, 17,690 miles of Class II roads, 48,721 miles of Class III roads, and
92 774 miles of unclassified roads. Roads are classified according to their traffic

value, those of purely local traffic importance remaining unclassified. Trunk roads
are the main arteries of national traffic and the whole cost of their upkeep is met
from the Road Fund, administered by the Minister of Transport, who is the high¬
way authority for these roads. On maps and signposts the trunk and Class I roads
can mostly be identified by the letter ‘A’ in front of a route number, and Class II
roads by the letter ‘B’. The Minister makes grants from the Road Fund towards
approved expenditure on Class I, II and III roads at the rates of 75, 60 and 50 per
cent respectively. The highway authorities for these and for unclassified roads are
the local authorities—in most cases the councils of counties and county boroughs.
The Road Fund, established in 1921, was originally financed by the proceeds from
motor vehicle and driving licence duties, but since the Finance Act, 1936, the
proceeds of motor taxation have been paid into the Exchequer and the Road Fund
has been financed, like any other Government-assisted service, by means of annual
grants voted by Parliament. In effect, therefore, Government road expenditure has
been met from money provided by Parliament and this will continue to be the
position after xst April 1956, when the Road Fund will be wound up.
Development
Economic difficulties since the war have restricted expenditure on major improve¬
ments and new construction, and the bulk of expenditure on roads—j£90»335,°oo
in the year ended 31st March 1954—has been devoted to maintenance and repair,
although since 1953 there has been increasing emphasis on new works, culminating,
in February 1955, in the announcement by the Government of the first instalment
of an expanded programme of road construction and improvement. In the four
financial years 1955-59, road development works in Great Britain would, according
to the announcement, be authorized, involving an ultimate expenditure of £147
million by the Government and of £20-£30 million complementary expenditure
by local highway authorities. The programme would include certain major projects
of great national importance. The cost of these would be formidable and the
Government had it in mind to charge tolls in suitable cases, with provision for
sharing the proceeds with local authorities where they contributed to the expendi¬
ture. The first of these major projects to be undertaken would be the first section
of a London to Yorkshire motor road—i.e. a road confined to motor traffic with
severely restricted access and with fly-over crossings and junctions. The section
would extend from London, by-passing St. Albans in Hertfordshire, to a point
near Rugby in Warwickshire with a connection to the trunk road leading to Bir¬
mingham. Thereafter, the remainder of that motor road would be put in hand and
also a motor road through Lancashire from Preston to Birmingham (see map, p. 226).
In Scotland, where, as from April 1956, roads will be the responsibility of the
Secretary of State, it is intended that a start should be made in the four-year period
with a crossing of the Firth of Forth by means of a bridge, or a tube on the river bed.
Roads in Northern Ireland
There are 13,397 miles of public roads in Northern Ireland, comprising 347 miles
of trunk roads, 960 miles of Class I roads, i,749 miles of Class II roads, 2,757 miles
of Class III roads, and 7,584 miles of unclassified roads.
In the year ended 31st March 1954 a little under £4 million was spent on road
works.
The Ministry of Commerce is the road authority for the trunk roads and the
cost of maintenance and improvement is met out of moneys voted by Parliament.
The road authorities for the other classes of public roads are the local authorities
within whose areas the roads lie, and the cost of reconstruction, maintenance and

of their expenditure on road works. The rates of grant range from 72 Per cent to
40 per cent for reconstruction and from 60 per cent to 20 per cent for maintenance
and improvement, according to the classification of the road.
ROAD TRANSPORT
Between 1830 and the 1914-18 war, the railways were unchallenged as the chief
means of transport in the country; the war, however, greatly stimulated the
development and use of motor transport. In the period immediately following the
1914—18 war, the growth of public road transport began to make itself felt as a
serious competitor of the railways and there was violent competition within the
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
227
road transport industry itself. In 1928 a Royal Commission on Transport was
appointed to consider the issues involved, and following its recommendations legis¬
lation was introduced. The Road Traffic Act, 1930, provided either directly or by
regulations for (i) a reclassification of motor vehicles and the re-enactment of the
licensing system for drivers; (ii) the prescription of speed limits and a variety of
‘safety’ measures, including a restriction on the hours during which drivers of
public service and goods vehicles could remain continuously on duty; (iii) safety
requirements governing the construction and use of motor vehicles; (iv) compulsory
insurance against third party risks; and (v) the introduction of a comprehensive
licensing and inspection system for public service (passenger) vehicles, under which
bodies of Traffic Commissioners (now called Licensing Authorities for Public
Service Vehicles) were created to have the duty, within defined Traffic Areas, of
licensing vehicles, drivers and conductors, and services operated. Each licensing
authority consists of a full-time chairman appointed by the Minister and two part-
time members chosen by the Minister from a panel of persons nominated by local
authorities. Applications for licences for road services are considered at public
sittings at which competing operators or local authorities can exercise a right of
objection; the licensing authority has power to suspend or revoke a licence in
certain circumstances. Although the Minister can issue general directions to
licensing authorities he has no power to intervene in their decisions, unless an
applicant or an objector, being aggrieved at a decision, appeals to him. The effect
of this system has been to ensure for road passenger transport the regularity and
reliability which has been a feature of railway services.
In 1933 the Road and Rail Traffic Act was passed; it was based on the recom¬
mendations of the Royal Commission and on those contained in a report of a
conference of experts, known as the Salter Report. A system of licensing for road
haulage vehicles was introduced and three types of carriers’ licences were instituted:
the ‘ A ’ licence for general public haulage; the ‘ B ’ licence for public haulage
limited to certain goods or certain areas and covering also the carriage of the
licensee’s own goods; and the ‘ C ’ licence for the carriage by traders of their own
goods alone. The licensing authorities for goods vehicles are the chairmen of
the licensing authorities for public service vehicles in each traffic area, and
applications for ‘ A ’ and ‘ B ’ licences are considered at public inquiries as in the case
of road service licences under the Road Traffic Act, 193° > C licences are granted
on application without public inquiry. A licence can be suspended or revoked by a
licensing authority for breaches of licence conditions committed frequently,
wilfully or to the public danger. There is a right of appeal against a decision of a
licensing authority to an independent tribunal, the Transport Tribunal, and not
as under the Act of 1930 to the Minister. The effect of this system has been to relate
the operations of vehicles under ‘ A ’ and ‘ B ’ licences to approved needs and to
eliminate wasteful competition between the different forms of transport.
During the i939—45 war commercial vehicles were subject to a considerable
degree of direct control through a system of permits and fuel rationing. The
Ministry of War Transport’s Road Haulage Organization, set up in i943> came to
control many of the bigger undertakings and hired a large number of vehicles
engaged in long and short distance work. Vehicles were handed back to their
owners when the Organization came to an end in 1946 and the carriers licence
system, which had been suspended, was resumed. At the end of 1946 there were
90,683 vehicles on ‘A’ licences, 58,386 on ‘B’ licences and 3^3>73^ on C licences,
a total of 532,807 vehicles.
The Transport Act, 1947, as already noted, established the British Transport
Commission, which took over ‘A’ and ‘B’ hauliers predominantly engaged on
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
228
long-distance haulage. Vehicles operating under ‘C’ licences and those used for
carrying certain specialized traffics were not affected by the Act; ‘A’ and B licensed
vehicles which were not acquired by the Commission could only be used on
journeys of over 25 miles from base under permits granted by the Commission. By
the end of 1951, when the acquisition of vehicles by the Commission was com¬
pleted, 3,266 undertakings with 41,265 vehicles and 3,018 trailers had been acquired.
Carriers’ licences were not required for vehicles operated by the various Executives
of the Commission.
The Transport Act, 1953, required the British Transport Commission to dispose
of the bulk of its road haulage undertaking, and all vehicles operated by the
Commission were made subject to the carriers’ licence system.
The Commission was to be allowed to retain a proportion of its road haulage
fleet corresponding broadly to the interest the railways had in road haulage when
they were taken over on 1st January 1948. The disposal operation was to be carried
out by the Commission as quickly as possible under the supervision of a Road
Haulage Disposal Board. Purchasers of the Commission’s road haulage property
were entitled to operate the vehicles bought immediately without restriction as to
distance from their operating centres, while the 25 miles radius limit was removed
from all operators on 1st January 1955.
The Act also provided for a levy on ordinary goods vehicles of more than 11 tons
unladen weight, and on general haulage tractors. The levy was required to defray
the capital loss suffered by the Commission on the disposal of its road haulage
undertaking and for ‘ disturbance ’ during the process. The rate of the levy was
fixed for 1954 and 1955, at a level which would produce approximately £4 million
a year, and could then be varied at three-yearly intervals according to requirements.
When sufficient money had been collected to meet the necessary payments, the
levy would cease.
Pending disposal, road haulage assets are being operated by British Road
Services (see p. 219).
The Road Haulage Disposal Board was set up in May 1953- There are six
members appointed by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation. Invitations
to tender for the first transport units offered for sale were published in November
1953. The vehicles were offered in units of varying sizes, in some cases with
premises, the Board’s policy in this matter being flexible and influenced by its
experience of demand. In particular early offers were framed so as to contain a high
proportion of units that would be within the resources of the small operator who
wished to enter or re-enter the industry. By 21st July 1955, I6,748 vehicles had
been sold, and arrangements had been made to put on sale 4,000 parcels vehicles
and 2,000 contract line vehicles. When allowance was made for a small number
of unsaleable vehicles, there remained for disposal under the Act of 1953 sontie
8,000 vehicles. On that date the Government announced its decision not to proceed
with the disposal of those vehicles required to maintain the Commission s trunk
services, which were rendering a good service to industry. A Bill would be laid
before Parliament to enable the Commission to retain for this purpose a number
of vehicles—bringing the total to over 7,000—beyond those authorized under the
1953 Act. The balance would be offered for sale as soon as possible.
At the end of 1954, 1,069,561 goods vehicles were authorized under carriers
licences including 96,853 under ‘A’ (public carriers’) or contract A licences;
64,649 under ‘B’ (limited carriers’) licences; 899,773 under ‘C’ (private carriers )
licences, and 8,286 under special ‘A’ licences issued to purchasers of vehicles
formerly operated by the British Transport Commission as part of the nationalized
road haulage undertaking.

Road Safety Measures
In 1955 there were some six million motor vehicles licensed to use Great
Britain’s roads, of which over three million were motor cars and over a million were
motor cycles. Traffic density is, therefore, high, presenting problems of control
and safety. In 1954, 5,010 people were killed on the roads and 233,271 injured.
Vigorous road safety campaigns are conducted by local authorities with the aid of
Government grants. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, the police
and education authorities are all actively at work to the same end. A system of
pedestrian crossings has been introduced, a feature of which is the more con¬
spicuous marking which takes the form of white stripes—hence the name ‘ zebra
crossings’—illuminated by flashing beacons. The standard of conduct for all road
users—pedestrians and drivers—is set out in The Highway Code, a new edition of
which was published in March 1955. A failure to observe any provision of this
code does not of itself render a person liable to criminal proceedings of any kind
but it may be taken into account in any such proceedings. Drivers of motor vehicles
.—including motor cycles and powered pedal cycles—all have to pass a driving test
before being granted a substantive licence to drive; until they pass the test they
may obtain a ‘ provisional ’ licence which necessitates their displaying ‘ L (Learner)
plates and, in all cases of vehicles constructed to carry passengers, being accom¬
panied by a qualified driver.
INLAND WATERWAYS
In 1761 James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from the
collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester. This
marked the beginning of canal building in modern Britain which played an
important part in promoting the industrial and commercial expansion of the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Most of the present network except,
notably, the Manchester Ship Canal which was built between 1888 and 1894—was
completed by 1840 when the development of railways brought to an end the golden
age of canals. As railway competition developed, many canal companies were
reduced to a precarious position, and, often at the instance of the companies, about
one-third of the canal mileage passed to the control of the railways. During the first
world war, Government control of railways included railway-owned canals. In
1917 the main canals not owned by the railway companies were placed under the
control of a Canal Control Committee of the Board of Trade, being returned to
their owners at the end of the war. Government control was again the rule in the
second world war, and in 194^ the canals passed direct from Government control
to the British Transport Commission.
The System
There are some 2,200 miles of navigable inland waterways in Great Britain. The
British Transport Commission is responsible for 2,172 miles, of which 1,750 miles
are open to traffic. The canals in England and Wales are grouped into four divisions
based on the main navigable river estuaries:
1. The North-Eastern Division is based on the Ouse and Humber rivers and
the ports of Hull, Grimsby, Goole and Immingham.
2. The North-Western Division is based on the Mersey estuary and its water¬
ways are connected with Liverpool and Birkenhead, Ellesmere Port, W eston
Point Docks, Manchester, and with Hull via Leeds.

3. The South-Western Division is based on the Severn estuary and its water¬
ways are related to the ports of Avonmouth, Gloucester, Sharpness, Barry,
Lydney, Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.
4. The South-Eastern Division is based on the Thames estuary and its water¬
ways give access to the Port of London and to the Midlands.
Canals in Scotland, which are separately administered, are the Caledonian Canal,
the Crinan Canal, the Forth and Clyde Canal and the Union Canal.
There are about 1,130 miles of broad waterways which can be used by craft with
from 50 to 400 tons capacity and about 1,040 miles of narrow waterways which can
generally be used only by boats not exceeding 7 feet in width with a load varying
from 25 to 30 tons. Broad waterways are mainly the canalized rivers—e.g., the
Severn, Lee and Stort Navigation, Trent Navigation, and Aire and Calder Navi¬
gation, while narrow waterways are mainly the canals in the interior—e.g., the
Grand Union, the Shropshire Union, and the Birmingham network. The canals in
Scotland are broad. Of the total mileage, 266 miles have been closed and another
486 miles are no longer used by commercial traffic. Most of the traffic on the water¬
ways is carried by independent carriers or by traders in their own craft. The British
Transport Commission, however, at the end of 1954 owned 24 tugs and 1,229
carrying craft with a carrying capacity of 43,697 tons, including 230 power-driven
craft with a carrying capacity of 8,225 tons.
Survey of Waterways
Since assuming control, the British Transport Commission has taken steps to
strengthen the commercial organization so as to secure increased traffic, improved
dredging methods and equipment, brought better types of craft into service, estab¬
lished a research organization and undertaken various development works including
the elimination of dangerous bends and the opening up of bottle-necks. During the
six years 1948 to 1953 over £1 million was spent on arrears of maintenance and
£500,000 on new plant and equipment, and the total traffic carried increased from
10 to 13 million tons. Over half the traffic is coal and nearly 2 million tons is liquid
in bulk. About 98 per cent of the traffic is carried on 1,200 miles of waterway,
indicating a serious problem of moribund canals.
In April 1954 the Commission appointed a Board of Survey to examine its inland
waterways, to report on whether they were being used to the best possible advan¬
tage and to suggest what should be done with those which could no longer be put
to economic commercial use. The Board of Survey reported in 1955- ft recom¬
mended, inter alia, that a separate organization, British Transport Waterways,
should be set up for the waterways (this has been done, see p. 219); that certain
waterways of a total mileage of 771 should not be retained for navigation; and that
responsibility for the canals in Scotland should be transferred to the Secretary of
State for Scotland.
LONDON TRANSPORT
London’s transport system, in its modern sense, may be said to have begun when
in 1829, four years after the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, the
first omnibus—horse-drawn—appeared on the London streets. Trams, also horse-
drawn, appeared in 1861. In 1863 the first underground steam railway, the
Metropolitan, was built by digging a great trench for the line and roofing it over.
In 1870 a better method for building a railway inside a city was found when the
Tower Subway was constructed. The line was laid in an entirely underground
tunnel shaped like a hollow tube and thus became the world’s first tube railway. In
Q
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
232
1890 the City and South London, the first electric tube railway in the world, was
opened, and it was followed soon after by the Central London Railway, called the
‘twopenny tube’ because all journeys on it cost twopence. Soon after this, buses
and trams ceased to be horse-drawn and used petrol and electricity respectively for
their motive power, and trams, buses and underground railways rapidly developed
into the vast network of London’s transport system.
Until 1933 there was no unified operation. The large number of transport
interests included: the main line railways with their suburban services; an Under¬
ground Group controlling most of the underground railways; the London General
Omnibus Company’s buses, Green Line coaches and three tramway companies;
the independent Metropolitan Railway Company; London County Council tram¬
ways; 13 municipal tramway undertakings; and some 60 small independent bus
undertakings. But in 1933, the whole system, except the main line railways’ subur¬
ban services, was vested in a public corporation, the London Passenger Transport
Board. During the 1939-45 war, London transport was taken overby the Government
and operated, like the main line railways, through the Railway Executive Committee.
In 1948, following the establishment of the British Transport Commission, the
London Transport Executive took over control.
The London Transport Executive is responsible for the operation of passenger
road and rail services in the London area with the exception of the main line rail¬
ways, certain suburban services which came under the Railway Executive, and
taxicabs, which are all privately operated by companies or owner-drivers.1
The Executive consists of a chairman and five members, of whom four are full¬
time and one part-time. The chairman and full-time members each have special
functional responsibilities apart from their general responsibility for the smooth
running of the London Transport system.
The operation of London’s transport is a vast undertaking. It serves an area of
2,000 square miles, extending for an average distance of 25 miles from Charing
Cross in the centre of London. It covers, in whole or in part, 10 counties, the cities
of London and Westminster, 27 other metropolitan boroughs, 2 county boroughs,
48 municipal boroughs, 59 urban and 29 rural districts. The total population of the
area approaches 10 million.
From north to south the railway stretches 18 miles, from east to west 32 miles
and from north-west to east 49 miles. The total length of the railway over which
London Transport trains operate is 253 miles, of which a third is underground,
including the longest tube tunnel in the world, ivi miles. London Transport trains
serve 277 stations.
Diesel buses travel over roads whose total length is 2,300 miles, coaches over
660 miles, trolleybuses (which use electricity) 253 miles.
To carry traffic over all this area, the London Transport Executive in December
1954 owned 4,036 railway coaches, 8,404 buses and coaches, and 1,764 trolleybuses.
The total staff employed at the end of 1954 was 91,000, of whom n,5°o were
women. The total number of passenger journeys in 1954 was 4,100 million, or
about 11J million every day.
The challenge to the efficiency of London Transport presented by growing
traffic is being met by a continuous process of development. Thus, since the end of
the war, all remaining trams have been replaced by buses, extensions to the Under¬
ground railway have been built and more efficient light alloy trains have been
1 During 1954 in the Metropolitan Police District, which covers the counties of London
and Middlesex and parts of Essex, Kent, Surrey and Hertfordshire, annual licences were
issued for 5,553 taxicabs; licensed taxicab drivers at the end of 1954 numbered 9,039.

introduced. Current development plans include a new tube railway from the north¬
east to the west-end of London for which powers to build are being sought.
THE ULSTER TRANSPORT AUTHORITY
Public inland transport in Northern Ireland, with the exception of passenger
transport in the City of Belfast, the railway system previously owned by the Great
Northern Railway Company (Ireland), and some small rail and road transport
undertakings, is owned and controlled by the Ulster Transport Authority, estab¬
lished under the Transport Act (Northern Ireland), 1948. The railway system
formerly operated by the Great Northern Railway Company (Ireland) has passed
to a public body called the Great Northern Railway Board, established on
1st September 1953 by the Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland Governments.
Before the 1948 Act was passed, all the railways in Northern Ireland were
separately owned but, from 1935, road transport (except for passenger transport
in Belfast City and certain types of specialized and ancillary freight haulage) was
under the control of the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board, a public under¬
taking formed to provide public transport services by road and to co-ordinate these
services with those of the railways. Now the Ulster Transport Authority operates
all the road services formerly provided by the Northern Ireland Road Transport
Board, together with the railway services provided before 1949 by the Northern
Counties Committee of the British Railways Executive and by the Belfast and
County Down Railway Company.
When the railway undertaking of the Northern Counties Committee was acquired
by the Ulster Transport Authority from the British Transport Commission in 1949,
it was agreed that each of the parties should co-operate with the other to foster and
encourage by all means in their power traffic and intercourse between Great Britain
on the one hand and Northern Ireland on the other and to . . . maintain the prin¬
ciples of through rates and fares and facilities as between places in Great Britain
and places in Northern Ireland ’.

CIVIL AVIATION
British civil aviation is now organized as follows:
1. Responsibility for its general development and supervision rests with the
Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.1
2. Scheduled public air transport services are reserved to the two public
corporations—British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British
European Airways (BEA)—and their associates. Such services are those
operated regularly or systematically between two places, one of which is in
the United Kingdom, for the transport of passengers, mail or cargo for
remuneration, in such a manner that each flight is open to use by members
of the public.
3. Non-scheduled or charter flights are operated in the main by independent
air transport companies, although the Corporations undertake such flights
as opportunity offers with aircraft not required for their scheduled services
at any particular time. Some of these independent firms have large fleets of
aircraft and many of them operate scheduled services as associates of one
or other of the Corporations.
Early Development
British airmen were the first to carry mails (at the time of the Coronation of
H.M. King George V in 1911) and the first to operate regular mail and passenger
services. The actual inauguration of civil air transport came on 25th August 1919,
when a daily passenger service was opened between London (Hounslow) and Paris
(Le Bourget) by a company called Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited. The
year 1919 was also marked by notable pioneer flights including the crossing of the
Atlantic by John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June (both were later
knighted for their achievement) and the first flight between England and Australia
by Captain (later Sir) Ross Smith and his crew in November.
In 1923 a Civil Air Transport Subsidies Committee recommended the merger of
the four existing small British companies into one organization capable of develop¬
ing oversea routes. In April 1924 the merger took place and there came into being
Imperial Airways Limited, which received a Government grant of £1 million
spread over the next 10 years. As a substantial shareholder the Government was
represented on the Board of Directors.
Imperial Airways Limited proceeded to pioneer the commercial development of
intercontinental air-routes, following up, in most cases, the exploratory work of the
Royal Air Force. Pioneering involved organizing the ground services upon which
civil aviation could rely. The route to the Far East came first. In 1927) 3- link was
established between Cairo and Basra and by 1929 there was a through service from
England to India. In 1931 the first service was established to Central Africa. The
first mail service between London and Australia was begun in December i934>
followed by a passenger service in 1935.
In 1937 crossings of the Atlantic were made simultaneously by Imperial Airways
with the modified ‘ Empire ’ class flying-boat and by Pan American Airways. In
1939 a transatlantic service was operated by both companies. The British Overseas
1 Up to 1945 civil aviation was administered by the Department of Civil Aviation of the
Air Ministry. Between 1945 and 1953 d16 Ministry of Civil Aviation was the responsible
Government Department. But, in October 1953, the Ministries of Civil Aviation and of
Transport were amalgamated. In the rest of this section, reference will usually be made
only to ‘the Minister’ or ‘the Ministry’.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
235
Airways Corporation was established by the British Overseas Airways Act, 1939,
and took over the undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways
Limited in 1940.
During the second world war the British Overseas Airways Corporation operated
essential oversea air services in support of the war effort. By the end of the war it
was carrying more than twice as many passengers as in 1939 and more than three
times as much freight. The routes were, moreover, left with efficient radio and
radar systems installed for war purposes which were adapted for civilian use. There
were also about 700 aerodromes in the United Kingdom, but most of them, having
been constructed for war purposes away from large towns, were unsuitably placed
for civil use.
The one serious obstacle to a continued expansion of British civil air transport
after the war was the absence of any new British civil aircraft to take the place of
the pre-war types. The British aircraft industry throughout the war had concen¬
trated entirely on the production of fighters and bombers for the Allied Forces,
leaving the production of all transport aircraft to the Americans. Since the evolu¬
tion of a new airliner takes anything from five to ten years, there was an awkward
gap in the natural development of British civil air services which could be filled
only by the use of uneconomical converted military types, or the purchase of foreign
aircraft. Both expedients together with the use of the highly successful interim
short-range Viking aircraft were, in fact, used while the British aircraft industry
concentrated on the development of the turbo-jet and turbo-prop airliners, e.g.,
Comets, Viscounts and Britannias.
The Corporations
As already noted, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) was set up
in 1939. The Civil Aviation Act, 1946, set up two additional public corporations;
British European Airways (BEA) to cover the United Kingdom and Europe, and
British South American Airways (BSAA) to operate to South America and the
Caribbean, leaving the North Atlantic and Eastern Hemisphere routes to BOAC.
In 1949 BSAA was merged into BOAC by the Airways Corporations Act of that
year. The statutory provisions (now laid down by the Air Corporations Acts, 1949
and 1953) relating to the powers, constitution, etc., of BEA and BOAC are as
follows:
Operations. Scheduled services are reserved to the two Corporations, working
alone or through associates. They can also engage in charter work. They may not
manufacture airframes, aero-engines or propellers.
Constitution. Each Corporation consists of a chairman, deputy chairman and not
fewer than five or more than eleven directors. Appointments are made by the
Minister who, in the case of BOAC, may, if he wishes, appoint two deputy
chairmen.
Finance. Each Corporation may, with Treasury consent, borrow either by raising
temporary loans or by issuing stock, to a maximum of £80 million in the case of
BOAC and £35 million in the case of BEA. The Treasury may guarantee redemp¬
tion or repayment of, and payment of interest on, any stock issued and temporary
loans raised. Provision is also made for Exchequer grants up to a limit of £8 million
a year (for both Corporations together) until April 1956, so as to enable the Corpora¬
tions to build up their organization and services over a period of years. (For 1946-47
and 1947-48 the maximum was £10 million.) Since 1952-53 BOAC have operated
without Exchequer grant. The Corporations are not exempt from liability for any
taxes or rates.
236 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Accounts. Statements of accounts in a form approved by the Minister and the
Treasury have to be prepared by the Corporations for each financial year. The
accounts are audited by auditors appointed annually by the Minister.
Annual Reports. Each Corporation must also make an annual report to the
Minister and the Minister must lay a copy of this report and of the accounts before
both Houses of Parliament. In addition, each Corporation must submit before the
beginning of every planning period (each three-year period, beginning ist April
1047) a programme of the services it proposes to provide and of any other activities
it proposes to engage in, as well as an estimate of its receipts and expenditure on
revenue and capital account during the period.
Labour Relations. Each Corporation must, unless it is satisfied that adequate
machinery already exists, consult with any organization which it considers appro¬
priate with a view to establishing machinery for settling terms and conditions of
employment and for discussing matters affecting the safety, health and welfare of
its employees and other matters of interest to both parties, including efficiency in
operating the Corporation’s services. In 1946 the National Joint Council for Civil
Air Transport was set up as the body through which terms and conditions of service
between the Corporations and the 18 Trade Unions representing the employees
are negotiated. A number of the independent air transport compames have since
become members of the Council.
Ministerial Control. The Corporations conduct their own affairs as commercial
businesses. The Minister can give general directions on matters affecting the
national interest but in practice this power is rarely, if ever, used, since it has been
found much more suitable to proceed by means of close consultation and discussion
with the Corporations. In fact, the Minister has maintained closer control over them
than has been the case for the other nationalized industries. This has largely been the
consequence of the payment of subsidy to the Corporations through the Exchequer
grants, since this has meant that the Minister has had to discharge a considerable
responsibility for their general efficiency. He has to decide in consultation with the
Treasury what grants, within the ceiling of £8 million, should be given to each
Corporation in any particular year. This necessitates a close examination of the
Corporations’ programmes of air services and estimates. The Minister also keeps in
close touch with the Corporations regarding plans for new aircraft and new routes
since he has to negotiate the necessary rights with foreign governments. He also
provides most of the aerodromes from which the Corporations operate and the
navigational aids and communications necessary to the conduct of their flights.
Contact between the Corporations and the Ministry is, therefore, close, mainly in
the form of daily informal exchanges of information between their staffs.
Independent Companies
The Government considers that non-scheduled or charter services are mainly the
domain of the independent companies. The Corporations are not precluded from
engaging in this work but they do not maintain aircraft specially for it. The opera¬
tion of scheduled services by independent companies under associate agreements
with the Corporations was introduced in 1948. Applications to operate these services
were considered by the Air Transport Advisory Council (see p. 242), which recom¬
mended to the Minister whether or not approval should be given. In the main,
agreements were of short duration, the routes being those which the Corporations
did not, at the time, plan to operate, e.g., some internal routes, short-haul ferry
services across the English Channel and a few holiday routes to the Continent.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
237
The opportunities for independent companies to take part in air transport
developments were increased in 1952. In May of that year the Minister outlined
the principles which would be followed in shaping the Government’s policy for
air transport development. These were broadly to combine public and private
enterprise in the best interests of British civil aviation; and to promote sound
development, reduce the cost to the taxpayer and give greater opportunities to
private enterprise without impairing the competitive strength of Britain’s inter¬
national services and without undermining the existing international networks of
BOAC and BEA.
This policy is being implemented within the existing legislation so that indepen¬
dent companies seeking to take advantage of new opportunities to operate scheduled
services continue to be appointed associates of one of the Corporations. Applications
by independent companies continue to be made to the Air Transport Advisory
Council but are considered under new terms of reference issued to the Council in
July 1952. Under these terms of reference, the Corporations’ position is safeguarded
by reserving to them the sole right to operate first and tourist class services on their
established routes. Independent companies and the Corporations alike, however,
are eligible to apply for the right to develop new routes not so reserved and new
types of scheduled services: for example, international services which do not serve
the same traffic areas as services by BEA or independent companies already
approved; services operated solely for the carriage of freight and ‘ Colonial coach
class’ services (i.e. services to United Kingdom territories overseas providing a
lower standard of service than the tourist class and so generating a new class of
traffic).
The Air Transport Advisory Council considers applications in the light of its
terms of reference and, after hearing evidence from interested parties, makes recom¬
mendations to the Minister. Approval of the operations of scheduled services by
independent companies as associates of the Corporations is now normally given for
seven years with extension to ten years in special circumstances, for example,
where the purchase of new aircraft is involved. In this way, it is intended to give
independent companies sufficient long-term security to justify capital outlay and
expansion.
Operations
The latest available information about the services, fleets and results of the two
Corporations, and the activities of the independent companies are summarized
below.
British Overseas Airways Corporation
The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) operates scheduled services
to the Middle and Far East and to Australia, with terminals at Sydney, Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Karachi, Bahrein, and Aden; to Africa with
terminals at Johannesburg, Nairobi, Accra/Uagos and Dar es Salaam; and to North
and South America and the Caribbean with terminals at New York, Chicago,
Montreal, Jamaica and Trinidad. There are regional services between New York
and Bermuda, Nassau and Montego Bay; the services between New York and the
last two points operate as extensions of the Uondon—New York route. The routes to
Central and South Africa are operated in co-operation with Central African Airways
and in partnership with South African Airways, and the route to Sydney in partner¬
ship with Qantas Empire Airways of Australia. Qantas carries on the service from
Australia by operating routes to North America—formerly operated by British
Commonwealth Pacific Airlines which went out of existence on 3Ist March 1954 '
238 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and it will connect with the planned extension to San Francisco of BOAC’s North
American service. Tasman Empire Airways, jointly owned by the Australian and
New Zealand Governments, operates services between Australia and New Zealand
and from New Zealand to Fiji and other islands of the South Pacific.
This network of services (see front end-paper map) is supplemented by the
activities of subsidiary and associated enterprises overseas in which BOAC partici¬
pates financially or with which it has technical or management agreements.
Those in which BOAC has a controlling financial interest include Aden Airways
Ltd., which develops services in the Red Sea area; Bahamas Airways Ltd., providing
services linking the islands of the Bahamas with each other; British West Indian
Airways Ltd., providing services throughout the Caribbean area; and Gulf Aviation
Company Bahrein Ltd., which operates between Bahrein and nearby ports of call.
Those with which BOAC is associated either financially or through advisory and
other agreements include Aerolinee Italiane Internazionali {Alitalia) which operates
services within Europe and also to East Africa, the Middle East and South America;
West African Airways Corporation and East African Airways Corporation, serving
West and East Africa; Malayan Airways Ltd., which operates services in the
Federation of Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak and services
between those territories and the Asian mainland; Cyprus Airways Ltd.; Iraqi
Airways; Kuwait National Airways and Arab Airways. BOAC, like BE A, is also
associated with International Aeradio Ltd. (see p. 245).
To implement its policy of extending the benefits of air travel to a wider public
by charging lower fares, BOAC has introduced tourist services on many routes and
by the end of March 1955, 43 per cent of BOAC’s available seat mileage was offered
at tourist fares.
On all its services, BOAC carried, in 1954-55, 291,136 passengers, 6,003 tons
of freight and 3,407 tons of mail. The figures in 1947-48 were 115,675 passengers,
2,447 tons of freight and 2,088 tons of mail.
BOAC’s fleet in the summer of 1955 consisted of: 22 Argonauts, 16 Constellations,
16 Stratocruisers and 4 Yorks.
The Comet I (with which the world’s first scheduled jet service was started on
2nd May 1952) had been progressively introduced into the Corporation’s fleet until
April 1954, when, following accidents which involved the loss of two aircraft, it was
withdrawn’from service pending the report of a Court of Inquiry. This report was
published in February 1955- The Court found that the cause of the accident to the
Comet wrecked off Elba in January 1954, was the structural failure of the pres¬
surized cabin brought about by fatigue. The Court thought it possible that the same
cause accounted for the loss of another Comet near Naples in April 1954- It made a
number of recommendations designed to prevent future similar accidents and these
have been accepted by the Government. BOAC has retained its faith in the future
of the Comet and has ordered 19 of a Mark IV Comet from de Havillands, the manu¬
facturers which will incorporate the improvements in structural design which are
the outcome of research and of the findings of the Court of Inquiry. Delivery of
these aircraft will begin in 1958. In 1956, it is expected that the Mark 100 Britannia,
which carried out successful trials in Africa in 1955, wiU be introduced into service
first on the South African route and subsequently on the Australian and Far East
routes. Progress is also being made in the development of the long-range Mark 300
Britannia, which it is hoped will enter into passenger service with BOAC early in 1957-
In the year 1951-52 BOAC for the first time made a net profit after allowing for
interest on capital and before crediting the Exchequer grant of £i| million. In
1952-53, when the profit (before providing for interest on capital) was reduced
from £i*2 million to £104,000 mainly owing to an increase in costs—including
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
239
increased wage rates and costs of materials, spares and fuel—BO AC abstained
from claiming any Exchequer grant and the deficit of £839,000 remaining after
paying interest on capital was carried forward. In i953~54 the profit was £2
million, and after paying interest on capital and providing for future income tax
and profits tax, there remained a balance of £936,911 to be applied to the reduc¬
tion of the accumulated deficiency. In 1954-55. a year made difficult by the with¬
drawal of the Comets from service in April 1954, the profit fell to £1-4 million and,
after paying interest, the surplus was £262,000. At the end of March 1955 the
Corporation’s accumulated deficiency was £862,000 compared with £4-4 million
in March 1950.
Over the whole eight-year period up to the end of March 1955, the capacity on
BOAC services increased from 89-5 million to 214-9 million ton miles; operating
revenue increased from £14-6 million to £36-9 million; operating costs were
reduced from 57-7 pence per ton mile to 39'9 pence; and the break-even load factor
(the proportion of aircraft space it is necessary to sell in order to cover all costs of
operation and administration including interest on capital) fell from 115 per cent
to 63 per cent.
British European Airways
British European Airways (BEA) is the seventh largest airline in the world
judged by annual number of passengers carried: 1,874,316 in i954“55 when it
operated on its own behalf, in conjunction with its associated companies and sub¬
sidiaries, a network of services covering 21,190 unduplicated route miles serving
67 airports in the United Kingdom, Europe and North Africa, within a periphery
on which the farthest points to the north, south, west and east are Oslo, Cairo,
Lisbon and Beirut. Its services within the United Kingdom include a number
which cannot be operated commercially with the equipment now available but
which meet a vital social need. These include services to the Highlands and
Islands of Scotland, winter services to the Isle of Man and inter-Channel Islands
services. Reduced tourist fares have been introduced on all BEA’s domestic routes
and on practically all its international routes. BEA maintains a close working
relationship with BOAC, whose aircraft of necessity fly through a number of
European stopping points on their way east and south. BEA also co-operates with
other airlines in order to create ‘ through travel’ facilities. In addition to passengers,
BEA carried 14,884 tons of freight and 6,964 tons of mail in the year 1954-55-
A subsidiary of BEA, Gibraltar Airways Ltd., operates services between Gibraltar
and Tangier. BEA is associated financially with Aer Lingus Teoranta, working
primarily between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom; Aerolinee Italiane
Internazionali {Alitalia) which operates services within Europe and also to East
Africa, the Middle East and South America; Cyprus Airways Ltd., which operates
services to Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, North Africa, the
Sudan and the Persian Gulf; and Malta Airzuays Company Ltd. BEA is also asso¬
ciated with Socidte Internationale de Telecommunications Adronautiques {SITA), a
Belgian company which provides communications circuits for subscribing operators;
and, like BOAC, with International Aeradio Ltd. (see p. 245).
BEA’s operational fleet in the summer of 1955 comprised: 19 Elizabethans,
26 Viscounts, 46 Pionairs, 6 Islanders, 6 helicopters and 2 Herons.
The Viscount V.joi ‘Discovery’ class was brought into regularly scheduled service
on 18th April 1953 on the routes to Istanbul and Cyprus, thus inaugurating the
world’s first commercial operations with propeller-turbine aircraft. During the
summer of 1955 Viscounts were in operation on 16 European routes and on trunk
route services between London and Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast.

A larger version of the Viscount, the Viscount-Major, is on order and is expected
to enter into passenger service early in 1957- Plans are also in hand for the produc¬
tion of a new fleet of Vanguards, double-decked airliners to accommodate over
90 passengers, which, it is hoped, will be delivered in 1959—60.
Since 1950 BEA has operated various scheduled services with helicopters, in
order to obtain experience in the civil operation of helicopters which can be used
to assist the design and production of a commercial twin-engined British helicopter
and the development of navigational aids and ground facilities. To begin with, BEA
worked with the American type Sikorsky S.51 but towards the end of 1951 the first
British-built and designed helicopter suitable for scheduled flying, the Bristol iji,
became available and BEA took delivery of its first two in June 1953 after working
for a period with one lent to it by the Ministry of Supply. This, like the S.^i,
is a single-engined helicopter. A prototype twin-engined helicopter, the Bristol 173,
has been developed but the commercial version needed by BEA for the operation
of the first network of passenger services is not likely to be available for airline
service for some years. Two Bell 47s are used for training and experimental work.
As part of the process of obtaining experience, BEA operated a service from
15th June 1954 until 17th May 1955 with a Bristol 171 between Eastleigh Airport,
Southampton, and London Airport. The service operated daily except Saturdays
and Sundays. An experimental passenger service between London Airport and
the centre of London, operated with two Sikorsky 55 single-engined machines,
started in July 1955. A site on the South Bank of the Thames near County Hall
has been developed as a temporary air station and is available for use by any
helicopter coming into the centre of London.
Over the period 1947-48 to 1954-55, BEA’s capacity increased from 22 million
to 98 million ton miles, operating revenue from £4 million to £17-1 million, total
costs were reduced from 83-6 pence per ton mile to 4I*7 pence, and the break-even
load factor on total costs fell from 115 per cent to 64-5 per cent. BEA is faced with
the problem of securing adequate revenue from short-haul routes aggravated by a
marked seasonal variation in its traffic.
In 1953-54 BEA earned for the first time a small operating surplus of £64,000,
but after providing for depreciation and increased aircraft amortization charges,
its net deficit was £i'8 million, against which was set an Exchequer grant of
£1.5 million. In 1954-55 BEA achieved its first net profit of £63,000. Its accumu¬
lated deficiency at xst April 1955 was £0-55 million.
Independent Companies
The operation of scheduled services by independent companies as associates of
the Corporations has already been indicated. In 1954 some 356,000 passengers were
carried by independent companies on scheduled services, compared with 133,000
in 1952 and 246,000 in 1953. The total traffic of the independent companies on
scheduled services increased from 3,700,000 ton miles in 1952 to 11,000,000 ton
miles in 1954. In addition, as already mentioned, non-scheduled or charter opera¬
tions are regarded as mainly their province. They cover a wide range of business
including moving troops on Government account; transporting to and from their
place of work personnel belonging to commercial and other companies operating
overseas; carrying livestock, including zoological specimens, machinery and other
cargo) taking parties to football matches and race meetings in Britain, taking parties
on trips or tours to oversea resorts; transporting, to and from the Hejaz, Moham¬
medans making the Pilgrimage to Mecca; and bringing perishable foodstuffs and
flowers from the Continent to the United Kingdom market. There are also firms
which specialize in such activities as aerial photography and crop spraying.
242
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The independent companies engaged in business of this kind operate a total of
194 twin-engined and 80 four-engined aircraft. A number of these companies are
members of the British Independent Air Transport Association Ltd. The larger
of them have subsidiary companies abroad and in some cases provide the manage¬
ment of small foreign airlines. Much charter business is now arranged through the
Air Section of the Baltic Exchange, the London market for shipping space. In this
market, business from any part of the -world is handled between brokers represent¬
ing, on the one side, the owners of aircraft available for hire and, on the other, the
prospective shippers of cargo or organizers of passenger trips. Inquiries for the
charter of aircraft were first received on the Exchange as long ago as 1925 but it
was not until 1947 that an Air Section was formed. To assist the market, the Baltic
Exchange set up an air freight advisory committee but this was dissolved on
1 st February 1949 when the Airbrokers’ Association was formed. Among other
aims, the Association seeks to promote and establish uniformity in transactions
and usages in the airbroking trade, to establish in London a world market for
chartering aircraft to carry cargo and passengers, to represent the interests of its
members to Government Departments and other bodies, and to provide commer¬
cial arbitration machinery for the assistance of its members.
A recent development has been the increasing participation of shipping finance in
independent air companies: e.g., the Clan line has acquired a 50 per cent non¬
controlling interest in the Hunting Group, Furness Withy has acquired a substan¬
tial interest in Airwork Ltd., an associate of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Company, Ltd. (P and O) has acquired a majority shareholding in
another independent company, Britavia, and the Bibby Line has acquired a sub¬
stantial holding in Skyways Ltd.
Powers and Duties of the Minister
The Civil Aviation Act of 1949, which superseded both the Ministry of Civil
Aviation Act, 1945, and the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, gives the Minister the duty
of ‘ organizing, carrying out and encouraging measures for the development of civil
aviation, for the designing, development and production of civil aircraft, for the
promotion of safety and efficiency in the use thereof, and for research into questions
relating to air navigation
Under the heading ‘measures for the development of civil aviation’ come the
Minister’s relationship to the Corporations (as laid down in the Air Corporations
Act of 1949) and his general responsibility for carrying out policy; participation in
the International Civil Aviation Organization; responsibility, in concert with the
Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office, for dealing with other coun¬
tries in civil aviation matters; and the work of the Air Transport Advisory Council.
This body was established by the 1946 Act primarily to bring to the Minister’s
notice important representations from the public concerning any inadequacy in
the services provided by the Corporations. It was also laid down that its duties
should include the study of any question related to the air transport services
which the Minister may refer to it. Under this provision, the Minister has given the
Council the task of considering and making recommendations to him on applications
from independent companies to operate scheduled services as associates of one of
the Corporations. This has, in fact, provided most of the Council’s work, which
has been increased following the Government’s decisions in 1952 (see p. 237).
The Act requires that the chairman of the Council must be a lawyer and, of its
two to four members, at least one must be experienced in the operation of air
transport services and one in other forms of transport. The Council makes an
annual report to the Minister who lays it before Parliament.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
243
The supervision of design, development and production of civil aircraft has been
delegated to the Ministry of Supply, which is also responsible for the provision of
all Service aircraft and carries on an extensive programme of research and develop¬
ment to meet civil and Service needs. The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation
is specifically debarred from ‘ producing ’ aircraft, and any dealings he may have in
aircraft, engines and equipment are subject to Treasury approval.
In exercising his responsibility for safety, the Minister regulates the operation of
aircraft and controls the licensing of flight crews. On all safety matters, the Minister
may call upon the advice of the Air Safety Board, a standing advisory body of
experts responsible to him for keeping under continuous review the needs of safety
in British civil aviation and for recommending measures calculated to promote
safety, in respect of both the operation of British civil aircraft throughout the world
and the efficiency of the system of ground facilities provided for all civil aircraft
operating over the United Kingdom.
On airworthiness matters the Minister is advised by the Air Registration Board,
to which he has delegated certain functions relating to the design, construction
and maintenance of civil aircraft. The Board is a non-profit-making incorporated
body which was set up in February 1937 and consists of 18 members, of whom 16
represent the interests concerned with civil aviation and two are appointed by
the Minister. The Board is responsible, inter alia, for the investigation of aircraft
for the purpose of making recommendations to the Minister for the issue of
Certificates of Airworthiness. Persons engaged in the maintenance of civil aircraft
must be the holders of appropriate licences issued by the Board or be members of
firms approved by the Board for the purpose.
The Minister is authorized (as are local authorities, subject to his approval) to
establish and maintain aerodromes for civil aviation. All civil aerodromes not under
the Minister’s direct control, which are used for commercial operations, are subject
to his licensing, inspection and regulation.
The Minister is responsible for determining the conditions, e.g., use of aero¬
dromes and choice of routes, under which aircraft may fly within the United
Kingdom and of those under which passengers or cargo may be carried. He is also
responsible for various other matters, including the use of signals to and from air¬
craft, the prevention of interference (e.g., from displays of lights and signs from
shops) and with the effectiveness of navigational aids. The Minister is jointly
responsible with the Minister of Health for sanitary control at his aerodromes and
he also assists the appropriate Departments in the application of customs and
immigration regulations.
Aerodromes
There are approximately 100 civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom and, in
addition, about 50 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under civil
control include 28 directly controlled by the Ministry, 3 iu the Channel Islands and
1 in the Isle of Man administered by the local governments, and 24 aerodromes
licensed for public use, of which 15 are owned by municipalities. Customs facilities
are provided at 15 of the Ministry’s aerodromes and at 12 others. The Ministry,
which provides the Colonial Office with advice on civil aviation matters, has also
assisted United Kingdom dependencies overseas in equipping and maintaining civil
aerodromes and necessary technical facilities to accepted international standards.
The main airports used by international scheduled services in i954~55 were:
for European services: London, Renfrew, Birmingham (Elmdon), Manchester
(Ringway);
244
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for North Atlantic services: London, Prestwick, Manchester (Ringway);
for South Atlantic, Middle East, Africa and Far East services: London.
Substantial increases in aircraft and passenger movements at the principal aero¬
dromes have continued from 1945 to 1954. In the latter year, all United Kingdom
aerodromes handled over 4J million passengers. Of this total London Airport dealt
with 1,724,000 and Northolt 493,000 between January and 31st October when it
was finally closed to civil flying and all services transferred to London. Outside the
London area, Manchester (Ringway) handled the largest number, 262,000; followed
by Glasgow (Renfrew), 258,000; Prestwick 192,000; Belfast (Nutt’s Corner)
189,000; and Isle of Man (Ronaldsway) 163,000. The number of movements of
aircraft engaged on commercial transport operations in 1954 was 232,000 for all
United Kingdom aerodromes. The Central Terminal Area at London Airport was
opened on 17th April 1955. On that day the airport was divided into two parts for
traffic purposes, ‘ London Airport North’ and ‘ London Airport Central’. Broadly,
the long-haul services and Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) continued to be handled
at the North terminal; the bulk of the European short-haul services have been
transferred to London Airport Central.
As the main alternate to London Airport, to be used when bad visibility involves
diversion and also as a base for seasonal services and charter operators, it has been
decided to develop Gatwick, 25 miles south of London, while Blackbushe, west of
London, will be used as the supplementary aerodrome to handle aircraft which for
any reason cannot use the main alternate. Prestwick is being developed as the second
international airport in the United Kingdom.
Air Traffic Control
The main air traffic control centres are in London for Southern England,
Preston for the North and Prestwick for Scotland and the Atlantic, while each
airport has its own traffic control unit.
An airliner flying into Britain comes first under the control of one of these centres.
It enters a Control Zone by one of the routes leading up to it, called National Air¬
ways. Each airway has a number of traffic lanes one above the other at intervals of
1,000 feet. The airliner must fly along one of these lanes at a height specified by
Control. This ensures that it can pass from the coast to the control zone at its
destination without any other aircraft being in that section of the airway at that
height at the same time. As the airliner reaches the control zone boundary, it is
passed to the airport control tower. It is brought to within a few miles of the airport
by the Approach Controller and then handed over to the Aerodrome Controller for
landing and taxi-ing instructions.
Radar plays an important part in air traffic control, monitoring the flight of
aircraft along the airways and guarding their safe separation from each other. It
enables aircraft to be brought to the runway in close succession and ensures safe
separation to be maintained between arriving and departing aircraft. Even in bad
weather a pilot can be brought down to within sight of the runway by means of the
radio and radar aids now in use, such as the Ground Controlled Approach system
(GCA), operated by a mobile radar unit on the airport, which provides the control
officer on the ground with a picture of the aircraft’s position in the air, and the
Instrument Landing System (ILS), which operates an indicator in the pilot’s
cockpit to guide him along the correct course and angle of descent required for the
approach. Meteorological information is provided by the Meteorological Office of
the Air Ministry (see p. 43).
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
245
Navigational Aids
Adequate radio navigational facilities are essential to enable aircraft to remain
safely within controlled airspace and to make accurate estimates of their times of
arrival.
The airways are marked by a series of beams from medium frequency radio
ranges and by radio beacons. By listening to the signals received in his aircraft and
by watching his radio compass, the pilot steers the aircraft along the required route.
During the next two or three years a number of very-high-frequency (VHF) omni¬
directional radio ranges will be installed at strategic points in the country. This
static-free system which shows on an indicator in the cockpit that the correct track
is being maintained by the aircraft may eventually replace many of the present
medium frequency ranges and beacons. In addition, the coverage provided by the
three Decca ‘ chains ’ now operating in Britain will enable any aircraft fitted with
the appropriate receivers and automatic flight log to follow any of the air patterns
at present planned. The pilot of such an aircraft can obtain a ‘ fix ’ of his position by
the readings of two meters recording radio signals from ground stations of the
Decca Air and Marine Navigator System. The process of deriving the position
from the readings is unsuitable when a pilot is operating in air traffic control areas
of high density and so the flight log was evolved whereby the aircraft’s track and
position are presented continuously on a chart. Further improvements of the system
are being developed.
A vital part of the technical services provided by the Ministry is a network of
radio stations giving communication between ground and air. About fifty of these
stations, at aerodromes and other places, provide rapid and efficient communi¬
cation operating in the VHF band to aircraft in flight over and near the United
Kingdom. Special stations at Birdlip (Gloucestershire) and Prestwick (Scotland),
operating in the high frequency (HF) band, maintain communication with aircraft
on the long-distance routes such as the North Atlantic and South African routes.
There is also an extensive system of point-to-point communication between aero¬
dromes and air traffic control centres in the United Kingdom, and to places abroad.
Over this system are transmitted such messages as flight plans and weather, so vital
to safety and regularity. The main United Kingdom signals centre is at Croydon
(near London), where an entirely new station, specially designed for the purpose,
sends and receives traffic over a network of teleprinter and radio circuits. Its hand¬
ling capacity is about 30,000 messages a day.
On routes outside the United Kingdom, British airline operators rely upon
ground organization provided by the countries over which they fly. In January IQ47
the Airways Corporations (which at that time included BSAA) took the initiative in
forming a company, registered in the United Kingdom, called International Aeradio
Limited (IAL), for the purpose of helping countries in need of assistance in pro¬
viding radio communications, flying control and navigational facilities for civil
aviation. Airlines of other countries have accepted invitations to become share¬
holders and the membership is broadly representative of international civil aviation.
IAL operates by entering into contracts with Governments to provide whatever
degree of assistance is required to enable States or Administrations to fulfil the
international obligations resting on them under the Chicago Convention on Civil
Aviation for the provision and maintenance of ground facilities for civil aviation.
By 1954 International Aeradio Ltd. was carrying on functions of various kinds at
74 places in 30 oversea countries, as well as at Yeadon (Yorkshire) and Cranfield
(Bedfordshire) in the United Kingdom; its network of radio and other facilities
was being used by over 290 operating companies.

The Air-Sea Search and Rescue Service, operated by the Royal Navy and the
Royal Air Force, is available to civil air operators within the United Kingdom area
and along the oversea routes wherever there are Royal Navy and RAF stations.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office with its staff of nearly 338,000 is a Government Department. It
is also the oldest of Britain’s nationalized undertakings. In 1649 a resolution in the
House of Commons declared that ‘ the office of Postmaster is and ought to be in the
sole power and disposal of Parliament
The ministerial head of the Post Office is the Postmaster-General, who, with the
Assistant Postmaster-General, is responsible to Parliament for his Department. He
is subject to the overriding authority of Parliament and the Cabinet, and, on many
questions, of the Treasury. The Postmaster-General is chairman of the Post Office
Board, composed of the principal permanent officials of the Department, which
discusses and gives advice on matters of general policy, and he normally presides
over meetings of the Post Office Advisory Council, on which the principal users of
the Post Office services are represented.
Under the Postmaster-General, the permanent head of the Post Office is the
Director General, who is supported by four Deputy Directors General and an
Engineer-in-Chief. At the next level there are seven Directors responsible respec¬
tively for Posts, Inland Telecommunications, Finance and Accounts, Radio and
Accommodation, External Telecommunications Executive, Establishments and
Organization, and Personnel. The Comptroller and Accountant General, one of the
Deputy Directors General, is responsible for the whole of the accounting system
and advises on financial matters. In addition, responsibility for their several
specialist functions rests with the Solicitor, the Public Relations Officer, the
Directors of Savings and of Contracts, and the Controllers of Supplies and of
Factories. The Post Office Headquarters is in St. Martin’s-le-Grand in the City of
London.
Six of the main divisions of work at Headquarters are carried down into the
organization of the three directorates—Scotland, Wales and the Border Counties,
and Northern Ireland, each under the control of a Director of the Post Office, and,
in England, seven regions—the North West, the North East, the Midlands, the
South West, the Home Counties, and London (which is divided into two functional
regions, Postal and Telecommunications), each under the control of a Regional
Director. In the United Kingdom there are 466 head post offices, 1,267 post offices
and 22,938 sub-offices, and 6,188 telephone exchanges.
The staff at headquarters and in the directorates and regions is divided into two
main groups: general civil service grades (administrative, executive and clerical)
and special grades recruited directly by the Post Office for its engineering and
operational activities.
The work of the Post Office falls into two main categories: (1) direct services—
mail services, telecommunications, remittance and savings bank business; (2) agency
services—broadcasting services and business undertaken on behalf of other
Government Departments.
Mail Services
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from the
time when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern airmail
transport. In 1657, under the Protectorate of Cromwell, an Act was passed which
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
247
declared that ‘there shall be one general post-office and one officer, styled the
Postmaster-General of England and Comptroller of the Post Office The eighteenth
century saw a great expansion of the postal services with the introduction of mail-
coaches in 1784. In the first half of the nineteenth century the Post Office was quick
to take advantage of Britain’s vigorous period of engineering and railway develop¬
ment, and the first dispatch of mails by train was made in 1830 between Liverpool
and Manchester.
The heavy charges, based upon the actual distance a letter was carried,
were among the factors which inspired Rowland Hill in his great work of postal
reform that led to the establishment of a uniform postage rate. In 1840 a
uniform inland rate of postage of one penny per half-ounce payable in advance
came into operation—prepayment to be made by means of adhesive postage stamps.
Since the business world found cheap postage a boon and since it proved ultimately
a great financial success, it was imitated by almost every country in the world.
The inauguration of the penny post (the rate remained unchanged until 1918) was
followed by a rapid extension of the scope of the postal services, beginning, in 1841,
with the introduction of the registered post to ensure additional safety for valuable
mail. In 1854 Rowland Hill became the permanent head of the Post Office, and it
was during his term of office that the Post Office Savings Bank was established, in
1861, to meet the needs of the small investor. The money order system which had
operated as a private venture from 1792 to 1838 was supplemented in 1881 by the
issue of postal orders for fixed amounts. Letter-boxes had been instituted in London
in 1855 to facilitate the increased postal traffic, and in 1883 the parcel post was
introduced. By the end of the nineteenth century a regular delivery of letters was
assured to every house in Britain.
The guiding principles of the postal services—speed, reliability and economy
have motivated all developments in the history of the Post Office. Improvements
include the provision of motor mail van services1 linking rural districts, postal
sorting carriages on the railways, special mail trains on certain routes and the
ingenious apparatus by which bags of mail are delivered and collected by trains
running at express speed. During the second world war many of these facilities had
to be curtailed and some were suspended, manpower shortage created a serious
problem and oversea mails were disrupted.
Since 1945 the Post Office has restored and developed most of the pre-war
services, and to the heavy task of reconstruction has been added a marked increase
in the volume of mail. In the 16 years from 1938-39 to 1954-55 the parcel post
increased from 185 million items to nearly 243 million, registered postal traffic
from 62 million to 130 million and posted correspondence from 8,425 million to
9,500 million. Every day the Post Office handles some 25 million letters and
parcels.
The minimum rates for letters sent by surface mails are: inland and Irish
Republic, 2^d. for two ounces; British Commonwealth, territories under British
Trusteeship, British Post Offices in Morocco and the Persian Gulf, Her Majesty’s
Forces overseas and Her Majesty’s ships in foreign waters, and also Burma, Egypt,
Israel, Jordan, United States of America, 2-|d. for one ounce; other foreign coun¬
tries, 4d. for one ounce. The inland parcel rate (from 1st January 1956) is is. 3d.
for parcels weighing up to 2 lb. ranging to 2s. pd. for 15 lb. The rates for parcels
sent to the Irish Republic range from is. 3d. for parcels weighing up to 2 lb. to
2s. iid. for 15 lb. The oversea parcel rates vary according to the destination.
1 In 1919 the Post Office inaugurated its motor transport with 48 vehicles; this fleet now
numbers nearly 33,000, of which over 13,000 are motor postal vans.
R
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
248
There are lower rates for second-class mail (unsealed packets containing printed
matter, newspapers, periodicals, commercial papers, samples and small consign¬
ments of merchandise).
Packages containing literature for the blind can be sent to destinations in the
United Kingdom and Irish Republic at a nominal rate ranging from ^d. to 2|d. for
the maximum weight of 15 lb. and to oversea destinations, by surface mail, post
free.
Airmail Services
Railways and motors as a means of transport for mails are supplemented by
steamers and aeroplanes. The figures for the year ended March 1955 show that
total oversea civilian correspondence amounted to 408 million items and Forces’
mail to 60 million, and that nearly 50 per cent of this traffic now travels by air.
First-class mail to all European countries is sent by air or by surface transport,
whichever offers the speedier delivery, without payment of any special air fee.
The Post Office dispatches nearly 27 tons of letter mail a week to European
destinations by this ‘ all-up ’ service mainly in aircraft of the British European
Airways, whose network of services enables many of the letters posted in London
for Europe to be delivered the following day. The air parcel service to Europe,
introduced on 2nd April 1949, is now operating to 25 destinations,1 and about
8 tons of parcel mail are dispatched weekly to Europe by air.
First-class mail and second-class mail are dispatched by air to countries outside
Europe upon payment of special airmail rates of postage. The airmail postage rates
for letters are pd., is. 3d. and is. 6d. per \ ounce, depending on the destination.
Air parcel services are also available to some 98 countries outside Europe. Light¬
weight air letters costing 6d. each are popular and some 46 million were posted in
the year ended March 1955.
Telegraphs
All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to the control of the
Postmaster-General in 1870. Teleprinter working for the transmission of inland
telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the present auto¬
matic switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now one of the most
up-to-date systems in the world and gives direct connection between any of the
500 larger telegraph offices. The Post Office accepted 26 million inland telegrams
in 1954-55, and the average time between handing in an inland telegram and its
receipt at the delivery office was 17 minutes compared with 48 minutes in 1946.
In recent years inland telegraph traffic has decreased while the costs of running
the service have increased. In 1954 the charges for inland telegrams were raised
to 3s. for 12 words and 3d. for each additional word.
Telex
The Telex Service provides a quick means of communication in printed form
between subscribers. The printed copy of the message is produced on teleprinters
at both the sending and receiving subscribers’ installations. Calls may be made to
any telex subscriber in the United Kingdom and to subscribers in certain countries
overseas, including parts of the United States of America. The service is available
day and night, and messages may be transmitted to a subscriber even though his
teleprinter is unattended. The message will then be available for attention when his
office opens.
Spain and the Balearic Islands are considered as a single destination.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
249
The United Kingdom is divided into 50 charging areas, each with its telex
centre. The call charges are based on the distance (measured in a straight line)
between the telex centres, the minimum charge being for a three-minute call. There
were just over 2,000 subscribers at the end of June 1955, and the service is expand¬
ing rapidly. Calls are connected at telex exchanges staffed by experienced tele¬
graphists, but it is likely that complete automatization of the service will be achieved
within the next few years, when subscribers will be able to dial all calls within the
United Kingdom and many oversea calls for themselves.
Inland and oversea telegrams may be sent to the Post Office by telex no chaige
is made for the calls and normal charges apply for the telegram. Arrangements can
also be made for incoming telegrams to be received by teleprinter.
Telephones
There are over 6,000 telephone exchanges in the United Kingdom; three-
quarters of these have been converted to automatic working. During the year
1954-55 some 240 new automatic exchanges were opened for service. Some of
these replaced smaller automatic exchanges of early and obsolete type which had
outgrown their capacity. At many of the automatic exchanges callers can not only
dial numbers in the same city or town but can also dial numbers in adjacent towns
up to about 15 miles. Plans are being made for dialling over longer distances in the
future, and experiments are being made with electronic switching systems which
may eventually supersede the electro-mechanical system now in use. The total
expenditure on telephone development, mainly new cables and new exchange
equipment, has increased from £50 million in 1951 to £7° million in 1954 and by
1956 it is expected to reach £81 million.
During the year ended 31st March 1955, some 600,000 new telephones were
provided for subscribers, bringing the total number of telephones at that date to
6J million (double the 1939 figure). This total includes over 66,000 telephone call
offices for public use. During the same period there was a net reduction of 5,0°°
in the number of people waiting for telephone service, bringing the total down to
371,000.
The level of telephone traffic continues to rise. In the year ended 31st March
1939 the total trunk calls amounted to 112 million, while in the year ended
31st March 1955 the Post Office handled a total of 306 million; of these 77 million
were at the cheap night rate, which was instituted in 1934* To meet this increasing
traffic about 12,000 trunk circuits over 25 miles in radial length have been provided
since the end of the second world war, making a total of over 21,000 such circuits.
The number of local calls handled during the year ended 3IS^ March 1955 was
3,615 million, an increase of 70 per cent compared with the year i93^-39-
About 550 exchanges now operate the automatic time service, first introduced in
1936, by which callers in 48 cities and towns are able to obtain the correct time
automatically by dialling the three-letter code TIM or a figure code which con¬
nects to the speaking clock at Holborn Exchange, London, or to a similar clock in
Liverpool.
The total number of these calls made in London from the introduction of the
service in July 1936 to September 1955 was 521,253,000.
The 999 emergency dialling service is available on about half of the 4,576 auto¬
matic exchanges now in service. Callers using this service are given priority of
answer and are connected as quickly as possible to the police, ambulance or fire
brigade, and in certain coastal districts to lifeboat and coastguard stations.
A telephone weather forecast service, operating within a 20-mile radius from
London, is to be inaugurated early in 1956, and will later be extended to other areas.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Oversea Telecommunications
All the oversea telephone services from the United Kingdom have, for a great
many years, been developed and operated by the Post Office. The oversea telegraph
services, on the other hand, were shared until 1950 between the Post Office and
Cable and Wireless Ltd. This company, which was brought into public ownership
on 1 st January 1947, had developed a large and valuable telegraph cable network
(some 150,000 nautical miles of submarine cable) of world-wide extent, and a large
number of radio circuits. It operated not only in the United Kingdom, but in most
parts of the Commonwealth as well as in some foreign countries. Between 1947 and
1950 the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa, India and Southern Rhodesia took over the operation of the oversea
telegraph services in their own countries, leaving the Company with its cable
network and with the operation of the network in some Colonial and foreign ter¬
ritories. Thus the Post Office operates all oversea telecommunications from the
United Kingdom.
The oversea telegraph, telex and telephone services are operated under the
general title of Post Office Cable and Wireless Services and through five London
stations having international circuits:
Telegraphs. Most of the European telegraph services are worked from the
Central Telegraph Office in St. Martin’s-le-Grand, London, from which there
are direct circuits to most European countries. The extra-European services
together with some services to Europe are operated from Electra House, Victoria
Embankment, London. In all, the Post Office transmitted 20 million telegrams
to countries abroad and received a similar number for delivery in Britain in
the year ended 31st March 1955.
Telex. The International Telex Exchange, in the Central Telegraph Office,
St. Martin’s-le-Grand, provides a teleprinter service to 25 countries abroad. In
November 1954 the separate international and inland services were amalgamated.
In 1954-55 three-quarters of a million outgoing international calls were made.
Telephones. Telephone service to European countries is through the Conti¬
nental Exchange from which some 490 direct telephone circuits radiate to 18
continental countries. These circuits, over which calls can be connected to almost
every country in Europe, are also used to send and receive pictures and to relay
speech and music for broadcast transmissions. In i954-55 over if million
outgoing calls were made. Automatic dialling by operators to subscribers in
certain European countries has been introduced on a small scale, and will be
developed progressively. Extra-European services are connected through the
International Radio Exchange over radio circuits which provide service with
most countries outside Europe and with many of the larger liners at sea. The
number of outgoing radio calls made in i954~55 was 97,000.
Work is progressing on the first transatlantic telephone cable. This is jointly
undertaken by the Post Office, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company,
the Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation and the Eastern Tele¬
phone and Telegraph Company of Canada, to improve and expand communications
between the United Kingdom and the United States and Canada. It is expected to
be completed by the end of 1956. The Post Office cable ship, H.M.T.S. Monarch,
is laying the cable, most of which is being made in the United Kingdom. The first
part of the operation—the laying of a single one-way circuit—was completed in
September 1955.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
25 1
The United Kingdom is a member of the International Telecommunications
Union, which has its headquarters at Geneva and is the co-ordinating body for
telecommunications throughout the world.
Ship-to-Shore Radio Communications
In addition to the radio stations for oversea telecommunications, the Post Office
has 11 coast radio stations situated in the United Kingdom. These stations provide
for radiotelegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea at ranges
up to 300 miles approximately. There is also a long-distance station at Burnham-on-
Sea, which communicates with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with safety
of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radiotelegraph and
radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or aircraft and take imme¬
diate action, by radio and by advising the appropriate shore authorities, to obtain
assistance for any vessel in distress. During the year ended 31st March 1955 the
stations handled 272 cases of casualties to shipping and aircraft and dealt with
142 distress calls.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange radio-
telegrams with ships, connect radiotelephone calls between telephone subscribers
ashore and suitably equipped ships, broadcast navigational warnings and weather
bulletins, and operate direction-finding services for ships. During the year ended
31st March 1955 the stations handled 882,000 radiotelegrams and 58,000 radio¬
telephone calls; they broadcast 1,780 navigational warnings and over 10,000
weather reports; and they gave 900 radio bearings to ships.
The stations also operate a free medical advice service whereby the Master of a
ship may obtain advice on the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury
aboard ship. In the year ended March 1955 the stations dealt with 500 medical
messages in this service.
The Post Office Counter: Agency and Direct Services
Largely as a result of the extension of social legislation and the widening scope of
the social services, the volume of work measured on a time basis at post office
counters has increased considerably compared with the total for i938~39- In the
16 years to 1954-55 the cash turnover increased from just over £1,000 million to
£3,977 million.
At the post office counter the citizen can draw his pension and his family allow¬
ance, buy a licence for his gun, dog, sound radio or television receiving set (see
p. 399), renew his car licence, buy stamps for National Insurance (see p. 323) or f°r
National Savings certificates (see p. 290) and bank his savings. In these and many
similar transactions the Post Office acts as an agent for other Government Depart¬
ments. Of the 48 million postal drafts paid out by the Post Office in 1954-55.
34 million were in payment of sickness benefits under the National Insurance
Scheme.
Counter sales include also an increasing volume of direct Post Office business:
during the year ended 31st March 1955 about 605 million postal orders were
issued by post offices, an increase of over 11 million on the previous year s record
figure.
For over ninety years the Post Office Savings Bank (see p. 290) has supported
the financial stability of Britain and the well-being of its citizens. Approximately
one out of every two persons in Britain has a savings account or other holding
with the Post Office, and active savings bank accounts numbered nearly 23 million
in July 1955.
VII. LABOUR
MANPOWER
The total working population1 of the United Kingdom at the end of June 1955
was just over 24^ million, some 47 per cent of the total population, and included
about 70 per cent of persons of normal working age (15 years to 59 years for women,
15 years to 64 years for men). In fact, about 95 per cent of British men of working
age are today in or seeking gainful work. The remaining 5 per cent consist mainly
of those continuing their education, of the severely disabled and of some persons
of private means. The proportion of women of working age in or seeking gainful
work is much lower, about 45 per cent, as many housewives have no wish to take
employment outside the home, or if they have, are prevented by household duties
from doing so. Besides those of normal working age, there are more than a million
older men and women still at work. The great majority of the working population
work for a wage or salary, but about i| million are employers or self-employed.
The make-up of the working population has been affected during the century by
decreases in both birth and death rates, the result of which has been that the
proportion of both the total population and the working population over the age of
35 has increased considerably. Changes in social habits have also had their effect.
The minimum working age has been raised to 15 years. The proportion of those
over the normal working age who are occupied has declined (though the great
increase in the number of older persons has meant that the actual number who are
working has increased). The proportion of men aged 20 to 64 who are at work has
remained high and fairly uniform. Among women, on the other hand, there has
been a steady increase during the century in the proportions employed in the age
groups 15 to 59, but this has been offset by the raising of the minimum working age
and by a decrease in the proportion of women employed above the age of 59. There
has been a considerable increase in the employment of married women during this
century, most noticeably in the last twenty years.
The proportion of women at work is generally higher for single than for married
women of the same age and for younger as compared with older women of the same
marital status. Thus in 1951 only 16 per cent of married women aged 55 to 59 were
at work compared with 37 per cent of married women aged 20 to 24. About one-half
of the female labour force is under 35 years of age, though an increasing number of
middle-aged women have recently been taking work, including part-time work.
The total working population is now higher than before the war, but probably
lower than during the middle of hostilities when housewives, including mothers of
young children, manned war factories at great personal inconvenience, while men
served in the armed forces. From the end of the war until mid-1947 the size of the
working population declined as women left industry. At the same time the expan¬
sion of the population of working age, a feature of the British economy for two
centuries, slowed down, largely as a result of the low birth rates of the 1930s, and
1 The total working population represents the estimated total number of persons aged
1 ■: and over who work for pay or gain, or register themselves as available for such work.
The total comprises the armed forces, men and women on release leave not yet in employ¬
ment all persons—employers and workers on their own account as well as employees—in
civil employment (including persons temporarily laid off but still on the employers’ pay¬
rolls) and wholly unemployed persons registered for employment. Part-time workers are
counted as full units.

in the case of women it actually halted. Further, the raising of the school-leaving
age in 1947 removed the 14 age group from the working population. However, after
remaining fairly steady from mid-1948 to mid-1949, the total working population
rose from mid-1949 to the end of 1951, if allowance is made for seasonal variations.
Among the reasons for this rise were the continued increase in the number of men
in the working age groups and the return of a number of women to part-time or
whole-time work. The working population fell slightly between the end of 1951 and
the end of 1952, but since then has continued its steady rise.
The broad changes in the manpower position in Great Britain between mid-1948
and mid-1955 are shown in Table 30.

Deployment of Labour
Nearly 45 per cent of those in civil employment are employed in the mining and
manufacturing industries and only about 5 per cent in agriculture and fishing. Over
half of those in manufacturing are in the metals, engineering, vehicles and chemicals

groups of industries, in which the total labour force has approximately doubled in
the last 20 years.
Most industries employ women as well as men, but there are jobs, such as under¬
ground work in coal mines, which are forbidden to women. The industrial groups
in which women are chiefly employed are in the manufacture of textiles, clothing,
and food, drink and tobacco, and in the distributive trades and professional and
miscellaneous services.
An analysis of the total number in civil employment by broad industrial groups is
given in Table 31.
The figures in Table 31 for the manufacturing and basic industries include those
engaged on administrative and clerical work, so that the numbers engaged on
productive processes are smaller than those given for the industries as a whole.
The 1951 Census One Per Cent Sample Tables (see page 7) showed that less than

a third of men at work and less than a quarter of women at work were employed in
manual occupations in mining or manufacturing industry. On the other hand, there
were in Great Britain at the time of the 1951 Census of Population over 1,400,000
women clerical workers (including typists), over 800,000 in retail trade, over one
million women domestic workers or charwomen (including those in hotels, insti¬
tutions and offices), 500,000 women in various other forms of personal service
(including catering), nearly a quarter of a million nurses, and 220,000 women
teachers.
In June 1955 the unemployed constituted one per cent of insured employees in
Great Britain. Unemployment was mainly short-term. The total number of persons
unemployed for more than six months in Great Britain was about 0-2 per cent of the
number of insured employees. Three-quarters of these long-term unemployed were

men and women over 40 years of age, some 40 per cent of whom were concentrated
in certain areas where unemployment had been especially severe between 1921 and
1939-
Unemployment in all areas has been very greatly reduced since the pre-war years,
both because of changes in the general economic situation and because of specific
measures taken by the Government to promote a balanced distribution of industry
in order to prevent the recurrence of severe unemployment in the areas previously
most seriously affected (see p. 129).
Considerable changes in the distribution of persons between various industries
and occupations have taken place during the twentieth century. Some short-term
changes were brought about by the two world wars and by the severe trade reces¬
sion and unemployment of the inter-war years, but the following appear to be the
main long-term trends:
1. A continuance at a decreasing rate of the decline in agricultural employment
which was rapid at the end of the nineteenth century.
2. A general increase in administrative and clerical employment, including
public administration, and a very large increase in the employment of
women in clerical work, including typing.
3. A decline in employment in certain large old-established industries, notably
coalmining and cotton textiles.
4. A very large increase in employment in the metals, engineering and vehicles
group of industries and the chemicals group of industries. Employment in
these industries approximately doubled between 1931 and 1951. Expansion
has been most marked in those sections of the industries making relatively
new types of products, e.g., cars, aircraft, electrical and electronic apparatus
and plastics. The rate of increase in certain branches of these industries was
accelerated during both world wars.
5. A decline in indoor private domestic service in which the number of women
employed has fallen by about a million since 1900.
6. A considerable increase in the numbers employed in the distributive trades.
This trend was reversed during both world wars—e.g., the number in the
distributive trades fell by 930,000 during the last war, and although increas¬
ing is still below the 1939 level—but appears to be fairly continuous in time
of peace.
Northern Ireland
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed but excluding certain unpaid helpers—is about 550,000. The
Government of Northern Ireland does not publish up-to-date monthly estimates
of total working population but at end-May 1955 the number of male employees
was 297,000 and of female employees 176,000. The industry with the largest
number of employees is the linen industry; there are only some 20,000 employees
in agriculture. Most agricultural work in Northern Ireland, however, is done by
small farmers and their families without hired help and the total number of persons
engaged in agriculture is over 150,000.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
The provision of employment services in Great Britain has been one of the prin¬
cipal functions of the Ministry of Labour and National Service since its inception in
1916. Northern Ireland has its own legislation in these matters which embodies the
LABOUR
257
main principles of the corresponding legislation in Great Britain, but owing to the
much smaller area of administration and the less favourable employment situation,
the facilities available are not so comprehensive in their scope as is the case in Great
Britain, and administrative arrangements are in some respects on different lines.
The responsible Department is the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance.
The following account, therefore, of services in Great Britain applies in general
to Northern Ireland except where otherwise stated. The scope of the services in
Great Britain has gradually been extended to include the provision of vocational
guidance, and, in suitable cases, of vocational training. The Employment and
Training Act, 1948, provided a permanent legislative basis for these wider services.
The main services are provided through the country-wide network of some 1,200
local Employment and Branch Employment Offices. Local Employment Com¬
mittees, composed of representatives of employers, workers and other local interests,
are attached to most Employment Exchanges as advisory bodies to secure for the
Department the full benefit of local knowledge and the close co-operation of
employers and workers. In addition, an Appointments Service, intended to meet the
needs of men and women who are qualified, or who are likely to qualify, for profes¬
sional, administrative, managerial, senior executive and higher technical and
scientific posts at home and overseas, is operated by the following offices in Great
Britain staffed by officials of the Ministry of Labour and National Service:
1. The Technical and Scientific Register, kept centrally in London, which
deals with professionally qualified scientists, engineers, architects and
surveyors.
2. Regional Nursing Appointments Offices (n) and Nursing Appointments
Offices (over 160), which deal with recruitment for training and employ¬
ment in nursing, midwifery, radiography, physiotherapy, occupational
therapy and medical laboratory technical work.
3. Appointments Offices (3) which deal with all other persons qualified for
professional and higher technical posts; senior executives; ex-regular officers
of the armed forces; and young men suitable for training for management in
industry and commerce.
In normal times there is no compulsion on any job-seeker or on any employer
requiring labour to use these Government services. Since 25th February 1952,
however, a Statutory Order, the Notification of Vacancies Order, 1952, has obliged
employers to recruit most types of ordinary labour through local offices of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service or through employment agencies regis¬
tered with the Ministry. The main object of this Order, which is flexible in its
application and permits many personal and occupational exceptions, is to give
employment officers every chance to persuade job-seekers to undertake work of
national importance, e.g., in defence or in the basic industries. This Order does
not give the Ministry any power to direct labour. The Order does not apply to
Northern Ireland.
General Services for Adults
Local offices and offices of the Appointments Service accept on their registers
both employed and unemployed persons seeking employment. Their primary
function is to introduce suitable persons seeking employment to employers requir¬
ing employees, thus providing an efficient service to employers and job-seekers and
meeting the needs of the national economy.
The appointments offices also operate a scheme for financing short business
courses for suitable ex-regular Service men and women, and provide a Careers
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
258
Advice Service for suitably qualified men and women of 18 years of age and over
on the choice of a career. This service is particularly valuable to young graduates
and other suitable young men and women, including those who have just finished
a period of service with the armed forces.
A special responsibility of the local offices is recruitment under the Vocational
Training Schemes. Two of these schemes—that for the disabled and that for men
and women who need this kind of help if they are to obtain suitable employment
after a period of voluntary service in the regular armed forces—are directed to the
resettlement of the individual and cover a comprehensive range of skilled trades
from agriculture to watch and clock repair, from radio and television servicing to
clerical work. Unemployed men and women have also been recruited for this wide
range of trades in some circumstances. The third Vocational Training Scheme is
directed to the filling of urgent vacancies in industries which are important to the
national economy and which at the same time suffer from shortages of skilled labour.
Any suitable man or woman without an employable skill is recruited under this
scheme, which includes 20 to 30 skilled courses including agriculture, engineering
and draughtsmanship.
Training under all these schemes is given mainly at Government Training
Centres, of which there are 16 in different parts of Great Britain and, for some trades,
in technical colleges or in an employer’s establishment. Courses vary in length
according to the occupation; most last for six months. Maintenance allowances are
paid during training, and men and women with dependants receive higher rates.
These maintenance allowances are higher than the rate for unemployment benefit.
During the period from the beginning of the post-war training scheme on 2nd July
1945 to 13th June 1955 the number of trainees placed in employment was 121,021.
Training schemes for particular groups of crafts have been drawn up in consulta¬
tion with representatives of employers and workers, who have agreed that trainees
should be accepted in industry for work which makes full use of the knowledge
acquired during the course. In trades where it is usual for the employee to provide
his own tools he is given these free on talcing up a job in his training trade. The job
itself is found whenever possible by the Employment Exchange (local office).
The Ministry of Labour and National Service sponsors as a free service to
industry the Training Within Industry for Supervisors scheme which gives training
to supervisors in three essential skills, i.e. in instructing and passing on informa¬
tion, in leading and fostering harmonious working relationships, and in improving
working methods. The Ministry is prepared to extend a measure of these services
to oversea branches of British firms. It is prepared also to train suitable persons to
develop the scheme in their own territories. The arrangements may be made by the
Government of the country concerned or (where appropriate) by the International
Labour Organization.
In recent years the Government, with the support of the representatives of
employers’ and workpeople’s organizations, has followed a policy of encouraging
the wider employment of older men and women. In October 195 3 National
Advisory Committee on the Employment of Older Men and Women, appointed by
the Minister of Labour and National Service to advise and assist him in this
matter, presented its first Report (Cmd. 8963). This Report recommended that the
following general principles should govern employers’ engagement and retirement
policy:
(1) that the test for engagement should be capacity and not age; and
(2) that all who can give effective service either in their normal work or in any
alternative work that employers can provide, should have the opportunity
to continue at work if they so wish. It also made recommendations for
LABOUR 259
overcoming some of the difficulties that might prevent these principles
being applied.
The Report received widespread publicity and support, and employers are show¬
ing an increasing willingness to consider the older worker on his merits and to relax
former rules and customs preventing the retention of their employees beyond a
fixed age. The Government has also been adjusting its own engagement and retire¬
ment practices where necessary to bring them into line with this policy.
Services for Foreigners
Foreigners are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment with a
particular employer, provided they are in possession of a permit issued to the
prospective employer by the Ministry of Labour and National Service (the Ministry
of Labour and National Insurance for Northern Ireland if the proposed employ¬
ment is in Northern Ireland). Employment is limited to a maximum of one year in
the first instance but may be extended on application by the employer. If a foreigner
already landed in Great Britain, for example as a visitor, seeks to enter employment,
his prospective employer must obtain prior approval from the Ministry of Labour
and National Service. Approval is subject to the same conditions and requirements
as are applied to the grant of permits to foreigners while still abroad.
The general conditions which must be satisfied before a permit is granted are:
that the proposed employment of a foreigner is reasonable and necessary in the
circumstances; that adequate efforts have been made by the employer to find suit¬
able labour from among British subjects (or foreigners long resident in the United
Kingdom); and that the wages and conditions of employment proposed for the
foreigners are not less favourable than those commonly accorded to British
employees for similar work in the district concerned.
In considering applications for permits, various other factors must be considered
according to the nature of the proposed employment. Special arrangements have
been applied to the admission of foreigners for nursing, teaching, various forms of
entertainment, and in particular industries. In principle, permits for unskilled
workers in industry are granted only in those industries which are particularly
important to the national economy and where there is a general shortage of labour.
To encourage visits and exchanges of young workers between Britain and other
countries, applications from prospective employers for permits for student em¬
ployees are granted freely under properly sponsored arrangements, organized mostly
through unofficial channels.
A foreigner who has been allowed to take employment under a permit, or by the
approval of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, may not change his
employment, unless his prospective employer has obtained prior approval from the
Ministry to employ the foreigner. From May 1946 to the end of 1954, 275,974
permits were granted, of which 169,754 were for resident domestic servants in
hospitals, schools, other institutions and private households, and 24,317 for student
employees.
The permit system applies to individual aliens. After the second world war, far
greater numbers were being admitted under various group schemes organized by
the Ministry of Labour and National Service.
There were two main group schemes for the employment of alien labour. The
first was the Polish Resettlement Corps, established in 1946 to resettle those mem¬
bers of the Polish Forces who felt themselves unable to return to post-war Poland.
Three years later, when the Corps was disbanded, practically all the 114,000 Poles
who had been its members were re-settled. Of these, almost 100,000 had chosen to
260
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
remain in the United Kingdom, many of them to be absorbed into the British
building, agricultural and coalmining industries.
The second large-scale project for the introduction of foreign labour to this
country was the European Volunteer Workers scheme. Workers came to Britain
from the displaced persons camps of the three Western Zones of Germany and
Austria, from Denmark, and finally from the towns and villages of Germany and
Austria. By the end of 1949, 65,000 male volunteers had been placed in work,
mainly in agriculture (35,000) and coalmining (11,000). By that time, those two
industries had reached saturation point as far as foreign workers were concerned
and no more men were recruited. When the recruitment of women ended in April
1951, 33,950 female volunteers had been settled in employment, mainly as domestic
servants (13,300), textile workers (17,200) and nurses (2,200), but difficulties of
absorption were being encountered. The most serious of these difficulties was the
housing shortage, which had the effect of limiting the field from which the aliens
could be selected, since it made it necessary that alien volunteers for work in the
United Kingdom should be without dependants.
Youth Employment Service
The Ministry of Labour and National Service is also responsible in Great Britain
for two specialized employment services: the Youth Employment Service and the
Disablement Resettlement Service.
The purpose of the Youth Employment Service is to help young people leaving
school and young workers under 18 to get a good start in their working life.
The service is under the general direction of the Central Youth Employment
Executive, staffed by officers of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, the
Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education Department. This joint executive
is appointed by the Minister of Labour and National Service, who is responsible to
Parliament for the Youth Employment Service as a whole. The Minister has
appointed a National Youth Employment Council and separate Advisory Com¬
mittees for Scotland and for Wales to advise him on questions relating to the
service.
Locally the service is operated in most areas through Youth Employment Offices
established by local education authorities (in Scotland by education authorities)
in accordance with the schemes submitted by them to the Minister of Labour and
National Service and approved by him. In those areas where such schemes are not
in operation, the service is operated by the local office of the Ministry of Labour and
National Service.
The main functions of the service are to collect and disseminate careers informa¬
tion, provide talks in schools, give vocational guidance, help to find suitable employ¬
ment and keep contact with young workers to assist them in settling down. A
further function is to assist employers in filling their vacancies for young people.
Local Youth Employment Committees, made up of teachers, employers, workers
and other appropriate interests, assist the service in an advisory capacity.
In Northern Ireland, the Youth Employment Service is operated by the Ministry
of Labour and National Insurance; in addition local education authorities in some
areas provide a Vocational Guidance Service. In these areas, there is close liaison
between the Ministry and the authorities.
Disablement Resettlement Service
The Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944, on which all the Ministry’s work
for disabled persons is based, declares that its purpose is ‘ to make further and better
provision for enabling persons handicapped by disablement to secure employment
LABOUR
261
or work on their own account’, and the Disablement Resettlement Service is
designed to help disabled persons to get and keep suitable work. The service is
available to all persons over school-leaving age who are substantially handicapped
as a result of injury, disease or congenital deformity.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service is responsible for the administra¬
tion of the service. At each of its 1,200 local offices a Disablement Resettlement
Officer, working under the direction of the Manager and in co-operation with other
officers, has the special duty of advising and assisting disabled persons in obtaining
suitable employment. This officer is in touch with all the hospitals in his area and
visits any patient who wishes to discuss the question of future employment. His
work involves close co-operation with doctors, local authorities and voluntary
welfare agencies.
There is also a Disablement Resettlement Officer with similar functions at each
of the three appointments offices.
The help given by the service falls under four main headings:
1. Vocational Guidance. This is given at local offices by Disablement Resettle¬
ment Officers in consultation, as necessary, with the local Disablement Advisory
Committees or Medical Interviewing Committees, and also by vocational psycho¬
logists in the Industrial Rehabilitation Units (see paragraph 3).
2. Placing in Ordinary Competitive Employment. On the basis of a disabled
person’s qualifications and aptitudes and with medical guidance, the Disablement
Resettlement Officer endeavours to find work most suitable for the individual, either
immediately, or after a course of industrial rehabilitation or vocational training. To a
limited extent this is facilitated by the main provision of the Disabled Persons
Employment Act, 1944, namely, that all employers of more than 20 persons are
bound by law to employ a quota (at present 3 per cent for almost all industries) of
registered disabled persons. Registration is voluntary. The number of disabled
persons registered was 825,359 at 18th July 1955 and of these 31,574 were con¬
sidered to be capable of ordinary employment but were unemployed. This figure is
estimated as about 3-9 per cent of the total number of registered disabled persons
capable of ordinary competitive employment.
3. Industrial Rehabilitation and Vocational Training. Industrial rehabilitation is
provided at residential and non-residential units run by the Ministry of Labour and
National Service where physical and mental toning-up is given and, for those who
need it, vocational guidance as to the best kind of employment to take up.1
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government Training
Centres, educational institutions and employers’ establishments (see p. 258).
For the more seriously disabled, however, there are special residential training
colleges run by voluntary organizations with the financial assistance and technical
help of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. There are also arrangements
for the training of special categories of disabled persons such as the blind.
4. Sheltered Employment. Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company,
with no share capital, was established in Great Britain in accordance with the pro¬
visions of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944. Its objects are to provide
training and employment facilities for registered disabled persons who are unlikely
to obtain work except under special conditions. Its powers are wide enough to cover
the provision of special factories and workshops, hostel accommodation and facilities
for home workers. The directors are appointed by the Minister of Labour and

with its own rehabilitation scheme, see photograph facing p. 342.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
National Service; funds for capital development and to meet operational costs are
provided by loans and grants under the Ministry of Labour Vote. At 21st June 1955
Remploy Ltd. operated 90 factories and employed 6,196 severely disabled men and
women, including 153 homeworkers.
Facilities for the employment of blind persons are provided by local authorities
directly or through voluntary bodies, with the financial assistance of the Ministry
of Labour and National Service. At end-June 1955 there were 69 workshops for
the blind in which there were 333 blind persons in training and 3,847 in employ¬
ment. The Ministry also helped to finance the provision of training or employment
for 901 severely disabled sighted persons in 44 workshops provided by 35 volun¬
tary undertakings or local authorities. Some 1,300 blind persons and 15 severely
disabled sighted persons were also working at home under homeworkers’ schemes.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
At the beginning of the nineteenth century industrial workers were without any
legitimate means of defending their standards of living or of ameliorating their
working conditions. The traditional methods of fixing wages had become obsolete,
trade unions were regarded as criminal conspiracies, and there was no protective
legislation setting minimum standards of safety, health and welfare in places of
work.
The first attempt at protective legislation was the Health and Morals of Appren¬
tices Act, 1802, but the first effective Factory Act was that of 1833 which created an
inspectorate employed and paid by the central Government to enforce its provisions.
Since that date, legislation extending, strengthening, adapting and consolidating the
statutory protection for employees has been passed at an accelerating rate. The
progress in standards has owed much to the recommendations of strengthened
inspectorates, much to the example of progressive employers and much to the
persistent pressure of trade unions and disinterested reformers.
Trade unions ceased to be actionable conspiracies in 1824 but their status as legal
entities was not properly established until 1871. This latter step had been made
acceptable to public opinion by the leaders of certain craft unions, who had aban¬
doned the revolutionary and financially unsound policies of earlier trade unions to
pursue a limited practical objective, i.e. the improvement of their members’ wages
and conditions through skilful and honest negotiation from positions of financial
strength.
After 1880 the organization of unskilled workers became more extensive and
effective and the whole tone of trade unionism became more militant and political.
As many employers were still hostile to trade unionism and were unwilling to
negotiate with trade unions or to recognize agreements made on an industry-wide
basis, many of the first 30 years of the twentieth century were marked by widespread
and prolonged strikes. Since i932> however, the strike rate (in terms of man-days
lost) has been very much lower, and arrangements for the negotiation of terms of
service and the peaceful settlement of disputes have become general and are on
the whole satisfactory.
Today, minimum standards have been established by statute or collective agree¬
ment for both the terms and conditions of employment and the working conditions
of the substantial majority of British workers. The fixing of terms and conditions of
employment, however, involves principles, methods and machinery quite different
from those for the determination of working conditions. Terms and conditions of
employment of the majority of workers are determined by collective agreements
LABOUR
263
between employers’ associations and trade unions, and the fixing by statute of mini¬
mum wages and terms of employment is confined to those trades or industries where
the organization of employers or workers or both is inadequate to negotiate collec¬
tive agreements and to ensure their observance.
Minimum standards for working conditions, on the other hand, are laid down by
statute, e.g., the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, and it is the duty of Government
and Local Authority Inspectors to enforce their provisions. The various Acts of
Parliament and statutory regulations made thereunder prescribe minimum stan¬
dards of safety, health and welfare for a large proportion of workers, and regulate
the hours of work for women and young persons. Health, safety or welfare require¬
ments, additional to these minimum statutory requirements, have, in some cases,
been the subject of collective agreement.
Many employers provide working conditions superior to those prescribed by
statute or agreement, and various voluntary bodies advise and assist in improving
these standards.
LABOUR RELATIONS
The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
basis, and rests on the organization of employers and workers into employers’
associations and trade unions. These organizations1 discuss and negotiate terms and
conditions of employment and other matters affecting the workpeople at their work.
In some cases these negotiations are conducted simply by ad hoc meetings, which
are held when necessary; in other cases voluntary joint machinery has been estab¬
lished on a permanent basis. Normally these arrangements suffice to settle all ques¬
tions which are raised, but provision is often made for matters not so settled to be
referred for settlement to independent arbitration. In certain trades where the
voluntary organization of employers and workers is not adequate for the effective
regulation of the workers’ remuneration, provision has also been made by the State
for statutory regulation under the Wages Councils Acts, 1945 to 1948, the Catering
Wages Act, 1943, the Agricultural Wages Act, 1948, and the Agricultural Wages
(Scotland) Act, 1949.
Employers’ Organizations
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ associations, some
of which have their origins in the nineteenth century. They are generally organized
on an ‘industry basis’—some being purely local in character and dealing with a
section of an industry only, while others have a national scope and concern them¬
selves with the whole of an industry. In some cases the local associations are
organized into district or national federations.
The central organ of employers’ associations is the British Employers’ Confedera¬
tion, to which the majority of employers’ associations and federations in the princi¬
pal industries are affiliated. It deals with matters affecting the interests of organized
employers in their relations with their workpeople, and is recognized by the
Government as the principal channel of consultation between Government Depart¬
ments and representatives of organized employers as a whole on all such matters.
The Confederation acts as an advisory and consultative body for its member
organizations, providing them with information and statistics, ascertaining and

operating the nationalized industries—negotiate with the trade unions representing their
different types of employees.
S
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
264
acting upon their collective views and representing these nationally to the Govern¬
ment and to the public, and also internationally, for example, to the International
Labour Organization.
While the main function of employers’ organizations consists in the safeguarding
of the interests of their members, a number consider that this purpose can be
furthered by the provision of advice and assistance to member firms and by such
special services as the organization of general training courses and special courses
on, for example, work study and its application. Where employers’ organizations
do not themselves provide such services they make arrangements for putting their
members in touch with the appropriate specialist agency.
Trade Unions
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organized into trade unions. These have grown up gradually
and independently over a great many years, and consequently their form and
organization vary considerably. Trade unions started more than two hundred years
ago among the skilled craftsmen and spread later to the general labouring and
unskilled classes. More recently trade unionism has increased among clerical,
supervisory, technical and administrative workers.
The qualification for membership of some unions is occupational, e.g., they may
recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed, while in others the qualification is
industrial, i.e. they seek to recruit all persons in an industry, whatever their
occupation. In a number of unions recruitment is based on a combination of these
principles. A few large unions recruit members in a number of different occupations
and industries.
At the end of 1954 the total membership of British trade unions was about
9,495,000. There were 674 separate trade unions, but about two-thirds of all trade
unionists were in the 17 largest unions.
The basic unit of organization in most British trade unions is the local branch or
lodge. Every member of the union belongs to a branch or lodge. He may attend its
meetings, put forward suggestions about terms and conditions of employment,
discuss the work and policy of the union, and take part in the election of branch
officers. The branch takes action on certain matters considered purely or mainly of
local interest but refers wider issues to the union’s national or regional bodies.
Many unions also have shop stewards or other representatives at the place of
work to enrol members and collect dues, to report any encroachment on agreed
or customary conditions of work and in some cases to act as representatives of
members at their place of work for the settlement of grievances.
In most large unions the central organization is along the following lines. Elected
officials, including a General Secretary assisted by clerical and specialist staff, are
in charge of the work of head office and are responsible to a National Executive
Council or Committee which may be part- or full-time, and which is usually elected
by, and responsible to, annual or biennial conferences of delegates from the
branches.
Executive committees or councils play an important part in the government of
the unions; between conferences they are the highest authorities and carry out
policy decisions made by delegates.
Most unions also have some kind of regional, district or area organization, while
in large unions there is usually also a system of regional, district or area committees
or councils.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations whose ‘
main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade unions in an
LABOUR 265
industry in negotiation with employers. The scope and authority of these federa¬
tions and confederations vary greatly in different circumstances.
All the trade unions of any size or importance except the National Union of
Teachers, the National Association of Local Government Officers and certain
civil service staff associations are affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), the
national centre of the British trade union movement. The objects of the TUC are
to promote the interests of all its affiliated organizations and generally to improve
the economic and social conditions of the workers. Its membership comprises 183
organizations, of which 12 are federations of some 180 separate unions, so that
some 350 unions in all are affiliated directly or indirectly. These represent over
8 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general questions which concern
trade unions both nationally and internationally and gives assistance on questions
relating to particular trades or industries at the request of the trade union con¬
cerned. The congress of delegates, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for
a week every year to discuss matters of general interest to trade unionists and to
employees generally. The General Council, elected annually, represents the TUC
between congresses. A large part of its work consists of acting as a spokesman for
British trade unionists on matters affecting their general interests, of co-ordinating
trade union activities and determining disagreements between trade unions, of
providing a number of educational and other common services and of preparing
a report and agenda for the annual congress.
Both the TUC and a number of affiliated trade unions have in recent years paid
increasing attention to the education of their members not only in general economic
questions and trade union practice but also in production subjects including work
study and costing, which had not hitherto been thought to concern trade unions.
The TUC itself holds regular one-week courses on production and manage¬
ment subjects and on industrial relations, as well as a two-week course on trade
union subjects. It also organizes week-end schools and summer schools. These are
open to members of any affiliated union, usually by nomination from the union.
A number of the larger unions hold similar courses. In addition, arrangements are
made for union officials to attend courses on production questions at technical
colleges. Some unions also make use of industrial consultants for this purpose.
The Trades Union Congress is recognized by the Government as the principal
channel of consultation between the Government Departments and representatives
of organized workers on matters affecting the interests of employees generally.
There is also a separate Scottish Trades Union Congress, to which trade unions
may affiliate in respect of their membership in Scotland.
Branches of various trade unions in a locality often voluntarily affiliate to a local
trades council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common
interest and as local agent of the Trades Union Congress, by which it is annually
registered. There are about 530 trades councils in England and Wales alone,
grouped together in 22 federations.
Voluntary Joint Negotiating Machinery
At National Level. While in some industries all matters affecting terms and
conditions of employment are discussed on an ad hoc basis between the employers’
organizations and the trade unions concerned, in other industries* there are standard
procedures for dealing with such matters by joint discussion at a national level. In
many industries there are, for this purpose, bodies composed of representatives of
both sides of the industry with, in some cases, an independent chairman. Some are
known as Joint Industrial Councils, of which there are over 140. The functions of
these bodies vary considerably, some being simply negotiating bodies, while others
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
266
deal with a wide range of subjects affecting the interests of the industry concerned.
Provision is sometimes made in the constitution of such bodies that, where it is
not found possible to reach agreed terms of settlement in a particular dispute, the
matter should be referred to some form of conciliation or arbitration by indepen¬
dent persons, including the methods provided under the Conciliation Act, 1896,
or the Industrial Courts Act, 1919 (see below).
At District and Factory Level. Similar arrangements exist at district and factory
level in many industries, where matters are discussed either between the appropriate
representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis, or through regular machinery
provided by District Joint Industrial Councils or similar bodies and Works Councils
(see p. 268). Such bodies discuss how agreements reached at a national level may
be applied to their district or factory, but as a rule have no power to alter the terms
of such national agreements. They also discuss new problems which may arise, and
if no solution can be found at factory or district level the matter may be referred to
the national body.
Statutory Wage-Regulating Machinery
In certain industries in which, owing to the lack of organization among employers
and workers, voluntary negotiating arrangements do not exist for the effective
settlement of terms and conditions of employment or are inadequate to secure their
observance by voluntary methods throughout the industry, statutory bodies known
as Wages Councils, Catering Wages Boards and Agricultural Wages Boards have
been set up. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers
and workers in the respective industries, with the addition of certain independent
members. Wages Councils and Catering Wages Boards are empowered to submit
proposals for the fixing of minimum remuneration and of holidays with pay to the
Minister of Labour and National Service, who is then required by the Acts con¬
cerned to make Orders giving statutory force to such proposals, subject only to his
right to return them to the Board or Council for further consideration.
Orders relative to employment in agriculture are made by the appropriate
Agricultural Wages Board (England and Wales or Scotland). Such Orders are
effective only in the County Agricultural Wages Committee area in respect of
which they have been made, but there is a national minimum enforceable in England
and Wales and also one for Scotland.
State Provision for Conciliation, Arbitration and Investigation
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred by
agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators, and one way in which the
parties can find such persons is by invoking the help of the Minister of Labour and
National Service. Under authority derived from the Conciliation Act, 1896, and
the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, the Minister has certain powers to assist industry
to settle disputes which it is not found possible to resolve through an industry s own
machinery and procedure. These powers are all intended to supplement and not to
supersede the industry’s own machinery.
To assist conciliation in industry, a staff of conciliation officers forms part of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service. The duties of these officers are to keep
in touch with the course of relations between employers and workers at national,
district, and, in some cases, factory level, and to assist them, if requested, to settle
their problems by joint discussion and negotiation.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both parties,
be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or an ad hoc
LABOUR
267
Board of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent tribunal established
under the Industrial Courts Act. The Court is normally constituted of three
members—the President, one member representing employers and one represent¬
ing workpeople. At present, provision is also made by an Order under emergency
legislation for disputes and ‘issues’1 about terms and conditions of employment, to
be reported to the Minister in certain circumstances by one of the parties, and to
be referred, if all other means of settlement have been exhausted, to an Industrial
Disputes Tribunal, whose award can be legally enforced. This tribunal consists of a
chairman and two other independent members appointed by the Minister of Labour
and National Service, together with one member representing employers and one
representing workpeople. These representatives are drawn from panels appointed
by the Minister after consultation with the British Employers’ Confederation and
the Trades Union Congress respectively.
The Minister is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry or Committee of
Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended. These procedures
are primarily means of informing public opinion of the facts of a dispute and not
means of arbitration. The report of a Court of Inquiry has to be laid before Parlia¬
ment. Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such bodies are
not binding on the parties, they usually provide the basis of a settlement of the
difference.
The machinery for negotiation and conciliation of disputes has reduced the need
for direct industrial action, i.e. strikes and lock-outs. Time lost by stoppages of work
caused by industrial disputes has been substantially less in the last twenty years
than formerly. The average time lost in the 22 years i933~54 was 1 ‘9 million man-
days or about a tenth of a day per worker per year compared with an average of
21 million man-days in the 23 years 1910-32. The reduction has been in the size and
duration of strikes and not in their number. Small local strikes without the backing
of a trade union headquarters have been relatively frequent.
In 1955 strikes in coalmines, rail transport and docks involved the loss of more
man-days than in any year since 1944, though far fewer than in many earlier years.
In consequence, Government, employers’ associations and trade unions have been
considering and discussing the possibility of further arrangements to facilitate the
peaceful settlement of disputes.
Liaison between the Government and Industry
As will be seen from the foregoing paragraphs the Government is in contact
with representatives of employers and workers at all levels on matters affecting
their common interests. At local and district level the conciliation officers of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service keep in touch with the representatives of
both sides of industry, while at national level officers of the Department attend the
meetings of many Joint Industrial Councils as liaison officers. Standing arrange¬
ments also exist for consultation between the Government, the British Employers’
Confederation and the Trades Union Congress through the National Joint Advi¬
sory Council, which was set up in 1939 to advise the Government on matters in
which employers and workers have a common interest. It meets quarterly under
the chairmanship of the Minister of Labour and National Service. Its membership
consists of representatives of the British Employers’ Confederation and the Trades
Union Congress, together with representatives of the managements of nationalized

268
industries. Among the subjects which it has considered in recent years are the
machinery for settling industrial disputes, joint consultation in industry, industrial
training and recruitment, double day shiftworking, and the economic situation with
special reference to production, wages and prices.
In July 1955 the NJAC, in view of strikes earlier in the year, considered the whole
problem of industrial relations and of further possible improvements in procedures
aimed at minimizing stoppages. There was general agreement that legislative action
was not appropriate and the matter was referred to the Joint Consultative Com¬
mittee of the NJAC for further consideration.
Joint Consultation in Industry at Factory Level
In addition to the arrangements already described, the purpose of which is
mainly but not exclusively for discussion and settlement of terms and conditions of
employment, there are, in many industries, national agreements which recommend
the establishment, in firms of sufficient size, of machinery for joint consultation
between management and workers on problems of common interest. In some
industries the constitution and functions of Works Councils are laid down in the
agreement, while in others model constitutions are made available. In other
industries, where no national agreement on the subject has been reached, the
practice of joint consultation in the factory is becoming increasingly widespread.
The range of subjects which Works Councils can fruitfully discuss is wide and
includes hours of work (within the framework of agreements), safety, efficiency of
production, absenteeism, labour turnover, training, education, recreation and
employees’ services generally. The constitution and functions of these bodies
vary widely from one firm to another. It is the general practice, however, to exclude
from their scope all questions relating to wages and conditions of employment, and
other matters covered by negotiation between organizations of employers and
workers. It is the policy of the Government to foster the development of voluntary
joint consultation throughout industry, not only because of its effect on production
but also as a most important means of maintaining good relationships between
management and employees.
At individual factory level, Personnel Management Advisers of the Ministry of
Labour and National Service are often approached by firms seeking advice on the
establishment of Works Councils or on ways in which their activities can be made
more effective.
Labour Relations of Public Authorities
The above broad description of labour-management relations in industries where
employers and employees are strongly organized applies in general to the public
as well as to the private sector. There are, however, some special features both in
the public service and in the nationalized industries.
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are under the direct control of the Treasury, are permitted and
encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service staff associations (trade unions)
and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint consultation by
means of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils1 (see pp. 61-62), corre¬
sponding to the Joint Industrial Councils in industry. The two sides of the National
Whitley Council are parties to a Civil Service Arbitration Agreement which pro¬
vides that, subject to certain limitations, if there is failure to reach agreement by
1 Named after Mr. J. H. Whitley, former Speaker of the House of Commons and chair¬
man of a committee which investigated industrial unrest from 1916 to iQtQ-
LABOUR
269
negotiation a Department or Association may report the dispute to the Minister
of Labour and National Service for reference to the Civil Service Arbitration
Tribunal. The Tribunal is an independent one appointed by the Minister by
virtue of his powers under the Industrial Courts Act, Industrial employees
of the central Government are organized by trades and not by Departments. Nego¬
tiations regarding their wages and conditions of employment take place on Trade
Joint Councils and Departmental Joint Councils.
In local government services there are separate National Whitley Councils for
the main grades of employees (e.g., manual, clerical and technical employees, and
road-menders, see p. 68) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well
as other matters. There are corresponding Regional and District Councils.
In the nationalized industries the main corporations, though not subject to
detailed governmental control, have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining in their industries and for joint consultation
with their employees; but in carrying out these duties they are free to choose the
arrangements that suit them. In nearly every case a complex system already existed
before nationalization and has been taken over and modified. The arrangements,
therefore, as in industry generally, vary substantially. The main difference from
private industry is that the corporations are not members of employers’ associa¬
tions. In some industries they are sole or main employers, but even where part of
the industry is in private hands, as for example in air or road transport, the corpora¬
tions are separately and directly represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Northern Ireland
The system of labour relations in Northern Ireland is based on the same prin¬
ciples as that of Great Britain and, in these matters, the Minister of Labour and
National Insurance has powers and duties broadly similar to those of the Minister
of Labour and National Service in Great Britain. About 90 per cent of trade
unionists in Northern Ireland are members of trade unions whose headquarters
are in Great Britain.
WORKING CONDITIONS: THE LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND
Protective legislation in mines and quarries, factories, building and civil engineer¬
ing, docks, wharves, and industrial workplaces generally is detailed and comprehen¬
sive and its enforcement strict, and a certain amount of protective legislation also
exists in respect of non-industrial occupations.
The Government has accepted in principle recommendations made in 1949 by a
committee under the chairmanship of Sir Ernest Gowers for extending to non¬
industrial occupations safety, health and welfare requirements similar to those for
factories; and has announced its intention of introducing the necessary legislation
as soon as Parliamentary time can be found for it.
Local authorities have power to regulate the provision of suitable sanitary con¬
veniences in houses and at places of work and to treat workplaces which are dirty or
dangerously ill-ventilated or overcrowded as nuisances whose abatement can be
enforced. They have also wide powers to regulate hours and conditions of employ¬
ment of children in their areas within the limits laid down by national legislation.
The general effect of the national legislation is to forbid the employment of children
under 13 years of age, to forbid the employment of children between the ages of 13
and 15 during school hours, or between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. on any day, or for more
than two hours before or after school or on Sundays. The employment of children
in any industrial undertaking before they reach the age of 15 is prohibited.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
270
The Shops Act, 1950, consolidating earlier Shops Acts, empowers local authorities
to ensure that all shops in their areas have proper ventilation, temperature, lighting,
sanitary and washing facilities, and that they observe the requirements of the Act
with regard to closing hours, meal intervals and holidays.
Certain industrial premises, e.g., factories, shipyards and docks, come under the
Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, which are administered by the Ministry of Labour
and National Service and enforced by Her Majesty’s Factory Inspectorate, which is
part of the Ministry.
The Acts lay down general requirements with regard to safety, such as the fencing
and proper maintenance of machinery, lifting appliances and steam boilers and
other pressure vessels; sound construction and proper maintenance of floors,
passages and stairs, safe means of access to workplaces and means of escape in case
of fire; and the prevention of escape of dangerous fumes and dust into the work¬
room. They also lay down general requirements with regard to health and welfare,
e.g., with regard to cleanliness, the provision of sanitary accommodation, cubic
space per worker, temperature, ventilation, lighting, washing facilities, accommo¬
dation for outdoor clothing, drinking water, first aid and provision of seats.
Any person intending to use premises as a factory has to notify the Inspector of
Factories of his intention not less than one month before he begins to occupy them.
All young persons under 18 years of age must be medically examined by doctors
appointed by the Chief Inspector of Factories on entry to employment in factories,
docks, or on building operations, and must be re-examined annually. The hours
permissible to be worked by women and young persons between the ages of 16 and
18 are limited to 48 in a week and 9 in a day, although some overtime is allowed
(up to six hours a week for not more than 100 hours a year nor in more than 25
weeks in a year). Young persons under 16 years of age are limited to 44 hours a
week. Adequate intervals for meals must be arranged for women and young persons
and the employment of women and girls by night is, in general, prohibited.
These general requirements for safety, health and welfare are supplemented or
modified by regulations providing safeguards against special risks or conditions in
particular industries, processes, establishments or machines.
The safety, health and welfare of workers in mines and quarries are the subject of
comprehensive legislation. Protective legislation in mines began with an Act of
1842, which forbade the employment of women underground, and successive
measures since then laid down detailed requirement for the safe conduct of
operations and dealt with such matters as ventilation, dust suppression, rescue
work, first aid and the initial medical examination of certain new entrants by official
doctors. The latest stage was reached, when the Mines and Quarries Act was
passed in 1954. This Act establishes the basic modern principles of safety, health
and welfare, leaving the details to be dealt with in statutory regulations; it both
consolidates the previous law and brings it up to date. Apart from technical
matters, it also covers such subjects as the general responsibilities of owners and
managements, the appointment and duties of officials, training, welfare, the powers
of official inspectors, statutory qualifications of managers and under-rnanagers,
employment of women and young persons, and inspections on behalf of work¬
men. . . .
The Ministry of Fuel and Power is generally responsible for the administration
of these enactments, while the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, which is part of
that Ministry, is directly responsible for their enforcement.
In agriculture, special attention has been paid to the protection of workers against
risks of poisoning, due to the use of toxic chemicals, and the Agricultural (Poisonous
Substances) Act, 1952 imposed necessary safeguards. Further legislation is
LABOUR •
271
contemplated for agriculture and forestry which will deal with such matters as the
fencing of dangerous machines, the provision of sanitary facilities, and first aid.
The Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1938, extended the restrictions on the
hours of work of young persons to certain occupations not covered by the Factories
Acts, the Mines and Quarries Acts, or Shops Acts. The proportion of young
workers whose hours were subject to statutory limitation was estimated in 1947 to
be about 65 per cent.
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been the
subject of legislation similar to that in Great Britain but embodied in separate
statutes to meet the special requirements of Northern Ireland. Provision for the
safety, health and welfare of workers in factories, workshops, ship and building
yards and certain other working premises is embodied in the Factories Acts
(Northern Ireland), 1939 and 1949. The Minister of Labour and National Insurance
is responsible for the administration of these Acts and for their enforcement by a
Factory Inspectorate, forming part of his Department.
WORKING CONDITIONS IN PRACTICE
Earnings
Standard minimum time rates for British manual workers vary mainly between
2S. pd. and 4s. an hour for men, and between is. 9d. and 2s. pd. for women. These
basic time rates are not, however, an accurate guide to average earnings. Higher
time rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates, shift rates and overtime rates
raise the level of average earnings. The Ministry of Labour and National Service
conducts a six-monthly survey of earnings and hours of work in some of the
principal British industries. The survey for April 1955 covered about 7 million
workers and showed the average hourly earnings in all the industries covered to be
as follows:
Men 21 years and over .. .. .. ..4s. 5 4d.
Youths and boys under 21 years . . . . . . 2s. 0-2d.
Women 18 years and over .. .. .. ..2s. 8-2d.
Girls under 18 years .. .. .. •• ..Is. 8-ld.
All workers .. .. . • • • • • • • 3s. 10-6d.
Average weekly earnings were:
Men  217s- 5d-
Youths . . . . . • • • • • • • • • 90s. lid.
Women .. .. •• •• •• •• •• H2s. 5d.
Girls  71s. 6d.
All workers . . . . • • • • • • • • 182s. 3d.
The principal industries not covered by this survey were agriculture, where the
average weekly earnings for regular adult male wrorkers were 15os- 9 ^d. in the year
April 1954 to March 1955; coalmining, where, according to information collected
by the National Coal Board, the average weekly cash earnings for men were
266s. 8d. plus 12s. 8d. in kind, in May 1955; railway services, in which average
weekly earnings in March 1955 (including those of non-manual workers but
excluding those of higher paid salaried staff) were 207s. 6d. for men and 125s. 6d.
for women; and dock labour, in which average weekly earnings of dock workers
employed by the National Dock Labour Board for April to June 1955 were 246s.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
272
The difference between men’s and women’s earnings in industry is due mainly to
the fact that women are for the most part engaged on different tasks from men and
are paid less than men on the grounds that these tasks are unskilled or semi-skilled.
Where a few women are employed in a preponderantly male occupation, they
sometimes receive the same rates as men.
There are no similarly detailed and comprehensive figures for the rates of pay
and earnings of non-manual workers, as these are often based on individual con¬
tracts, except in the public service, teaching and retail distribution. The rather
limited evidence suggests that the majority of male non-manual workers—the
clerks and shop-assistants—have average earnings little different in range from
those of manual workers, but the earnings of women in these occupations are
somewhat higher than in manual occupations. The pay of shop-assistants is on
scales prescribing weekly minima of from about £5 15s. to £7 for men and about
£4 to £5 for women. The Office Management Association makes periodical sur¬
veys of clerical salaries. The latest survey (1st March 1954) which covers 831
establishments employing 70,537 workers, shows that the average weekly salaries
for young inexperienced clerks ranged mainly from 50s. to 65s. for youths and from
45s. to 60s. for girls, while average salaries for adult male clerks ranged from £7 for
the lowest grade of skill and responsibility to £12 for the highest. Corresponding
women’s salaries were about 28 per cent less.
The starting salaries in many professional and technical careers are often in the
range of £350 to £500 a year; such posts offer increments and opportunities for
LABOUR
273
promotion, but as recently as 1949-50 only about one per cent of all employees
were earning over £1,000 a year, only about per cent over £2,000 and less than
o-i per cent over £5,000. More recent information about the spread of incomes in
different occupations is available from an unofficial source, a sample survey of
personal incomes and savings by H. F. Lydall. Table 32 is based on this source.

(a) Employment income includes income from wages, salaries, pensions from employers,
casual earnings of non-professional workers, bonuses, tips, etc.
(b) The income unit is defined as follows: (1) all single persons of 18 or over, whether
living alone or with other members of their family, are regarded as separate income units;
if they have dependent children of their own (of under 18), as may happen in the case of
widows and divorced and separated people, their children form part of their income unit;
(2) married couples living together are assumed to pool their incomes and each couple is
counted as a single unit, and their children of under 18 are also included in their income
unit.
Note. #=less than half of one per cent.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service are in
the range of from £1,000 to £5,000 a year. The posts of from £5>000 t° £I0»000
a year include Cabinet Ministers, chairmen and some other members of the boards
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
274
of nationalized industries, Judges of the High Court and Court of Appeal, and
Lords of Appeal, the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, the clerks of the largest
municipal authorities, a few persons outstanding in their professions and the top-
management of large businesses. A few persons in business draw still higher
salaries.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices, admini¬
strative posts and professions. They are paid the same salary for doing the same
work in medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, radiography, university teaching,
journalism, broadcasting and architecture, and as Ministers of the Crown, Members
of Parliament, salaried magistrates and solicitors, pharmacists working in hospitals,
and administrative, professional and technical workers in local government. Profes¬
sional men and women earning fees also have equal pay. In almost all other
occupations, however, a woman in Britain doing the same job as a man is at present
paid less for doing it, although the position may be quite different in a few years’
time. The Government has stated that it accepts the principle of equal pay, and
steps are being taken to put it into effect by stages in the public services. In
January 1955, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced Government acceptance
of a scheme for progressive increases in the salary scales of non-industrial women
civil servants to make these identical with men’s scales by 1961; in April 1955, the
Minister of Education announced approval of similar proposals by the Burnham
Committee (the advisory body concerned with teachers’ salaries) for equal pay for
women teachers; and in the same month it was decided that equal pay for women
in the administrative departments of local authorities should also be introduced by
stages.
Hours of Work
While, as already stated, the hours of work in factories of women and young
persons between the ages of 16 and 18 are limited by law to 48 a week and those of
young persons under 16 to 44 a week, normal hours of work for all ages and sexes
are usually shorter. Agreed weekly hours mainly vary between 42 and 46, averaging
between 44 and 45, and may be worked as either a five- or a five-and-a-half-day
week according to the industry and the rule of the particular establishment. Hours
actually worked are somewhat longer owing to overtime working. The survey con¬
ducted by the Ministry of Labour and National Service in April 1955 into earnings
and hours showed that average weekly hours actually worked were as follows:
Men .. .. . . .. .. . • • • 48-9 hours
Youths and boys . . . . . . . . . . 45 0,,
Women .. .. . . .. . . .. • • 41 -9 „
Girls . . . . . . . . . . . • • • 42-7 ,,
All workers .. .. .. .. .. . • 46-9 ,,
Holidays with Pay
It was estimated in May 1952 that more than two-thirds of the total number of
wage-earners (including shop assistants) covered by agreements or statutory Orders
were entitled to paid holidays of 12 days or two weeks, about one-quarter were
entitled to paid holidays of six days or one week, and the remainder to holidays
of intermediate duration. Moreover, payment is made for bank or statutory holi¬
days which are as follows: in addition to Good Friday and Christmas Day, there
are Bank Holidays in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands
on Easter Monday, Whit-Monday, the first Monday in August and the first
LABOUR
275
weekday after Christmas (Boxing Day), and in Scotland on New Year’s Day, the
first Monday in May, and the first Monday in August.
Safety
Safety depends in practice at least as much on the education of the worker as
upon safety regulations. The Accident Prevention Movement, a voluntary educa¬
tional campaign, is strongly supported by the Factory Inspectorate and the Mines
and Quarries Inspectorate. Inspectors inquire into safety problems, and advise
makers on safety aspects of machine design and specification, circulate expert
advice by personal exhortation, lectures and literature, and encourage the appoint¬
ment of Safety Officers and the formation of Accident Prevention Committees.
An Industrial Health and Safety Centre is maintained in London by the Ministry
of Labour and National Service.
In road, rail and air transport most of the work is outside the jurisdiction of the
Factory Inspectorate, but elaborate safety codes are laid down by the various
transport authorities. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents helps the
Accident Prevention Movement by providing posters and pamphlets and by
organizing training courses for safety officers.
Fatal industrial accidents have tended to diminish during the twentieth century
in spite of the increase in the number of persons employed. Such accidents rose
somewhat in factories during the early years of the second world war. Since then,
however, there has been a further decline. Fatal industrial accidents reported during
1954 in the United Kingdom numbered i,499; of these 436 were in mines and
quarries, 721 in establishments under the Factories Acts, 167 in railway service,
and 175 in ships registered in the United Kingdom.
Health and Welfare
Many employers achieve health and welfare standards higher than those pie-
scribed by law. An increasing number of firms in Britain provide a whole-time or
part-time doctor, an industrial nurse, and a canteen with hot meals, and operate
retirement and sickness insurance schemes supplementing National Insurance
benefits. Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes.
Health and welfare standards vary from one factory to another. Between a third
and a half of the factory workers of the country are employed by small firms
employing less than 250 workers, which with more limited resources are not always
able to provide amenities for their workers up to the standard of the larger progres¬
sive firms. The latter tend increasingly to plan their welfare policy in consultation
with the workers, whether through regular consultative machinery or by other
means.
The public corporations operating the nationalized industries have set out to be
model employers and to standardize and improve the varied provisions for safety,
health and welfare made by the undertakings which they took over. They have
established safety and first-aid organizations and medical services and have taken
part in or supported research designed to reduce the risks of accidents or occupa¬
tional disease. They have provided or arranged for convalescent homes and, in some
cases, rehabilitation centres. They have extended the provision of canteens and
other facilities at the place of work, and have made increased contributions to social
welfare. Where necessary, they have undertaken considerable housing programmes
to provide accommodation for their employees.
A number of official and voluntary bodies help to supply the research, advice and
assistance necessary for developing higher standards of industrial health and
welfare. These bodies include, besides the Factory and the Mines and Quarries
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
276
Inspectorates, such Government agencies as the Medical Research Council (see
p. 376), the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, including the
National Physical Laboratory (see pp. 375-6), and the Government Chemist (see
p. 382); the Departments of Industrial Health and Social Medicine of the Univer¬
sities ; such voluntary bodies as the Central Council for Health Education, and the
Industrial Welfare Society; and the research and personnel departments of various
large industrial concerns. Co-ordination is provided by a number of general and
special committees.
Human Relations in Industry
There has been a considerable growth in recent years of interest in ‘human
relations’ in industry, i.e. relations between management and their workers as
individuals, as distinct from relations between organizations of employers and
organizations of workers. This has led to more widespread attention being given
to all aspects of personnel management and to the establishment of more personnel
departments. Between 1939 and 1944 the number ofwhole-time personnel managers
and welfare officers increased from about 1,500 to 6,000, and this increase seems to
have continued since, though perhaps more slowly. While the form of organization
of personnel departments varies, the personnel officer is generally responsible for
advising all levels of management on the development of good industrial relations.
This officer also has particular duties with regard to recruitment, selection, edu¬
cation and training, transfer of labour, the application of wage agreements, the
promotion of joint consultation and the supervision of working conditions and
employee services.
Both voluntary and official organizations have been concerned with the promo¬
tion of better human relationships in industry.
The voluntary organizations include bodies which deal with management prob¬
lems (see pp. 140-41) and provide a service to subscribing firms, professional asso¬
ciations linking individuals who have a common interest in particular functions of
management and administration, and bodies which provide specialist services
usually on a fee-paying basis.
In 1945 the Ministry of Labour and National Service established a Personnel
Management Advisory Service which has done much to promote good personnel
management and to assist firms by discussing problems of personnel policy. The
service is staffed by a team of experienced Personnel Management Advisers
recruited from industry.
In March 1953 the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the
Medical Research Council set up two committees which are concerned with
research into the human factor in industry. They are known respectively as the
Committee on Human Relations in Industry and the Committee on Individual
Efficiency in Industry.
The Committee on Human Relations has approved a number of projects for
research into factors influencing the effectiveness of incentive payment schemes,
factors facilitating and restricting the introduction of new techniques and methods
in industry, characteristics of management organization affecting productivity,
industrial education, training and promotion, and the problems of the effective
employment in industry of special groups such as older persons and married
women.
The Committee on Individual Efficiency has concerned itself with research into
such matters as the influence of equipment and tool design on operator efficiency,
factors affecting the efficient utilization of industrial engineering techniques, and
training methods in industry.
VIII. FINANCE
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities finance their activities
.—fiow their expenditure is decided upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Moneys administered by public authorities can be roughly divided into two
categories:
1. The moneys of the central Government, raised mainly by taxation and
paid into and out of the Exchequer in accordance with the proposals of
the Government, as approved by Parliament (principally the House of
Commons).
There are also funds administered for special purposes by Government
Departments and wholly or partially maintained by receipts which do not
come from the Exchequer. The only important one at present is the National
Insurance Fund, administered by the Minister of Pensions and National
Insurance, used for the payment of benefits under the National Insurance
Scheme (see pp. 323—6) and for a small part of the cost of the National
Health Service (see p. 332).
2. The moneys of local authorities, obtained partly from rates (local taxes on
dwelling houses and other real estate) and income from property, and partly
from grants and loans from the Exchequer. Local authorities may also raise
loans in the open market.
The following broad account of Government finance will be concerned mainly
with the Exchequer moneys and only incidentally with local government1 and other
public funds.
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law,
parliamentary rights and custom. .
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the principle
that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was gradually evolved.
The principle was established, at the end of the constitutional struggles of the
Stuart period, by the Bill of Rights, 1689.
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once the King
was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, he was free to spend it as he
chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the House of Commons gradually
developed the modern system of controlling expenditure through the device of
Appropriation, which was embodied in its final form in the Exchequer and Audit
Departments Act, 1866.
Since the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such financial
control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of Commons.
This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seventeenth century, but
as regards expenditure it was not effective until the nineteenth century. The con¬
trolling power of the House of Commons is acknowledged today in the Speech from
the Throne at the opening of a new session of Parliament, which is addressed to
both Houses but contains a special paragraph addressed to the Commons alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power to
modify financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions. It was indeed to
1 For further information on local government finance see pp. 68 69.
277
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
278
minimize the chance of rejection that the practice was started in 1861 of embodying
the main financial provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill. Since the passing
of the Parliament Act, 1911, however, the assent of the House of Lords is no longer
necessary' for a Bill certified by the Speaker to be a Money Bill (see p. 31).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all expen¬
diture by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue by taxation
or borrowing. All Government revenue is paid into the Government account with
the Bank of England—known as the Exchequer Account or the Consolidated Fund.
With certain exceptions (the main one being National Insurance benefits), all pay¬
ments by the Government come out of this account.
The following section outlines the machinery by which expenditure and revenue
are authorized and controlled, the purposes on which public money is spent and the
sources from which revenue is obtained.
ESTIMATES AND EXPENDITURE
Classification of Expenditure
Central Government expenditure falls into two main groups:
1. Expenditure which is specifically authorized by Act of Parliament without
limitation to any' particular year. This expenditure includes the interest,
sinking fund and cost of management of the National Debt, the financial
provision made for members of the Royal Family, and salaries and pensions
of judges and certain high officers whose independence of the Government
is thought to be better guaranteed by permanent grant than by annual vote.
These Consolidated Fund Services represent a permanent charge on the
Consolidated Fund.
2. All other Government expenditure, which is authorized from year to year
and which includes all expenditure on defence, on the social services and on
the general administration of the country. These are called Supply Services
because the House of Commons, when voting money, is granting to the
Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are required to satisfy . . . the pecuniary
necessities of the Government ’. It should be noted that some of this expen¬
diture may also depend on legislation, such as the National Health Service
Acts, relating to a specific object of expenditure.
Authorization of Expenditure
The Estimates for these Supply Services are considered by the House of Com¬
mons in Committee of Supply (that is, in Committee of the whole House with the
Chairman of Committees, instead of the Speaker, in the Chair). The Committee
usually discusses public policy relevant to the Estimates, though any Estimate could
be examined in detail if members wished and if time allowed (see also p. 34).
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on 1st April are
submitted to the Treasury by each Department in the preceding November and
December. Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called ‘ Votes ’
which are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House of Commons
approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later confirmed in the
Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the moneys to specific Votes. Inside each
Vote, a ‘virement’, the spending of money on one subhead instead of on another,
is permissible so far as Parliament is concerned, but only with Treasury consent.
Departments are free to distribute expenditure within subheads as they please
subject to Treasury approval of the type of expenditure involved.
FINANCE
279
An excess of expenditure, or a new service not covered by the Vote, or a virement
of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should be brought to
the attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate. The 1 reasury
exercises the same power of scrutiny over this as over the ordinary Estimates.
Scrutiny of Expenditure
Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller and
Auditor General, by the Select Committee on Public Accounts of the House of
Commons and by the Select Committee on Estimates.
The Treasury
The power of the Treasury to control expenditure derives from the responsibility
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the financial policy of the Government.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the House
of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by Departments, the Treasury
has to weigh the advantages of administrative proposals against the monetary and
economic cost, taking into account current Government policy, to decide the rela¬
tive merits of expenditure proposed by different Departments and to eliminate any
overlapping, uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where this has escaped the net of
departmental financial control. Quite apart from the scrutiny of Estimates, through¬
out the year the Treasury keeps a close control over such matters as rates of pay and
the aggregate size of the staff in all Government Departments, in addition to exer¬
cising a general supervision over all departmental expenditure. The Treasury also
lays down general rules of financial and accounting procedure for Departments and
prescribes the principles on which departmental contracts shall be made and the
limits within which losses may be written off.
The Comptroller and Auditor General
Control over issues of money to Departments and the audit of accounts is
exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who holds a permanent appoint¬
ment as an officer of Parliament. Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comp¬
troller of the Exchequer he controls entries and issues of public money to and from
the Exchequer Account, and as Auditor General he audits departmental accounts
and submits the Appropriation Accounts to Parliament. His statutory function is
to ensure that all expenditure is properly incurred, e.g., that no payments are made
which go beyond any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury sanction has
been obtained wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has been encouraged
by successive Committees on Public Accounts (see next paragraph) to examine
departmental expenditure with a view to drawing the attention of that Committee
to any cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The Select Committee on Public Accounts
The accounts of each Department and the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor
General thereon are considered by the Select Committee on Public Accounts (PAC).
This was set up in 1861, by Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of ensuring that expen¬
diture was properly incurred in accordance with the Estimates and with any rele¬
vant Acts of Parliament, but it has since developed much wider powers. Nowadays
it may consider whether full value has been obtained for the sums spent by Depart¬
ments and it examines cases in which the administration appears to have been
faulty or negligent. The Committee has therefore become a powerful instrument
for the exposure of waste and inefficiency. It embodies its findings in Reports which
may be discussed in the House of Commons. Its recommendations are considered
T
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
280
by the Treasury in consultation with Departments and put into effect, so far as
they are accepted, according to Treasury instructions. If the recommendations are
not acceptable a reasoned reply has to be submitted to the Committee, which may
either accept the objections or return to the charge in subsequent reports.
Select Committee on Estimates
This Committee was originally set up in 1912 but was re-formed in 1929 with
wider terms of reference. Under these terms it has been re-appointed annually
except during the war years. The Committee’s functions are to examine the Esti¬
mates, to suggest the form in which they should be presented, and to report whether
there are any economies which could be made without altering the policy implied
in the Estimates. It is customary for the Committee to select each year a few aspects
of Government-voted services for review. In practice the Estimates for the current
year are not affected, but the Committee’s recommendations may reinforce Treasury
control and influence the nature of expenditure in succeeding years.
REVENUE AND THE BUDGET
Sources of Revenue
Money to meet the normal Budget expenditure of the central Government is in
normal years derived mainly from taxation. The revenue from loans and invest¬
ments is small, and other sources of revenue, e.g., trading surpluses of Government
Departments, are not important.
Taxes can be divided into two groups, direct and indirect, which correspond
roughly to the duties collected by the Board of Inland Revenue and by the Customs
and Excise Department. The most important Inland Revenue duties—income tax
(including surtax), profits tax and estate duty (death duty)—are levied directly on
the income or property of those who, in general, have to bear them. Income tax on
individual (though not on corporate) incomes and estate duty are progressive taxes,
that is, larger incomes and estates bear a proportionately higher rate of tax. Stamp
duties, although not a direct tax, are also collected by the Board of Inland Revenue.
Taxes on motor vehicles are collected by local taxation authorities, which are the
county or county borough councils in England and Wales and the corresponding
councils in Scotland; the proceeds are paid by the local authorities to the Exchequer.
Most indirect or outlay taxes are Customs and Excise duties and are levied on
commodities or services. They are called indirect because the importer, manufac¬
turer, wholesaler, or provider of commodities or services pays them first and then
passes them on to the individual consumer in the form of higher retail prices.
Customs duties are levied on imported goods, and Excise duties on goods pro¬
duced, and services provided, at home. The Purchase Tax, which is also collected
by the Customs and Excise Department, applies equally to home-produced and to
imported goods.
Budget Procedure
‘ Budget ’ is an ancient name for a bag containing papers or accounts. The origin
of the term lies in the phrase ‘ The Chancellor of the Exchequer opened his budget ’,
which was applied in Parliament to the annual speech of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer explaining his proposals for making revenue and expenditure balance.
By the time the Budget is introduced, the Estimates will have been presented to
Parliament and published, and the expected total of Government expenditure for
the year will be known.
FINANCE
28l
The Budget speech is the main occasion of the year for reviewing the financial
state of the nation. But its formal basis is the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s pro¬
posals for raising money by taxation: he estimates the yield of the revenue on the
basis of existing taxation and proposes such changes as will provide whatever
surplus or deficit he considers desirable on general economic grounds. These
proposals are later embodied in detail in a Finance Bill.
Budget Policy
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money for
Government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated that
taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and the level of the
expenditure on particular goods and services. At a later period it came to be realized
that taxation also affected the nation’s total expenditure and therefore the general
level of economic activity. Since the second world war, Budgets have been con¬
sciously designed in greater or lesser degree to bring the total of personal and
governmental demand for goods and services into balance with the supplies which
could be made available.
Direct taxation on income and property affects the distribution of wealth because
the rates vary according to the size of income and property, the proportion of a
high income going in tax being much greater than the proportion of a small one;
at the same time, the services provided by the Government (whether in cash or
kind) are generally available to all, irrespective of wealth, but in some cases they are
specially designed to benefit people with lower incomes. Indirect taxes do not affect
the distribution of income; their main purpose has always been the raising of
revenue, but by discouraging or encouraging consumption of particular goods they
can be used to influence the allocation of resources and the pattern of trade.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure (personal and governmental),
and therefore the total demand for goods and services, in the following way: if
there is an increase in Government expenditure without an increase in taxation
then total demand for goods and services will tend to rise; the same thing will
happen if there is a decrease in taxation without a decrease in Government spend¬
ing. In this way the Budget can be used to counter unemployment. On the other
hand if there is an increase in taxation without an increase in Government expendi¬
ture or a decrease in Government expenditure without a decrease in taxation then
the total demand for goods and services will tend to fall. In this way the Budget can
be used to counter inflation.
For some years after the war, budgetary policy was mainly designed to avoid
inflation by holding down consumer demand for goods and services so that it would
not hamper exports, investment or (since 1950) the defence programme. The
Budgets of 1951 and 1952 aimed also to hold down investment in the interests of
exports and defence. By 1953, however, as total demand had fallen while productive
capacity had increased, some unused resources became available; in consequence
there was a reduction of taxation in the 1953 Budget, which aimed particularly at
encouraging higher investment and production. These aims were continued in the
1954 Budget, when, however, changes in taxation were much smaller than in 1953.
The Budget of April 1955, which gave further tax reliefs, was followed in October
by a Supplementary Budget which had the purpose of reinforcing measures,
including a tighter credit policy, instituted earlier in the year with the object of
curtailing excessive internal demand and of strengthening the balance of payments
position.
The principal taxation changes introduced in the Budgets of 1953, 1954 and 1955
were as follows:
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
282
1953 (Cost to the Exchequer £169 million in the first year and £413 million in a
full year.)
Income Tax and Profits Tax. The standard rate of income tax was reduced
from 9s. 6d. to 9s. in the £, with 6d. off the reduced rates which apply to
the first slices of taxable income of individuals. The initial allowances—
for the purpose of calculating liability to income tax and profits tax—were
restored for capital expenditure on plant and machinery, industrial build¬
ings and mining works. The allowances had been withdrawn as from 1952.
Excess Profits Levy. This was abolished as from 1st January 1954.
Indirect Taxation. Rates of purchase tax on most goods were reduced by one-
quarter with larger reductions in a few cases. Cricket and amateur sports
and games were exempted from Entertainments Duty.
1954 (Cost to the Exchequer £4^ million in the first year and £6f million in a full
year. These figures exclude the cost of the investment allowance, which is
put at £4 million in 1955-56 and will increase thereafter.)
Income Tax and Profits Tax. A new investment allowance was introduced, in
place of the existing initial allowance, for capital expenditure on new plant
and machinery, industrial buildings and mining works. The allowance
extended also to new buildings and plant used for scientific research and
agricultural buildings, which did not qualify for the initial allowance. (The
initial allowance merely anticipated subsequent depreciation allowances,
the total allowances being limited to the net cost of the asset: the invest¬
ment allowance is given in addition to other allowances amounting to the
full net cost.)
Estate Duty. Some anomalies were corrected and concessions made to assist
family businesses. The starting point of liability to the duty was raised
from £2,000 to £3,000.
Indirect Taxation. Entertainments Duty was reduced on admission to all
dutiable entertainments.
1955 April. (Cost to the Exchequer £134 million in the first year and £155 million
in a full year.)
Income Tax. The standard rate was reduced from 9s. to 8s. 6d., with cuts of
3d. in the reduced rates, adjustments in personal allowances and increases
in child allowances.
Indirect Taxation. The rate of purchase tax was halved on cloth and house¬
hold textile articles made of cotton, linen, rayon or other non-woollen
material. (Most of these goods were later exempted from tax.)
1955 October. (Supplementary Budget. Gain to the Exchequer £15 million in
1955-56 and £112*5 million in a full year.)
Profits Tax. Increase in the rate of profits tax on distributed profits from
22J per cent to 27-2- per cent.
Excise. Increase of purchase tax by one-fifth (with certain exceptions). Some
household goods, previously exempt, were made subject to tax.
THE EXCHEQUER ACCOUNTS
In the Budget of April 1955, total current expenditure for the financial year
ending 31st March 1956 was estimated to reach £4,562 million, while the estimate
FINANCE

for total current revenue (after allowing for taxation changes) was £4,710 million,1
making a surplus of £148 million.1 These figures exclude self-balancing revenue and
expenditure (almost entirely post office trading), for which the estimate was £260
million. On capital account, total expenditure was estimated at £776 million, while
total receipts were estimated at £192 million leaving a deficit, to be met by borrow¬
ing, of £584 million. Comparable figures for previous years are given in Table 6,
p. 99-
Budget and Expenditure
Total ‘ordinary’ expenditure for 1955-56 falls under four main heads: defence
preparations £1,557 million (34 per cent of the total), National Debt service £636
million (14 per cent), social services and subsidies £1,795 million (39 per cent)
and general services, which make up the remaining £574 million (13 per cent).
The total for defence preparations, £1,557 million, is made up of £1,537 million
voted for Service Departments for the defence programme less American Aid
receipts (expected to amount to £43 million), plus £63 million for defence prepara¬
tions under civil votes, mainly civil defence and strategic reserves.
The second heading, National Debt service, comprises £600 million for interest
and management charges on War Loans, Savings Certificates and other forms of
national debt, and £36 million for sinking funds.
The main items under the third heading, social services and subsidies (£i,795
million) can be subdivided as follows: education (£343 million); health services
(£462 million); Government contributions to National Insurance Fund, family
allowances, war pensions, etc. (£414 million); assistance to local authorities for
housing, police, roads, etc. (£265 million); and agricultural and food subsidies
(£311 million).
The main items under the fourth heading, general services (£574 million) are:
Commonwealth and foreign services £80 million; works, buildings, stationery and
information services £62 million; Northern Ireland Exchequer2 £61 million;
atomic energy £51 million; tax collection £44 million; agriculture and fisheries
£35 million; broadcasting £28 million; research and development £21 million3;
employment services £20 million; civil aviation £17 million; and Colonial develop¬
ment and welfare £18 million.
Current Revenue
The total current revenue estimated for 1955-56 (£4,710 million1) falls under two
main heads: Inland Revenue, £2,478 million (53 per cent of the total) and Customs
and Excise, £1,928 million1 (41 per cent). The remaining 6 per cent consists of
receipts from motor vehicle duties (£80 million), from broadcast receiving licences
(£25 million), from sundry loans (£24 million) and from miscellaneous sources
(id 75 million).
1 In his statement on the Supplementary Budget of 26th October 1955, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer estimated that changes in taxation introduced by the Supplementary
Budget would raise total revenue by approximately £15 million (mainly on account of pur¬
chase tax) for the financial year 1955—56.
2 Mainly the payment from the United Kingdom Exchequer, under the Government of
Ireland Act, 1920, of the Residuary Share of Reserved Taxes which is the amount of
income tax and other revenue collected in Northern Ireland less the sum deducted for cost
of collection and the Northern Ireland Contribution towards Imperial Expenditure (see
also pp. 287-8).

Atomic Energy Authority.

Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April. For 1955-56 the standard rate is 8s. 6d. in the £. The tax imposed on
an individual is graduated by means of personal allowances, by reduced rates of
tax on the first sections of taxable income, and by the surtax. In the case of a
married couple the incomes of husband and wife are aggregated and are treated as
one income, but a higher personal allowance is given than for a single person.
The amount of income tax paid yearly by people with different incomes is shown
in Table 33.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
286
Since 1943 most wages and salary earners have paid their income tax under a
PAYE (‘Pay-as-you-earn’) Scheme enabling them to keep up to date in tax
payments.
Companies are liable at the standard rate of tax on their total income irrespective
of its amount; they are also subject to profits tax of 27J per cent on profits distri¬
buted as dividends, and of 2j per cent on undistributed profits.
In general, income arising from sources within the United Kingdom is subject
to United Kingdom income tax, even though the person entitled to the income is
not resident in the United Kingdom, except in the case of certain United Kingdom
Government securities. Where the income arises from sources outside the United
Kingdom, tax is not chargeable unless the owner becomes chargeable as a resident.
The United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many countries providing
for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are not in force the United
Kingdom allows unilateral relief.1
The scale of estate duty is illustrated in Table 34. In 1946 estates of a net capital
value of less than £2,000 were exempted from payment of duty and a new scale
for values over £2,000 was introduced. The scale was altered again in 1949, when
legacy and succession duties were consolidated with estate duty. In 1954 estates
below £3,000 were exempted from estate duty.
The yields from the different sources of Customs and Excise revenue in 1955-56
are expected to be as follows:

Capital Payments and Receipts
The Government also receives funds and makes payments of a capital nature for
which it has statutory power to borrow and which are therefore excluded from the
Budget expenditure met from revenue. In the last few years the main items of
capital expenditure have been loans to local authorities for housing and other invest-

ment; funds to meet capital expenditure by the Post Office; War Damage payments;
issues to the Exchequer Equalization Account; and working capital for the National
Coal Board. Capital receipts have come mainly from the repayment of these loans.
If, on balance, there is a deficit, it is met from the proceeds of Government borrow¬
ing, while if there is a surplus it goes to reduce the National Debt.
The National Debt
So far, borrowing on a large scale has been undertaken only to finance deficits
during or immediately after a war. The National Debt rose from £651 million in
1914 to £7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7,i3I million
in 1939 to £23,637 million in 1946. On the 31st March 1955 the total National Debt
was £26,933 million, of which £2,130 million was repayable in currencies other
than sterling, mainly to the United States and Canadian Governments. Of the
£24,803 million of internal debt, about £5,250 million was short-term debt, mainly
in the form of 91-day bills on the Treasury, while the long-term loans included a
variety of stocks, bonds, loans, and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest
(ranging from 2^ to 4 per cent) and with fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment.
Since the war new lending by the Government has exceeded loan repayment, as
the main borrowers, the local authorities, repay over a long term. From 1945 to the
end of 1952 local authorities relied on the Exchequer for virtually all their loans. As
from 1 st January 1953 they were given permission to borrow on the open market.
In his Budget Statement of October 1955, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
announced that local authorities had been asked to exercise restraint in their
expenditure. The volume of Government lending to them would be checked and
the Public Works Loan Board (see p. 69) would ‘ put all applicants on inquiry as
to their ability to raise the finance on their own credit either in the stock market
or in the mortgage market’. Any advances granted would be at a rate of interest
‘ reflecting not Government credit, but the credit of local authorities of good
standing in the market for loans of comparable periods ’.
Northern Ireland
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main features,
similar to that operating in Great Britain, under which public revenues, with a few
288
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
minor exceptions, are paid into the Exchequer, from which no money can be with¬
drawn except on the authority of Parliament. That authority, as in Great Britain, is
expressed in the case of Consolidated Fund charges in permanent legislative form,
and in the case of Supply Services by annual Appropriation Acts based on esti¬
mates prepared by Departments and sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major portion of the taxation in Northern Ireland, comprising Customs and
Excise duties, purchase tax, income tax and surtax and excess profits levy, is levied
and collected by the United Kingdom Government and the proceeds are paid in
the first instance into the United Kingdom Exchequer. From this portion, known
as ‘ Reserved ’ Revenue, there is deducted and retained by the United Kingdom
Treasury in accordance with the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the sum con¬
tributed by Northern Ireland towards Imperial Services (called the ‘ Imperial Con¬
tribution’), the cost of the administration of the Supreme Court, the Post Office,
and other Reserved Services, and the cost of collecting Reserved Revenue. The
balance, termed the ‘Residuary Share of Reserved Taxes’, is paid over to the
Exchequer of Northern Ireland and joins with the proceeds of taxes levied and
collected by the Government of Northern Ireland, called ‘Transferred’ Revenue,
and with other non-tax receipts of a miscellaneous nature to form the public
income. The items of Transferred Tax Revenue are estate duties, stamp duties,
entertainments duty, Excise licence duties and motor vehicle duties.
A Joint Exchequer Board, representative of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
constituted in accordance with the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, determines
the amount of Reserved Revenue and the cost of Reserved Services attributable to
Northern Ireland for each year, the amount of the Imperial Contribution and such
other questions affecting the financial relations of the two Governments as may be
referred to it.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £43 million at 31st March 1955,
is fully covered by repayable advances and investments held by the Ministry of
Finance.
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland there have been established,
in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, various funds created to meet
the requirements of specific sections of the community. These funds in general
follow the United Kingdom pattern, the principal being those relating to National
Insurance and Government loans. The latter constitutes a pool of capital moneys
available for local and public authority borrowings; at 31st March 1955, a sum of
approximately £53 million was outstanding against such authorities.
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It consists of
a Central Bank; of Commercial Banks which carry on the usual main banking
services; of the United Kingdom offices of various banks whose main business is in
other countries; and of various specialized banks and similar financial institutions.
The Bank of England
The Bank of England is the Central Bank and its principal business is to act as
banker to the Government and to the other banks, as the agent of the Government
for important financial operations and as the central note-issuing authority; it also
maintains relations with central banks overseas. It was established in 1694 by Act
of Parliament as a corporate body and its entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act, 1946.
FINANCE
289
As the central bank, the Bank of England acts in conjunction with other banks
and financial institutions in co-ordinating the application of the Government’s
monetary policy. One of the main instruments for this purpose is the Bank Rate—
the rate at which the Bank of England will discount approved bills of exchange.
As banker to the Government the Bank of England holds the main Government
accounts and it acts as the Government’s agent for the issue and registration of
Government loans. It also operates, for the Treasury, the administration of
exchange control which has been in force since 1939 (see pp. 311-12).
The commercial banks maintain large balances with the Bank of England and
these balances form part of the bankers’ cash reserves.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing bank
notes. Notes thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold and securities, the part
covered by the latter being the ‘Fiduciary Issue’, the level of which is subject to
parliamentary control. In practice very little gold is now held by the Issue Depart¬
ment of the Bank of England, the bulk of the United Kingdom gold (and foreign
exchange) reserves being in a separate account, known as the Exchange Equaliza¬
tion Account, originally established in 1932, for the purpose of checking undue
fluctuation in the exchange value of sterling. The provision of coin for circulation
is the responsibility of a Government Department, the Royal Mint.
The Commercial Banks
The banks handling the major part of the domestic banking business in the
United Kingdom are, in the main, limited liability companies which are subject to
the ordinary law relating to such companies.
Some of the main distinguishing features of the United Kingdom commercial
banks are:
1. A relatively small number of banks control a large number of branches.
Domestic banking members of the British Bankers’ Association number 27,
including 7 in Scotland, and 3 in Northern Ireland; these banks control
nearly 12,500 branches and have total assets of over £8,000 million.
2. The volume of cheques handled is very large and, in spite of a stamp duty
of 2d. on each cheque, many payments—and even relatively small payments
—are made by cheque. The average daily value of cheques, drafts, bills and
bankers’ effects cleared in 1954 through the London and Provincial Clear¬
ing Houses was £478 million; and many cheques do not, for various
reasons, pass through Clearing Houses.
3. It is the practice of the chief United Kingdom banks to maintain a ratio of
about 8 per cent between cash reserves and total deposits (of which about
two-thirds are repayable on demand, the remainder being deposits at
interest and subject to notice).
In September 1955 about 36 per cent of the banks’ deposits were covered
by cash and short-term securities while longer-term securities amounted to
about 32 per cent, and advances to customers to about 31 Per cent of total
deposits. It is not the practice of British banks to participate directly in
industry, the financing of which is, as far as they are concerned, normally
limited to short-term advances.
4. Certain banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland have retained limited rights
to issue notes; these issues must, apart from an amount for each bank which
is specified by legislation, be fully covered by Bank of England notes and
by coin.
290
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
United Kingdom Offices of Banks Operating Mainly Overseas
The importance of London as a financial and trading centre and as the largest
city of the British Commonwealth has encouraged many banks whose main business
is in the Commonwealth and other countries to have London offices; in some cases,
indeed, the institutions concerned are United Kingdom companies and the London
office is the head office. These London offices form part of the complex structure
engaged in the financing of trade not only between the United Kingdom and other
countries but also in goods which are shipped direct between other countries.
Savings Banks and the National Savings Movement
The function of Trustee and Post Office Savings Banks is to provide facilities for
the investment of voluntary savings and particularly of the small savings of persons
with small incomes. Both these types of banks were well established during the
nineteenth century. The growth of their business was, however, encouraged in the
first world war when the War Savings Committee was set up under Government
auspices to promote an official savings drive. A new type of long-term security for
the small investor was inaugurated at that time. This was the National Savings
Certificate, with interest payable only on encashment, but free of income tax. From
this war-time drive originated the present National Savings Movement devoted to
the encouragement of the widespread investment of savings in Trustee and Post
Office Savings Banks and in National Savings Certificates and Defence Bonds. The
policy of the movement is determined by the National Savings Committee for
England and Wales and similar committees for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The committees are bodies of independent persons representing regional savings
organizations and various national institutions connected with such matters as
finance, industry and education. They are assisted by a salaried staff of civil
servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often assisted or promoted by local
authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary local savings groups.
Trustee Savings Banks are managed by boards of honorary trustees and managers,
and most of the funds deposited with them are ordinary deposits which are with¬
drawable on demand or at short notice. These deposits are invested with the
National Debt Commissioners, and the Government is responsible to the trustees
for the repayment of the money so invested with accrued interest as and when
required. Trustee Savings Banks also accept, in certain circumstances, deposits for
special investment. These deposits, which may receive a slightly higher rate of
interest than ordinary deposits, are invested under the supervision of the National
Debt Commissioners, but the Government is not responsible to the trustees for the
repayment of these investments. Trustee Savings Banks are particularly flourishing
in small towns. In October 1955 there were about 1,315 Trustee Offices controlled
by 84 independent banks.
The Post Office Savings Bank is the largest organization of its kind in the world.
It has nearly 23 million active accounts; in July 1955 total balances, which carry
a Government guarantee, amounted to £i,735 million, about £80 per depositor.
Through a centralized system of accounting, a depositor can pay in money or make
a withdrawal at any one of some 19,000 post offices throughout the country.
To ensure that Savings Banks are used primarily by the small investor there is a
limit of £500 on the amount which may be deposited by any individual in one year,
and of £3,000 on the total balance which may be held by one individual. The
maximum amount of National Savings Certificates which may be held by any
one person is £900 worth of the current (ninth) issue and about £2,000 worth of
all issues. The limit on individual holdings of the current issue of Defence Bonds
(4 per cent) is £ 1,000; this is in addition to holdings of previous issues.
FINANCE
291
Co-operative Banks
The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed a deposit and loan department
about the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to engage in banking
was legally defined in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act in 1876. The
primary purpose of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank was to serve the
Co-operative movement, whose financial centre it has become, but the bank has
also come to include among its clients trade unions and other mutual societies, local
authorities and individual depositors.
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of many
special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities, which are
supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are mainly proviaed
through the Discount Market, Finance Corporations, the Stock Exchange, Invest¬
ment Trusts, Building Societies and the Insurance Market. New Issues, except for
certain small operations, are controlled by the Treasury with the advice of the
Capital Issues Committee (see p. 293).
The firms engaged in this business are in the main highly specialized, e.g.,
discount houses, stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers. In
addition to these specialist firms, however, there is a class of bank, the merchant
bank, which has been of great importance in the finance of trade and commodity
dealings and in the flotation of major issues of bonds, particularly for oversea
concerns and governments.
The merchant banks helped to give London an international reputation as the
main world centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. Long-term loans for
development purposes created a continuing claim for interest and attracted to
Britain a steady flow of orders for machinery, textiles and coal. This increasing
trade was usually financed by bills of exchange, which were traded on the discount
market and provided an easy method of transferring debts and claims.
The Discount Market
The main business of the Discount Market consists of trading in and holding
commercial bills of exchange, United Kingdom Government Treasury Bills and
other short-term securities.
To the extent to which the various firms which compose the Discount Market
have insufficient funds of their own to finance the bills and securities which they
wish to hold, they obtain loans from the banks and, to a lesser extent, deposits from
the public. In the main these loans and deposits may be called in at any time.
The commercial banks do not, in the ordinary way, buy Treasury Bills at the
weekly tenders except on behalf of customers, but purchase, from the Discount
Market, bills which have been taken up by the market and held until they become
of a currency required by the banks.
If the banks call in loans which they have made to the Discount Market and the
latter is unable to cover its needs elsewhere, it will be forced to borrow from the
Bank of England. It is not the practice of the commercial banks themselves to
obtain direct loans from the Bank of England to augment their cash resources if the
need arises.
Finance Corporations
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited and the
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited, were set up in 1945 to
2Q2
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
assist in dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction and development.
Although the Government displayed considerable interest in their formation, the
Corporations themselves are ordinary limited companies with no official repre¬
sentation on the boards and having no recourse to public funds. Another finance
corporation, the Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited, was
established in 1953 to assist development projects in the Commonwealth. Among
other financial corporations of note are the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Limited, Air Finance Limited and the National Film Finance Corporation.
Finance Corporation for Industry Limited
The FCI was formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of £200,000
and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of industry with a view to
promoting efficiency and thereby assisting in the maintenance and increase of
employment.
The Corporation has an authorized and issued capital of £25 million and may
borrow up to four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of £125
million. The share capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance companies,
30 per cent by trust companies and 30 per cent by the Bank of England. As at the
31st March 1954 the capital had been paid up to the extent of 2 per cent (£500,000),
the liability of the shareholders in respect of the uncalled capital representing
security to the banks who provide the capital out of which the Corporation makes
its advances.
The enterprises assisted by the FCI are concerned with a variety of products,
e.g., diesel engines, permanent prefabricated houses, shipping, electrical com¬

Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited
The ICFC is smaller than the FCI and has as its main object the provision of
credit and finance by means of loan capital and share capital for industrial and com¬
mercial concerns in Great Britain, particularly in cases where the existing facilities
provided by banking institutions and the Stock Exchange are not readily or easily
available.
The authorized and issued share capital of the Corporation is £15 million which
is paid up as required; the Corporation can borrow up to a further £30 million and
can thus have a maximum of £45 million available. Although the Bank of England
has a token participation, the principal shareholders are the London Clearing
Banks and the Scottish Banks in proportion to their size; the loan capital is pro¬
vided by all the shareholders in the same ratio as their shareholdings.
The nature of the Corporation’s business is to provide finance in sums ranging
between £5,000 and £200,000 for small and medium-sized concerns. It has a large
number of customers and has established branches in Birmingham, Manchester
and Edinburgh.
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited
The primary function of this Corporation, which was established in 1928, is to
grant long-term loans against first mortgages on agricultural lands and buildings
in England and Wales. The share capital was subscribed by the Bank of England
and other banks, but the greater part of the funds is derived from public issues of
debentures of which about £30 million is outstanding (see also p. 156).
The Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Limited
This Corporation, with share capital subscribed by Scottish banks, fulfils similar
functions in Scotland (see also p. 156).

Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited
This Company was established early in 1953. It originated from the Conference
of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in December 1952 and its purpose is to finance
development schemes in the British Commonwealth. The authorized capital of this
company is £15 million but to begin with only £2-9 million has been called up; the
Company is empowered to borrow up to twice its issued capital (see also p. 305).
Air Finance Limited
This Company was formed by a group of bankers and the FCI late in 1953 for
the purpose of financing aircraft exports. Its initial resources were £11 million (see
also p. 195).
The National Film Finance Corporation
The Corporation is a statutory body established under the Cinematograph Film
Production (Special Loans) Act, 1949. Its function is to make loans to film pro¬
ducers and distributors in order to help to finance the production of films (see also
pp- 395-6).
The Stock Exchanges
Although there are several Stock Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the London
Stock Exchange is by far the most important.
The Stock Exchanges provide a means by which a holder of quoted stock or
shares (all important securities are quoted) can, if he wishes, find a buyer for his
securities; they are also a most important element in the raising of new capital by
Government and commercial borrowers.
The Stock Exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains are
made between members reflect the interaction of supply of and demand for the
securities concerned.
All the Stock Exchanges operate under strict rules of conduct which they make
themselves.
The Capital Issues Committee
Since 1932 there has been control to a greater or lesser degree over capital issues
in the United Kingdom. The 1932 controls, and such modifications as were made
up to 1939, were without a statutory basis but resulted from public requests by the
Chancellor which the various markets observed. At the outbreak of war in 1939 the
Foreign Transactions (Advisory) Committee, which had been set up in 1936 to
advise the Treasury on issues involving remittances to countries outside the
Commonwealth, was renamed the Capital Issues Committee and was given the
wider task of advising the Treasury on the administration of the statutory control
of capital issues (and analogous transactions) for which provision was made in
Regulation 6 of the Defence (Finance) Regulations, 1939.
The end of the war in 1945 saw the retention of the Capital Issues Committee
with its primary function unchanged; permanent provision for capital issues control
was made the following year with the passing of the Borrowing (Control and
Guarantees) Act, 1946.
The Committee is entirely independent of Government Departments and con¬
sists of seven men of experience in commerce, industry or finance, who consider
applications to raise loans or issue capital (except those which do not involve more
than £50,000 in any one year for the borrower concerned, or which for certain other
reasons may be exempt) and tender their advice to the Treasury upon them.

Investment Trusts
Investment trusts cater for the investor who does not wish or has not sufficient
resources to hold a large number of investments in his own name but who desires
to have an interest in several securities as a means of spreading his risk.
The ordinary type of investment trust is a public company, limited in liability
and registered under the Companies Acts; investment trusts in this form have been
established in the United Kingdom for about a century. They invest their share
and their loan capital over a range of securities, the precise choice depending in
part on the objects of the particular company concerned.
Since 1931 there have also been ‘unit trusts’ in the United Kingdom; a trust of
this type is normally limited by its trust deed to a specified range of securities. The
original conception of the unit trust was that securities could be grouped in fixed
proportions to form units, and these units could be divided into sub-units which
could be sold to the public. In practice, while retaining this unit basis of investment,
many unit trusts have considerable flexibility in their choice of the underlying
securities.
The Insurance Market
The British insurance market is in the main divided into two parts, the insurance
companies and Lloyd’s. The company market is the larger, but Lloyd’s is older and
has a greater claim on the popular imagination.
Insurance Companies
The company market consists of about 300 British insurance offices, chiefly
incorporated under the Companies Acts, of which some two-thirds are small or of
local or specialized significance, whereas the remainder transact a general business.
Most of the latter are controlled by about 30 very large companies of international
repute. In addition some 200 oversea companies are represented, emphasizing the
international nature of the insurance market. The natural focus of the market is
in London, although some of the largest offices have their administrative centres
elsewhere. In addition, there are some 150 Friendly and Collecting Societies devoted
solely to ‘industrial’ life assurance1 throughout the country, but these are not part
of the insurance market proper.
Lloyd's
Lloyd’s is an association of individual underwriters who group themselves into
syndicates. The conduct of insurance business at Lloyd’s is regulated by the
Committee of Lloyd’s, and the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate
capacity are administered by the Committee under Acts of Parliament. In addition
to its insurance activities, Lloyd’s maintains a world-wide organization for the
collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence (see p. 210). Although in its earlier
history the activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance
business, during the last fifty years there has been built up at Lloyd’s a very con¬
siderable world-wide market for the transaction of other classes of insurance
business.
Insurance Brokers
The market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf of the
insured, who are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a valuable part of the
1 Life insurance for which the contributions are collected by house-to-house visits at
intervals of less than two months (a system convenient to weekly wage earners).
FINANCE
295
company market. Many brokers specialize in reinsurance business, acting as inter¬
mediaries in the exchange of contracts between both British and oversea companies,
and often acting as London representatives of the latter.
Volume of Business
The volume of premium income business transacted by the insurance market
during the year 1954 was over £1,000 million.
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine business comes from abroad,
partly by direct placing in London and partly from branch and agency offices of
insurance companies established in over 100 countries. The profits on this business,
together with interest earned on funds maintained by insurance companies locally,
have produced in recent years a substantial sum in foreign exchange, of which a
large part was represented by dollars. The basic principle of international business
is that resources capable of meeting any potential loss are instantly available for
application whenever necessary.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the assets of the
insurance companies, aggregating over £4,000 million in addition to substantial
reserves of uncalled capital; also the whole of the underwriting trust funds and
personal fortunes of Lloyd’s underwriters. British insurers hold about £i,500
million in British Government and other public stocks, while a further £1,400
million is invested in ordinary shares, preference shares and debentures in industry,
mostly in the United Kingdom.
Building Societies
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on the
security of private dwelling houses purchased for owner-occupation, though loans
are occasionally made on the security of commercial and industrial premises and
farms. The funds of building societies are derived mainly from the general public
who invest in shares or deposits. The amount of share capital is not fixed but may
be regulated in accordance with the amount of mortgage business; shares are not
dealt with on the Stock Exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given.
The rapid expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a few very
large societies. At the end of 1954 there were in operation a total of 777 societies,
whose total assets were £1,867 million. The amount advanced on mortgage in 1954
was £373 million.
U
IX. TRADE
EXTERNAL TRADE
British oversea markets and sources of supply are world-wide. The wealth and
very existence of the British people has, for over a century, depended on oversea
trade. British imports consist mainly of food and of the various materials, raw and
processed, required by British industries, though finished capital and consumer
goods are also imported. British exports are preponderantly of manufactured goods;
in 1954 Britain supplied about one-fifth of the total world exports of manufactures.
For over one hundred years the value of goods imported (c.i.f.)1 into Britain has
exceeded that of goods exported (f.o.b.),1 the balance of imports being more than
paid for in normal years by net invisible exports—i.e. the net receipts of interest,
dividends and profits on previous investment abroad and net income from shipping,
insurance and a variety of financial services—and the net overall surplus has been
invested overseas. This is the broad picture: it has been modified in detail over the
course of time.
TRENDS SINCE 1938
Changes since 1938 in value, volume, composition and distribution of imports
and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
Value and Volume
Imports rose in value from £919 million in 1938 to £1,798 million in 1947 and
£3,379 million in 1954. The rise in value of exports was from £471 million in 1938
to £1,142 million in 1947 and £2,673 million in 1954.
Calculations of changes in the volume of external trade compared with pre-war
cannot be made with precision as the relative values of different types of goods on
which the volume figures are based have changed considerably since 1938. Broadly
speaking, however, the volume of imports in 1947 was a quarter less than before the
war and exports had regained their pre-war volume. The trend in the volume of
imports and exports since 1947 is shown in Table 35, where value figures are given
from 1938.
Some indication of the increased importance of exports in the national economy
is shown by the rise in the proportion of total national income derived from export
earnings—from 10-4 per cent in 1938 to 13 per cent in 1947 and 18-2 per cent in
1954. Over the same period the rise in the proportion of expenditure on imports
to total national expenditure was smaller—from 18 per cent in 1938 to 19-4 per
cent in 1947 and 21-8 per cent in 1954: this rise was caused by the rise in import
prices relative to other prices which offset the slight fall in the volume of imports.
Commodity Composition
Changes in the commodity composition of trade are shown in the diagram on
p- 2"- , . j • r
The most notable change in exports has been the increased importance or j
engineering products—e.g., motor vehicles, aircraft, machinery and electrical goods
—and the declining, though still considerable, share taken by the older staples such
1 For definition see footnotes (b) and (c) of Table 35.
296
TRADE
297
as textiles. In 1938, coal accounted for 8-6 per cent of total exports, textiles for
20 per cent and engineering products for 24-4 per cent. By 1948 the percentages
were 2-8 per cent, 18-4 per cent and 35-8 per cent, and, in 1954, 2-5 per cent,
12-2 per cent and 37-8 per cent. While coal exports have been declining, exports of
refined petroleum—2-9 per cent of total exports in 1954—have increased, particu¬
larly since 1952 when the results of the post-war refinery development began to
make themselves felt. Exports of chemicals—7-6 per cent of total exports in 1954—
have also increased greatly since the end of the war. Within the category of
engineering products, particularly notable gains have been made by road vehicles,
aircraft, and certain types of machinery and electrical goods.
Owing to the expansion of the output of domestic agriculture (by about one-
half since 1938) and the increased industrial output (by nearly one-third since
1948) Britain relies relatively less than before the war on food imports, but needs a
relatively larger supply of imported raw materials. Whereas 47 per cent of total
imports in 1938 consisted of food, beverages and tobacco, the proportion in 1948
was only 42 per cent and, in 1954, 39 per cent. On the other hand, the proportion
for basic materials rose from 26 per cent in 1938 to 31 per cent in 1948, and was
also 31 per cent in 1954. Imports of manufactures in 1954 represented 20 per cent of
total imports, nearly as high a proportion as in 1938. Imports of fuels rose from
5 per cent in 1938 to 10 per cent in 1954, mainly on account of increased require¬
ments of petroleum in industry.

Area Distribution
The area distribution of external trade in 1938 and 1947 in comparison with that
of 1954 is shown in the diagram on p. 299.
In 1938, imports from the dollar area represented 23 per cent of the total value
of Britain’s imports, but in 1947 their share had increased to 34 per cent. Mean¬
while, imports from non-sterling member countries of the Organization for
European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) and their oversea territories fell from
24 per cent in 1938 to 17 per cent in 1947 and those from the rest of the non¬
sterling world declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent. Imports from the sterling
area in 1947 took the same share of the total as in 1938, i.e. 31 per cent. By 1954,
imports from the dollar area had fallen to 18 per cent and from the rest of the
non-sterling world they had declined further, to 13 per cent. The sterling area (see
p. 304) meantime increased its share to 44 per cent in 1954 and OEEC countries
regained their pre-war share of 24 per cent.
The share of total exports to the dollar area in 1947 was almost unchanged from
the 1938 level—about 11 per cent of the total value of exports—but by 1954 their
share had increased to 14 per cent. Total exports to the sterling area also rose from
42 per cent in 1938 to 47 per cent in 1947 and 49 per cent in 1954, while total
exports to member countries of the OEEC and their dependencies, after declining
from 27 per cent in 1938 to 25 per cent in 1947, recovered to 28 per cent in 1954.
Exports to the rest of the world fell from 20 per cent of the total in 1938 to 18 per
cent in 1947 and 10 per cent in 1954.
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Britain’s outstanding economic problem in the post-war period has been its
balance of payments.
1. Britain has to earn enough abroad to pay for half the food of its people and
more than half the raw materials for its factories. The bill on this account
will increase as domestic production and prosperity grow. This means that
the pace of internal expansion is inevitably governed by that of external
expansion.
2. But Britain has to do more than just pay its way if, together with the rest of
the sterling area (see p. 304), it is to build up the reserves that will be needed
in a world of multilateral trading and convertible currencies, and if it is to
meet its obligations overseas including those voluntarily accepted in relation
to promoting development in the Commonwealth and elsewhere. To do
these things, it needs a substantial yearly surplus of receipts over payments.
The early post-war years were years of great difficulty. The whole economy had
been geared to war production; export trade and foreign assets had been sacrificed
in the interests of war (see p. 119); and the adverse movement in the terms of trade
swelled the size of the most austere import bill. The balance of payments with the
dollar area was specially difficult in view of the disruption of production in other
areas and the resulting heavy demand for supplies from the dollar area.
The challenge was met by rapid reconversion of productive capacity to the needs
of peace and the mounting of an export drive coupled with severe restrictions of
home demand and imports. Assistance on a large scale was obtained from lines of
credit granted by the United States in 1945 ($3,75° million) and by Canada in 1946
($C.i,25o million of which $C.i,i85 million was taken up). Even so there was a
deficit on current account of £298 million in 1946 and £443 million in 1947- In I948>
when there was a small surplus of £1 million, the flow of dollars began under the

European Recovery Programme (ERP). In 1949, the year when, to protect the
reserves, the exchange value of sterling was reduced from $4.03 to $2.80, there was a
surplus of £31 million. In 1950, when a trade boom followed the outbreak of war in
Korea, the surplus was £300 million and in December allocations of aid to Britain
under ERP were suspended. The total amount of ERP aid to Britain was $2,694
million in grants and loans, of which a small part was not received until 1951. But
the improvement in 1950 was followed by a serious balance of payments crisis in
1951 when imports were over £1,000 million greater than the year before and there
was a deficit of £403 million (including Defence Aid of £4 million). Restrictions had
to be imposed on imports and on home demand but these were gradually relaxed as,
from 1952, the balance of payments position improved, helped by more favourable
terms of trade and United States Defence Aid. Including Defence Aid of £121
million, £102 million and £50 million respectively, there was a surplus of £251
million in 1952, £180 million in 1953 and £186 million in 1954.
The surplus in 1954 masks a change from a surplus (excluding Defence Aid) of
£141 million in the first half of the year to a deficit of £5 million in the second half.
The main reason for this was that exports, while they attained a record level, did
not rise enough to meet the increased cost of imports. There were two reasons for
the increased import bill. First, after falling continuously for two years, import
prices began to rise again in April 1954 and by the beginning of 1955 were almost
6 per cent higher than a year before.1 Over the same period, export prices had
1 In the summer of 1955 the rise in import prices began to level out.

remained virtually unchanged. The course of the terms of trade since 1946 are
shown in the diagram on p. 300. Secondly, towards the end of the year there were
signs that the volume as well as the prices of imports were rising, reflecting the fact
that an expanding economy is bound to demand more imports.
The diagram on p. 301 shows the composition of Britain’s balance of payments
since 1946 in terms of visible and invisible trade. By 1948, the normal position of a
surplus on invisible items had been restored and, except for 195this surplus has
more than offset the normal deficit on visible items. The regional composition of the
balances over the same period is shown in the diagram on this page.
Gold and Dollar Reserves
The course of the gold and dollar reserves is shown in the diagrams on p. 303.
These reserves serve most of the needs of the sterling area and not just those of the
United Kingdom. A major influence on their level is the surplus or deficit which the
sterling area as a whole has with the rest of the world.

All the Commonwealth countries (except Canada), together with Burma, Iceland,
Iraq, the British Protected States in the Persian Gulf, the Irish Republic, Jordan
and Libya are members of the sterling area. These countries contain one-quarter of
the world’s population and do one-quarter of the world’s trade. The main feature of
the sterling area is that the greater part of the oversea trade of member countries is
financed in sterling. They keep their foreign reserves largely in the form of sterling
and maintain a fixed relationship between their currencies and sterling. Member
countries for the most part sell their foreign currency earnings to the United
Kingdom Exchange Equalization Account for sterling and can purchase for
sterling the foreign currency they require. Members generally also sell gold in the
London Market for sterling, and United Kingdom purchases of gold are also held
in the Exchange Equalization Account. The Account’s holdings of gold and dollars,
therefore, constitute the central gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area.
Members have agreed to extensive restraint in the demands for foreign currency,
particularly dollars. (South Africa is in a special position as a large gold producer.
Although it used to finance its net dollar requirements from the sale of its own gold,
making available most of the balance for the central reserves, it now sells most of its
gold through London, acquiring sterling with which it can, like other member
countries, draw on the central reserves for its dollar requirements.)
All these currency arrangements are voluntary; there are no strict or centralized
rules of conduct, the Commonwealth member countries agreeing between them¬
selves at periodic conferences the broad policies to be followed for the strengthening
of the reserves. Thus, following the balance of payments crisis of 1951—which
affected all the sterling area and not only the United Kingdom Commonwealth
Finance Ministers met in January 1952 to agree on remedial measures. Action was
agreed on to bring the sterling area into balance with the rest of the world in the
second half of 1952, to stop the drain on the reserves—which had fallen by £550
million in 1951—and to eliminate inflation. These immediate aims were accom¬
plished and the reserves rose from a low point of £602 million in June 1952 t°
which they had fallen from £1,381 million in June 1951—to £650 million by the
end of the year. In 1953, the United Kingdom had a surplus of £44 million with
non-sterling countries, and the rest of the sterling area had one of £281 million, so
that the whole sterling area’s surplus was £325 million and the reserves rose by
£240 million. In 1954, largely due to increased payments for imports in the second
half of the year, the United Kingdom had a non-sterling deficit of £75 million and
the rest of the sterling area’s surplus was reduced to £145 million so that the whole
sterling area had a surplus of only £70 million. The reserves rose by £87 million.
Monetary Assets and Liabilities
In estimating the improvement in the monetary position of the United Kingdom
and of the sterling area as a whole it is necessary to take into consideration not only
changes in the gold and dollar reserves, but other changes in what might be
described as ‘monetary assets and liabilities’. These are made up of items of a very
diverse character, but a rough measure of the change in the balance between them
is given by the difference between sterling accounts held by residents outside the
United Kingdom and the holdings by United Kingdom residents of oversea
currencies other than dollars. Table 36 brings together the changes since the begin¬
ning of 1951 in United Kingdom net monetary balances including the gold and
dollar reserves. Changes in the balance with the non-sterling areas reflect the
transactions—including short-term capital transactions—of the sterling area as a
whole with the non-sterling world. The figure of changes over all areas, on the other
hand, reflects the movement of the monetary assets and liabilities of the United
TRADE
305
Kingdom in relation to the oversea world as a whole, including the rest of the
sterling area.

Over the two and a half years from end-December 1951 to end-June 1954, the
monetary position of the United Kingdom improved by £279 million and that of
the sterling area as a whole by £538 million, but in the second half of 1954 the
improvement had been reduced to £198 million and £457 million.
United Kingdom Post-War Aid to Other Countries
As against the aid received from external sources after the war, the United
Kingdom made available considerable sums to other countries. Between 1st January
1946 and 31st December 1952 the amount spent by the United Kingdom Govern¬
ment on assistance in the form of loans and grants to other countries, including
United Kingdom dependencies, and to international organizations was £1,504
million. Loans and grants received by the United Kingdom in the same period
amounted to £2,556 million.
Oversea Investment
With the progress of post-war recovery, Britain has been able to resume its
role as a provider of funds for investment in development overseas, particularly in
the Commonwealth. Thus, between 1947 and 1954, the Governments of member
countries of the Sterling Area Commonwealth raised loans in London totalling
about £90 million, while Governments of United Kingdom dependencies raised
loans totalling some £120 million. Private borrowing in the London market for
Commonwealth development has increased in recent years, Capital Issues consent
(see p. 293) having been given to applications totalling £40 million in 1953 and £48
million in 1954. Development in the Sterling Area Commonwealth is also being
assisted through the Commonwealth Development Finance Company Ltd. (see
p. 293), which, by 31st March 1955, had invested or committed £9*75 million.
For the same purpose, the United Kingdom Government has agreed to allow
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3°6
£10 million a year for six years to be available for Commonwealth investment from
its contribution to the International Bank (releases totalling £14 million had been
agreed to the end of 1954), and, in 1953, it granted a credit of £10 million to
Pakistan.
Private capital from Britain going directly into private oversea enterprises and
the ploughing back of profits from existing undertakings have, of course, always
represented an important element in Commonwealth development, although it is
not possible to measure the extent with any accuracy, since only those investments
which involve raising new money are subject to any control. In the case of Canada—
a dollar country—where, as with all non-sterling countries, United Kingdom
investment requires Exchange Control approval as well as Capital Issues consent
where new borrowing is involved, participation by United Kingdom investors in
economic development has been facilitated in various ways, and private investment
in Canada was authorized to the extent of £37 million in 1953 and £49 million in
1954. In addition, the investment of smaller amounts in the United States and other
foreign countries has been authorized: in 1954 applications were approved for the
investment of £29-7 million in the United States, £15.7 million in Europe and
£6-j million in other countries. A credit of £10 million was granted to Persia in
I954-
It has recently been estimated that the average figures for United Kingdom
long-term investment overseas (excluding inter-Govemment lending, but including
United Kingdom Government loans for commercial projects and borrowing by
oversea Governments in the London Market) are:

Current Policies
The current trade and payments policy of the United Kingdom and the Sterling
Area Commonwealth countries has been worked out at a series of conferences.
There are three main objectives: (1) the maintenance of a strong balance of pay¬
ments position and the strengthening of the reserves; (2) sound internal policies on
which ‘ depend the purchasing power of money, the cost of living and the ability to
sell exports in increasingly competitive markets’; and (3) the development of
resources, with particular emphasis ‘on the development of those resources which
directly or indirectly contribute on an economic basis towards improving the
balance of payments of the sterling area’. In the matter of financing development,
the United Kingdom has undertaken to make a special effort in the knowledge that
this, added to other oversea commitments on account of military expenditure, debt
repayments, etc., requires an increase in current account earnings.
These objectives are being pursued in the context of proposals designed ‘to bring
about the widest possible system of multilateral trade and payments, the reduction
and progressive elimination of import restrictions, and the convertibility of sterling
and other important currencies ’. These proposals, known as the collective
TRADE
3°7
approach’, are based on the need for ‘collective action by debtor and creditor
countries to bring about a balance in the world economy on the basis of “ trade, not
aid’”. Considerable progress has been made towards freer trade and payments;
in facilitating these objectives, convertibility of currencies will be a major instru¬
ment and not an end in itself. Necessary conditions for further decisive action have
been stated to be: (1) progress in Europe in moving from the present European
Payments Union to a system in which some countries’ currencies will be convertible
but not those of others; (2) the consolidation and furthering of the real progress of
the sterling area towards useful development, internal balance and adequate foreign
exchange resources; (3) the carrying forward of the United States Administration’s
trade liberalization policies, so that the dollar-earning opportunities of other
countries can be increased; and (4) the development of more elastic methods of
co-operation between the International Monetary Fund and its members.
CONDUCT OF EXTERNAL TRADE
The export trade and most of the import trade of the United Kingdom is
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the industry,
the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export trade, especially
of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through export merchants in the
United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to importers and consumers abroad
through their own agents or resident representatives in the countries concerned;
in other cases, sales are made through a firm’s own branch office, distributing
organization or subsidiary sales company established in oversea markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or domestic
trade buy directly from oversea suppliers, while smaller firms may find it more con¬
venient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export houses, commission
agents, and the representatives of oversea firms.
Commodity Markets
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world’s basic com¬
modities. These markets were largely closed during the war but they have gradually
been re-opened and are rapidly regaining their previous position. Among the more
important are the London Rubber Market, the London Wool Exchange, the
London Metal Exchange and the Liverpool Cotton Exchange. Apart from the
import of goods for home consumption, many transactions are arranged between
buyers and sellers from other countries and the British markets play an important
part in merchanting and distributing commodities throughout the world.
Re-export Trade
Re-exports are goods which are exported {a) in the condition in which they
are imported or (6) after having undergone minor operations—e.g., simple blending,
husking, repacking—which leave them essentially unchanged. For some hundreds
of years Britain has been an important centre of re-export trade though, over the
past forty years, its importance relative to total United Kingdom export trade has
declined. The greater part of United Kingdom re-export trade has always been
in raw materials and foodstuffs, e.g., wool, rubber, tea, non-ferrous metals and
furskins. Traditionally, re-export commodities are imported from Commonwealth
countries and re-exported to countries in Europe.
308 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
London’s Part in the Finance of International Trade
In the financing of international trade, both visible and invisible, the part played
by the City of London is of outstanding importance. By a process of evolution
through the centuries ‘ the City ’ has developed an efficient and adaptable organiza¬
tion of trade and financial services capable of meeting the needs, not only of Britain,
but of the world in general. The supremacy of London in this respect derives from
a number of factors—historical, geographical and economic—as well as the technical
efficiency and low cost of its services. In the nineteenth century the rapid growth
of British industry, commerce and shipping under the stimulus of the industrial
revolution made Britain the market as well as the workshop of the world. It
became the site for the chief world markets in raw materials, freight, insurance,
and precious metals. At the same time British capital was invested in oversea coun¬
tries to assist their development, increase their output and exports, and provide
markets for manufactured goods. London became the chief supplier of capital for
many Commonwealth and foreign governments and a centre for entrepot trade
proceeding to and from the growing industrial areas on the continent of Europe
and in North America. In course of time the pound sterling and the sterling bill of
exchange developed into the principal form of money for transactions between one
country and another in all parts of the world. Britain is now the banker for the
sterling area and sterling is used in the finance of nearly half the world’s international
transactions.
Side by side with these developments a sound commercial banking system and
a flexible system of central bank control have been built up, while specialized
institutions such as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the Stock
Exchange, investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to satisfy par¬
ticular needs of short- or long-term finance (see pp. 288-95). The facilities provided
by merchant banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been used to
finance shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but between any two
outside countries.
Despite the dislocations of two world wars and the growth of economic national¬
ism in the twentieth century, London has retained its supremacy as an international
centre for the provision of financial and trade services. Its reputation has been
enhanced in recent years by the recovery in the sterling area’s gold and dollar
reserves, the improvement in Britain’s balance of payments and the removal of
restrictions on trade and financial operations.
Government Assistance to Oversea Trade
The United Kingdom Government provides a service of information and advice
to merchants and manufacturers in the export trade. The Government Department
most concerned is the Board of Trade, which calls upon the assistance of oversea
representatives. At each Embassy or Legation there is always an officer of high
rank, a Minister, Counsellor or First Secretary (Commercial), who specializes in
commercial matters. These officers direct the commercial activities of Consular
officers in their respective territories.
At important centres in the Commonwealth there are Trade Commissioners who
are directly responsible to the Board of Trade.
Oversea officers regularly report on local economic and commercial conditions, j
pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities, and generally
assist the exporter to overcome the difficulties he encounters in trade with the
country in question, particularly those arising out of governmental regulations.
These officers indicate potential demand for United Kingdom products, advise
TRADE
3°9
about methods of trading with particular areas, and seek out and pass on all
opportunities for export business and inquiries for United Kingdom goods.
Assistance is also given to United Kingdom exporters in finding agents and likely
importers. From the records the Department keeps in London, brought up to date
by reports from its oversea officers, it can provide information concerning any
country on:
(1) prospects for United Kingdom exports and requirements of particular
markets;
(2) governmental regulations affecting trade, including import restrictions and
tariffs and duties on particular commodities;
(3) methods of trading;
(4) goods most likely to sell;
(5) local tastes and preferences in design;
(6) the probity and influence of firms with which an exporter contemplates
entering into business relations.
Export Credit Insurance
The Export Credits Guarantee Department is a Government agency run on
commercial lines to provide insurance for United Kingdom exporters and mer¬
chants against the main risks of financial loss incurred in oversea trading. These
facilities have been developed over a period of more than thirty years, and the
Department now underwrites some £500 million worth of insurance a year, for
more than 3,800 policyholders. The Department is obliged to conduct its business
on a self-supporting basis, taking one year with another, and cannot therefore be
regarded in any way as a provider of subsidies to exporters.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer, action
by the buyer’s Government which blocks or delays transfer of payment to the
United Kingdom, imposition of new import licensing restrictions in the buyer s
country, war between the buyer’s country and the United Kingdom, cancellation
or non-renewal of a United Kingdom export licence, or ‘any other cause of loss
occurring outside the United Kingdom and not within the control of the exporter
or the buyer, and not normally insurable with commercial insurers . Cover may
commence from date of contract or (at lower premiums) from date of shipment.
There are three main types of export insurance policy:
1. Short-term policies normally covering goods sold on terms of up to six
months credit. The exporter insures the whole of his trade, or the whole of
his trade with an agreed group of markets, for the twelve months covered
by his policy. For certain engineering goods this type of cover is extended
to goods sold on maximum credit terms of up to two years. Cover is also
available for goods of foreign origin sold by a United Kingdom merchant
to third countries, provided this trade does not conflict with direct United
Kingdom exports.
2. Medium-term policies which cover capital and other goods sold on credit
terms exceeding two years. Specific policies are negotiated for each indi¬
vidual contract.
3. Dollar market policies for North America and the Dollar Account countries
of Central and South America. The policies listed above cover risks affect¬
ing payments under a contract of sale: the dollar market policies are designed
to reduce to manageable size the special risks of loss in breaking into these
markets. The exporter insures against a percentage of the loss which may
3io
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
result if market surveys, advertising or sales promotion campaigns, or stock¬
holding, do not produce sufficient revenue to defray their cost. A similar
but more extensive form of insurance is provided by ‘Joint Venture’
policies.
In the case of all the Department’s policies, the exporter or merchant is required
to retain an interest in the debt or risk involved and, consequently, guarantees are
given up to a maximum of 85 to 90 per cent. Premium rates are assessed separately
for each country, and vary according to the risks and the terms of payment.
Trade Fairs
The British Industries Fair (BIF) is the largest national trade fair held regularly
in any country. It was first held in 1915, and has since been an annual event except
for a break in 1925 and again from 1940 to 1947. Since 1947 it has consisted of
exhibits by manufacturers within the United Kingdom and representative displays
by the Governments of Commonwealth countries.
Part of the BIF is held in London; and part is held simultaneously at Castle
Bromwich, Birmingham.
Under the British Industries Fair (Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1954, the
responsibility for the BIF has been transferred as from 1955 from the Board of
Trade to a non-profit-making company (British Industries Fair, Ltd.) whose board
is nominated by trustees representative of industry. The initial working capital for
this company is guaranteed by the Government for a period of five years. Manage¬
ment of the Birmingham section of the fair remains with the Birmingham Chamber
of Commerce.
In addition to the British Industries Fair, which serves industry generally, there
are many specialized trade fairs held in the United Kingdom. The most important
of these, such as the Motor Show, the Mechanical Handling Exhibition and the
Radio and Television Show, attract large numbers of the public as well as many
trade buyers from home and overseas. These specialized fairs provide an important
means of advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom manufacturers show their goods at most of the large inter¬
national trade fairs throughout the world. For example, more than 450 United
Kingdom firms were represented at the 1955 Milan Fair and more than 330 at the
1955 Brussels Fair. At the more important of these international trade fairs there is
an official United Kingdom export promotion unit to deal with trade inquiries. In
addition to taking part in these international events, there are specially organized
displays of British goods: a successful trade fair of this sort was organized in
Zurich in 1953 by the British Chamber of Commerce for Switzerland, and the
Federation of British Industries organized a British Trade Fair in Baghdad in 1954,
and in Copenhagen in 1955.
Tourist Trade
During post-war years the tourist trade has become an important source of foreign
currency earnings. In 1954 oversea visitors spent in the United Kingdom the
equivalent of £95-5 million, of which some £34 million was in dollar currency. The
total number of visitors in 1954 was 901,000, an increase of more than 100 per cent
on the 1947 figure and of 85 per cent on the figure for 1937, the peak year before
the war.
The British Travel and Holidays Association, which is a Government-sponsored
body, is concerned with the promotion of the tourist industry, particularly by means
of publicity overseas. The Association was formed in April 1950 by the merger of the
TRADE
311
British Travel and Holidays Board and the Travel Association. Its work is directed
by a Board consisting of a chairman and 23 members. The President of the Board of
Trade appoints the Chairman and eight members, the Council of the Association
elects seven members, the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland Tourist Boards
between them appoint four members and the Board itself has power to co-opt four
members to represent tourist interests not otherwise covered. The Association runs
a Tourist Information Centre (to which all correspondence should be addressed)
at 64-65 St. James’s Street, London, S.W.i, and has oversea offices in New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles, Toronto, Paris and Frankfurt.
There are no restrictions on the amounts of sterling that United Kingdom
tourists visiting sterling area countries may take with them. For visits to non¬
sterling countries outside the dollar area United Kingdom tourists are entitled to
take a basic foreign currency allowance of £100 per twelve-month period. Special
arrangements apply to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe
Islands: United Kingdom tourists visiting these countries are allowed all reasonable
amounts of currency.
Changeover from State Trading to Private Trading
In the immediate post-war years nearly all the principal imported foods and raw
materials and some other goods were bought wholly or mainly on Government
account, and the Government was also the sole purchaser of nearly all domestically
produced food and certain raw materials such as flax and timber. By 1951 a con¬
siderable number of major commodities including wool, rubber, tin, woodpulp,
hardwoods, hides and skins, flax and leather, had been restored to private trade.
Since 1951 the changeover from state trading to private trading has proceeded
rapidly. Government monopoly oversea purchasing, which was responsible for
about half the United Kingdom’s total imports in 1951 (about two-thirds of food
imports and about one-quarter of raw materials) was, by 1954, confined to two
foodstuffs—raw sugar and bacon—and one industrial commodity jute goods.
These three items accounted for only about 5 per cent of total imports in 1954*
July 1955 the Government announced its plans for ending State trading in sugar.
Concurrently with the process of reversion from public to private trading,
import licensing restrictions have been substantially eased, so that for most of the
principal foodstuffs and raw materials no limit is now imposed on the quantity
or value of imports from any country or, in some instances, from a wide range o
countries.
The principal quantitative controls still in operation on external trade are (1)
currency exchange control; and (2) import and export licensing.
Exchange Control
Exchange control, i.e. control over the purchase and sale of gold and foreign
currencies, was introduced at the outbreak of war in September i939‘ The legal
basis was at first the Defence (Finance) Regulations issued under the Emergency
Powers (Defence) Acts, but in 1947 most of these temporary war-time powers were
embodied in permanent legislation in the Exchange Control Act, 1947-
Exchange control does not affect transactions wholly within the sterling area.
It is imposed only on: (a) transactions between residents within the sterling area
and residents outside; and (b) transactions conducted in sterling between persons
resident outside the sterling area. Although the main structure of exchange control
has continued intact since 1939, relaxations in its operation have been made in
recent years.
X
312
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In March 1954 the facility which certain countries possessing transferable
accounts have enjoyed of settling current transactions between each other—as well
as with sterling area countries—in sterling was extended to virtually all non-dollar
countries. The facility now applies to capital as well as to current transactions.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of the
administration is in practice carried out by the Bank of England as agent of the
Treasury—and in turn the Bank of England has delegated to the commercial banks
a wide variety of powers to deal with applications.
Foreign Exchange Market
From the beginning of the war until December 1951 the purchase and sale (both
spot and forward) of the more important foreign currencies by residents of the
United Kingdom for authorized transactions, was permitted only at official buying
and selling rates which were maintained at a narrow margin either side of the
parity of those currencies against sterling. From 17th December 1951 wider spreads,
between which spot exchange transactions could take place, were introduced and
forward rates were entirely freed from restrictions, making it possible to reopen the
Foreign Exchange Market on a limited scale.
In May 1953 there was a resumption of arbitrage transactions (i.e. the purchase
of a currency in one market and its sale in another, taking advantage of a difference
in rates between the two markets) between London and the principal European
exchange markets in the more important European Payments Union currencies.
London Gold Market
The London Gold Market, which had also been closed since the beginning of
the war, was reopened on a restricted basis as from 22nd March 1954. The Market
operates under the general supervision of the Bank of England.
Dealings in the Market are conducted in sterling, but the reopening of the
Market does not make sterling more convertible into other currencies. Gold
transactions in the Market on account of non-residents are settled in sterling which
is the equivalent of dollars, i.e. payments are made into American, Canadian or
Registered Accounts1 all of which are exchangeable for dollars. Purchases of gold
for residents of the sterling area require prior permission of the Bank of England
and are strictly limited.
Import and Export Control
The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, empowers the
Board of Trade to make Orders prohibiting or regulating the import or export of
goods. The powers of both import and export control derive from the same legis¬
lation, but the purpose and mechanism are quite distinct.
Import Controls
Although goods can be imported into the United Kingdom only under licences
issued by the Board of Trade, an importer does not have to apply for a licence every
time he wishes to import anything. A large number of goods can be imported under
the Open General Licence, which authorizes any person in the United Kingdom to
import a number of specified commodities without any limits of quantity or value,
either from anywhere in the world or from specified countries or groups of
countries. Similarly, for a wide range of goods, individual traders are granted Open
1 Registered Accounts may be opened by any non-resident (other than American or
Canadian). They may only be credited with the proceeds of sales of gold or dollars or with
transfers from American or Canadian Accounts.
TRADE
313
Individual Licences which allow them to import unlimited amounts of the goods
from any country or from specified countries or groups of countries. Nearly all the
United Kingdom’s imports from the sterling area, a very large part (85 per cent at
1 st June 1955 in the case of member countries of the Organization for European
Economic Co-operation) of its imports from the rest of the non-dollar world, and
about one-half of its imports from the dollar area are admitted under Open General
Licence or Open Individual Licences. . .
When an importer wishes to bring in goods not covered by the unrestnctive
Open Licensing arrangements, the Board of Trade decides whether he should be
granted a licence to import a limited value of the goods in accordance with one o
three basic methods of determining who should be allowed to import goods and
in what quantities. These methods are:
(1) ad hoc consideration of applications for licences;
(2) apportionment of quotas among importers;
(3) apportionment of quotas among exporters to the United Kingdom by
arrangement with the Governments of the exporting countries concerned.
The choice of method depends on the circumstances of the particular trade under
consideration.
Import and exchange control are closely linked. All holders of import licences
and anybody who wishes to import goods admissible under the Open General
Licence are granted the currency required to pay for their imports.
Export Controls
For the most part, United Kingdom exports are not subject to any Government
control or direction. Such controls as are in operation are imposed for the following
reasons:
(1) to control goods of strategic importance;
(2) to conserve or regulate the distribution of scarce materials,
(3) to assist exchange control operations in preventing exports of capital in
the form of valuable goods (e.g., diamonds);
(4) to control the re-export of materials purchased with dollars;
(5) to control the export of goods the prices of which have been subsidized
for consumption in the home market;
(6) to prevent the export of works of art of national importance.
The operation of export licensing control is such that goods are freely exportable
to all destinations unless there is a specific ban on their export without licence.
Normally, individual licences are required for specific consignments of goods sub¬
ject to export licensing control, but in a few cases Open General Licences are
issued. In other cases bulk licences are issued to permit exports of specified
quantities of controlled goods within a given period.
In recent years export controls have been greatly reduced and now cover only
a small proportion of total shipments. The position is continually under review
and relaxations in control are made whenever circumstances permit. Following
improvements in the supply position, the majority of goods now subject to control
are of strategic importance. Certain of these strategic goods may be exported with¬
out licence to the Commonwealth (other than Hong Kong), the Irish Republic an
the United States of America, but exports of such goods to other destinations are
subject to export licensing control. All exports to China and Macao are subject to
export licensing control, and all exports to North Korea, North Viet Nam and Ti et
are prohibited.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
INTERNAL TRADE
The internal trade of the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad
categories: trade in raw materials, capital goods and intermediate products (such
as steel plates) which do not reach the hands of the public; and trade in consumer
goods. An account of the supply and distribution of consumer goods is given below.
Methods of distribution are varied and complex. On the basis of some pre-war
researches,1 however, it would appear that 10 to 15 per cent of sales (by value) are
made to consumers through producers’ own selling organizations, including their
own retail shops, and in about half the remaining sales the producers sell direct to
retailers. Where wholesale channels exist, they take a number of forms. Fish, for
example, is auctioned at ports mainly to port wholesalers to sell to inland wholesalers
at certain main distributive centres, who in turn sell to retailers, although a significant
number of retailers buy direct from port wholesalers. Most producers of fresh fruit
and vegetables (many of whom are small growers) market their products through
a wholesale market where most of it is handled by selling agents on a commission
basis. Wholesale distribution of consumer goods is not, however, generally
centralized.
WHOLESALE TRADE
Returns published in 1955 in the Census of Distribution and Other Services ig§o
were made by 55,701 wholesale establishments—about 92 per cent of the total
number. The returns show that 790,266 persons were engaged in wholesale trade,
and that the wages bill, excluding the incomes of proprietors, was £297,666,000.
Table 37 summarizes these returns with regard to wholesale establishments by
method of trading.
The greatest numbers of wholesale establishments are found in the clothing,
footwear and textiles trade (7,019), and the groceries, confectionery and drinks
trade (6,946).
RETAIL TRADE
Retail outlets of the United Kingdom can be classified into four types: (a) the
independent shop, (b) the departmental store, (c) the multiple shop, and (d) the
co-operative society. There is an increasing number of self-service shops in the
United Kingdom. Street and market traders, though relatively numerous, are not
believed to do a large volume of business.
Types of Shops
One-half of the retail trade of the United Kingdom is handled by independent
shopkeepers in ordinary small retail businesses consisting of a single shop or a few
shops. Such retailers usually serve customers in the immediate neighbourhood, often
supplying a great variety of commodities. Some specialist shops, however, have a
widespread and even an international clientele.
A departmental store is a shop having a number of departments for different
types of goods, while a multiple shop is a branch of a firm which owns or controls
a considerable number of similar retail outlets. Some shops are multiple depart¬
mental stores, i.e. they belong to a firm running several departmental stores.
Similar to these in their wide range of goods are the variety chain stores, which

are multiple shops of a special kind. Their main features are the sale of a wide

tion of layout and general appearance.
Co-operative Societies
Retail co-operative societies are voluntary, non-profit-making associations
engaged in retail trade and controlled by their members, who are also their
customers. Any operating surplus is returned annually to members as a dividend.
Dividends are proportionate to the value of purchases made in the year and not
to investment in the society.
Retail co-operative societies sell to the general public as well as to their own
members, but membership is open to anyone willing to pay a small deposit on a
minimum share and entitles the member not only to a dividend but to an equal
voice with other members in deciding the society’s policy. Investment of individual
members is limited to £500 and the rules of some societies may fix lower limits.
Only a low fixed interest is paid.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3l6
Retail co-operative societies are free to buy where they will or to produce their
own goods, but, in order to secure the advantages of large-scale production and
trade, they have collectively established wholesale and production societies.1
At the end of 1954 there were 1,033 retail co-operative societies registered under
the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, but nearly a quarter of the entire
co-operative membership (11,272,000) was provided by the eight largest societies,
each of which had a membership of over 115,000. The total sales of the retail
societies in 1954 were £772 million, about 7 per cent of the total national expendi¬
ture on consumer goods and services.
The 1950 Census of Distribution
The reports of the Census of Distribution for 1950, published in 1953 and 1954,
gave details of retail trade and certain allied service trades in Great Britain in 1950.
The reports cover 684,764 establishments and 542,299 organizations (an organi¬
zation is an undertaking operating one or more establishments) whose chief activity
is selling goods or providing certain services to the general public. Included in this
total are 531,143 retail establishments employing 2,265,291 persons (including
working proprietors and unpaid family workers) with a turnover of nearly £4,923
million and a wages bill of over £392 million. The other trades covered include
catering (turnover £277 million), hairdressing (£34 million), repairing for the
general public (£25^ million), and the motor and cycle trades (£546 million).
Catering as part of the business of a hotel or public house is not included. Table 38
classifies establishments by kind of business, and shows figures for the main retail
and service trades. In addition there were over 3,500 central offices and warehouses
belonging to the larger organizations, employing 132,000 persons, with a wages bill
of £47 million. Owing to some non-response in the census these figures are not
complete, but the results for the retail trade, apart from the service trades, are
estimated to represent about 91 per cent of the total number of retail establishments
and about 95 per cent of the total turnover.
Forty-eight per cent of the retail trade was done by organizations consisting of a
single establishment. On the other hand 30 per cent was done by 534 large organi¬
zations with annual sales of over £ 1 million.
The retail businesses are not all shops. The census found 5 31,143 retail (excluding
service and motor trade) establishments of which 467,7°° were fixed shops, but
the total also includes 22,800 market traders, 6,600 street traders, 13,800 traders at
coal yards and other yards making retail sales, and smaller but still considerable
numbers selling by other methods. The business done by market and street traders
was usually very small (under £2,000 a year) and though it is not claimed that all
street traders were included, the omissions are not believed to have made a signifi¬
cant difference to the total figures. The retail shops included 483 self-service shops
with the high average turnover of £ 3 5,000; 478 of these establishments are classified
in the grocery group.
CONTROLS ON CONSUMER GOODS
In recent years most of the controls on consumer goods surviving after the war
have been swept away. The last remnant of the war-time food rationing system—
the rationing of meat and bacon—was ended in July 1954. The dismantling of
rationing schemes has been accompanied, as a rule, by the removal of retail price
controls. The proportion of consumer outlays subject to price control diminished

from about 70 per cent in 1951 to about 40 per cent at the beginning of 1954 5 by the
end of the year it was a considerably lower proportion. The price of bread, milk
and potatoes continues to be controlled. In the case of bread and milk this is
because of the continuation of the consumer subsidy; in the case of potatoes it is
because of the existing fixed price and guarantee system (see p. 150).
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
318
The most important price control directly affecting the consumer and still in
force is that on rents (see p. 355).
Domestic Fuel
With certain exceptions,1 the supply of solid fuel for domestic use is restricted
under the Coal Distribution Order, 1943, by the imposition of‘maximum permitted
quantities’. These are not rations and provide no assurance that supplies will be
sufficient for everyone to purchase the maximum amount allowed. For the pur¬
poses of control, solid fuel is usually divided into two groups: house coal and boiler
fuel (largely anthracite). It is usual, in defining the maximum permitted quantities
under each of these two headings, to give a total figure for the year from May to
April inclusive, and separate figures for the summer months, May to October, and
the winter months, November to April. Maximum permitted quantities vary also
between the northern and southern halves of the country, the northern regions
being allowed more coal than the southern regions.
Households which use solid fuel for cooking or have other special needs can
obtain fuel additional to the maximum permitted quantity on grant of a licence
from the local fuel office of the Ministry of Fuel and Power.
1 The following fuels are free from restriction: coke, wood, anthracite duff, washery
slurry, uncarbonized ovoids and briquettes, certain classes of coal not classified as house
coal ’ because of unsuitable size or quality, and the carbonized smokeless fuels ‘ Coalite
and ‘ Rexco’.
X. SOCIAL WELFARE
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is now responsible, through either central or local govern¬
ment authorities, for a range of services covering subsistence for the needy,
education and health services for all, housing, employment or maintenance, the
care of the aged and the handicapped, and the nutrition of mothers and children,
besides sickness, maternity and industrial injury benefits, widow’s and retirement
pensions and family allowances. Public authorities in the United Kingdom are
spending over £2,000 million a year on social services; and Exchequer expenditure
on social services amounts to over a quarter of total Exchequer expenditure.
Voluntary organizations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of nearly all
the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, and
social and recreational clubs before these were provided by the State. They made
themselves responsible for the welfare of the very young and the very old, the
homeless and the handicapped, before it was generally accepted that the whole
community had a responsibility towards these people. Where the services and the
facilities they provided were adequate, they have been encouraged to continue. The
State now supplements these voluntary services and provides financial assistance,
sees that essential services are brought within the reach of every citizen, and ensures
that the necessary standards are maintained.
Many voluntary social services still surround and supplement the State services.
The two types are not competitive but complementary and merge into each other.
The State services often work through voluntary agencies specially adapted to
serve individual or special needs. The welfare work of the National Assistance
Board is supplemented by the work of many voluntary social service societies with
whose workers the Board’s officers co-operate, while State and local authority
institutional provision for the chronic sick and aged is supplemented by voluntary
homes of various types for the care of the sick and elderly, most of whom receive
State pensions or benefit.
Voluntary Bodies
The number of voluntary charitable societies and institutions in Britain runs into
thousands. Some of them are large and some are small and local in character. Some
have general aims and others, such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind,
have been established for a particular purpose. The societies co-operate with each
other and with local authorities engaged on the same work.
Foremost among societies providing general social service are the National
Council of Social Service, the Scottish Council of Social Service, and the Family
Welfare Association. The National Council of Social Service was established in
1919 to create a closer link between the machinery of government and the voluntary
activities of the ordinary citizen. The Family Welfare Association, formerly the
Charity Organization Society, which was founded in 1869, works on personal lines
to help any individual or family in need or difficulty. It has a number of district
committees in London and there are, affiliated to it, about 60 family casework
agencies in the provinces.
There is a Central Council for the Care of Cripples, and the major societies
caring for homeless children, such as Doctor Barnardo’s Homes and the Church of
England Children’s Society, are represented on the National Council of Associated
3W
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
320
Children’s Homes. Other examples of co-ordination in a specialized field are the
National Association for Mental Health, the Women’s Group on Public Welfare
and the National Marriage Guidance Council.
Societies working on a national scale whose social work is definitely religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, the Social Service of the
Church of Scotland, the Church of England Children’s Society, the Church of
England Moral Welfare Council,-the Young Men’s Christian Association, the
Young Women’s Christian Association, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the
Crusade of Rescue, the Jewish Board of Guardians and the Catholic Marriage
Advisory Council.
War-time organizations such as the Women’s Voluntary Services and the
Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (there are still about 465 of these bureaux) continue, with
official support, to find scope for their activities. The Citizens’ Advice Bureaux act
as interpreters between the Government Departments and the ordinary citizen and,
though the inquiries are somewhat fewer now than during the war, more skill and
time are often needed for their solution. WVS activities are many and various. They
include welfare work for children, the aged and the sick, and for certain foreign
workers, as well as relief work in emergencies.
The old-established British Red Cross Society not only aids the sick and wounded
in time of war but works in peace time for ‘ the improvement of health, the preven¬
tion of disease, and the mitigation of suffering’. It is, in particular, developing its
welfare services for civilian disabled, invalid and crippled children and the aged.
The members of the St. John Ambulance Brigade and, in Scotland, the St.
Andrew’s Ambulance Association likewise render voluntary auxiliary medical
services and undertake welfare work for the sick and the infirm.
Old People's Welfare
Voluntary bodies take a large share in the work for old people that has been
steadily expanding since the second world war brought into prominence the prob¬
lems of old people’s welfare that social and population changes had already begun
to accentuate.
Hostels for bombed-out or evacuated old people have been followed by perma¬
nent homes where old people can live together in happiness and comfort however
small their means. Voluntary homes of this kind now number over 750. More than
4,000 social clubs for elderly people have been started in recent years in all parts of
Britain. The regular visiting of lonely old people and the delivery of cooked meals
to their homes (‘meals-on-wheels’) are other welfare services that are being
developed by voluntary effort with State support with the object of enabling old
people to continue to live in their own homes wherever possible.
Local Old People’s Welfare Committees are formed by those concerned in this
work, and are aided by the National Old People’s Welfare Council, an associated
group of the National Council of Social Service widely representative of voluntary
and statutory bodies having direct contact with old people, or by the Scottish Old
People’s Welfare Committee, a committee of the Scottish Council of Social
Service. A National Corporation for the Care of Old People was established in
1947 by the Nuffield Foundation (see p. 369) to stimulate and to give financial
support to schemes for the welfare of the aged, to maintain an expert technical
advisory service, and to encourage and to undertake research and experiment for
the welfare of old people. The Corporation is now concentrating its main effort on
home services for old people. Over £400,000 from the King George VI Memorial
Fund is being spent by the King George VI Foundation on schemes for the benefit
of old people.
SOCIAL WELFARE
321
The Social Worker
While the voluntary worker giving full- or part-time service has done pioneer
work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an essential part in
probably every service, social services of all kinds increasingly depend for their
operation primarily on the professional social worker, that is the full-time salaried
worker trained in the principles and technique of social service. Training for many
forms of social work consists of a basic university diploma or certificate course in
social science followed by a specialized training for a particular service. The latter is
usually organized by the profession concerned. An attempt is being made to lessen
specialization in social work.
Voluntary organizations have been pioneers in the employment and training of
social workers, but it is a significant fact that central Government Departments and
local authorities are employing trained social workers in greater numbers and in
more services. Such workers include regional and local welfare officers, children’s
care organizers, children’s officers for work under the Children Act, 1948 (see
p. 328), neighbourhood workers, youth leaders, almoners, mental health workers,
psychiatric social workers, tuberculosis care workers, housing managers, personnel
managers and probation officers; in fact, representatives of most branches of social
work. In June 1955 the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland
set up a working party to examine the field of work, recruitment and training of
social workers in the local authorities’ health and welfare services.
NATIONAL INSURANCE AND RELATED SERVICES
National Insurance, Industrial Injuries Insurance, Family Allowances and
National Assistance together constitute a system of social security in the United
Kingdom which ensures that in no circumstances need anyone fall below a minimum
standard of life. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance administers the
first three of these measures in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are adminis¬
tered by the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance. National Assistance is
administered by the National Assistance Board in Great Britain, and in Northern
Ireland by the National Assistance Board of Northern Ireland. Pensions and
welfare services for war pensioners and their dependants (see p. 32^) are
responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance throughout the
United Kingdom.
The Poor Relief Act of 1601 can be regarded as the starting-point of public
provision for social security in England and Wales. From the beginning of the
present century, and particularly after the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws
and Relief of Distress had issued its report, with the influential Minority Report,
in 1909, a strong movement arose against the form and spirit of the poor law as it had
been administered under the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. The first depar¬
ture from the poor law as the sole means of relief given from public funds had been
the introduction in 1908 of non-contributory old age pensions granted on a test of
means. The poor law' was finally superseded by the National Assistance Act, 1948.
In the same period there was a development of compulsory insurance administered
on a national basis. The Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1897 foreshadowed the
present National Insurance Industrial Injuries scheme, although the system it
introduced of compulsory payment by employers of compensation to workers for
accidents at work was not itself a State-administered insurance scheme. In 1912
came the National Health Insurance scheme and with it the introduction of the
contributory principle on which all later measures have been based. In return for
322
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a small weekly contribution it provided a small cash payment and medical treat¬
ment without charge during sickness. It applied only to a limited number of the
lower-paid workers. In 1912 also a limited scheme of unemployment insurance was
started. This was extended in 1920 to cover the great majority of employed persons,
a very necessary provision in view of the large-scale unemployment of the inter¬
war years. In 1926 contributory pensions for old people, widows and orphans were
introduced.
By the beginning of the second world war the social services in Britain were
among the best in the world, but they lacked co-ordination by the very fact of their
piecemeal development, and they were not universal. A comprehensive, co-ordi¬
nated and unified plan for social security was needed.
Under the stimulus of war, when plans for post-war reconstruction were being
formulated, Lord (then Sir William) Beveridge was invited by the National Coali¬
tion Government to investigate the country’s existing social insurance system. In
1942 the Beveridge Report was published and recommended the creation of a
comprehensive and unified system of social insurance. The report aroused intense
interest and was accepted in general by the Government as the basis on which the
future social security structure should be built.
In the immediate post-war years a series of Acts introduced a new comprehensive
system which became fully operative on 5th July 1948. Adjustments have been
made in a number of subsequent Acts.
Reciprocity
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate as a single
system. Reciprocal agreements on family allowances are in operation with
Australia, New Zealand, Jersey and Guernsey, and there are further agreements
with Australia and New Zealand (on sickness, unemployment and widow’s benefits,
and retirement pensions), with Jersey (on sickness, industrial injuries and widow’s
benefits, guardian’s allowances and retirement pensions) and with the Irish Republic
(on sickness, unemployment, maternity and widow’s benefits, and the insurance of
seamen). Agreements covering various aspects of social security have been in
operation with France since November 1949, with Italy since May 1953, with
Switzerland since June 1954, with Luxembourg since April 1955, and with the
Netherlands since June 1955. An agreement with Denmark on industrial injuries
benefits has been in operation since May 1954. Similar agreements with other
Commonwealth and European countries are under negotiation.
A multilateral agreement on social security, signed by the five Brussels Treaty
Powers, was ratified by the United Kingdom in May 1950, and was implemented
a year later for limited purposes; it will not come into full operation until the
network of bilateral agreements between the five participating countries has been
completed. Other multilateral provisions, embodied in two interim agreements on
social security signed by the member countries of the Council of Europe and in a
United Nations Convention on the status of refugees, have also been ratified and
were brought into effect during 1954.
FAMILY ALLOWANCES
The Family Allowances scheme introduced the new comprehensive system of
social insurance. Payments began on 6th August 1946 and provided an allowance
of 5s. a week for every child in the family after the first under the age limit, i.e. up
to the end of compulsory school age (normally 15) and for any further period before
SOCIAL WELFARE
323
the 1 st August following the sixteenth birthday while the child is receiving full¬
time instruction in a school (or would still be receiving such instruction but for ill
health), or is an apprentice. (A Bill is to be introduced to extend the period during
which family allowances are payable for children who remain at school.) The rate
was raised to 8s. a week in September 1952, under the Family Allowances and
National Insurance Act, 1952. Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer
and their object is to benefit the family as a whole; these allowances belong to the
mother but may be paid either to the mother or the father.
At the beginning of 1955 some five million family allowances were being paid
to about three and a quarter million families in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland
over 100,000 families were receiving between them more than 210,000 allowances.
NATIONAL INSURANCE
The National Insurance Act, 1946, came into full operation on the 5th July 1948.
It has been amended by the National Insurance Acts, 1949 and 1951, the Family
Allowances and National Insurance Act, 1952, and the National Insurance Acts,
1953, 1954 and 1955. The Acts apply, in general, to everyone over school-leaving
age living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in Northern Ireland and the
Isle of Man.
Contributors are divided into three classes:
Class 1—Employed persons. Those who work for an employer under a contract of
service or are paid apprentices—about 211 million.
Class 2—Self-employed persons. Those in business on their own account and
others who are working for gain but do not work under the control of an
employer—about i -| million.
Class 3—Non-employed persons. All insured persons who are not in Class x or 2—
about half a million.
This general classification is subject to certain modifications, made by regulations,
to meet special circumstances. Married women engaged only in their own house¬
hold duties are, in general, provided for by their husbands’ insurance and cannot
become insured in their own right unless they were insured under the old scheme
on the 5th July 1948 and continued to pay contributions as non-employed persons,
or have since taken up paid work. Students undergoing full-time education and
unpaid apprentices need not pay contributions. Up to the age of 18, contributions
are credited to them. Over that age they may, if they wish, pay as non-employed
persons (Class 3). Self-employed and non-employed persons whose income is not
more than £156 a year can apply for exception from liability to pay contributions
under the scheme.
Contributions
The main weekly rates of contribution from June 1955 are shown in Table 39,
overleaf. These contributions, which the Exchequer supplements from general taxa¬
tion, are normally paid on a single contribution card by National Insurance stamps
bought from a post office. It is the employer’s responsibility in the first place to see
that the Class 1 contributions are paid, but he can deduct the employee’s share from
his or her wages. The self-employed and non-employed must stamp their own
cards. Contributions are usually credited for weeks of unemployment, sickness or
injury, or if widow’s benefit is being paid.
An insured person ceases to be liable for National Insurance contributions when
he retires, or is deemed to have retired, from employment. If such a person does

any work as an employed person thereafter, he must pay an-Industrial Injuries
contribution (sd. weekly for a man, 3d. for a woman) and his employer’s liability
remains the same as shown in Table 39.
Benefits
The scheme provides sickness, unemployment, maternity and widow’s benefit,
guardian’s allowance, retirement pension and death grant. Persons in Class 1 are
covered for all benefits; those in Class 2 for benefits other than unemployment and
industrial injuries benefits; and those in Class 3 for benefits other than sickness,
unemployment and industrial injuries benefits, and maternity allowance.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before any
benefit can be paid, a minimum number of contributions must actually have been
paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit cannot be paid
unless a certain number of contributions have been paid or credited over a specified
period. For guardian’s allowance and industrial injuries benefits there are no
contribution conditions.
Rates of benefit have been increased since the scheme began. The rates current
at the end of 1955 are set out below.
Sickness Benefit
The standard weekly rate of sickness benefit for a man or woman over 18
(except a married woman) is 40s., with an increase of 25s. for an adult dependant
and ns. 6d. a week for the first or only child under the family allowances’ age
limits (see p. 322), with 3s. 6d., in addition to any family allowance payable, for
each subsequent child. The weekly rate for a married woman is 25s., but she is paid
at the 40s. rate if she is maintaining an invalid husband or is separated from her
husband and cannot get financial support from him.
Unless 156 Class 1 or Class 2 contributions have been paid since the entry into
insurance, sickness benefit can be drawn only for a year, but in general it continues
for as long as sickness lasts, once 156 contributions have been paid.
Unemployment Benefit
The rates of unemployment benefit are the same as for sickness benefit except
that the standard rate for married women is 30s. instead of 25s.
SOCIAL WELFARE
325
Unemployment benefit is payable in the first place for 30 weeks, but it may
be continued for up to a maximum of 19 months in all, according to the person’s
record of contributions paid as against unemployment benefit drawn in recent years.
Maternity Benefit
The National Insurance Acts, 1953 and 1954, amended the maternity benefits
of the 1946 Act. A maternity grant of fio is payable for a confinement, provided
the required contribution conditions have been satisfied; and where more than one
child is born at any confinement additional grants may be payable. A home confine¬
ment grant of £4 is payable where the mother is not confined in free accommoda¬
tion under the National Health Service or in accommodation otherwise paid for
out of public funds. A maternity allowance of 40s. a week, beginning with the
eleventh week before the expected week of confinement, payable for 18 weeks, is
available for working women who satisfy the contribution conditions. These are
that during the year ending 13 weeks before the expected week of her confinement,
the claimant must have paid 26 contributions as an employed or self-employed per¬
son and, for the full rate of the allowance, have a total of at least 50 contributions
paid or credited. Increases of maternity allowance for dependants are payable in
certain circumstances at the same rates as increases of sickness benefit.
Widow's Benefit
There are three kinds of widow’s benefit, paid only on the deceased husband’s
insurance. A Widow’s Allowance of 55s. a week plus ns. 6d. a week for the
first or only child under the age limits (see p. 322) and 3s. 6d. a week for second
and subsequent children (in addition to family allowances) is paid for 13 weeks. A
Widowed Mother’s Allowance of 51s. 6d. a week is paid following widow’s allow¬
ance to a widow who has a child who qualifies under the age limits; she also receives
3s. 6d. a week, in addition to any family allowance, for each child after the first.
A Widow’s Pension of 40s. a week is paid to a widow (a) who is 50 or over at the
time of the husband’s death and has been married ten years, or (b) who is 40
or over when her widowed mother’s allowance ends, provided ten years have
elapsed since the marriage, or (c) who, when her widow’s allowance or widowed
mother’s allowance ends, is incapable of self-support because of infirmity and is
likely to remain so for a long time.
Guardian's Allowance
A Guardian’s Allowance of 18s. a week may be paid to a person who has in his
family a child whose parents (or step-parents) have died and one of whom was
insured under the National Insurance Acts. This continues while the child remains
in the guardian’s family and is a child within the meaning of the Family Allowances
Act.
Retirement Pension
Retirement pensions are paid to men at the age of 65, and to women at the age of
60, provided they have retired from regular employment. From the age of 70 (men)
and 65 (women), however, the pension is payable whether or not the claimant has
retired. The standard rate is 40s. a week. A married woman ordinarily qualifies
for pension on her husband’s insurance at the standard rate of 25s. a week. If
after retirement a pensioner below the age of 70 (65 for a woman) earns any money,
then, for every is. earned over £2 in any week, is. is deducted from the following
week’s pension.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
326
Men and women are encouraged not to retire at minimum pension age and are
able to earn a larger retirement pension by continuing in their jobs. For every six
months they stay at work between the ages of 65 and 70 (men) or 60 and 65 (women)
their pension is increased by is. 6d. a w^eek. The pension of the wife of such a
contributor is increased by is. a week for each six months’ extra work and continues
at this rate up to the time of the contributor’s death; if his wife survives him
her pension is re-calculated at the is. 6d. rate. A man now reaching the age of
65 who continues at work for a further five years can therefore receive a pension of
as much as 55s. on attaining the age of 70. If he has a wife not more than five
years younger than himself, their combined pensions can be 90s.; if the wife sur¬
vives her husband her pension can be 55s.
A retirement pensioner is entitled to an increase of 25 s. a week for his wife
if she is under 60 and also to an increase of ns. 6d. for the first child under the
family allowances’ age limits (see p. 322), and 3s. 6d. for each succeeding child, in
addition to any family allowance payable.
Death Grant
A Death Grant of up to £20 is paid towards the expenses in connection with the
death of an adult, and a smaller sum on the death of a child. Grants are not paid
for persons already over pension age on 5 th July 1948, or for children born before
5th July 1948 if they die before they are ten years old. Reduced grants are paid on
the deaths of people who on 5th July 1948 were over 55 (men) or over 50 (women).
NATIONAL INSURANCE (INDUSTRIAL INJURIES)
The Industrial Injuries Insurance scheme, which replaced the Workmen’s
Compensation scheme in July 1948, provides benefits for personal injuries caused
by accidents arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for prescribed
diseases due to the nature of employment. It covers practically everyone in Class 1
of the National Insurance scheme and certain others. The relevant Acts are the
National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts, 1946 to 1954.
Benefits
Injury Benejit
Injury Benefit for an adult is 67s. 6d. a week plus 25s. for an adult dependant
and ns. 6d. for the first or only child under the family allowances’ age limits (see
p. 322) and 3s. 6d. for each other eligible child, in addition to any family allowance
payable. It is paid when the insured person is incapable of work as a result of an
industrial accident or disease, and payment can continue for a maximum of 26
weeks from the date of the accident or development of the disease.
Disablement Benefit
Disablement Benefit may be paid when injury benefit stops and the amount
depends on the extent of the disablement, as assessed by a medical board. It varies
from 67s. 6d. for 100 per cent disablement to 13s. 6d. a week for 20 per cent
disablement. For disablement of less than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid,
ranging up to £225.
In the following circumstances Disablement Benefit may be increased:
1. It will be made up to the 100 per cent rate during in-patient treatment in a
hospital for the relevant injury or disease, and increases for dependants will
be paid.
SOCIAL WELFARE
327
2. If benefit is being received at the 100 per cent rate and someone is needed to
look after the insured person, a constant attendance allowance not exceed¬
ing 30s. a week (60s. in certain cases) may be paid.
3. If the insured person is permanently unfit for work an unemployability
supplement of 40s. a week may be paid, with allowances for dependants.
4. If the insured person is unfit to return to his former job, or work of a
similar standard, benefit may be increased (subject to a maximum of
67s. 6d.) by a special hardship allowance of up to 27s. 6d. a week.
Death Benefit
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, Death Benefit is
paid to the dependants. The amount varies according to the degree of relationship
and the extent of maintenance during lifetime.
A widow receives a pension of 55s. a week for the first 13 weeks. Thereafter
she gets a pension of 45 s. a week if she is over 50 or permanently incapable of self-
support or has the care of a child of the dead man. In other cases the pension is 20s.
a week. In addition, an allowance of 1 is. 6d. can be paid for the first or only child,
and 3s. 6d. for each other child under the family allowances’ age limits (see
p. 322).
Certain other dependants, such as parents, are entitled to pensions, allowances or
gratuities. The amounts vary with the closeness of the relationship and the extent
to which they were maintained by the deceased during his lifetime.
Adjudication
Claims for benefit under the National Insurance and National Insurance (Indus¬
trial Injuries) Acts are not decided by the Ministry but by independent authorities
appointed under the Acts.
NATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND CARE OF CHILDREN
The National Assistance Act, 1948, also came into operation on 5th July 1948. It
provides a unified State service of financial assistance for those in need, replacing
the various ‘needs’ services provided in the past by the State and local authorities.
As the residual service, National Assistance meets the financial needs of all those
people who are unable to maintain themselves and who fall outside the scope of the
other social security services, and supplements the insurance benefits when they
are insufficient.
The National Assistance Board is responsible for administering these weekly
cash grants. It has various other duties, including the administration of non¬
contributory pensions under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1936 (still payable on a
means and residence test to a diminishing number of persons over 70 who have not
qualified for pensions under the contributory scheme); the administration of
hostels provided under the Polish Resettlement Act, 1947and the assessment under
the Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, and the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland)
Act, 1949, of the maximum amount a person applying for legal aid may be called
upon to pay towards the cost of the action.1
The Board is responsible for influencing ‘ persons without a settled way of living ’
to lead a more settled life. It provides temporary accommodation for such persons,
usually through the agency of local authorities, and it runs a residential re-establish¬
ment centre for men of this type or men who have been long unemployed and in
receipt of National Assistance grants.
1 For further information on legal aid see pp. 80-81.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
328
The provision under the National Assistance Act of residential accommodation
for the aged, infirm and others, and of special welfare services for the blind, the
deaf, the crippled and other handicapped persons is not the responsibility of the
National Assistance Board but of county and county borough councils in England
and Wales and, in Scotland, of councils of counties and large burghs.
The Children Act, 1948, provides that all local authorities shall have special
children’s committees to be responsible for the care of all children deprived of a
normal home life, and in other ways makes improved provision for their care.
In Northern Ireland financial assistance is given under the provisions of the 1
National Assistance Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, to persons in need and there is
also a system of non-contributory pensions similar to that in operation in Great
Britain. Under the Welfare Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1949, local authorities,
in their capacity as welfare authorities, provide residential accommodation for the
aged, infirm and other persons who are in need of care and attention. The welfare
authorities also provide special services for the blind, deaf and other handicapped
persons and are responsible under the Children’s Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, for
the care of all children deprived of normal home life.
WAR PENSIONS AND RELATED SERVICES
Pensions to persons disabled or bereaved through the wars are paid under Royal
Warrants.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier is
67s. 6d. a week, but the amount varies according to the rank and degree of disable¬
ment. The latter is assessed by comparing the disabled person with a normal
healthy person of the same age and sex, without taking earning capacity into account. !
Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic pension and
there are supplementary allowances for unemployability, constant attendance,
additional comforts and lowered standard of occupation.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary payments are free of
income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any allowance payable
under the Family Allowances Acts.
War pensioners have priority (except over more urgent cases) for treatment of
their war disabilities in National Health Service hospitals.
Pensions are paid to war orphans and to war widows. The latter also receive
allowances for their children, and, in certain cases, an allowance for rent. Parents
or other relatives who were dependent on a person whose death resulted from the
wars may receive pensions if they are in pecuniary need.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance maintains a welfare service for
war pensioners, with a special branch for war orphans.
The British Legion and other voluntary associations also give financial aid and
personal service to disabled ex-servicemen and women and their families. The
Ministry and these bodies work in co-operation.
The Imperial War Graves Commission
The Commission was founded in 1917, its purpose being to commemorate the
war dead of the British Commonwealth and Empire by establishing war cemeteries,
ensuring the perpetual care of war graves, whether in these cemeteries or elsewhere, j
and erecting suitable memorials to those who have no known grave. A Charter of
1940 extended the Commission’s powers to enable it to deal with the dead of
the 1939-45 war. The members of the Commission include representatives of the
United Kingdom and Commonwealth Governments and of the three Services, and
SOCIAL WELFARE
329
a number of unofficial members chosen for distinction in various walks of life. The
cost of the Commission’s work is borne by the respective Governments in propor¬
tion to the numbers of the graves of their dead.
HEALTH
The concern of the State with public health is chiefly a development of the last
100 years. The second half of the nineteenth century saw the growth of compulsory
and comprehensive environmental health services, such as provision of pure water,
sewerage, disposal of refuse and cleaning of streets, and also building byelaws and
other measures designed to promote healthy living conditions in Britain. Local
authorities provided smallpox and other infectious-disease hospitals and poor law
infirmaries in the nineteenth century, but the major hospital and medical services
remained in the hands of voluntary hospitals and private practitioners until the
twentieth century, when the main development of publicly provided personal
health services, as distinct from environmental services, took place. The medical
benefit introduced under the National Insurance Act of 1911 was the first step in
the provision of a State-aided general practitioner service outside the Poor Law.
There was progressive development in the hospital services provided by local
authorities, and the period before the first world war is notable for the develop¬
ment of maternity and child welfare and of measures for the prevention and
treatment of tuberculosis.
Since the first world war there has been progress in many directions: medical
research, discovery of important new drugs, blood transfusion, control and treat¬
ment of venereal disease, and research into diet.
The second world war served to emphasize the importance of a sound diet and as
a result the Welfare Foods Service for expectant and nursing mothers and young
children was introduced (see p. 335) and the School Meals Service (see p. 343)
and industrial canteens were expanded. War also stimulated developments in
industrial health services (see pp. 275_6) and in the rehabilitation of the disabled
(see pp. 261 and 333).
THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
The National Health Service was established in 1948. The relevant Acts, the
National Health Service Act, 1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act,
1947, and the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, came into force
simultaneously on 5 th July 1948.
The National Health Service Act, 1946, aims ‘to promote the establishment in
England and Wales of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improve¬
ment in the physical and mental health of the people of England and Wales and the
prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness, and for that purpose to provide or
secure the effective provision of services’. The National Health Service (Amend¬
ment) Act, 1949, the National Health Service Act, i95I> and the National Health
Service Act, 1952, make some modifications in the scheme for Great Britain and
provide for charges to be made for certain parts of the Service, which is otherwise
free of charge, and which is available to all according to medical need. Its avail¬
ability is not dependent on contribution to National Insurance.
Health Service Administration in Great Britain
In England and Wales the Minister of Health has assumed direct responsibility
for (1) the provision on a national basis of all hospital and specialist services, (2) the
ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES
33°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SOCIAL WELFARE
331
former mental health functions of the Board of Control and local authorities, except
for the quasi-judicial functions of the Board designed to safeguard the liberty of
the patient,1 (3) the conduct of research work into any matters relating to the
prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness or mental defect, (4) a public health
laboratory service, and (5) a blood transfusion service. He has indirect responsi¬
bility for the establishment and maintenance of general practitioner services and all
other services. He is advised by the Central Health Services Council and by stand¬
ing advisory committees on various aspects of the Service.
The hospital and specialist services are administered through Regional Hospital
Boards and Hospital Management Committees or, in the case of teaching hospitals,
by Boards of Governors. The hospitals themselves have been grouped into admini¬
strative units; these consist sometimes of several formerly independent hospitals,
and sometimes of one. There are nearly 400 such groups under the control of
hospital management committees, which are in turn under the control of 14 regional
hospital boards. The regions are arranged so that the hospital and specialist services
can conveniently be associated with a university having a school of medicine.
The members of the hospital management committees are appointed by the
regional hospital board. The committees, by their constitution, reflect the com¬
munities concerned, for they usually include not only medical practitioners but
members of local authorities, trade unionists and others. The regional hospital
boards are appointed by the Minister and are similarly constituted. The term of
office is three years, one-third of the board or committee retiring each year but
being eligible for reappointment. The boards of governors of teaching hospitals are
appointed by the Minister, a proportion of the members being nominated by the
teaching faculty of the university, the regional hospital board and the medical staff.
All appointments to hospital management committees, regional hospital boards and
boards of governors are honorary.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the Minister. It is the
Minister’s responsibility to provide clinical facilities for the training of medical
students. The universities are responsible for the provision of teaching.
The administration of the General Medical, Dental, Pharmaceutical and Optical
Sendees (see p. 334) is in the hands of 138 Executive Councils, each covering the
area of a county or county borough. (In a few cases two areas are combined under
one council.) Each council has an Ophthalmic Services Committee responsible for
administering the Supplementary Ophthalmic Service. Doctors, dentists and
pharmacists are represented on the Executive Councils and each profession also
forms a local committee. Councils of counties and county boroughs are the 146 local
health authorities in charge of local health services (see pp. 334_7)>
In Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland is the responsible Minister; 31
county councils and 24 town councils of large burghs are the local health authori¬
ties; hospital and specialist services are administered by five Regional Hospital
Boards appointed by the Secretary of State, assisted by 84 Boards of Management
1 The functions of the Minister include the supervision of local authorities in the per-
formance of their duties with regard to persons of unsound mind (see p. 336), the general
supervision of matters relating to mental defectives, and the licensing or other formal
approval of accommodation for mentally ill or defective patients outside the National
Health Service. The Board of Control deals with the admission, discharge and periodic
review of mentally disordered or defective patients and inspects all institutions for their
care, whether in or outside the National Health Service.
In February 1954 a Royal Commission was set up to inquire into the existing law and
administrative machinery in England and Wales governing the certification and care,
other than hospital care or treatment under the National Health Service Acts, of persons
suffering from mental illness or defect.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
332
(the equivalent of hospital management committees in England); and there are 25
Executive Councils, each serving the area of one or more local health authorities.
The teaching hospitals in Scotland come under the control of the Regional Hospital
Boards, but special Medical Education Committees consider matters relating to
medical teaching. The Scottish Health Services Council and its Standing Advisory
Committees advise the Secretary of State and keep closely in touch with the Central
Health Services Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Service is described separately on pages 337-8-
Health Service Finance
About four-fifths of the cost of the National Health Service falls on the Exchequer.
The balance is met mainly by a transfer from the National Insurance Fund, pay¬
ments by persons using the Service and local rates. (Half the expenditure by local
health authorities is refunded to them by the central Health Departments.)
Since 1950 an attempt has been made to check the rising expenditure on the
National Health Service and to keep the net total cost to the Exchequer for the
Service in Great Britain from greatly exceeding £4°° million. To help to limit
expenditure without reducing the services offered, it was found necessary in 1951
and again in 1952 to introduce charges for certain items in the Service. There is
a charge of is. on each prescription form, and charges are also made for dentures
and spectacles (except children’s spectacles in standard frames), for elastic hosiery
supplied in the family doctor service or hospital out-patients department, for
certain appliances supplied to out-patients, for treatment in the dental service (but
not for examination only or for treatment given to persons under 21 or to nursing
or expectant mothers), and for some local health authority services. Certain
exemptions or refunds are made and anyone may apply to the National Assistance
Board for help in meeting any of these charges. Under the 1946 Act a limited
number of beds may be put aside for hospital patients wishing for privacy, provided
that this accommodation is not needed on medical grounds for non-paying patients.
Charges for these ‘ amenity ’ beds are fixed under Regulations. Provision is also made
at certain hospitals for patients who wish to occupy private patients accommoda¬
tion on payment of the whole cost of this accommodation and treatment. Such
patients may make private arrangements for treatment by a doctor of their own
choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried or part-time, part-time
medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept private
patients. General medical practitioners in public service are remunerated mainly
by capitation fees according to the number of persons on their lists.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed scale
of fees according to the items of treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists dis¬
pensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they
dispense. Doctors and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the Supplementary
Ophthalmic Service are paid on the basis of the number of sight tests made;
opticians who dispense glasses are paid according to the number of pairs of glasses
supplied.
Hospital and Specialist Services
The hospital and specialist services include the provision of consultants;
hospitals of all kinds including maternity accommodation, tuberculosis sanatoria,
mental hospitals and institutions for the mentally defective, infectious-disease units,
convalescent homes and rehabilitation centres; and all forms of specialized treat¬
ment.
SOCIAL WELFARE
333
At the end of 1954 there were in the Service in England and Wales 2,655 hospitals
(including teaching hospitals) with 481,673 available beds and a nursing and mid¬
wifery staff of 144,551 full-time and 30,363 part-time nurses. In Scotland there
were 400 hospitals with 62,400 beds, and 20,279 full-time and 3,849 part-time
nurses and midwives. A small number of hospitals remain outside the Service for
special reasons. Most of these are run by Religious Orders.
It is proposed to begin an expanded programme of new hospital building and
increased expenditure on capital improvements in existing hospitals in 1956.
Teaching Hospitals
The 26 London teaching hospitals are in fact groups of hospitals, and include 97
hospitals, convalescent homes, branches, annexes or treatment centres. The 10
teaching hospitals in Wales or in the provinces cover some 67 hospitals and other
establishments.
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation departments are established at the main hospital centres. The
work is carried out under the guidance of the appropriate medical specialist by
physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts, occupational therapists and social workers,
working as a team. The aim is to prevent undue disability and to restore fitness after
all forms of sickness and injury. Experience has shown that efficient medical
rehabilitation reduces the stay in hospital, the incidence of permanent disability
and the period of incapacity for full work. The departments work in close associa¬
tion with the Disablement Resettlement Service of the Ministry of Labour and
National Service (see pp. 260-62). Rehabilitation methods have been applied with
advantage in the care of the chronic sick and have enabled many patients to be dis¬
charged from hospital and to resume an independent life in their own homes.
Blood Transfusion
The National Blood Transfusion Service is administered by the regional hospital
boards under the National Health Service. Each of the regions is centred on a
university town, where an organization is maintained for collecting blood within
the region. The blood is kept in the Regional Blood Bank, or issued to Area Blood
Banks which are maintained at general hospitals in each county. Each of the
principal hospitals holds a supply of blood sufficient not only for its own needs but
also for the smaller hospitals, nursing homes and general practitioners in its district.
In Scotland, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Association organizes the
service on behalf of the Secretary of State. The blood is provided free by voluntary
donors recruited from the public. In 1954 the total of blood donations in Great
Britain was 793,202.
Medico-Social Work
There are over 1,000 trained almoners working in Britain; the majority work in
hospitals, others in local health authority services or elsewhere. The almoner
co-operates with the medical staff in the investigation and treatment of disease by
elucidating and adjusting social and economic factors which contribute to a
patient’s disability or impede his restoration to health. Psychiatric social workers
are specially trained for work in the mental health and education services. They are
an invaluable complement to doctors not only in mental and mental deficiency
hospitals but also in the local health and education services, in assessing the
environmental factors in mental abnormalities and in helping patients to make the
necessary adjustments to their environment.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The General Medical Services
The General Practitioner Services cover the medical attention given to individuals
by doctors and dentists of their own choice, from among those enrolled in the
Service. Doctors and dentists normally work at their own surgeries; in a few places
they practise in health centres established under the National Health Service Acts.
Nearly 24,000, or almost all, general practitioners (principals and assistants) in
Great Britain take some part in the Service.
Doctors previously in practice were entitled to join the Service at its start in the
place where they were practising. Those now wishing to start practice have to
apply through their Executive Councils to the central Medical Practices Com¬
mittee, so that a better distribution of doctors throughout the country may be
facilitated. The maximum number of patients’ names permitted to be on one
principal’s list is 3,500. The average number in England and Wales is about 2,200.
Of about 10,000 dentists in England and Wales available for general practice,
about 9,500 are in the Service, and in Scotland 1,155 dentists (practically all those
in general practice) are in the General Dental Service.
Over 900 ophthalmic medical practitioners and over 7,000 ophthalmic and
dispensing opticians in England and Wales, and 68 ophthalmic medical practi¬
tioners and 918 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in Scotland, are engaged in the
Supplementary Ophthalmic Service. This service provides for the testing of sight
and provision of glasses. Cases requiring treatment are dealt with through the
hospital eye service.
Almost all chemists (15,000 in England and Wales and 1,750 in Scotland) are
taking part in the Service.
Local Health Services
The Local Health Services administered by the county and county borough
councils (in Scotland, county and large burgh councils) include those for maternity
and child welfare (but not hospitals and maternity homes), domiciliary midwifery,
vaccination and immunization, health visiting, home nursing, the prevention of
illness and the care and after-care of the sick (including the mentally ill and also the
mentally defective), the provision of domestic help in time of sickness or confine¬
ment, etc., the ambulance service (in Scotland, the responsibility of the Secretary
of State), and the establishment and maintenance of local health centres (in Scot¬
land, the responsibility of the Secretary of State).
Welfare Centres
Maternity and child welfare centres have been established for many years. In
England and Wales there are about 5,500 child welfare, 2,000 ante-natal and 230
post-natal clinics. In Scotland there are 400 child welfare, 100 ante-natal and 70
post-natal clinics. These are part of the advisory and preventive services of the local
health authority and they provide regular supervision by nurses and doctors for
expectant and nursing mothers and young children. Special clinics for test feeding
and for remedial exercises may also be arranged at a number of centres and a feature
of the service is the education of the mothers by means of talks, demonstrations and
special classes, particularly in mothercraft. Some centres are also the distribution
points for the national dried milk and vitamin preparations provided for expectant
mothers and young children which are distributed by local health authorities (see
p. 335). In England and Wales about three out of four babies attend the centres.
Maternal Care
According to the advice given by the doctor or midwife and her own preference,
the expectant mother may arrange to have her baby at home or in hospital; in
SOCIAL WELFARE
335
allocating hospital beds priority is given to those for whom domiciliary confine¬
ment is inadvisable for medical or obstetric reasons or because of adverse home
conditions. For a home confinement every mother has available to her the services
of either a general practitioner obstetrician or her own family doctor if he is willing
to undertake her maternity care, besides those of a trained midwife employed in
the domiciliary service of the local health authority. The doctor carries out certain
ante-natal and post-natal examinations, attends at the confinement (if he thinks it
necessary) and gives any other medical care required. Routine supervision and
advice is provided by the midwife, who visits regularly before the confinement
for the purpose of examination and to give the mother advice and help. In addition,
the expectant mother may attend the ante-natal clinic for instruction in prepara¬
tion for motherhood and in some cases for interim ante-natal supervision. The
midwife delivers the patient (unless the doctor considers it necessary to be present)
and continues in attendance for the first 14 days after the birth. Midwives work in
close touch with the welfare centres in the care of the mother both before and after
the birth of the child.
Welfare Foods Service
Local health authorities distribute the welfare foods other than liquid milk that
the Welfare Foods Service1 provides for expectant and nursing mothers and young
children, at a low cost or free of charge. These foods are National Dried Milk as an
alternative to liquid milk* and at an equivalent price; orange juice, at sd. a six-fluid-
ounce bottle, and cod liver oil, free of charge, for expectant mothers and children
under five; vitamin A and D tablets, free of charge for expectant mothers as an
alternative to cod liver oil, and also for mothers for 30 weeks after confinement.
Milk and orange juice are supplied free to expectant mothers and to children under
school age if the families cannot afford to pay.
Other Maternity and Child Welfare Services
Many local health authorities make special arrangements for premature babies
remaining in their own homes, by lending equipment and appointing experienced
nursing staff to supervise their care.
There are some day nurseries for children under five in Great Britain provided
by local health authorities or voluntary associations working with them. The
National Health Service Act, 1952, gave local authorities power to make charges
for the use of day nurseries. Private or factory nurseries must be registered with the
local health authorities; this regulation applies also to persons who mind for pay¬
ment more than two children, not all of the same family.
Local authorities co-operate with voluntary denominational and other bodies
caring for unmarried mothers and their babies, or make direct provision for their
special needs through welfare workers, homes, hostels and nurseries, and by finding
suitable foster-mothers.
Health Visiting
Health visitors, who are qualified nurses with special additional training, give
expert advice to mothers in their own homes on such matters as breast feeding, the
1 The Service began in 1940 with the National Milk Scheme and in 1946 the extended
scheme was put on a permanent basis as the Welfare Foods Service. Beneficiaries now
obtain the necessary coupons from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance.
* The liquid milk allowance (which is obtained through usual retail channels) is one
pint a day at i£d. a pint for expectant mothers, children under five, and children between
five and sixteen who are physically or mentally disabled and are unable to attend school
where they would receive milk.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
336
general care of the baby, and the nurture of children up to five years old. They are
also responsible for giving advice on the care of the sick and the measures necessary
to prevent the spread of infection. They, together with special tuberculosis visitors,
have a particular interest in tuberculosis. They are also employed in the School
Health Service.
Home Nursing
The employment of nurses for attending persons who require nursing in their
own homes is the responsibility of the local health authorities. Although many
authorities employ nurses directly for this purpose, others have entered into
arrangements with voluntary organizations to provide a service on their behalf.
Domestic Help
Local health authorities have the power to make arrangements for providing
domestic help in households where it is needed owing to illness, confinement, or
the presence of children, old people or mental defectives. This is not one of the
free services and authorities are authorized to recover from those assisted such
charges as the authorities consider reasonable, having regard to the person’s means.
Ambulance Services
Free conveyance between home and hospital or clinic is provided, where neces¬
sary, either directly by local health authorities or, on their behalf, by voluntary
organizations. The Hospital Car Service (organized by the St. John Ambulance
Brigade, the British Red Cross Society, and the Women’s Voluntary Services)
provides transport in many areas for patients who do not require an ambulance;
such patients are conveyed in private cars whose owners volunteer to give this
service, and the authorities make a mileage payment to the volunteers to cover their
expenses. In Scotland, ambulances are run by the Scottish Ambulance Service (St.
Andrew’s Ambulance Association and the Scottish Branch of the British Red Cross
Society) on behalf of the Secretary of State.
Mental Health Services
Persons who are suffering from mental illness can consult the family doctor and
receive specialist advice at hospital out-patient clinics in the ordinary way. If they
need to enter a mental hospital they can do so as voluntary patients with little
formality. If need be, they may be admitted under Order as temporary or certified
patients. If patients, or their relatives, are unable or unwilling to make the neces¬
sary arrangements for admission to a mental hospital, it is the duty of a duly
authorized officer of the local health authority to do so. The local health authority
is expected to offer a welfare service to such patients, whether before admission or
to help their rehabilitation on discharge.
Local health authorities have a duty to ascertain mental defectives in the com¬
munity, to supervise them and to provide, where practicable, suitable training or
occupation. This is given in occupation centres where the defectives attend daily,
as at school, or by home teaching. If supervision affords insufficient protection it
is the duty of officers of the local health authority to take the initial steps to place
such defectives under guardianship within the community or to arrange for their
admission to a mental deficiency hospital.
Control of Infectious Disease
Control of infectious disease is based on four main principles: notification,
isolation, supervision of contacts and, for some diseases, immunization. The
SOCIAL WELFARE
337
investigation of outbreaks of infectious disease is the concern of local Medical
Officers of Health and of the Public Health Laboratory Service associated with the
Medical Research Council (see pp. 376-7)*
There are arrangements to deal with certain conditions and diseases which
require specialized treatment both to alleviate the sufferings of the patients and to
protect the community as a whole, such as the provision of treatment centres for
venereal disease and the provision of sanatoria and chest clinics for the specialist
treatment of tuberculosis. The prevention of tuberculosis, and of infectious
diseases generally, is also a matter of active concern. The public is offered free
examination by mass miniature radiography for the early detection of chest disease;
at the end of 1954, 69 mass radiography units were operating in England and Wales
and 9 in Scotland.
Vaccination and Immunization
Arrangements are made by local health authorities for a service providing free
vaccination against smallpox, and immunization against diphtheria. Parents cannot
be compelled to make use of this service but they are given every encouragement to
do so; and the success of the diphtheria immunization campaign is a very hopeful
sign. In 1954 there were only 9 deaths from diphtheria in England and Wales as
against 2,641 in 1941; in Scotland, only 2 deaths as against 517 in 1941. Besides
freely available vaccination against smallpox and immunization against diphtheria,
BCG vaccination against tuberculosis is available in some areas to certain school-
children and certain persons specially exposed to risk.
Health Centres
A few health centres have already been established, differing widely in size and
character according to local need. Experience shows that they are likely to be most
successful in areas of housing development where new services are needed. The
need to observe the working of the largely experimental centres already provided
and to conserve scarce resources is likely to prevent any general expansion of the
service in the near future. In Scotland, where the provision of health centres is the
direct responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, two have been built.
HEALTH SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
In Northern Ireland the historical development of the health services has taken
broadly the same course as in other parts of the United Kingdom and the Health
Service established under the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948>
corresponds fairly closely to the medical care system established under the National
Health Service in Great Britain. The essential principle is that the same range of
services shall be available to citizens in Northern Ireland as in England, Wales and
Scotland. The Service in Northern Ireland is financed as in the rest of the United
Kingdom.
In hospital administration the role of the central Government is not quite so
immediate or direct as in Great Britain, and hospital property, for example, is vested
not in the Minister of Health and Local Government but in the Northern Ireland
Hospitals Authority. The Hospitals Authority has under its control 62 hospitals
and three special case institutions containing in all about 14,500 beds.
The Tuberculosis Service is on a separate footing from the main Hospital
Service, having been established a little earlier to deal urgently with a serious
tuberculosis problem. The Northern Ireland Tuberculosis Authority, which was
constituted for the prevention of tuberculosis and the care of tuberculous patients
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
338
by the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act (Northern Ireland), 1946, has eight
hospitals under its control.
Vaccination against smallpox is compulsory in Northern Ireland but otherwise
the range of preventive and domiciliary services is similar to that existing in Great
Britain.
THE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND ALLIED PROFESSIONS
Only persons whose names are on the medical register can practise as doctors
under the National Health Service. Apart from medical practitioners, only persons
whose names are on the dentists’ register can practise dentistry in Britain. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’
training in medical school and hospital, plus one year as an intern; for a dentist,
four or more years at a dental school are required.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for State registra¬
tion as a general trained nurse is three years. Training is available also in sick
children’s, mental, and mental deficiency nursing. The enrolled assistant nurse
undergoes an essentially practical training for one year, followed by a year’s work
under supervision before enrolment.
Only registered pharmacists may describe themselves as such, and qualifications
requiring four to five years’ vocational training are necessary for registration.
For the professions of almoner, chiropodist, dietitian, medical laboratory techni¬
cian, occupational therapist, psychiatric social worker, physiotherapist, radiographer
and speech therapist a good general education is required followed by a professional
training. The length and nature of the training varies according to the profession.
VOLUNTARY AID FOR THE SICK AND HANDICAPPED
A number of voluntary organizations provide services of various kinds for sick
and handicapped persons in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the services
provided by central and local authorities. A number of convalescent homes, for
instance, of a type outside the scope of the hospital service, are administered by such
bodies. In many areas invalid children and others needing care in their own homes
are visited and helped by voluntary organizations. Special organizations also serve
the welfare of the blind, the deaf and other special groups. Though the need for
material aid from private sources becomes less as public provision extends, many
forms of help to meet individual needs that would not otherwise be met are
given by voluntary agencies. Their most valuable service is probably to provide
personal service and the continued personal interest that can contribute so much
to the welfare of the sick and infirm. These voluntary agencies usually depend
largely on the work, part-time or full-time, of unpaid volunteers.
EDUCATION
There are over seven million children and young people in full-time attendance
at schools or universities in the United Kingdom. Over 90 per cent of school
children attend publicly provided or aided schools. The universities are indepen¬
dent, self-governing institutions but they derive an increasing proportion (now
over two-thirds) of their funds from public sources. Many schools and colleges
continue to benefit from the endowments provided by benefactors in past centuries.
In England and Wales, the main development of publicly provided primary
education dates from 1870, and that of secondary education from the beginning of
SOCIAL WELFARE
339
the present century. In 1833 the Government had begun to make annual grants to
the voluntary societies which were providing schools, and the Elementary Educa¬
tion Act of 1870 accepted the principle of compulsory education. By the end of the
nineteenth century elementary education had become virtually both compulsory
and free. Public provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales) started
in England under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public
education in England and Wales. It seeks to widen and improve educational oppor¬
tunities at every stage.
The Scottish and Northern Ireland educational systems have each a long history
independent of that of education in England, but the same general policy is now
being implemented throughout the United Kingdom, with some national variations
in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Educational Administration
The national system provides education in three stages: primary, secondary, and
(for those who have left school) further education. Local authorities are responsible
for ensuring that adequate facilities are available in their areas throughout these
stages.
Administration is divided between the central Government Departments (the
Ministry of Education for England and Wales, the Scottish Education Department,
and the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland), local education authorities,
and various voluntary organizations. The relation between these three groups is
based on consultation and co-operation, both by direct contact between the parties
and through Her Majesty’s Inspectors who act as liaison officers, particularly
between local education authorities and the Departments.
All schools, including independent schools, are subject to official inspection.
SCHOOLS
School attendance is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 15 in Great Britain
(temporarily 14 in Northern Ireland). In England and Wales over 6,445,000
children, including about 172,000 under and 232,000 over compulsory school age,
are attending publicly maintained schools, besides 100,000 others (including 1,600
under and 28,000 over school age) who are at schools receiving direct grants from
the Ministry of Education. There are also about half a million children of all ages
at independent schools. In Scotland, 830,000 children are attending publicly main¬
tained or aided schools and about 21,000 are at independent schools. In Northern
Ireland, 252,000 children (including 17,000 under and 20,000 over compulsory
school age) are attending publicly maintained or aided schools; independent schools
are few.
In England it is usual for boys and girls to be taught together in primary schools,
but more often than not they attend separate secondary schools. Mixed schools are
more common in Wales; and in Scotland all but a few city schools take both boys
and girls. In Northern Ireland there are a number of separate schools for boys and
girls, especially among schools under voluntary management, except for the
smallest primary schools.
The majority of independent schools are for boys or for girls only, except
in classes for small children. There are, however, a few schools which are
co-educational.
In England and Wales three broad types of school are supported from public
funds: county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained by local
education authorities, i.e. their full cost falls on public funds; voluntary schools
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
34°
which have been provided by a voluntary body (usually of a religious denomination)
but which are maintained by local education authorities; and direct grant schools
which are completely independent of local education authorities but receive a
grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Education. These last (the smallest group) mostly
provide education of the grammar school type; they include some schools of ancient
foundation.
In Scotland most of the schools supported from public funds are provided by
education authorities and are known as public schools (in England this term is used
for a type of independent school of which there are also a few in Scotland and
Northern Ireland). There are also a few grant-aided schools (some of ancient
foundation) conducted by voluntary managers which receive grants direct from the
Scottish Education Department.
In Northern Ireland there are county schools, managed by local education
authorities, and voluntary schools, which are grant-aided schools under voluntary
management.
Primary Schools
A child’s primary education continues until about the age of n in England, |
Wales and Northern Ireland and 12 in Scotland. There are some nursery schools
and classes for children between 2 and 5 years old. In England and Wales there are
infant schools, or departments, for all children between 5 and 7 and junior schools
for those aged 7 to 11. In Scotland there are primary departments for children i
between 5 and 12 years old.
Secondary Schools
Public provision of secondary education is being greatly extended with the aim
of providing for all children an education suited to their particular abilities.
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
In England and Wales the grammar school takes children who hope to reach a
university and others likely to profit from an academic type of education. A large 1
proportion of university students are recruited from these schools. Secondary
modern schools form the largest group of secondary schools. They give a general
education with a practical bias, closely related to the interests and environment of
their pupils. The secondary technical schools are the smallest group and offer an
education largely related to industry, including commerce, or agriculture. Each
local education authority decides how the selection shall be made for its schools. The
kind of secondary education a child is given usually depends on the results of a test
taken as a rule at the age of 11. In some areas it is possible for children who are
recommended by their head teacher to take it at the age of 10. Two of these types of
education may be given in one school—a bilateral school; some authorities are
experimenting with comprehensive schools providing all types of secondary education.
In Northern Ireland the secondary intermediate school is the equivalent of the
secondary modem school in England and Wales. Technical intermediate schools in
Northern Ireland offer the same facilities as secondary technical schools in England
and Wales.
Most grammar school pupils remain until they are 16 years old, some till they
are 17, 18 or 19. Most secondary modern pupils at present leave at the age of 15,
but the number staying on until the age of 16 is increasing.
Scotland
Scottish secondary schools fall into two main categories, those providing courses
extending normally to three years, generally called junior secondary schools, and
SOCIAL WELFARE
341
those providing courses of five or six years, known as senior secondary schools. In
each type of school the courses are intended to provide a general education, but
they are differentiated in character to suit the varying needs and abilities of the
pupils, and include literary, commercial, boys’ technical, domestic and rural courses.
While some schools are purely junior secondary and some purely senior secondary,
there are also a number of schools of the ‘ comprehensive ’ type in which all kinds of
courses, both junior secondary and senior secondary, are provided. Many schools
also provide modified courses for pupils of limited ability for whom the normal
courses are too exacting.
Promotion from the primary to the secondary school takes place usually between
the ages of 11J and 12J. The fitness of pupils to profit from the various types of
secondary course is assessed on the basis of teachers’ estimates of attainment,
intelligence tests, and attainment tests, with due regard to the wishes of the parents.
There is provision for an appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland in the event
of a dispute between the education authority and the parent and also for the
reconsideration of original allocations where transfer to another course sub¬
sequently appears to be necessary.
Independent Schools
The largest and most important of the independent schools are known in
England as ‘public’ schools, although not all schools classed as public schools are
independent (those which are not are mostly direct-grant schools) and public
schools form only a minority of all independent schools.
The public school is a characteristic English institution which has made a notable
contribution to English education. Many public schools date from the sixteenth
century, some are older (e.g., Winchester, 1382, and Eton, 1440), and many have
some income from endowments. All are controlled by their own Boards of
Governors. Public schools have emphasized the importance of character-building,
and in these schools were developed the prefect system, whereby day-to-day
discipline is largely controlled by the pupils themselves, and the house system,
whereby a school is divided into groups of about 50, each under the care of a house¬
master. The public school is also characterized by a high staffing ratio and a high
proportion of pupils doing advanced work. A public school is often, although not
necessarily, a boarding school. The usual age of entry to the independent public
schools for boys is 13 and the leaving age about 18. There are some girls’ public
schools modelled to a certain extent on the public schools for boys.
There are also preparatory schools, most of them boarding schools, for boys aged
from about 8 to 13 years of age (and some similar schools for girls) who are intend¬
ing to enter public schools, and a wide range of other day and boarding schools
covering every age group and grade of education and every variety of educational
method. Some of these schools are owned and managed, often under a trust deed,
by independent non-profit-making bodies. Others are privately owned by pro¬
prietors for whom the running of the school provides a living.
Secondary School Examinations
In 1951 the General Certificate of Education superseded the former School
Certificate and Higher Certificate examinations in the secondary schools (State-
aided and independent alike) of England and Wales. This examination, which may
also be taken by candidates not attending school, is conducted at three levels
(ordinary, advanced and scholarship). Most candidates are at least 16 years old on
1st September of the year of their examination, but a child can sit at an earlier age
342
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
at the discretion of the headmaster or headmistress of the school. In the summer of
1954 some 20,000 children under the age of 16 took the examination.
In Scotland the courses in senior secondary schools lead to presentation for the
Scottish Leaving Certificate at about the age of 17, although many pupils who are
under 17 take the examination. The certificate, which can be taken only by pupils
in attendance at Scottish schools, is awarded on examinations conducted by the
Scottish Education Department.
In Northern Ireland the Junior Certificate Examination is taken at about the age
of 15 and the Senior Certificate Examination, which is conducted at two levels, at
about 17 years of age.
Teachers
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing bodies
or managers. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland they are not subject to
official control on questions relating to curricula or methods. In Scotland, schemes
of work in primary and secondary departments are subject to the approval of one
of Her Majesty’s Inspectors, and no pupil may be presented for the Scottish Leaving
Certificate examination unless he has followed a course approved by the Scottish
Education Department.
In 1954 there was one full-time teacher to 27 pupils in publicly maintained
primary and secondary schools in England and Wales; the figure was 24 for
Scotland and 30 for Northern Ireland. The high birth rate at the end of the second
world war is the chief of several factors in the present need for more teachers.
There are 154 teachers’ training colleges in England and Wales. The usual train¬
ing course lasts for two years but there are three-year courses for women taking
housecraft or physical education. There are 23 university departments of education
providing a one-year course for graduates. In Scotland there are four general
training centres, two denominational training colleges and a college for women
teachers of physical education. Courses are normally of one year’s duration for
graduates or the equivalent, and of three years for non-graduates. Northern Ireland
has two general teacher training colleges, one university training department and
three specialist colleges—one for training teachers of physical education, one for
teachers of domestic science and one for teachers of art. The basic course in the
general training colleges lasts three years.
The Education Departments, the universities, local education authorities and
other bodies provide a variety of short courses for practising teachers. Teachers
from schools in the United Kingdom go to a number of oversea countries each year
under interchange schemes or schemes for temporary oversea posts.
Broadcasting and Visual Aids
The School Broadcasting Department of the British Broadcasting Corporation
sends out over 50 transmissions a week which reach more than 27,000 schools in
the United Kingdom, over 70 per cent of the possible total. School broadcasting
does not attempt to cover the whole school curriculum, or to replace the teacher,
but to supplement existing work in the schools (see also p. 405).
Visual aids to education—films, film strips, wall charts, pictures, and models—
are being increasingly used in Britain’s schools.
Religion in Schools
All children in county or voluntary schools, that is, all schools wholly or partly
financed by local authorities, receive religious instruction and take part in a daily
corporate act of worship unless their parents object. In all kinds of voluntary schools

333). At King’s College
lospital, London, a kitchen

artment. Here a mixing tap
lat has lever handles and a
winging pipe makes it pos-
ible to fill saucepans without
olding them over the sink.
Industrial rehabilitation (see
p. 261). In the Industrial Re¬
habilitation Centre at Vauxhall
Motors Ltd., Luton, surgeon and
engineer co-operate to secure
an early return to work and full
recovery. Here an employee is

SOCIAL WELFARE
343
there is opportunity for denominational religious instruction and in the county
school religious instruction of an undenominational Christian character is given.
Such undenominational instruction is also usually given in one kind of voluntary
school—the controlled school.1 Over a third of the schools maintained by local
education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary schools and the majority
of these are Church of England primary schools. There are nearly 2,000 Roman
Catholic voluntary schools and smaller numbers belonging to other religious bodies.
In county schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access to give denomi¬
national instruction to children of their persuasion for a limited period each week.
In Scotland, subject to safeguards for the individual conscience, matters relating to
religious instruction are in the hands of the school managers, but there are a number
of denominational schools conducted by education authorities.
Services in the school chapel and religious teaching are an essential part of the
life and education of the independent public schools and most of these schools are
linked to some religious denomination.
Health and Welfare of School Children
Physical education forms part of the general curriculum in all schools.
The School Health Service provides regular medical examination and certain
free treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local education
authorities. Treatment provision includes dental clinics and child guidance centres.
(There are also child guidance clinics in the National Health Service.) In Northern
Ireland the School Health Service is operated by the health authorities.
Milk (one-third of a pint a day in Great Britain and two-thirds in Northern
Ireland) is given free to all children in schools who wish to have it, and the School
Meals Service provides a daily dinner at a subsidized price (remitted where there
is need) to nearly half the pupils in county and voluntary schools. Free transport is
provided for children attending these schools who live more than a reasonable
walking distance from their schools, defined as two miles for those under eight years
(11 in Northern Ireland) and three miles for those over eight years.
Special educational treatment, either in special schools or otherwise, is provided
for children between the ages of 5 (or less) and 16 who require it on account of any
physical or mental handicap, including maladjustment. There are over 700 special
schools in the United Kingdom, including hospital schools, day and boarding
schools, and boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary schools.
School Building
An extensive building programme for education has been undertaken in Britain
since the end of the second world war. Progress has been held in check by limited
resources, but schools, together with factories and houses, have been given priority
over the claims of less essential forms of building.
Although 2,704 new post-war schools had been completed in England, Wales
and Scotland by June 1955, and 1,052 more were under construction, much
remains to be done. Many war-damaged schools have had to be repaired or rebuilt.
Entirely new schools, both primary and secondary, are needed to provide for the
increased number of school children and their longer school life, and for the many
post-war housing estates and for the new towns; new buildings are also needed to
replace or improve those that are out of date and ill-equipped by modem standards.
1 The majority of voluntary schools are either ‘ aided ’ or ‘ controlled ’ schools. The aided
school has more independence than the controlled school but it has financial obligations
for part of its maintenance, whereas the controlled school has none.

Advantage is being taken of this opportunity to raise standards in public educa¬
tional building and to introduce new ideas and methods in the design and construc¬
tion of schools. Education authorities are using both traditional and new methods
of building. Post-war school buildings are light and airy, with an imaginative use
of colour and generous provision of practical rooms and space for outdoor games.
Local education authorities are responsible for providing the schools and other
buildings needed for public education in their areas, but the central Departments
exercise control by approving annual building programmes, framing regulations,
fixing cost limits and approving or rejecting the authorities’ plans; they also offer
guidance to authorities in the form of building bulletins and in other ways.
UNIVERSITIES
In 1954 there were over 83,000 full-time students at universities or university
colleges in the United Kingdom, of whom some 8,000 came from overseas. In
Great Britain in October 1954 the number was 80,700; in 1938-39 it had been
about 50,000, and it increased from under 38,000 to over 85,000 in the first five
years after the war. Nearly three out of four students are now being aided from
public funds or from scholastic endowments (see pp. 346-7).
The Education Departments have no jurisdiction over the universities, and their
relations with them are concerned mainly with the training of school teachers, the
provision of adult education, and the award of scholarships from public funds. The
universities, though self-governing institutions, receive aid from the State in the
form of direct grants from the Treasury made on the advice of the University
Grants Committee, a committee appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer from
persons with experience of university administration and education.
There are 16 degree-giving, self-governing universities in England and Wales:
Oxford, Cambridge, London, Birmingham, Bristol, Durham, Exeter, Hull, Leeds,
Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Reading, Sheffield, Southampton and Wales;
and two university colleges of lesser status. Oxford and Cambridge Universities,
each with a number of colleges, are very old foundations, dating from the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, and are residential. Most of the other universities, three
of which—London, Durham and Wales—also comprise groups of largely autono¬
mous colleges, are mainly non-residential, though nearly all maintain some halls
of residence. The tutorial system of individual tuition to supplement the lecture
system is a traditional and valued feature of Oxford and Cambridge Universities,
and is now being developed in the other universities and colleges of Britain.
There are four Scottish universities, all dating from the fifteenth or sixteenth
century: St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Northern Ireland has
the Queen’s University of Belfast which includes Magee University College,
Londonderry.
Degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though in medicine
five or six years are required. All the universities provide for post-graduate work
and research. Courses in arts and science, pure and applied, are offered by all
universities. Further reference to technology in the universities is made below and
on pp. S?0-?1-
FURTHER EDUCATION
Outside the universities there is a great variety of further education, full-time and
part-time, for men and women, and for boys and girls who have left school. Local
education authorities are required to secure such provision, either directly or by
SOCIAL WELFARE
345
aiding voluntary bodies and institutions. Vocational and non-vocational courses at
all levels and in all subjects are available in technical, commercial and art colleges,1
in evening institutes and in adult education classes. Increasing numbers of young
persons are being released by their employers during working hours for part-time
education, both vocational and general
Evening classes for adults, in addition to the extra-mural courses provided by
the universities, are organized by local education authorities and also by voluntary
bodies, notably the Workers’ Educational Association, and are aided by Govern¬
ment grants. There are six residential colleges directly aided by the Education
Departments which provide one-year non-vocational courses for adult students,
and since the end of the war more than 20 residential colleges have been established
where adult students can take short courses lasting from a few days to a few weeks.
The latter are either maintained or aided by local education authorities.
Technical and Technological Education
Technical education is related closely to the needs of the individual industry
and of the individual student. In the technical colleges most of the students are
taking part-time national courses while serving an industrial apprenticeship (see
below).
Voluntary attendance at part-time courses, mainly of evening classes, is at present
the most common form of vocational education. In recent years, however, many
more employers than formerly have adopted the practice of allowing young workers
paid leave of absence to attend technical colleges during working hours.
Technical colleges offer workers in industry training as technicians or as crafts¬
men, and some provide technological education of university standard. Part-time
National Certificate courses are organized by the Education Departments and pro¬
fessional institutions, such as the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, in conjunc¬
tion with the technical colleges. These courses normally last three years and students
usually follow them between the ages of 16 and 19, giving about 200 hours a year
to the course. A Higher Certificate takes a further two years’ work. National
Colleges have been established for a few relatively small and highly specialized
industries.
Higher technical or technological education is provided, in close co-operation
with industry, in both the universities and the technical colleges of Britain. Facilities
for technological education have been greatly expanded since the second world war,
and the Government is promoting further development by the planned expansion
of institutions of university rank in London, Glasgow, Manchester, Leeds and
Birmingham (see pp. 370-71). The Government also intends to develop ultimately
30 of the technical colleges run by local education authorities into advanced regional
colleges, and at some colleges advanced courses, which have been specially approved,
are being grant-aided by the Ministry at the rate of 75 per cent as against the normal
60 per cent.
In England and Wales there are some 300 technical colleges (other than art
colleges) that provide for full-time students, and some 250 others that take part-
time students only. About 150 of the technical colleges provide instruction in one
or more technologies at an advanced level, that is of Higher National Certificate
standard.
Scotland has a system of Central Institutions for higher technical education.
These institutions provide courses in a wide range of technologies; particular
attention is given to those connected with the main industries in their regions. The
1 For further information on art colleges see p. 389.
346 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
courses are linked with the more elementary training provided in the further educa¬
tion centres conducted by education authorities. There are close ties between the
central institutions and the universities, and the institutions also award their own
associateships or diplomas of a standard comparable with that of a university
degree.
In Northern Ireland the system is similar to that in England and Wales and
includes courses leading to National Certificates. The Ministry of Education
awards Junior and Senior Trade Scholarships to apprentices, to enable them to
follow full-time courses of study at the Belfast College of Technology. The junior
course lasts five months and the senior course eight months.
FINANCE
The bulk of expenditure on education in the United Kingdom comes from
public funds. It is estimated for 1955-56 that total public expenditure on education,
which is increasing, will be about £500 million for Great Britain. This includes
expenditure on university education. Northern Ireland Exchequer expenditure on
education is estimated at about £8f million for 1955-56. Of public expenditure on
education other than in the universities, about 60 per cent comes from taxes and
about 40 per cent from local rates. The proportion of university income provided
by the Exchequer is increasing and in 1953-54 was over 7° Per cent for Great
Britain. Another 4 per cent was contributed by local authorities, 12 per cent by fees,
and the balance by endowments and other sources.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending schools
maintained by local education authorities, and books and equipment are supplied
free. Local education authorities pay for free places in direct-grant schools and, to
a lesser extent, for free and assisted places in independent schools which normally
charge fees. A number of schools are able to offer some scholarships from endow¬
ments. In Scotland, education authorities may charge fees in certain schools pro¬
vided that this does not prejudice the provision of free education for all who desire
it. In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children attending any
county or voluntary primary, intermediate or special school; qualified pupils
attending both county and voluntary grammar schools receive scholarships from
the local education authorities which cover the whole or most of the fees charged
by the school.
Grants and Scholarships
England and Wales
Grammar schools receiving grants direct from the Ministry of Education still
charge fees but they are required to offer each year, to pupils who have at any time
previously attended a grant-aided primary school for not less than two years, free
places to the extent of not less than 25 per cent of the previous year’s admission to
the upper school; and a further 25 per cent of the places must be put at the disposal
of the local education authorities if they require them. Pupils occupying these latter
places need not previously have attended a grant-aided primary school. Day pupils
not holding free places are entitled to claim a remission of fees in accordance with
an approved income scale, and the Ministry pays the governors of the school the
amount of the fees so remitted.
Over recent years the number of scholarships and awards for university students
has been greatly increased with the aim of ensuring that no able candidate shall be
debarred from a university education by lack of means. Some 3,250 State scholar¬
ships for university honours degree courses were taken up by young students in 1954
SOCIAL WELFARE
347
besides 121 technical State scholarships and 25 mature scholarships for students
over 25 years of age. In 1954 local education authorities in England and Wales
awarded 10,779 university scholarships with maintenance grants. Numerous exhi¬
bitions and scholarships are also awarded from endowments by universities and
colleges and private benefactions. The Ministry supplements university open
scholarships and exhibitions as may be necessary.
Scotland
In Scotland the power of awarding bursaries and scholarships is confined in the
main to the education authorities, who in exercising this power are required to
comply with regulations made by the Secretary of State. There are no State
scholarships, but the Secretary of State supplements scholarships at English uni¬
versities won in open competition by Scottish students.
Northern Ireland
University scholarships in Northern Ireland are awarded either by the local
education authorities or from endowment funds. The Ministry of Education awards
State exhibitions. Supplementary awards are made by the local education authorities
and not, as in England and Wales, by the Ministry.
YOUTH SERVICES
The object of the youth services in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time
activities of young people and to offer them opportunities—complementary to
those of home, formal education and work—for discovering and developing their
personal resources, so that they may be better equipped to be responsible members
of a free and civilized society. There is no regimentation of young people; they are
free to join any of the youth organizations, or none, and the aim is that the facilities
for recreation, educational pursuits and social contacts offered should be sufficiently
varied to appeal to every type of boy and girl.
Responsibility for youth services is shared by the Education Departments, local
education authorities and numerous voluntary organizations. There is no attempt
to impose a system of uniformity or to create anything in the nature of a national
youth movement. Youth groups have been developed mainly by voluntary organi¬
zations. Some of them now receive State aid but all retain their independence of
action. The practice of democratic self-government has an established place in most
youth organizations and service to the community is encouraged. The major volun¬
tary youth organizations have memberships totalling over two million young people
under 21 years of age.
The earliest of the youth organizations were formed during the nineteenth
century and most of them, for example the Young Men's Christian Association, the
Young Women's Christian Association, the Girls' Friendly Society, the Boys' Brigade
and the Church Lads' Brigade, were religious in origin and purpose. Later organi¬
zations, such as the Boy Scouts' and Girl Guides' Associations, which, as movements,
have no definite affiliation to a religious body although local groups are often
attached to a church or chapel, also recognize the importance of spiritual values in
the formation of character and seek to inculcate high ideals of personal conduct and
of service to others.
Local education authorities have been indirectly concerned with youth services
since 1918, and in 1939 the then Board of Education decided to give active
encouragement to youth welfare. The Board urged local education authorities to
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
348
stimulate the provision of leisure activities for young people, both by co-operating
with voluntary agencies and by establishing Youth Centres and other recreational
facilities of their own. The status of youth services as an essential part of the edu¬
cational system, thus recognized in 1939, was confirmed by the Education Act of
1944 and the Education (Scotland) Act of 1945 and, today, all local education
authorities are required to ensure that adequate facilities for the recreational and
social needs of young people exist in their areas. In areas where voluntary youth
organizations are well established, local education authorities are expected to co¬
operate with them, and where existing services are inadequate, to make provision
themselves (usually in the form of Youth Centres). Most local education authorities
now employ full-time paid youth organizers and have appointed local youth
committees or councils, on which official and voluntary bodies are represented.
Education authorities also have powers to provide community centres for the use
of people of all ages. Such centres normally provide a mixture of formal and
informal further education. The centres are usually run by community associations,
some of which are affiliated to the National Federation of Community Associations.
Over twenty voluntary youth organizations, each with at least 10,000 members
between the ages of 14 and 20, belong to the Standing Conference of National
Voluntary Youth Organizations.1 There are also the youth organizations of the
political parties. In addition, there are a number of bodies which, though not
specifically youth organizations, cater for the welfare of young people by providing
them with opportunities for physical training, holidays, camping and travel.
Finance is provided by voluntary subscriptions from members and others, by
money-raising efforts by members, by grants from the great charitable trusts, by
contributions from local authorities’ rates and by direct grants from the Education
Departments. About £1 million from the King George VI Memorial Fund is being
spent by the King George VI Foundation on schemes for the benefit of young
people.
Some Youth Organizations
The following examples are selected to illustrate the variety and wide scope of
the services and activities provided by voluntary organizations in Britain concerned
with the welfare of young people in their leisure hours. Other groups include the
Catholic Young Men’s Society, the Methodist Association of Youth Clubs, and other
religious groups; the Co-operative Youth Movement; and the Welsh League of Youth.
In Scotland there are Scottish associations corresponding to several of the national
associations.
Scouts and Guides
The Boy Scouts’ Association and the Girl Guides’ Association, which were founded
by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 respectively, are based on the principle of
the development of character and good citizenship in boys and girls by training
them in habits of observation, self-reliance, self-discipline, loyalty and thoughtful¬
ness for others, and by promoting physical fitness and a knowledge of useful crafts.
Both associations have world-wide affiliations, and are undenominational and non¬
political in character.
1 The Standing Conference of National Voluntary Youth Organizations was founded in
1936 as a consultative body which takes action only in the name of its constituent members
and with their consent. Its member organizations have a common aim in the development
of character through educational and recreational interests, and the promotion of the
physical, mental and spiritual training of their members. The Scottish Standing Conference
of Voluntary Youth Organizations is the corresponding body in Scotland.
SOCIAL WELFARE
349
In I955 there were 230,000 Boy Scouts (aged 11 to 18 years) and Rovers (over
17^. years) in the United Kingdom. This total includes Sea Scouts and Air Scouts.
There were also 226,000 Wolf Cubs (aged 8 to 11 years).
At the end of 1954 there were 228,000 Girl Guides in the United Kingdom,
including Sea and Air Guides and also Cadets and Rangers (aged 16 to 21 years).
There were also 214,000 Brownies (aged 7 to 11 years).
Brigades
The Boys' Brigade, which was founded in 1883, is essentially a Protestant religious
organization. Every company must be affiliated to a church, and regular attendance
at church is a vital principle. Companies have regular drill parades, there are club
rooms for games and other pastimes, and organized camping during the summer
months is a feature of the movement.
The Church Lads' Brigade, which is a similar organization, is attached to the
Anglican Church. Companies are formed in parishes under the direct control of the
incumbent.
The Girls' Life Brigade is an inter-denominational uniformed organization for
girls. Each company is connected with a church or other religious organization.
National Associations of Clubs
The National Association of Boys' Clubs and the National Association of Mixed
Clubs and Girls' Clubs, which are non-sectarian, provide educative recreational
facilities for young people designed to develop their mental, physical and spiritual
well-being. Discussion groups, handicrafts, drama, music and many other activities
are encouraged.
Pre-Service Organizations
Pre-Service organizations, which comprise the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet
Force, the Combined Cadet Force and the Air Training Corps (see pp. 106, in and
114), have special connections with the respective Service Departments and receive
financial grants from them. The training of boys for entry into the armed forces,
provided by these organizations, is linked with training to promote their social,
educational and physical development. Similarly the Girls' Training Corps, the
Girls' Nautical Training Corps and the Women's Junior Air Corps prepare girls for
entry into the Women’s Services.
Young Farmers' Clubs
The National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs (see p. 161) instructs its
members in agricultural subjects and rural crafts, and each club has the support of
an advisory committee on which local farmers are represented.
Outward Bound Trust
The Outward Bound Trust maintains mountain schools at Eskdale and at
Ullswater, in the Lake District, and sea schools at Aberdovey, in North Wales, and
at Burghead, Morayshire, in Scotland. In these schools it provides four-week
character-building courses for boys from all walks of life but mainly for young
employees in industrial firms sent at their employers’ expense. The boys live as a
community and are given the opportunity to assess and develop their qualities of
courage, endurance, initiative and self-discipline in learning the techniques of
sailing or of rock-climbing, by various physical tests, and in expeditions over rough
hill country lasting several days. Similar, but modified, courses for girls are held at
Bisham Abbey, in Berkshire, and at mountain centres.

Youth Hostels
The Youth Hostels Association, which was founded in 1930, seeks to promote a
greater knowledge of, and love for, the countryside. It caters for young people of
limited means by providing hostels where they can stay for one or two shillings a
night when on walking or cycling tours or canoe trips. The movement has a
membership of over 180,000 and maintains 292 hostels in England and Wales.
There is a membership in Scotland of some 29,000 with 92 hostels, and of about
4,000 in Northern Ireland where there are 18 hostels. The Association is linked
closely with similar organizations in other countries and, through its International
Travel Bureau, encourages and facilitates the exchange of visits.
Political Party Youth Groups
Youth groups which are junior branches of the political parties in the United
Kingdom are maintained by each of the leading parties to spread knowledge of
party policy among young people, and to obtain party recruits. Members are
encouraged to form debating societies and to engage in other social activities, and
they are trained to take an active part in party politics. They receive no aid from
public funds.
Youth Sections
Youth Sections are maintained by several other adult voluntary organizations
which have a particular function; for example, the British Red Cross Society and
the St. John Ambulance Brigade train their young members in first aid and home¬
nursing. *
The Central Council of Physical Recreation
The Central Council of Physical Recreation, on which the leading voluntary
youth organizations are represented, is grant-aided by the Ministry of Education
and by the corresponding Department in Northern Ireland. It was founded in 1935
to improve the physical and mental health of the community through physical
recreation. The Central Council arranges training courses, provides instructors in
games and athletics, plans and judges athletic competitions and organizes demon¬
strations of sport and physical training. It also arranges training holidays for young
people in its three National Recreation Centres. The corresponding body in
Scotland is the Scottish Council of Physical Recreation.
The National Playing Fields Association
The National Playing Fields Association is a central organization, founded in
1925, with 54 affiliated county and city associations throughout England and Wales,
and branches covering Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Association encoura¬
ges the provision and preservation of public playing fields and playgrounds for
the present and future needs of all sections of the community and advises local
authorities and sports organizations on the acquisition, layout, construction and
use of grounds. It also keeps a watch on all matters relating to playing fields, endea¬
vours to stimulate recreational activity by grants, publications and persuasion,
carries out technical research and pioneers new ideas.
XI. HOUSING AND
PLANNING
PROBLEMS AND ADMINISTRATION
The problems of housing and of planning the use of land in Britain have their
origins mainly in the sevenfold expansion of the population in the last two and a
half centuries and its concentration in industrial urban areas. This gave rise to
overcrowding in the older houses in the centres of cities and to the unplanned
spread of outer suburbs. Overcrowding persisted in spite of a high rate of building
in the nineteen-thirties and was aggravated by the second world war which left
behind increased needs and new opportunities for housing and planning. New
building had virtually ceased for six years, while the United Kingdom population
had risen by nearly i£ million; meanwhile, approximately one house in every three
had been destroyed or damaged by enemy action.1
Ministerial Responsibility for Housing and Planning
The Minister of Housing and Local Government is responsible in England and
Wales for formulating housing policy, for housing standards and for general super¬
vision of the housing programme. In planning, the Minister is responsible for
implementing general policy regarding the use and development of land throughout
England and Wales, and for the direction and guidance of local planning authori¬
ties, the New Towns Development Corporations and the National Parks Com¬
mission in the carrying out of their planning functions.
In Scotland the same responsibilities fall on the Secretary of State for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland the Minister of Health and Local Government is responsible
for housing and planning.
The Ministry of Works acts as production authority in Great Britain for certain
building materials and equipment; it is responsible for general building efficiency
and for relations with the building industry, and it is primarily responsible for keep¬
ing building research under review. The Ministry of Labour and National Service
is concerned with the supply of labour to the building industry and its ancillary
trades; and the Building Apprenticeship and Training Council reviews the
industry’s long-term labour needs and the measures necessary to maintain the
skilled labour force. The Agricultural Departments are responsible for advising on
the agricultural value of land proposed for housing or other development. rl he
Board of Trade is responsible for regulating the distribution of industrial develop¬
ment. An Inter-Departmental Committee on Services’ Land Requirements meets
to harmonize Service and civilian needs and proposals for land use.
HOUSING
The census of April 1951 showed that 14-5 million private households in Great
Britain were occupying 13 "3 million houses and flats. These figures do not imply a
need for exactly 1 ‘2 million new dwellings, but they give an indication of the size
1 In 1941 a scheme of payment for damage by enemy action to land and buildings in the
United Kingdom was set up and the War Damage Commission was appointed to
administer it.
351
352 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the problem. Some sharing households do not want a structurally separate
dwelling, but there are other households which would gladly divide if separate
accommodation were available. In addition, many old houses are in danger of
becoming uninhabitable.
PROGRESS AND POLICY
In 1954 over 350,000 houses were built in Britain. By 30th June 1955, 2,235,651
new houses, permanent and temporary, had been built in Great Britain since early
1945, and 287,660 more were under construction. In all, over 2j million families
were rehoused in this period by new building, repair of uninhabitable houses and
conversion. Local authorities in England and Wales had built 1,354.674 of the total
number of new houses, and local authorities in Scotland, with the Scottish Special
Housing Association (see p. 353), had built 220,000.
In addition, in Northern Ireland some 56,000 houses were built between
January 1945 and the end of June 1955, including 21,000 permanent houses built
by local authorities and 14,000 by the Northern Ireland Housing Trust (see p. 353).
New Building
It has been the aim of post-war Governments to provide as many new houses as
the country’s building resources will allow. Since 1951 the Government’s target has
been to build at least 300,000 houses a year. Within this number a substantial
proportion are provided for letting and the remainder built for occupation by their
owners. Until November 1954 new building was controlled by licensing regulations,
but these had been relaxed over the course of the preceding two years to enable a
larger number of houses to be built by private enterprise. In November 1954
licensing was finally abolished. In the ten years since the end of the second world
war local authorities have concentrated mainly on providing houses for letting to
meet the general needs of their districts, i.e. to provide homes for families without
a house of their own, and to relieve overcrowding. In future local authorities are
likely to devote an increasing proportion of their new building to the rehousing of
families displaced by slum clearance.
Slum Clearance
Because of the need to concentrate on providing new houses for families without
a separate home of their own, slum clearance was virtually in abeyance for some
years after the end of the war, and the number of houses demolished was relatively
small. Early in 1954 local authorities were informed that, in view of the amount
of new housing provided since the war, it had now become an essential part of the
Government’s housing policy that the authorities should take up again, as a matter
of urgency, the campaign of slum clearance which the war interrupted. Each local
authority should determine the pace and phasing of a slum clearance programme,
having regard to the circumstances of its area, and should put such a programme
into operation as soon as possible.
In some areas the number of slum houses is so large that it would not be practic¬
able to replace all of them within five years or so. The Housing Repairs and Rents
Act, 1954, and the corresponding Scottish Act, therefore contain provisions which
empower local authorities to acquire, and to defer the demolition of, houses unfit j
for human habitation which are destined for clearance but which cannot be dealt
with for some time to come, because the local slum problem is so large. To make
conditions more tolerable for the occupants, local authorities are empowered to
patch these houses. It has been made clear that temporary retention and patching
HOUSING AND PLANNING
353
are to be the exception and not the rule—to be done only in the comparatively few
areas which have the largest problems—and that these houses are to be demolished
as early as possible; patching is not intended to prolong the life of the slums, or to
be an alternative to slum clearance. Exchequer contributions are available to meet
part of the cost of acquisition and patching.
HOUSING AUTHORITIES
While responsibility for housing policy and for the general execution of the
housing programme rests with the Minister of Housing and Local Government (in
Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland the Minister
of Health and Local Government), local authorities have executive responsibilities
as set out in the following paragraph for housing in their areas (including building
by Housing Associations, which are non-profit-making bodies providing houses
mostly for letting rather than for sale, and Self-Help Groups, which build in their
spare time for the benefit of members). In England and Wales and Northern Ire¬
land these authorities are the councils of county boroughs, boroughs (including
metropolitan boroughs), urban districts and rural districts, the London County
Council and the Common Council of the City of London. In Scotland all town and
county councils are housing authorities.
Housing Powers and Duties of Local Authorities
These authorities are responsible for ensuring as far as possible that housing
conditions in their areas are satisfactory. At present this responsibility principally
involves the provision by the local authorities themselves of houses for letting, by
new building or by the conversion of existing buildings. In England, Wales and
Scotland these local authority houses may also be sold on certain conditions, under
a general consent given by the Minister, to occupying tenants or to persons in need
of a house for themselves. In addition, local authorities must ensure that other
dwellings in their areas comply with certain standards of fitness, design, construction
and equipment.
Scottish Special Housing Association
The Scottish Special Housing Association, a statutory body, assists local authori¬
ties in their housing programmes. It has built about one in seven of the permanent
post-war houses completed in Scotland. The Association is financed entirely from
Government funds and is under the general direction of the Secretary of State for
Scotland.
Northern Ireland Housing Trust
The Northern Ireland Housing Trust, a statutory body, was established in 1945
for the purpose of erecting houses for letting to supplement the activities of local
authorities. The Trust has built about a quarter of Northern Ireland’s post-war
houses.
BUILDING METHODS AND STANDARDS
Much research has been and is being done on housing design, construction and
equipment. Components have been standardized and new methods and materials
have been evolved to ease the strain on skilled workers and traditional materials.
354
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Non-Traditional and Temporary Housing
To help to meet the immediate post-war need, the Government provided over
157,000 temporary factory-built houses for erection on sites provided by local
authorities in Great Britain. Within four years from April 1945 the programme had
been completed at a cost of £216 million for the houses and their erection. In
addition, 2,000 temporary houses were erected in Northern Ireland.
A number of new forms of construction for permanent houses were also developed
with practical encouragement from the Government during the experimental
period. Some types were steel-framed, some of pre-cast concrete, some concrete
poured in situ, and some timber-framed. A number of proved new systems have
been able to compete successfully with traditional house-building methods and
these have been making a considerable contribution to the housing programme.
Standards for Housing
Local authorities are now building better houses than before the second world
war. The central Departments have issued manuals of guidance for local authorities
setting standards of space, structure, design and equipment for different types of
houses, and describing how estates can be laid out attractively while saving land
and money, by the use of new and improved types of layout.
HOUSING FINANCE
Costs and Subsidies
The cost to a local authority of building the average three-bedroom traditional
house in England and Wales (with a superficial area of 1,050 square feet) was about
£1,450 for houses completed in October 1951, with another £240 for land, roads
and services and professional fees. Since 1951 new designs have been introduced to
achieve economies in space and to keep down the cost per house. The average
house completed in 1954 was about 915 square feet in area and cost about £1,385
to build.
To enable local authorities to let their houses at reasonable rents in spite of the
high cost of building, subsidies are provided under the Housing (Financial and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1946, and the Housing Act, 1952. Housing sub¬
sidies have existed since 1919, but since the second world war they have been on
a more generous scale than before. All subsidy rates are reviewed annually. On
1 st November 1955 a Bill was introduced to reduce, and to provide for the eventual
abolition of, the Exchequer subsidy on houses approved by the Minister for
building by local authorities to meet general needs. The reduction proposed is
from £22 is. to £10 a year. The subsidy would continue as before for houses built
to replace slum dwellings, and at the increased rate of £24 for certain other houses,
for example houses built by development corporations in the new towns. Local
authorities may supplement the Exchequer subsidies. Special rates of subsidy are
provided for special types of housing, including houses for agricultural workers,
houses in poor areas, and flats and houses on expensive sites, also where expensive
works are necessary in order to minimize the risk of subsidence due to mining
operations.
The Housing Act, 1949, provides Exchequer assistance for the improvement of
existing housing or adaptation of buildings for housing by local authorities or
private owners. Grants can be made by local authorities, with Exchequer assistance,
to persons converting or improving existing buildings for housing at a cost of over
£100 a dwelling. The grants may amount to half the cost, with a maximum of £400.
HOUSING AND PLANNING
355
There are certain technical conditions which the dwellings as improved or con¬
verted must satisfy to ensure that public money is only spent on property that will
provide satisfactory accommodation for a sufficient period. The Housing Repairs
and Rents Act, 1954, considerably eased the conditions attaching to these grants,
and it is the Government’s intention that they shall be much more widely employed
in the future, in order to make the utmost use of the nation’s stock of existing
houses. A subsidy for residential hostels built by local authorities or by certain
other bodies is also granted under the Act of 1949-
Subsidies are similarly provided in Scotland, though the amounts are generally
higher owing to the different rating system and higher costs.
In Northern Ireland annual subsidies are paid for 60 years to local authorities,
the Northern Ireland Housing Trust and Housing Associations. In addition ‘lump
sum’ subsidies are paid to private persons who build houses for letting or for owner
occupation. Under the Housing on Farms Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, grants are
available for the provision of new houses and for the reconditioning of existing
premises to accommodate farmers and approved workers.
House Purchase Schemes
Loans to enable persons to buy their houses by a system of instalment purchase
extending over several years are provided by some local authorities as well as by
building societies, certain insurance companies and other financial institutions.
Building societies (see also p. 295) have not actually built houses for over 100
years, but for a long time they have been the most important source of finance for
private building.
Many local authorities also operate a scheme whereby they guarantee part of the
loan made by a building society so that an advance greater than normal (up to
95 per cent of the value of the house) may be made to the purchaser. The Exchequer
undertakes to share any liability local authorities may incur under this scheme.
Rent Control
The great majority of the privately owned houses in Great Britain which are let
are subject to rent control. Houses owned by local authorities, New Towns Develop¬
ment Corporations, Housing Associations, and the Scottish Special Housing
Association are, in general, free from control, as are new houses completed since
30th August 1954.
The first Rent Restrictions Act was passed in 1915- The Acts now in force, either
wholly or in part, are the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts, 1920 to
1939, the Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act, I949> and the Housing Repairs
and Rents Acts, 1954.
These Rent Restrictions Acts, which apply, with few exceptions, to all unfurnished
dwellings below a certain rateable value, limit the rent a landlord may legally
recover from a tenant, while at the same time giving the tenant in most circum¬
stances security of tenure. The Acts also make illegal most premiums for the grant
of a tenancy of rent-controlled premises. Landlords restricted in this way are them¬
selves protected against undue increases in rates of mortgage interest and against
the calling in of mortgages so long as they pay the restricted interest due. 1 his
protection applies to anyone buying a controlled house on mortgage. The standard
rent of each controlled house is fixed by reference to the rent payable on a certain
date (for ‘old control’ houses 3rd August i9I4> f°r new control houses
1st September 1939). The standard rent of ‘old control’ houses may be raised by
increases permitted under the Rent Act of 1920. The standard rent of a house let
for the first time since 1st September 1939 is the rent at which it was first let,
356
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
except where this rent is reduced or increased by a rent tribunal, which on the
application of either party will determine a reasonable rent.
The Housing Repairs and Rents Acts, 1954, allow landlords to increase their
rents to pay for repairs, subject to certain conditions and to a maximum limit. This
measure is part of the Government’s policy of maintaining the stock of existing
dwellings.
The rents payable for furnished accommodation in England and Wales are con¬
trolled by the Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act, 1946. The Act provides for
the control of rents of houses or parts of houses let furnished or with services, with¬
out limitation by rent or rateable value. Local rent tribunals, appointed for the
purpose, determine the rents of furnished lettings in cases referred to them by
either party or by the local authority. Similar legislation for controlling rents of
furnished lettings was passed for Scotland in 1943.
Somewhat similar measures of control apply in Northern Ireland. In 1951,
however, legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases in the rent of
controlled houses provided they were maintained in good and tenantable repair.
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
The land of Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world
and it is therefore of vital importance in the public interest that competing claims
to its use should be settled in such a way that the necessary balance between them
is maintained.
From 1909 onwards, the idea of the planned use of land was given a degree of
expression in successive Acts of Parliament, but because the pattern of develop¬
ment over much of the country had already hardened into large unplanned urban
concentrations (as a result of the industrialization processes of the previous century)
the powers granted to planning authorities by the early Acts were inadequate for
the task in hand.
The twenty years between the two world wars were also decades of expansion in
industry, engineering and house-building; population was increasing, and there was
a general movement towards better standards of living, and consequently a greater
need for systematic planning than had hitherto been required. At the begin¬
ning of the nineteen-thirties, a major effort was made to consolidate and strengthen
planning law and to extend the planning powers of central and local authorities to
the point at which they could exercise effective control. Despite this effort, which
culminated in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, inter-war planning
legislation had only a limited effect, mainly because it failed to deal adequately with
the question of compensation, which had always been an obstacle to satisfactory
planning. By the nineteen-twenties, the principle had been accepted that the
property of an individual might be subjected to restrictions in the public interest,
provided that he received some compensation out of public funds for any depriva¬
tion which went beyond the requirements of good neighbourliness that he might
suffer thereby. The method adopted for implementing this principle, however,
placed so heavy a financial burden on planning authorities that they were often
prevented from, or at least hampered in, carrying out their work. As a result, at the
time of the outbreak of the second world war, many of the outstanding problems of
land use remained unsolved.
Renewed efforts were made to deal with these problems during the course of
the war. Between 1937 and 1942 three expert committees were appointed to study
and report upon (a) the unregulated growth and spread of industry, (b) the ham¬
pering of planning by the financial and administrative difficulties of compensation
HOUSING AND PLANNING
357
and betterment and (c) the encroachment of urban development upon the country¬
side. After the war, other committees studied the question of New Towns and
National Parks.
Almost all the principal planning recommendations of these committees have
now been incorporated in Acts of Parliament, as follows: the Distribution of
Industry Act, 1945; the New Towns Act, 1946; the Town and Country Planning
Act, 1947; the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947 > the National
Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949; the Town Development Act, 1952;
the Town and Country Planning Act, 1953 > the Town and Country Planning Act,
1954; and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1954-
The Town and Country Planning Acts
The Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, and the Town and Country
Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947, are comprehensive and radical measures which
provide a framework or pattern of land use for the whole of Great Britain (the
Acts do not apply to Northern Ireland (see pp. 362-3). Their main purposes are:
1. To co-ordinate planning throughout the country by means of development
plans against which day-to-day development can be considered.
2. To bring development (with certain exceptions) under control by making
it subject to the permission of a local planning authority or of a central
Government Department.
3. To extend both the powers of public authorities to acquire and develop
land for planning purposes and the scope and scale of grants from central
funds to local authorities towards carrying out the acquisition and clearing
of land.
4. To deal with certain specific problems of amenity, e.g., the preservation of
trees and woodlands and of buildings of special historic or architectural
interest, and the control of the display of advertisements.
The 1947 Acts were also intended to solve the compensation-betterment prob¬
lem; and, to this end, they provided for the transfer of development values in
land to the State, the establishment of a system of ‘ development charges payable
before development could take place by any person whose land was increased in
value by the grant of planning permission to develop, and the setting up of a £3°°
million fund from which payments could be made to owners whose land was depre¬
ciated in value by the passing of the Acts. It was hoped that by these provisions the
pre-war obstacles to effective planning might be removed; but, in the event, serious
difficulties were encountered in the working of the system, due mainly to the fact
that the development charge became in effect a tax on development. The financial
provisions of the 1947 Acts have therefore been amended in three subsequent Acts.
the Town and Country Planning Act, i953> which abolished the development
charges and suspended payment from the £300 million fund; and the Town and
Country Planning Act, 1954, and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act,
1954, which provided a new scheme for the payment of compensation for deprecia¬
tion in land values and a new basis of compensation for public acquisition. Under
the terms of the Acts, claims for compensation out of the £300 million fund form
the basis for all future compensation payments, but payments will not actually be
made unless and until loss is suffered. Since development charges have been
abolished, owners will normally be able to realize the full value of their land on
the open market and compensation will, in fact, become payable only when land is
acquired by a public authority or restricted against development. On compulsory
acquisition, compensation is paid for development value, only if a claim on the
358 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
£300 million fund had been established or could have been established, if made,
and up to the value of the claim. Loss of development value through the imposition
of planning restrictions, other than restrictions in the interests of‘good neighbour¬
liness is to be met by the State, in order that local planning authorities shall
continue to be relieved of the burden of paying the compensation for which they
were responsible until the passing of the 1947 Acts.
The Acts also provide a transitional system of payments, again based on claims,
to redress the financial effects on owners of land of the provisions of the 1947 Acts
and also a simplified and extended system of planning grants to local planning
authorities to replace that of the 1947 Acts.
Development Plans
Under the terms of the 1947 Acts, local planning authorities in England and
Wales and in Scotland are required to prepare, and submit to the Minister of
Housing and Local Government and to the Secretary of State for Scotland respec¬
tively, development plans covering the whole of their districts, based on a careful
survey of physical and other resources; all but three of those in England and
Wales and many more than half of those in Scotland have already done so. The
local authorities for the purpose are: in England and Wales, the county councils,
the county borough councils, or, where necessary, joint planning boards; and in
Scotland, the councils of counties and of large burghs, and the councils of the two
small burghs of St. Andrews and Thurso. Provision is made in the Acts for public
inquiry before any plan receives ministerial approval, so that persons whose land
is affected may have an opportunity to state their case; and for a five-yearly revision
of development plans. Individual plans for the reconstruction of parts of many of
the large towns and cities in Great Britain have also been drawn up and approved,
and in many cases considerable progress has been made. By the end of 1954 work
valued at about £20 million had been completed in England and Wales. By the end
of September 1955, in the City of London, projects valued at £10 million had been
completed, and work valued at £35 million was under construction.
The Distribution of Industry
The Distribution of Industry Acts, 1945 and 1950, and the Town and Country
Planning Acts, 1947, contain provisions to control the general location of industry
throughout the country. Under the terms of the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945,
the Board of Trade, as the responsible Department has wide powers to promote
industrial development in the Development Areas,1 i.e. areas in Britain which, in
the past, have been peculiarly liable to severe unemployment in times of depression
owing to their dependence for employment and prosperity on a few basic industries
(see pp. 128-9). The Board of Trade is also responsible, under the terms of the
Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, for certifying that any proposed industrial
development involving the erection of industrial buildings of more than 5,000
square feet can be carried out consistently with the proper distribution of industry,
before permission to develop can be given by the local planning authorities. General
problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of Govern¬
ment Departments, but the main responsibility for controlling the siting of industry
as apart from its general location rests with the local planning authorities, for it is
their duty to ensure that industrial development fits properly into existing and
expanding communities and is consistent with the best use of land.

of the Board of Trade and the Secretary of State for Scotland, acting jointly.

The New Towns
The New Towns Act, 1946, gives the Government powers to create new towns
vhen it is in the public interest so to do. Under the terms of the Act, the Minister
Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who
ire the responsible ministers, may, after consultation with the local authorities con-
;erned, make an order designating any area of land (which might include as its
nucleus the area of an existing town) as the site of a proposed new town. Once the
site has been designated, the responsible minister appoints a Development Corpora¬
tion (consisting of a chairman and up to eight other members) to be responsible for
the development of the new town. One of the first tasks of the Development
Corporation, when appointed, is to prepare a master plan which becomes the basis
for development proposals, each of which covers a part of the area. Every proposal
must be submitted to the responsible Minister who must consult the local planning
authority and, together with the Treasury, must be satisfied with the proposal on
economic grounds before giving approval.
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the consent of
the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for
Scotland) to acquire, by agreement or compulsory purchase, any land or property
necessary for their purposes. They may provide housing, commercial and industrial
premises, estate roads and sewers and other buildings essential for the development
of the towns; and, in certain circumstances, they may make provision for main
services. In England and Wales, the Minister of Housing and Local Government
has made a special development order to exempt the development corporations
from the necessity of obtaining planning permission from the local planning
authorities; but in Scotland, in the absence of a similar order, permission to develop
I has to be obtained from the local planning authority.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced to the corporations
from public funds and must be repaid on terms approved by the ministers with
the concurrence of the Treasury. The corporations must submit their reports
annually to the Minister or to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are respon¬
sible for laying them before Parliament; the accounts of the corporations must be
audited annually and are then presented to Parliament by the Comptroller and
Auditor General. .
When the purposes for which development corporations are established have
been substantially achieved, the corporations are to be dissolved and the towns
handed over to the appropriate local authorities, on terms settled by agreement or
after reference to the House of Commons.
There are 12 new towns in England and Wales and two in Scotland. Eig t
of these—Basildon and Harlow in Essex; Hemel Hempstead, Stevenage, Hatfield
and Welwyn in Hertfordshire; Crawley in Sussex; and Bracknell in Berkshire
are designed to help in absorbing excess population from the Greater London area,
four—Corby in Northamptonshire; Aycliffe and Peterlee in Durham; and Cwmbran
in Monmouthshire—are to serve the special needs of their areas. Of the Scottish
new towns, East Kilbride in Lanarkshire is designed to take the surplus population
from Glasgow; and Glenrothes in Fife to provide housing and other facilities for
the families of miners transferring to an area of expanding mining development.
In spite of the fact that the development corporations have been somewhat
handicapped by shortages of materials and labour and by restrictions on capita
investment, their work represents a notable achievement in the translation o

planning into reality. By the end of September 1955 the total population of the new
towns in England and Wales, designed to be 545,000 when the towns are completed,
had reached the figure of approximately 260,000 (including the people previously
living in the area); a total of 34,300 houses had been built by the development
corporations with a further 12,500 under ^construction; 190 factories had been
established and a further 58 were being erected; 465 shops had been completed and
245 more were being built; 63 schools had been finished and 33 more were under
construction. Many miles of roads have been laid, and large main sewerage works
have kept pace with housing needs.
In the Scottish new towns, by the same date, 4,578 houses had been built by the
development corporations with a further 1,675 under construction; 44 shops had
been completed and 31 were under construction; four new schools were in use and
the building of a further five was in progress; and the extension of communica¬
tions and public services was under way.
Under the New Towns Acts of 1946, 1952, 1953 and 1955, Parliament approved a
consolidated fund of £250 million to provide for advances to the development
corporations for work on the new towns. By September 1955, £156 million of
expenditure from this amount had been approved by the Minister of Housing and
Local Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
National Parks, Access to the Countryside and Nature Conservation
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949, provided for the
designation of a number of extensive areas of beautiful and relatively wild country
in England and Wales as National Parks. The characteristic landscape of these
areas is to be carefully preserved, and facilities for open-air recreation are to be
improved or provided.
A National Parks Commission for England and Wales was set up by the Act of
1949, and by the end of October 1955 its work had resulted in the establishment of
the first eight of the 12 National Parks recommended by the National Parks
(England and Wales) Committee, which reported in 1947. The Commission has
also submitted, to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, Orders
designating most of the upland country of Northumberland (from the Cheviots in
the north to the Roman wall in the south), and the Brecon Beacons (in South Wales),
as National Parks.
The established parks are: the Peak District, the Lake District, Snowdonia in
North Wales, Dartmoor in Devonshire, the Pembrokeshire Coast, the North York
Moors, the Yorkshire Dales, and Exmoor in Somerset and Devon. These parks
cover a total area of 4,333 square miles. Administrative systems are now in opera¬
tion for six of the parks, as follows: the Peak District and Lake District National
Parks are administered by Joint Planning Boards; for Dartmoor, the Pembrokeshire
Coast and the North York Moors, special Park Planning Committees of the county
councils concerned have been set up; while in Snowdonia, each of the county
councils concerned with the National Park, i.e. Caernarvonshire, Merionethshire
and Denbighshire, has a special Park Planning Committee of the county council in
respect of that part of the Park which falls within its area, and a Joint Advisory
Council tenders advice to the three councils in planning matters.
The Commission may also select other areas in England and Wales for designa¬
tion as areas of outstanding natural beauty in order to keep them unspoiled. These
areas may be less extensive than the National Parks and no special administrative
system needs to be set up for their planning. The Commission has begun a review
of these areas and is likely to designate the first in the near future.
A Scottish National Parks Working Party has considered all five areas recom-
HOUSING AND PLANNING
361
mended as National Parks in Scotland—the Trossachs, Glen Affric, the Cairngorms,
Wester Ross (Loch Maree) and Glen Coe—with a view to their possible develop¬
ment under existing statutory powers, and has submitted to the Secretary of State
for Scotland a report on each of these areas.
The Nature Conservancy (see p. 379) was given powers under the National Parks
Act to acquire, by purchase, lease or gift, land or properties necessary for the
furtherance of its objects. At the end of September 1955 there were 29 Nature
Reserves in England and Wales. By the same date the Nature Conservancy, on the
advice of its Scottish Committee, had established the first six national Nature
Reserves in Scotland; of these the Cairngorms Reserve, which accounts for 39,639
acres of the total of 79,035 acres of reserves in the whole of Great Britain, is the
largest reserve in Great Britain and one of the largest in Europe. The Conservancy
has also been consulted by local authorities, using their own powers under the
National Parks Act to set up local nature reserves.
The National Parks Act also provides for (a) a complete survey of all footpaths
and bridle-ways in England and Wales to be a comprehensive national record of
public rights of way and (b) long-distance routes connecting footpaths and bridle¬
ways as continuous rights of way. Individual surveys of footpaths are being carried
out by parish and county district councils; on completion, they will be collated and
published by the county councils. Responsibility for making proposals for the
provision and maintenance of long-distance routes rests with the National Parks
Commission; once the proposals are approved by the Minister of Housing and
Local Government, it falls to the local authorities to give effect to them. By the end
of October 1955 the provision of five routes had been approved: the Pennine Way,
which runs from Edale in the Peak District to the Scottish Border, a distance of
some 250 miles; a Pembrokeshire coastal path; a path along the north coast of
Cornwall around Land’s End to Penzance; an extension of this coast path from
Penzance along the south coast; and a path running mainly along the line of Offa’s
Dyke, from the coast of Flintshire down the Welsh border country to Chepstow
on the river Wye in Monmouthshire, a distance of 168 miles. The Commission is
planning a further continuation of the Cornwall coastal path, from Minehead in
the north of Somerset to Studland in the south, on the Dorset coast.
The Act also gives local authorities the task of surveying in their areas the access
enjoyed by the public to open country, i.e. mountain, moor, heath, down, cliff and
beach, and empowers them to improve such access, where necessary, by means of
agreements with owners or by access orders. In the Peak District National Park
agreements granting access to some 10,000 acres in the Kinder Scout area have been
negotiated.
The Government is empowered, under the Bird Protection Act, 1954, to
establish bird sanctuaries1 in Great Britain. The first sanctuary to be established
under the Act was the Humber Wild Fowl Refuge, in October 1955-
Preservation of Amenities
Responsibility for the preservation of the historic, scenic and architectural
beauties of Great Britain (from tree preservation and the preservation of ancient
inns to the protection of buildings against atmospheric pollution) is vested mainly
in the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Secretary of State for
Scotland, and the various statutory planning authorities and commissions. The
Ministry of Works, however, is also concerned, in that it is the Department respon¬
sible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces and, in addition, is empowered
1 Other bird sanctuaries have existed in Britain for many years, in the care of naturalist
societies and other bodies.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
362
by the provisions of the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, to
assist in the preservation of historic houses by making grants (after consultation
with specially constituted Buildings Councils) for their upkeep together with their
contents and their adjoining land. By September 1955, 241 such grants, totalling
£742,378, had been approved towards the cost of urgently needed structural repairs
to historic buildings in England, Scotland and Wales.
Unofficial amenity societies, wholly dependent upon the support of their
members, include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, founded
in 1926 to organize concerted action to secure the protection of rural scenery and
of town and country amenities from disfigurement or injury; the Association for
the Preservation of Rural Scotland, founded in 1927 for the protection of rural
scenery and the amenities of country districts and towns and villages in Scotland;
the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society; the Society for
the Protection of Ancient Buildings; the Pilgrim Trust1; the National Trust
for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland1; and the National Trust for Scotland. The National Trust for England,
Wales and Northern Ireland (which was founded in 1895 and by mid-1955
had nearly 54,000 members) is the largest landowner in the United Kingdom
other than the State and State institutions. It has acquired, mainly through gifts,
about a thousand properties, which it holds for the enjoyment of the public; it
administers over 223,000 acres of land of great natural beauty (including 30,000
acres of woodland); and it owns many fine gardens. The National Trust for Scot¬
land, which was founded in 1931 to promote the preservation of places of historic
or architectural interest or of natural beauty in Scotland, for the benefit of the
public, now has under its care some 60 properties, covering in all about 55,000 acres.
Planning in Northern Ireland
Town and Country Planning in Northern Ireland is governed by two enactments:
the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland) 1931, and the Planning (Interim
Development) Act (Northern Ireland), 1944.
The Act of 1931 provides for the preparation by local authorities of planning
schemes for development or re-development of their areas, with the general object
of securing proper sanitary conditions, amenities and conveniences in connection
with the laying out and use of land, and continues to be the main source from which
power to prepare a planning scheme is derived. The Interim Development Act of
1944, however, constituted an important advance in planning legislation in Northern
Ireland, since it enabled persons wishing to carry out development to do so without
delay and, at the same time, ensured that development carried out before a planning
scheme became operative should conform to the provisions likely to be included in
a planning scheme for the area in which development was proposed.
The provisions of the Act brought under planning control all land in Northern
Ireland and, in addition, required every local authority to prepare a planning
scheme for its area. Interim control is exercised in accordance with the section of
the Act which requires that, where application is made to an authority for permission
to develop, the authority may grant the application conditionally or unconditionally
or may refuse it altogether. In the event of a refusal or conditional approval, the
applicant has a right to appeal to the Ministry of Health and Local Government
for Northern Ireland (which is the Department primarily responsible for the
administration of the planning Acts).

HOUSING AND PLANNING 363
Since the Act of 1944 was passed, all local planning authorities have made ap¬
preciable progress in the preparation of outline plans which indicate broadly
the proposals for their areas. The outline plans not only provide a foundation for the
preparation of more detailed plans at a later stage but also facilitate materially the
work of interim development control. Many interim development applications
have been decided by local planning authorities, and appeals lodged with the
Ministry have been relatively few.
XII. RELIGION, SCIENCE,
AND THE ARTS
RELIGION
Every person living in Britain possesses the rights of religious freedom as they
are described in article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; that is,
he may change his religion at will and may manifest his religion in teaching, prac¬
tice, worship and observance. Churches and religious societies of any faith may
own property, conduct schools and propagate their faith in speech and writing.
Freedom of conscience for minority religious groups and for non-religious groups
has been achieved gradually and not without a struggle.
The Church of England and the Anglican Communion
The Church of England is the established Church of the Realm. It also claims to
be the ancient Catholic Church of the land. At the Reformation it repudiated the
supremacy of the Pope, but retained the historic episcopate, the Creeds, the Sacra¬
ments, and the appeal to Scripture, upon which its doctrine is based: therefore it
claims to be both Catholic and Reformed. Its form of worship is embodied in the
Book of Common Prayer.1 Religious Orders were restored a hundred years ago.
No single law defines the establishment of the Church of England in any such
way as, for example, the Act of Union, 1707, defines the position of the Church
of Scotland. The relation of Church and State in England is one of mutual obliga¬
tions, of privileges accorded to the Church but balanced by certain duties. The
Church of England is uniquely related to the Crown. The Sovereign, who must be a
member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the Faith’, a statutory
title as protector of the Church, and promises on his or her Accession to uphold it.
Prayers for the Sovereign are said in all the statutory services of the Church and the
clergy take the oath of allegiance to the Crown.
The second link of Church and State is through the House of Lords, in which
the two archbishops of Canterbury and York and 24 bishops have seats. This makes
it possible for the mind of the Church to be freely expressed on any great moral
issue raised in connection with the corporate conduct of the State, as well as on
more narrowly ecclesiastical issues. Clergy of the Church of England are legally
disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons. All bishops and deans are
appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister. The State upholds
sentences passed in ecclesiastical courts (see p. 77). The highest court of appeal
from an ecclesiastical court is the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
The State recognizes and protects church property. It makes no payments to the
Church except for services rendered (e.g., chaplaincies to the armed forces and to
prisons). ‘Church property’ belongs to parishes, dioceses or church societies. An
investigation in 1951 showed that half the Church’s income came from present
giving and half from past giving, in the form of endowments. Endowments pro¬
duced an income of £8f million a year and, of this total, property representing an
1 In March 1956 there will be commemorated the fourth centenary of the death at the
stake of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, whose name is closely associated with the Refor¬
mation. Besides encouraging the translation of the Bible into English and its circulation,
Cranmer was personally responsible for much of the work of compiling the first two
editions of the Book of Common Prayer.
364
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
365
annual income of £7 million was administered by the Church Commissioners, most
of it for specific purposes from which it could not be transferred. The present figure
for property administered by the Church Commissioners is £8i million a year, but
there may be other factors affecting the aggregate which any new inquiry would
have to take into account. The State is represented on this body and it reports
annually to Parliament.
The Established Church is not free to change its forms of worship, as laid down
in the Book of Common Prayer, without the consent of Parliament. A proposed
revision (1928) was accepted by the Church Assembly and the Convocations of
Canterbury and York (see below), though with substantial minority opposition in
some of the Houses, but was rejected by the House of Commons. A Church-
appointed commission on Church-State relations reported in January 1952 and
suggested certain changes in the relations between Church and State, but it was
opposed to disestablishment; its report was unanimously accepted by the Church
Assembly.
The Church is organized mainly by geographical areas (dioceses subdivided into
parishes), and not by congregations. Everyone in England is born in a parish—
about two-thirds being baptized by the Established Church—and the great
majority tend to look to the Church for personal services (baptism of children,
marriage and burial) and to expect it to play a part in local life. Only those who are
baptized and confirmed may receive the Holy Communion but anyone who is
baptized and not a member of another Church and who is over 18 years of age may
apply for membership of the electoral roll of the parish where he or she habitually
worships. The total number on the roll is just under 3 million, but this figure does
not represent anything like the total Church membership.
Spiritual authority in the Church of England rests in the bishops. There are 43
dioceses, 29 in the province of Canterbury and 14 in that of York. The most ancient
authoritative bodies in the Church in matters of doctrine and discipline are the
Convocations of Canterbury and York. Each is presided over by its archbishop and
consists of an upper house of bishops and a lower house of deans, archdeacons
and elected clergy. The Houses of Convocation meet separately or together in
May and October.
In 1919 by Act of Parliament the Church of England was given a National
Assembly, commonly called the Church Assembly. This consists of three houses,
Bishops, Clergy and Laity. The Laity (346 in number, including some 85 women)
are elected on the basis of the electoral rolls to represent their dioceses. The Church
Assembly may pass regulations and measures. Regulations affect matters which do
not require parliamentary consent; thus, for example, the Diocesan Conferences
were set up in 1935 by regulation. Measures, when passed through successive
stages, are presented to the Ecclesiastical Committee which consists of 3° members,
15 of whom (from the House of Lords) are appointed by the Lord Chancellor, and
15 by the Speaker of the House of Commons. This committee reports on the
expediency and possible legal results of the measure. On its advice the measure is
either laid before Parliament and forwarded on resolution for the Royal Assent or,
more rarely, is the subject of debate like any other Bill. The advantages to tne State
are the removal of the greater part of church business from its overcrowded debating
time, and to the Church the initiation, discussion and framing of necessary matters
by a fully representative church body and their speedy passing into operation.
The Assembly co-ordinates the vast scattered labours of the Church through
Councils which report to it annually. The Training Colleges Council maintains 24
colleges for the training of teachers—an indication of the part played by the Church
in the country’s educational system. The Schools Council, in co-operation with the
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
366
National Society, deals with matters affecting the Church Schools. Other councils
include the Central Advisory Council of Training for the Ministry. Selection of
ordination candidates lies in the power of the bishops, but it has been agreed
that candidates under 40 years of age shall attend one of the Council’s ‘ selection
centres ’ where a group of assessors spend several days with the men and discuss
with them the future training which would best suit their needs. There are at
present 24 theological colleges in England, one in Ireland, one in Scotland, and
two in Wales.
At the time when the Church Assembly was set up the laity were associated in
the government of the local churches through new elected bodies, the Parochial
Church Councils.
There are Anglican Churches in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, but these are not
established. The Church of Ireland has 14 dioceses or united dioceses, and some
400,000 members;*the Episcopal Church in Scotland, seven dioceses and some
107,000 members; and the Church in Wales, six dioceses and some 200,000 members.
Outside the United Kingdom the Anglican Communion exists wherever English¬
men have gone as settlers, traders and missionaries. The Protestant Episcopal
Church in the United States of America, the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and
Ceylon, and the Anglican Churches of South Africa, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, the West Indies, China, Japan, West Africa and Central Africa are all
autonomous members of the Anglican Communion, while there are 20 oversea
dioceses, mainly in Africa and Asia, which are under the jurisdiction of the Arch¬
bishop of Canterbury.
Since 1867, except for the war years, the Lambeth Conference has met every
tenth year as an unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops. It has no
authority but enjoys great moral prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline,
relations with other communions, and on the attitude of the Churches to political
and social questions are widely read. In the interim years between the Lambeth
Conferences it is proposed that an Anglican Congress should be held periodically.
These Congresses, which include clergy not in episcopal orders and laymen as well
as bishops, were inaugurated in 1954. The first session took place in the United
States, at Minneapolis, and it is expected that each future Congress will be held in
a different country.
The Church of Scotland
The established Church in Scotland is the Church of Scotland, which in govern¬
ment is Presbyterian. It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a
Church which is established and yet is free’. Whereas Episcopacy in church
government is a hierarchy of persons, in Presbyterianism there is a hierarchy of
courts. All ministers are of equal status, and the Church is governed locally by the
Kirk Session, consisting of the minister and elected elders: above this is the court
of the Presbytery, then that of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly, which
meets annually and consists of elected ministers and elders presided over by an
elected Moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at the
General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The complete independence
of the Church of Scotland to appoint its own officers and decide all matters of
doctrine and discipline has been fought for by the Church with the utmost vigour
down the years. The freedom of the Church is recognized by Parliament without
being the subject of debate or modification. The thorough training of the ministry
—lasting a minimum of six years—has given the Church a high reputation for
scholarship and has in turn influenced the standard of education in the country.
The communicant membership of the Church is over a million and a quarter.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
367
The Free Churches
The largest of the Free Churches, formerly more generally known as the Non¬
conformist Churches, is the Methodist Church, the product of a union of Methodist
Churches in 1932. It has three-quarters of a million adult full members. The
supreme authority in the Church is the annual Conference and the system of
government is in many ways presbyterian; the Leaders’ Meeting corresponding to
the Kirk Session, with Circuit Meetings and District Synods resembling Presbytery
and Synod. It is not, however, the form of government that distinguishes Methodism
from other Churches. Starting as a powerful evangelistic movement within the
Church of England in the eighteenth century under the leadership of the brothers
John and Charles Wesley, the Methodists had no idea of founding a Church until
forbidden to preach by ecclesiastical authority. One of the Church’s characteristics
is its strong emphasis on lay leadership. There are nearly 24,000 trained lay
preachers sharing the ministers’ work and preaching in thousands of local
churches.
The Congregational and Baptist Churches both regard the Church as a
covenanted fellowship of believers, ministers being called to special service and set
aside, trained and recognized by the Church. Local churches have formed county
and national unions, whose secretariat and assemblies, however, have no compulsive
authority over them, though much influence.
The Congregationalists in Britain, including Welsh Independents, number
379,000 and the Baptists 329,000 adult members. The importance they both attach
to the autonomy of the local church meeting has been an influential factor in the
development of British democratic methods. They both admit women to the
ministry. Baptists differ from Congregationalists in practising the baptism of
believers only; they do not baptize infants.
The Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from
the revivalist movement led by Howell Harris in i735> embraces a large section of
the Welsh-speaking population: its members number some 154,000.
Next in size among Presbyterian Churches is the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.
The Presbyterian Church of England is organized in 14 Presbyteries and its highest
court is the General Assembly. It admits women to the eldership.
The Society of Friends, or Quakers, founded in the middle of the seventeenth
century by George Fox, have no ordained ministry, and do not observe the Sacra¬
ments. They have borne a consistent witness to pacifism, and their influence,
especially in social reform and the relief of suffering, has been out of all proportion
to their number (21,000). There are about 300 Unitarian and Free Christian
Churches united by loyalty to the principle of freedom of thought in religion. Since
1904 they have admitted women to the ministry. The Salvation Army, founded in
1878 by William Booth, a Methodist, replaces ecclesiastical by military terminology.
William Booth’s mission to the poorest attracted first the scorn and then the respect
of a large public. The movement is now world-wide and its social work is well
supported. . . . ..
The Christian Scientists have over 340 branch churches and societies in Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church
The Roman Catholic Church in the United Kingdom claims nearly four million
adherents including children. The head of the Church in England is the Cardinal
Archbishop of Westminster. There are 18 dioceses and nearly 2,000 parishes. The
Church attaches great importance to educating children in its own schools. Schools,
social work and many institutions are staffed by the great Roman Catholic Orders
for men and women.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
368
Jewry
The virtual destruction of whole Jewish communities on the Continent has left
English Jewry as the largest group of Jews in Europe. These same events have
caused religious organizations among Jews to gain in numbers and influence. The
two main divisions are between Orthodox and Progressive Jews and each has
within it several groups of congregations and synagogues. The Chief Rabbi is the
head of the largest group within the Orthodox Jews.
Other Non-Christian Communities
Among other non-Christian communities in Britain, the Moslems are the most
widely represented. The principal mosque is the Shah Jehan Mosque at Woking,
and there are also mosques in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and
Glasgow.
A Buddhist temple was ceremonially opened in South Kensington, London, in
May 1954.
Co-operation between the Churches
An outstanding feature of recent years has been the growth of co-operation
between the Churches. The British Council of Churches was founded in 1942 and
includes official representatives from almost all the Churches of the British Isles
with the notable exception of the Roman Catholic Church. The Council facilitates
common action between the Churches and seeks to further the cause of Christian
unity. The Archbishop of Canterbury is President. In addition, many though not
all of the Free Churches in England and Wales are members of the Free Church
Federal Council (formed in 1940 by the amalgamation of the Federal Council of
Evangelical Free Churches with the National Free Church Council) the aims of
which are to promote unity and joint action between the Free Churches and to
provide a channel through which the Free Churches can communicate and negotiate
with central and local government organs as a united body.
The Church of England, the Church of Scotland and the Free Churches in
England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales also participate in the World Council of
Churches which was constituted at Amsterdam, Holland, in 1948, and held its
Second Assembly at Evanston, Illinois, U.S.A., in August 1954. The Council
links together 163 Churches in 48 nations for co-operation in action and the study
of common problems.
Co-operation of other Churches with the Roman Catholic Church takes place on
specific issues but there is no machinery of continued co-operation. The Council of
Christians and Jews works for better understanding between members of the two
religions, and deals with problems arising in the social field.
THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
While the promotion of the sciences in the United Kingdom is largely the
concern of those learned societies and institutions devoted specifically to this end,
only a small part of the research which is vital to science is carried out directly by
them. Most of the ‘ pure ’ or ‘ fundamental ’ research is conducted in the universities,
which also play an essential part in promoting the sciences by maintaining a steady
supply of trained scientists. In practice it has become impossible to distinguish
clearly between science and its extensive applications in everyday life, with the
result that scientific research in the widest sense has become the concern also of
industry and of various Departments of Government.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 3^9
In recent years it has become an acknowledged responsibility of the Government
not only to undertake research directly but also to keep under review the facilities
for the training of scientists, to encourage fundamental research, to finance certain
research projects, and to ensure that adequate research is directed to matters of
national interest. As a result a system of collaboration has developed between the
universities, industry, the learned societies and the Government which is of great
value to the community and leaves the greatest possible measure of freedom to
individual scientists.
Though scientific research is carried out mainly under three different kinds of
administration—university, industry and Government there is Strong liaison and
close co-operation between them, while the learned societies remain free to play a
most important part in the discussion and publication of the results of research.
Important work is also undertaken by independent organizations—for example,
in medical research, by the British Empire Cancer Campaign, the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund, the Nuffield Foundation, the Lister Institute of Preventive
Medicine, and by some large pharmaceutical firms. The Nuffield Foundation,
which was established by Lord Nuffield in 1943, has a wider scope. Its aims are:
the advancement of health and the prevention and relief of sickness; the advance¬
ment of social well-being; the care and comfort of the aged poor; the advancement
of education; and such other charitable purposes as shall be declared by Lord
Nuffield in his lifetime and by the trustees after his death. Prominent among the
Foundation’s many activities are the promotion of medical, scientific and social
research and the development of medical services and of technical and commercial
education. Its resources consist of a fund of £10 million provided by Lord Nuffield
and of gifts and bequests from other persons.
THE LEARNED SOCIETIES
The learned societies have had a profound and lasting influence upon the develop¬
ment and organization of science in Britain; not only have they provided the back¬
ground for the continuity of research from the seventeenth century onwards, but
they have been a meeting ground where all scientists can forgather for the exchange
of ideas, and a reliable source from which new ideas for the enrichment of know¬
ledge can flow. Although today the bulk of research operations is conducted under
auspices other than theirs, the learned societies have retained their traditional
function of facilitating the spread of scientific knowledge and the application of new
discoveries. ... ....
At present there are over 200 learned scientific societies in Britain with approxi¬
mately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical institutions
and professional associations, many of which are playing a distinguished part m
promoting their own branches of science and are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members. Prominent examples of these are the
British Medical Association, the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the Institution of
Metallurgists, the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of Physics, and the
Institute of Biology.
The Royal Society, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s
scientific affairs, although for two centuries scientists were in a minority among its
members, whose interests lay mainly in history, art, archaeology or exploration. The
Society has always been independent of State control but its advice on scientific
matters has frequently been sought by the Government. Today its influence remains
3?o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
as strong as ever and its Fellows serve on most, if not all, of the Advisory Councils
of Government Departments.
In addition the Society is responsible for the administration of many research
funds and special funds derived from various sources and a number of Government
grants. These funds and grants are used for the promotion of science through
research, publications, congresses, the award of medals, lectures, and in many other
ways. Its Fellowship consists of approximately 500 eminent scientists and 50 foreign
members. Admission of the former is restricted to 25 a year, and of the latter to four
a year; a few eminent non-scientists are also elected to Fellowships. The Society
maintains a library (145,000 books of a purely scientific nature), issues a large
number of publications, including the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings
and convenes conferences which are attended by scientists from all countries.
The Royal Society of Arts (originally the Society for the Encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce) was founded in 1754, and as it was the first society
of its kind its work was at first very wide, covering scientific, technical, industrial
and commercial matters on a world-wide scale. As institutions devoted to the
specialized branches of science and industry came to be established, the Society
gradually abandoned some of its earlier fields of work, but it is still a recognized
forum for the discussion of technical and other subjects.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating the
introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for teaching
the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the ‘promotion of
chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving arts and manufactures ’,
and ‘ the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge ’. Its character, however, was
largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday who
established a tradition of research. Today the Institution has extensive research
laboratories, and lectures are given on the recent developments in science and other
branches of knowledge. Its library of 70,000 books includes many early scientific
works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831 to
promote general interest in science and its applications. At the present day one of
its chief activities is the Annual Meeting. Its 13 sections cover the whole range of
pure and applied science other than medical science, and there is a division for
studying the social and international relations of science. Collaboration with other
scientific organizations has always been an important function of the British Asso¬
ciation, and it has an organized relationship with over 150 scientific bodies and
learned societies. It has also played an important part in the development of science
by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles to the discovery and
application of scientific knowledge.
THE UNIVERSITIES
The universities carry the main responsibility for the pursuit of fundamental
research and for the training of scientists. During recent years there has also been
a considerable expansion of technological training and research facilities within the
universities, all of which now offer work in one or more technological subjects
(e.g., applied science, engineering, metallurgy and industrial fermentation). Early in
1953 it was decided that the Imperial College of Science and Technology (part of
London University) should undergo a major expansion with the aim of increasing
the number of scientists and technologists under full-time training from the existing
figure of 1,650 to 3,000 by the end of 1962.
37i
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
Major developments in technological education, with the aid of Government
grants, are also planned for the universities and technical colleges of Glasgow,
Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds. There are also to be developments on a fairly
large scale at Cambridge and Sheffield and specialized developments at universities
in other industrial centres.
The estimated number of graduate scientists in the working population has risen
from under 50,000 in 1939 to nearly 80,000 in 1955 and there has been an even
greater increase, from a little over 50,000 in 1939 to over 130,000 in i955» the
number of technologists. This increase will continue with the expansion of facilities
at the universities and training colleges, but demands for trained scientists will
continue for some time to exceed the supply.
The twenty-one universities and the two university colleges in the United King¬
dom (see p. 344) all have laboratories or research departments. Over two-thirds of
the income of the universities comes from Government sources. There is no direct
departmental control and the method of administering the grant through the
University Grants Committee (see p. 344)—ensures academic freedom. Additional
funds for the prosecution of research are also secured in some instances by the
private endowment of research fellowships generally awarded by the universities to
selected persons, or by grants from outside bodies tenable at the universities.
Examples are the Leverhulme Fellowships, the Imperial Chemical Industries
Fellowships and the research grants of the Nuffield Foundation.
The universities are also assisted by grants from industry and commerce and
from the Government Research Councils. An example of the close co-operation
that has been achieved between several branches of industry and the research
departments of universities is the Glass Delegation of the University of Sheffield.
This is responsible for the general direction of the work of the Department of Glass
Technology and is composed of members appointed by the Council of the Univer¬
sity and representatives of firms and companies who subscribe funds for the
furtherance of training and research. By these means the universities are closely
associated with the Government research departments and with the most important
industries in the country.
RESEARCH IN INDUSTRY
Industrial research in Great Britain is conducted by individual industrial firms
and organizations independently of Government aid, by co-operative Research
Associations which make use of facilities afforded by the Government, by sponsored
research institutes, and by universities and a number of the major technical colleges.
The main nationalized industries have their own research establishments and
also give financial support to organizations concerned with research into matters
of interest to them. An account of the provision for research by the National Coal
Board, the Central Electricity Authority and the Gas Council is given on pp. i?1-2.
179, and 182 respectively.
Industrial Organizations
The Industrial Research Secretariat of the Federation of British Industries has
conducted a comprehensive survey (1945-46) of the research work done in private
organizations {Scientific and Technical Research in British Industry, FBI, July 1947)-
This showed that about 1,000 British firms were conducting research: 420 spent at
least £1,000 a year on research, and the total sum spent by industry on research
and development was approximately £30 million. The number of workers engaged
372
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in industrial research was estimated at 45,000; about 10,000 were qualified staff
with a university degree or equivalent, and nearly one-half of these were chemists.
About 100 firms had first-class research facilities and extensive research programmes
which embraced both pure and applied research. The survey showed that about
300 firms were in touch with universities and technical colleges on research ques¬
tions, and 60 firms had a very close connection, through endowing scholarships and
research fellowships, with appropriate universities. It also revealed that more than
300 of the firms surveyed were members of a Research Association and that more
than half of these were members of more than one Research Association.
A later report {Research and Development in British Industry, FBI, July 1952)
suggested that, in the year 1950-51, the total expenditure on research and develop¬
ment had increased by between 50 and 100 per cent since 1945-46, and the number
of qualified staff by about 50 per cent. The other figures remained substantially the
same.
Research Associations
One of the first acts of the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
(see pp. 373 and 375), when it was established in 1915, was to recommend a scheme
by which the Government associated itself with groups of firms having similar
interests to form Research Associations. Today there are 41 such Research Associa¬
tions,1 with a combined income of £4 million of which about one-third is contri¬
buted by the Government through the Industrial Grants Committee of the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (see pp. 375-6). The amounts of
the Government grants are related to the contributions made by the industries
concerned.
The Research Associations are autonomous bodies, governed by their own
councils, the large majority of whose members are representatives of industry. The
councils are advised by research committees in the preparation of research
programmes.
Sponsored Research Institutes. A number of sponsored research institutes have
been established to meet the needs of private firms which are unable to maintain
fully equipped research laboratories. They are establishments where research can
be carried out confidentially so that the results and any patents which may arise
from it are retained as the property of the sponsoring body. The principal institutes
are the Fulmer Research Institute and the Sondes Place Research Institute.
National Research Development Corporation. The National Research Develop¬
ment Corporation (NRDC) was set up by the Board of Trade in 1948. Its function
is primarily to develop in the public interest, inventions resulting from research
carried out by Government Departments and other public bodies. Under the
Development of Inventions Act, 1954, however, NRDC is now allowed, under
certain conditions, to initiate research as well as to develop inventions resulting
from research. It is an independent body, subject only to general direction by the
Board of Trade, with powers to borrow from Government funds up to £5 million
in the first ten years of its life. Projects selected for development include electronic
digital computers, Merton diffraction gratings, a lightweight power unit, a potato
harvester, printed electrical circuits, and the manufacture of cortisone from heco-
genin obtained from the sisal plant.

Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.

RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
GOVERNMENT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION
Early Developments
Although the active participation by the Government in scientific effort is, for the
most part, a twentieth-century development, its association with science dates from
a much earlier time. Interest in navigation led Charles II in 1675 to establish
Britain’s first State-supported institution—the Royal Observatory at Greenwich1
for the purpose of correcting the tables of the positions of the moon and fixed stars
‘for the use of his seamen’. The Geological Survey of Great Britain—the first
national institution of its kind in the world—originated in 1835. In 1842 the
Department of the Government Chemist was founded, and in 1854 ‘for the safe¬
guarding of seamen’ the Meteorological Office was established by the Board of
Trade. All these Government Departments were using scientific knowledge but
there was little organized effort towards the application of the discoveries made in
pure science. Government scientific organization, like many British institutions,
evolved gradually in response to the changing social and economic circumstances of
the times.
The need for research in physics and engineering, and particularly into methods
of precise measurement, led to the establishment of the National Physical Labora¬
tory under the control of the Royal Society in 1900, with a modest grant from the
Treasury towards equipment and a yearly grant towards upkeep.
From 1909, however, the Government assumed a wider responsibility for pro¬
moting and encouraging scientific research and since that time its assistance has
been adapted to meet the rapidly changing conditions in industry and education.
The Development Commission, appointed in 1909 by the Government, recom¬
mended that financial aid should be made available from the Development Fund to
‘aid and develop agriculture and rural industries by promoting scientific research’.
In 1911 the Development Fund was used to establish a comprehensive scheme
which led to the formation of most of the present-day agricultural research institutes.
In 1913 a Medical Research Committee (the forerunner of the Medical Research
Council) was appointed to administer the research funds provided under the
National Health Insurance Act of 1911.
Up to the outbreak of the first world war, the Government’s contribution to
scientific research was made directly through such organizations as these, and
indirectly through grants administered on its behalf by such bodies as the Royal
Society and the Imperial College of Science and Technology.
The recognition of the importance of scientific research and of the application of
scientific knowledge to commerce and industry led to the establishment of the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) as a separate Govern¬
ment Department in 1916. The Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, to which all proposals for new work are referred by the DSIR in the
first instance, was given responsibility for (1) instituting specific researches,
(2) establishing or developing special institutions or departments of existing
institutions for the specific study of problems affecting particular industries or
trades; (3) the establishment and award of research studentships and fellowships.
In 1918 financial responsibility for the National Physical Laboratory was trans¬
ferred from the Royal Society to the DSIR, although the Royal Society continued
to advise on the scientific direction of the Laboratory.
The Forestry Commissioners were appointed in 1919 with powers to undertake
and aid research for the promotion of forestry.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1920 the Government established the Medical Research Council with a grant-
in-aid provided directly by Parliament.
The third of the Councils created by the Government for the promotion of
research, the Agricultural Research Council, was established in 1931. In addition to
its duties as adviser to the Development Commissioners and the Agricultural
Departments (for England and Wales and for Scotland), the Council was given
funds of its own from which grants could be made for special research projects.
During the second world war a Scientific Advisory Committee to the War
Cabinet was created, with the object of co-ordinating defence research and civil
research.
The Lord President of the Council, as the Minister responsible for the three
Research Councils, and as President of the Scientific Advisory Committee, came to
be regarded as the member of the Cabinet responsible for the direction of Govern¬
ment scientific organization.
Post-war Developments
At the end of the second world war, the Government established an Advisory
Council on Scientific Policy ‘to advise the Lord President of the Council in the
exercise of his responsibility for the formulation and execution of Government
scientific policy’.
The Advisory Council, appointed by the Lord President in January 1947, has 15
members—12 eminent scientists from the universities, industry and Government
service, and 3 senior Government administrators.
In the same year the Defence Research Policy Committee was established ‘to
advise the Minister of Defence and Chiefs of Staff on matters connected with the
formulation of scientific policy in the defence field ’.
These two bodies replaced the Scientific Advisory Committee to the War Cabinet.
In order to give adequate attention to each of the subjects within its wide range
of interest, the Advisory Council has established the following standing committees:
the Committee on Scientific Manpower;
the Scientific Library and Technical Information Committee;
the Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations.
Government Machinery for Civil Scientific Research
The principles underlying Government scientific organization are briefly as
follows:
1. The Lord President of the Council is responsible for the formulation and
execution of Government scientific policy and is advised by the Advisory
Council on Scientific Policy on general questions which relate to the whole
field of civil science.
2. The Lord President is the Minister responsible to Parliament for the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Medical Research
Council, the Agricultural Research Council, and the Nature Conservancy,
and is chairman of the three Privy Council Committees to which they report
—the committees for Scientific and Industrial Research, Medical Research,
and Agricultural Research and Nature Conservation.
3. The Lord President is also the Minister responsible to Parliament for
general oversight of the development of atomic energy, and appoints the
members of the Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 379)-
4. Other Ministers are responsible for the scientific establishments within their
own Departments.
375
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
5. The advice of the Research Councils is at the disposal of the Executive
Departments and there is close liaison between them, but the Research
Councils are not subject to departmental control.
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
The DSIR1 is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research of which the Lord President is chairman. This Committee
is advised by the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (see
pp. 372 and 373), which includes in its membership eminent scientists and leading
industrialists, two members closely connected with organized labour and assessors
appointed by Government Departments. riaii?
With the exception of medicine, agriculture and atomic energy, the 1JJiK
includes in its scope all branches of natural science and their application to indus¬
trial processes. Its activities fall into three main groups:
1. Scientific research in the national interest and to meet the needs of Govern¬
ment Departments.
2. The encouragement of research and the application of scientific knowledge
in industry.
3. The encouragement of fundamental research at universities and elsewhere,
and the maintenance of an adequate supply of trained research workers for
laboratories of all kinds.
The first of these functions is discharged through 13 national research organiza¬
tions2 under the Department’s own control and direction and financed from rts
own Vote, and one, the Fire Research Organization, which is maintained by the
Department and the Fire Offices Committee jointly.
The National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, Middlesex, is the largest ot the
DSIR establishments and conducts research in a variety of branches of physics.
These include aerodynamics; electricity; electronics; X-ray, ultra-violet, visible
and infra-red radiations; mathematical computation; metallurgy; heat and tem¬
perature measurement; sound and noise; and ship design. The Laboratory also
maintains the British primary standards of length, mass, temperature, illumination,
electrical and other physical units. The facilities for accurate measurement are a so
employed for precision work and determination of the physical properties o
materials. The Laboratory carries out high-grade testing of a wide range o
apparatus and materials.
The second of the DSIR’s functions is discharged mainly through the autono¬
mous Research Associations (see p. 372); while its third function is carried out y
means of grants to individual workers or institutions for special investigations.
The close contacts maintained between the DSIR and otner Governm
Departments, Research Associations and other bodies help to ensure that t e

scientific resources of the Department are applied to the solution of problems which
are of most importance to the national economy and are used to make the maximum
contribution to improving industrial efficiency.
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council (MRC), the successor of the Medical Research
Committee, was incorporated under its present title by Royal Charter in 1920.
The MRC is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Medical
Research of which the Lord President is chairman and the Minister of Health and
the Secretaries of State for the Home Department, Scotland, Commonwealth
Relations, and the Colonies are members.
The MRC has 12 members. Nine of these members are appointed for their
scientific qualifications; and of the other three, one must be a member of the House
of Lords and one a member of the House of Commons. The scientific members are
appointed by the Privy Council Committee after consultation with the Medical
Research Council and the President of the Royal Society.
The Council’s chief function is to undertake or promote scientific investigations
to obtain new knowledge likely to be of value in the field of curative and preventive
medicine. In promoting investigations on particular subjects it has the advice of a
large number of expert committees which it appoints for the purpose. In general,
the arrangements for the support of research fall under three headings:
1. Investigations by members of the Council’s scientific staff, mostly working
in the Council’s own research establishments.
2. Temporary research grants to independent investigators in universities and
elsewhere.
3. Research scholarships and fellowships for work both at home and abroad.
The Council’s principal research establishment is the National Institute for
Medical Research, at Mill Hill, London. In addition, the Council maintains
some 50 research units, departments or groups attached to university departments
or hospitals; some of these are concerned with clinical research and others with
laboratory studies.1

The Public Health Laboratory Service is administered by the MRC on behalf of
the Ministry of Health. It consists of a chain of public health laboratories through¬
out England and Wales, the largest establishment of the Service being the Central
Public Health Laboratory, Colindale (London). This laboratory includes the
National Collection of Type Cultures, the Standards Laboratory for Serological
Reagents, and reference laboratories specializing in the identification of particular
groups of infective micro-organisms, as well as other specialized laboratories such
as the Air Hygiene and Food Hygiene Laboratories.
Agricultural Research Council
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) was established by Royal Charter in
1931. It is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Agricultural
Research and Nature Conservation, of which the Lord President of the Council is
chairman, and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is vice-chairman.
The other members of the Committee are the Secretaries of State for the Home
Department, Scotland, and the Colonies, and the Ministers of Education and
Housing and Local Government.
The ARC consists of 15 members, five appointed for their general experience
of, and interest in, agriculture, and the rest for their scientific qualifications. The

Privy Council Committee, after consulting the ARC itself and (as regards the
scientific members) the President of the Royal Society, makes the appointments.
The Council plans and co-ordinates work over the entire field of agricultural
research and is assisted in this task by standing committees and a number of
technical committees and conferences.
The Council advises both the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and
the Department of Agriculture for Scotland on the programmes, estimates and
staffing of the Agricultural Research Institutes,1 which with certain exceptions have
their own governing bodies but are almost wholly financed from State funds. The
Council has 17 research stations and units under its direct control in Great Britain.2
In May 1955 the Government announced that it had decided to transfer to the
Council (from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) responsibility for
making grants to the independent research institutes in England and Wales, but
not in Scotland, where this will remain the responsibility of the Department of
Agriculture for Scotland. The transfer is likely to be completed by 1st April 1956.
In addition the ARC devotes part of its funds to encouraging research by means
of special research grants which are allocated to one or other of the research insti¬
tutes, to university departments or to advisory centres. It also awards scholarships
and training grants.

Nature Conservancy
The Nature Conservancy was established by Royal Charter in 1949 an<i
responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Agricultural Research and
Nature Conservation. Its functions, as summarized in the charter, are ‘to provide
scientific advice on the conservation and control of the natural flora and fauna of
Great Britain; to establish, maintain and manage nature reserves in Great Britain
Tsee p. 361], including the maintenance of physical features of scientific interest;
and to organize and develop the research and scientific service related thereto’.
Atomic Energy Authority
Before 1946 the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was responsible
for atomic energy research and development.
From 1946 to 1953 this responsibility rested with the Minister of Supply. By
April 1953, however, the Government had decided in principle to transfer respon¬
sibility for atomic energy from the Minister of Supply to a non-departmental
organization, in view both of the growing importance of the industrial applications
of atomic energy and the need for an organization for atomic energy more akin to
that of a large industrial undertaking. It was subsequently announced that the
Minister to be generally responsible for the control and development of atomic
energy in the United Kingdom would be the Lord President of the Council.
As an interim measure the Department of Atomic Energy was set up under the
Lord President; this Department took over responsibility for the operation of the
atomic energy project from 1st January 1954’ Subsequently Parliament passed
the Atomic Energy Authority Act, i954> and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority, set up under that Act, took over responsibility for the project from the
Department of Atomic Energy on 1st August i954> The Lord President is still
responsible to Parliament for atomic energy policy generally and also, subject to the
consent of the Treasury, for providing funds for the Authority out of money pro¬
vided by Parliament. In particular he has the duty of securing that, in the Authority’s
operations, the proper degrees of importance are attached to the various applica¬
tions of atomic energy. He is assisted, in the exercise of these responsibilities, by
the Atomic Energy Office, which also provides any necessary liaison between the
Authority and other Government Departments. The Minister of Supply continues
to be responsible for providing atomic weapons to the Services and places contracts
with the Authority for the production of nuclear components of such weapons and
research related to them; the Authority is free to conduct experimental work which
may lead to improved types of warheads for such weapons.
The Authority, whose members are appointed by the Lord President, consists of
not fewer than eight and not more than 11 members, including the chairman.
The Authority, like other statutory corporations, is free from day-to-day Govern¬
ment control (subject to the power given to the Lord President to issue directions
to the Authority on any matter where he considers over-riding national interests
require his intervention), but differs from them in that the bulk of its revenue is
derived from money voted by Parliament and in that its accounts are examined ana
certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General (see p. 279)-
The Authority’s establishments, and their respective functions, are as follows:
The Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, in Berkshire, is respon¬
sible for fundamental research into nuclear physics and atomic energy, and provides
basic scientific information to the other establishments. It houses the United
Kingdom’s first two experimental piles, deep and Bepo, a zero energy experimenta
fast breeder reactor, Zephyr, which went into operation on 5th February 1954, and
a heavy water reactor known as Dimple, which started working on 1st August 1954-
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
380
It was announced on 8th August 1955 that the amount of fresh plutonium produced
in Zephyr by the breeding process had been found to be about double the amount
consumed in the core; and that another experimental fast breeder reactor, Zeus, a
very low-powered model of the Dounreay fast breeder reactor (see below) had been
built at Harwell and would be in operation before the end of 1955. Two more heavy
water reactors, the E443 (Dido) and the REyyj (Pluto), are under construction.
Harwell is also responsible for about half the production of isotopes in the United
Kingdom (see p. 198), the number of consignments dispatched from the Establish¬
ment in 1954 being 9,274, of which 3,138 were exported.
An Isotope School was established at Harwell in April 1951 and a Reactor School
in September 1954. The first gives training in the handling and measuring of radio¬
isotopes, and the second provides courses in reactor physics and reactor engineering
as well as in nuclear physics and metallurgy. One-third of the students at the
Isotope School and nearly one-half of those at the Reactor School come from
overseas.
The Radiochemical Centre at Amersham, in Buckinghamshire, is a dependency
of the Harwell Establishment. It is concerned with preparing radioactive’ sub¬
stances such as radium, radon and radioactive isotopes produced in the atomic piles.
Over 115 different labelled compounds have been prepared by chemists at Amer¬
sham since 1948 and 100 of these can now be supplied from stock. In all 10,257
consignments of isotopes were dispatched from the Centre in 1954, of which 4,114
were exported (see also p. 198). These are used for medical, scientific and industrial
purposes.
The production of fissile material is directed from the headquarters of the
Industrial Group at Risley, near Warrington, Lancashire. Production factories are
situated at Springfields, near Preston, Lancashire, where pure uranium is produced
from uranium concentrates; at Windscale in Cumberland, where plutonium is
produced from uranium by means of atomic piles; and at Capenhurst in Cheshire,
where there is a gaseous diffusion plant for separating the uranium isotope U235
from the more abundant isotope U238, thus providing a fissile material which can
be used as an alternative to plutonium. The Industrial Group is also responsible
for the design, construction and operation of the experimental atomic power plant
that is being built at Calder Hall, adjoining the Windscale factory, and for the
experimental breeder reactor being built at Dounreay, in Caithness, Scotland,
where a further heavy water reactor is to be built.
Research work on atomic weapons is carried on at the Establishment at Alder-
maston, in Berkshire, and its out-stations at Woolwich, Fort Halstead and Foulness.
The work of these establishments is co-ordinated at the headquarters of the
Atomic Energy Authority in London.
When the Authority first took over the atomic energy project, orders for all
buildings and maintenance work at different establishments were the responsibility
of the Ministry of Works. It was decided that such work should be taken over by
the Authority as soon as possible, and an immediate start was made by setting up,
in September 1954, a Works Contract Branch at Risley, Lancashire, to deal with
all building projects for new work or maintenance in the Industrial Group. Since
then arrangements have also been made at Harwell, and at Aldermaston, to take
over from the Ministry of Works all maintenance work at these establishments with
effect from 1st April 1955 ; new works will be taken over at a later date.
The Atomic Energy Authority will provide expert advice on the nuclear elements
in the power stations to be built for the Central Electricity Authority, as well as
being responsible for the six additional reactors which are to be constructed for the
Authority itself (see p. 177)-

Other Government-sponsored Scientific Research
All Departments rely on one or other of the Government Research Councils for
scientific advice. While some use these bodies as their main source of scientific
information, a few have set up supplementary research organizations of their own.
Defence Research with Civil Applications
Research and development undertaken by the Admiralty is almost exclusively
directed to meeting the requirements of the Royal Navy, but a substantial amount
of this work has important civil applications. The research activities of the Royal
Observatory and the National Institute of Oceanography, which are mainly in the
civil field, are administered by the Admiralty.
The Ministry of Supply carries out research needed to meet the technical
requirements of defence and is also responsible for research in some civilian fields,
e.g., the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National Gas Turbine Establishment
at Farnborough. Some fundamental research is also carried out for the Ministry by
universities and industrial organizations.
The Air Ministry is responsible for the Meteorological Office (see p. 43), where
the research carried out has many applications on the civil side.
Agriculture
Apart from research at the grant-aided Institutes and the centres financed by the
Agricultural Research Council, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
conducts research in its own Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, and also
at its Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden, Herts; and its Infestation Division
at Tolworth, Surrey, conducts research into problems affecting the destruction and
control of insect pests of stored food, rodent pests and other animal and bird pests.
The Department of Agriculture for Scotland maintains a plant pathology laboratory
in Edinburgh (carrying out research in entomology and helminthology). In Northern
Ireland research in all the major agricultural sciences is carried out directly by the
Ministry of Agriculture.
Fisheries
The authorities concerned with fisheries research are: the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, which maintains a laboratory for marine research, four research
vessels, and two experimental stations for shellfish investigation; the Scottish Home
Department, which maintains a research laboratory at Aberdeen and four research
ships; and the Development Commissioners.
The Development Commissioners, through their Advisory Committee on Fishery
Research, co-ordinate all fishery research, not only that which is aided by the
Development Fund (see p. 373)* From the latter a number of independent insti¬
tutions receive grants for marine and freshwater research.1
Food
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, under the direction of its Chief
Scientific Adviser (Food), conducts research in nutrition and food technology. It
has experimental laboratories and kitchens in London and has an experimental
factory at Aberdeen to facilitate the commercial development and application of
the results of research.

Forestry
The Forestry Commission (see p. 166) is responsible for forestry in Great Britain
and undertakes experimental work relating to silvicultural and allied problems. By
means of grants, it also aids forest research work undertaken by various universities
and other institutions, including the Imperial Forestry Institute, Oxford.
Fuel and Power
The Ministry of Fuel and Power has responsibility for research on safety in mines,
and plays a direct part in research such as that into the development of coal¬
consuming gas turbines, underground gasification and total gasification. There is
close collaboration between the Ministry, the Scientific Departments of the
National Coal Board, the Central Electricity Authority, the Gas Council, and the
Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, all
of which are responsible for research in their own fields.
Transport
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation is concerned with two main fields
of scientific research: research on radio aids to marine navigation, conducted by the
Admiralty Signal and Radar Establishment, the cost being borne by the Ministry
of Transport and Civil Aviation; and road research, in co-operation with the DSIR,
including soil mechanics, materials, construction and road safety.
Land Use and Planning
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is responsible for policy relating
to the use and development of land in England and Wales. Through its Technical
Services Directorate, the Ministry deals with technical planning and geographical,
geological, economic and sociological matters. Similar arrangements are made for
Scotland by the Department of Health for Scotland. The Ministry of Health and
Local Government is responsible for the general administration of the planning
legislation in Northern Ireland.
Building
The Ministry of Works is responsible for reviewing the whole field of research
and technical development of the building industry and for ensuring that the results
of research are made available to the industry. Research is carried out by several
establishments of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, in particu¬
lar the Building Research Station.
Radio and Telecommunications
The Post Office undertakes scientific research on a wide range of subjects relating
to telephone, telegraph and radio systems which is carried out by the Research
Branch of the Engineering Department. It also undertakes the experimental
development of radio transmitters and receivers for Post Office services and other
Government Departments. The Post Office keeps in close touch with the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Independent Television Authority (ITA)
in connection with the development of broadcasting techniques.
Analytical Chemistry
The Department of the Government Chemist is responsible for providing
analytical services to all Government Departments that may require them. It
carries out special investigations, e.g., in connection with nutritional and physio¬
logical surveys, and conducts fundamental research in infra-red spectrography,
chromatography and X-ray study of crystals.

Medicine and Health
In addition to the work carried on under the aegis of the Medical Research
Council, the Ministry of Health may conduct and promote research into the cause,
prevention and treatment of illness or mental defectiveness.
The Department of Health for Scotland has similar responsibilities, and an
Advisory Committee on Medical Research in Scotland works with the Medical
Research Council.
In Northern Ireland, the Hospitals Authority (a statutory body set up by the
Minister of Health and Local Government) has permissive powers to conduct or
assist medical research. In addition, it has a statutory duty to provide adequate
bacteriological and pathological services.
The General Register Office carries out research in four main fields: (1) analysis
and interpretation of statistics of causes of death; (2) statistical inquiry into the
treatment of cancer and its results; (3) morbidity as revealed in hospital statistics;
and (4) mental health.
Colonial Research
The bulk of the research work relating to Colonial development is done locally,
but much of it requires close collaboration with research institutes and laboratories
in Britain. It is the function of the Colonial Research Council to co-ordinate the
work of the specialist committees and to advise on general questions relating to
policy. The specialist bodies concerned deal with research into such subjects as
agriculture, animal health, forestry, medicine, social science and colonial products.
Anti-Locust Research
In 1931 a small locust research organization at the Imperial Institute of Ento¬
mology in London was internationally adopted as the world centre for locust
research. This organization, later known as the Anti-Locust Research Centre, has
during the past twenty years received and co-ordinated information on locust move¬
ments and breeding from 40 countries, undertaken scientific research into the life-
history and habits of the different species, and investigated and developed methods
for their control and destruction. One-half of the expenditure on control is con¬
tributed by the member countries of the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom
itself contributing one-third.
Other Research Work
Finally there are a number of scientific institutions administered by Government
Departments which undertake a certain amount of research work in addition to
their other scientific activities. These include the Royal Botanic Gardens (Kew)
and the Ordnance Survey Department.
Scientific Museums
The British Museum (Natural History)—an independent section of the British
Museum—contains one of the world’s largest collections of natural history material
and is recognized as a leading research institution.
The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science
in all countries, but chiefly in Great Britain which has always held a leading place
in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the development
of industrial machinery and processes, all of which are represented in the Museum s
collections. The geology of Britain is known in more exact detail than that of any
other country in the world, and the Geological Survey, responsible for this work,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
384
also has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological Museum. These
three museums are in South Kensington, London.
Important collections outside London are the Museum of Science and Industry
Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee was founded at the end of 1939 by
members of the House of Commons and replaced the former Parliamentary Science
Committee. It is one of a number of informal, unofficial, all-party Parliamentary
groups, which have grown up spontaneously and have a varying degree of influence
(see p. 32). Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party and in
both Houses, and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-making
scientific and technological organizations in Britain as may be affiliated under its
constitution. Membership in 1954 comprised 161 members of Parliament and
representatives of 94 scientific and technological institutions. The aims and objects
of the committee are:
1. To provide members of Parliament with authoritative scientific information
from time to time in connection with debates.
2. To bring to the notice of members of Parliament and Government Depart¬
ments the results of scientific research and technical development which
bear upon questions of current public interest.
3. To arrange for suitable action through parliamentary channels whenever
necessary to ensure that proper regard is had for the scientific point of view.
4. To examine all relevant legislation and to take such action as may be
suitable.
5. To watch the financing of scientific research.
6. To provide its members and other approved subscribers with a regular
summary of scientific matters dealt with in Parliament.
Broadly speaking the activities of the committee may be divided under two
headings. First it provides, as far as possible, for a regular exchange of information
between members of Parliament and scientists; secondly, it endeavours to ensure
that action is taken to right matters seen to be wrong in the light of such information.
Scientific Liaison Overseas
The history of scientific progress is essentially a story involving many nations,
and the organization of a country’s scientific research would be incomplete without
provision for adequate liaison with other countries.
Before the second world war a vast amount of international scientific collabora¬
tion took place through the exchange of university staffs, the awards of scholarships
and fellowships, the close relations existing between the learned societies in this
country and their equivalent bodies abroad, and through international conferences
and congresses.
The war and the post-war period saw the emergence of a number of new develop¬
ments in oversea scientific collaboration which reflected the Government’s recogni¬
tion of its responsibility in the whole field of science. The result has been that today
there are various official channels through which scientific liaison can be conducted;
these include:
1. The British Commonwealth Scientific Offices. A feature of the war-time pattern
of scientific collaboration was the establishment of Scientific Missions, in London
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 3^5
by the United States and the Commonwealth countries, and in Washington by the
United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth countries; the latter subsequently
joined together as the British Commonwealth Scientific Office in Washington.
Immediately after the war a British Commonwealth official Scientific Conference
was held in London, and in view of the success of the office in Washington during
the war period, it was recommended that this office be continued in peace time, and
in addition that a British Scientific Office be set up in London. These recommenda¬
tions were approved by all Commonwealth Governments. Since 1948 the Scientific
Offices in London of the Commonwealth countries have been located in the same
building, and are closely associated with the Overseas Liaison Division of the DSIR.
2. The Standing Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations. This committee of
the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy was set up after the war to provide, among
other things, for discussion of general policy on oversea scientific representation,
scientific relations with Commonwealth and foreign countries, and scientific aspects
of the work of the United Nations.
3. The Overseas Liaison Division of the DSIR. This division is responsible for the
executive work arising from the Standing Committee’s activities. It is regardea as
the general inter-departmental body responsible for oversea scientific liaison, and
is placed within the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for con¬
venience of organization.
4. Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux. Machinery exists in the Commonwealth
Agricultural Bureaux for liaison in the field of agricultural science between coun¬
tries of the Commonwealth. In the United Kingdom there are 10 Bureaux,
specializing in various branches of agricultural science, and two Institutes the
Commonwealth Mycological Institute and the Commonwealth Institute of Ento¬
mology. A third Institute, the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control, has
its headquarters in Ottawa, Canada. The Bureaux collect, collate and disseminate
information resulting from agricultural research.
5. The British Council. The aims of the British Council in the pure and applied
sciences are to foster closer co-operation between British scientists and scientists of
other countries, and to promote a better understanding of Britain among oversea
specialists by disseminating a knowledge of British activities and achievements
Under the first objective the exchange of visits between scientists m the United
Kingdom and other countries is of prime importance. Besides arranging lecture or
advisory tours overseas by eminent British scientists, the British Council, among
many activities of a similar nature, brings to the United Kingdom every year a
number of senior oversea specialists, postgraduate students and technicians on
visits of varying duration, for the purpose of study in British universities and other
institutions, or for discussion with British experts. In addition to publishing the
British Medical Bulletin, intended primarily to keep oversea specialists informed ot
progress in medical research in Britain, the Council maintains an extensive and
much used specialist information service. In the 60 countries in which the Bntis 1
Council is represented, libraries are maintained and in many instances these have
strong sections of scientific and technological literature. .... c
The British Council maintains at its headquarters specialist departments tor
medicine and science (including agriculture and engineering), while in some coun¬
tries scientists are attached to its oversea representatives. The Council is advise y
eminent scientists who serve on its Science Advisory Committee and on specialist
panels for the different subjects.

Government Expenditure on Research
Central Government funds to a total of over £196 million for scientific research
and development were voted for the financial year 1955-56. Besides Civil Estimates
of £178 million, this sum included1 £17-5 million in respect of Navy Estimates and
£603,000 in respect of Air Estimates. Included in the Civil Estimates were:
Ministry of Supply £157-7 million; Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research £6-5 million; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food £4-6 million;
Medical Research Council £2-2 million; Colonial Development and Welfare £1-3
million; Agricultural Research Council and Nature Conservancy £1-4 million.
In addition to the above figures, over £51 million has been voted to the Lord
President to enable the Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 379) to carry out research
into, and the development of, atomic energy.
THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
Various institutions are concerned either wholly or in part with the preservation
of Britain’s cultural heritage and the promotion of literature and the arts. There is
no Ministry of Fine Arts or equivalent organization to formulate or administer
policy in the arts, though bodies such as the Standing Commission on Museums
and Galleries (appointed 1931) and the Royal Fine Art Commission (appointed
1924) act in an advisory capacity. Government interest in the arts is expressed
mainly through the provision of grants to such bodies as the Arts Council, the
British Council, the British Film Institute (see p. 396), and the Council of Industrial
Design (see p. 390), and also to the national museums and art galleries (see p. 378).
In addition, under the Local Government Act, 1948, local authorities may now use
part of the revenue from the rates for the encouragement of the arts. Local educa¬
tion authorities also make grants to some schools of art, music and drama.
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established under a Royal Charter in 1946.
It consists of not more than 16 honorary members appointed by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer in consultation with the Minister of Education and the Secretary of
State for Scotland. Its main duties are to increase the accessibility of the fine arts to
the public, to improve the standard of execution in the fine arts, and to advise and
to co-operate with Government Departments, local authorities and other organiza¬
tions on any matter connected directly or indirectly with these objects. The corre¬
sponding body in Northern Ireland is CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of
Music and the Arts).
The British Council exists to promote overseas a wider knowledge of the United
Kingdom and the English language and to develop closer cultural relations with
other countries. It was founded in 1934 and was granted a Royal Charter in 1940.
Nine of the 30 members of its Executive Committee are nominated by Government
Departments; it is financed almost entirely from public funds, mainly through the
Foreign Office. In the Commonwealth it acts directly as the agent of the Common¬
wealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office. It is usually designated as the
Government’s principal instrument for the implementation of cultural conventions
to which the United Kingdom is a party.
The Council maintains staffs who, in about 60 oversea countries, foster English
studies, provide regular information on British life and thought and promote know¬
ledge of the scientific, artistic and other developments and achievements of the
United Kingdom.
1 Full particulars will be found in Civil Estimates 1955—56. Memorandum by the
Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Appendix A, pp. 21-24. HMSO.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 3^7
In the United Kingdom itself, the Council arranges study programmes for
scholars and teachers from overseas, and other professional visitors. It also provides
a wide range of services for students from overseas (particularly those from the
dependent territories) who are studying in United Kingdom universities and other
educational institutions.
Unofficial institutions concerned with the promotion of the arts include many
charitable trusts and foundations, e.g., the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust and
the Pilgrim Trust, and a large number of societies, associations and other organiza¬
tions concerned with separate aspects of the arts, some of which are mentioned
later in this chapter.
The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust was founded in 1913 by the late Andrew
Carnegie. It was incorporated under Royal Charter in IQ1?* The Trust, which was
initially founded for ‘ the improvement of the well-being of the masses of the people
of Great Britain and Ireland’, consists of 25 life trustees, 6 trustees nominated by
the Corporation of Dunfermline and 3 trustees nominated by the Fife County
Council. Its cultural policies include the support of adult amateur activities in
music, drama and the visual arts. It also supports non-national museums. Grants
totalling approximately £21,124 were made for these purposes during the year
ended 31st December 1954.
The Pilgrim Trust was founded in 1930 by the late Edward Stephen Harkness, an
American citizen. The Trust, which has an income of about £140,000 a year, is
administered by a body of trustees who are empowered to make grants towards
any legally charitable object within the United Kingdom. In fact, the greater part
of the Trust’s income is at present being used to help to preserve the nation s
heritage of architecture and history, and for the advancement of learning and the
arts. The grants made for these objects during 1954 amounted to £115,562.
VISUAL ARTS
The fine arts of painting and sculpture in Britain receive State support by grants
to national institutions and, indirectly, through grants made to the Arts Council,
to municipal art galleries and museums, and to local education authorities for art
schools and other means of promoting education in art. There are at present a
number of British painters and sculptors of international repute as well as younger
artists of great promise; and interest in their work and that of their contemporaries
overseas, as well as in that of British and foreign artists of the past, is most marked
in all sections of the community.
In the year April 1954 to the end of March 195 5 the Arts Council arranged 82
separate art exhibitions in Great Britain; 323 showings of these exhibitions were
given in 157 different places. Knowledge of British fine arts is fostered overseas by
the British Council by means of exhibitions, the dissemination of reproductions and
photographs, lectures, and the provision of information and advice to inquirers
abroad and to visitors in Britain. In the year ended March 1955, 26 different exhi¬
bitions organized by the Council were shown in 35 countries. The Council was also
responsible for British participation in 10 international exhibitions.
Museums and Art Galleries
There are in all about 750 museums and art galleries open to the public m Great
Britain, though many are only small collections or merely a few rooms set aside in
a public building for the display of local treasures. _
The national museums and art galleries in London probably contain between
them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic, archaeological.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

scientific,1 historical and general interest ever to exist within one city. The British
Museum, which celebrated its bicentenary in 1953, has unparalleled collections of
archaeological and ethnographical material from every part of the world, in addition
to housing the national library of printed books, manuscripts, newspapers and
periodicals; its Department of Prints and Drawings also possesses collections of the
widest extent and richness. The Victoria and Albert Museum contains works of
fine and applied art of all countries and periods, arranged mainly according to
material, though since the war primary collections have been arranged to bring
together, by style, period or nationality, masterpieces of all the arts. The National
Gallery presents paintings by almost all the greatest European masters. The Tate
Gallery embodies two collections: the British school from the eighteenth century
onwards, with a few earlier works, and modern foreign schools since 1850. Both
sections include modern sculpture. Frequent loan exhibitions are held in the
gallery.
Other important collections in London are at the National Portrait Gallery, the
Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, the London
Museum (reopened in Kensington Palace during 1951), and Hertford House,
where the famous Wallace Collection (furniture, objets d’art and paintings, mainly
French of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) is housed. Many of the
national institutions in London suffered war damage to their buildings, and the
financial stringency of the post-war years combined with lack of space and staff
has resulted in these great museums and art galleries being still unable to do justice
to the wealth of material they possess.
The Ministry of Education is responsible for the administration of the Victoria
and Albert Museum. The other national institutions have their own Boards of
Trustees, but all receive Treasury grants.
There are five national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland, the Royal
Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, and the Scottish
United Services Museum; and in Cardiff is the National Museum of Wales with
its branch at St. Fagans Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed. A
Northern Irish Folk Museum is proposed for Belfast. The Belfast Museum and
Art Gallery is municipally owned, but serves unofficially as a national institution
for the whole of Northern Ireland.
Almost every city and large town has a museum devoted to art, archaeology and
natural history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes by a local
learned society or privately by individuals or trustees to whom some rich collector
in the past has bequeathed his treasures. A notable example in the last category is
the Bowes Museum at Barnard Castle, Durham, containing one of the finest art
collections outside the capital cities. Both Oxford and Cambridge are rich in
museums—the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, is the oldest in the
country and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has fine art galleries and a
notable collection of engravings, manuscripts and books bequeathed by its founder
on his death in 1861. Other universities have important collections, primarily for
teaching purposes but also open to the public. Other cities with important museums
and art galleries are Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool
(where part of the museum building destroyed in the war is now being rebuilt),
Manchester, Norwich, Southampton, and York where the Castle Museum, with
its complete reconstruction of an eighteenth-century street of shops, offers a most

RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 3^9
interesting historical display. In recent years there has been a notable development
of ‘period-house museums’, in which outstanding examples of the private resi¬
dences of former times have been taken over by national and municipal authorities
for this purpose, as at Temple Newsam, Leeds; Aston Hall, Birmingham; and the
Royal Pavilion, Brighton.
Temporary exhibitions, particularly on art subjects, including circulating exhi¬
bitions produced by the Arts Council, the Art Exhibitions Bureau, and the
Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, are a regular feature
of many museums.
The Museums Association, founded in 1889, is an independent organization to
which museums and art galleries and members of their staffs throughout the
country belong; there are also many oversea members. The Association serves as
the central body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters
relating to museum administration and practice, and as a training and examining
body for professional qualifications. It also produces directories, a monthly journal,
and other publications.
Financial assistance for improving the displays of the smaller museums is among
the functions of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which has done much to
encourage the growth of the museum movement during the past twenty-five years,
and at present expends an average of £10,000 a year in this field.
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy, which,
in summer, holds exhibitions of works by members and non-members and, in
winter, a series of exhibitions devoted to national schools of painting; the Institute
of Contemporary Arts; the Royal Society of British Artists; the Royal Institute of
Oil Painters; the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours; the Royal Society of
Portrait Painters; and the London Group. Some of these societies, notably the
Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in London. There
are also an increasing number of amateur art societies throughout the United
Kingdom which hold local exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts
in a variety of ways. The Contemporary Art Society uses its members’ subscriptions
to buy modem works which it presents to the public galleries.
Exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists are held throughout the
year in the galleries of the art dealers of Bond Street and other parts of the West
End of London.
Art Education
There are 13 colleges of art in the United Kingdom, each serving a region,
all of which offer courses in most branches of art and a varying range of crafts,
and there are schools of art in nearly all the larger towns. In London the most
notable of these schools and colleges are the Royal College of Art (a national
college) and the Central School of Arts and Crafts of the London County Council,
in both of which the emphasis is on industrial design, and the Slade School of Fine
Arts in the University of London. At the Royal Academy Schools, founded in 1768,
all instruction is provided free by Royal Academicians.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history of art
are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department of
Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the Warburg
Institute (also a part of London University) which provides facilities for research
on the character and history of the classical tradition.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school and the Society for
Education through Art encourages the purchase by schools of original works of
art.

Industrial Design
Industrial design is the concern of the Royal Society of Arts, which was founded
‘for the encouragement of arts, manufactures and commerce’ (see p. 370), and of
the Council of Industrial Design.
The Council of Industrial Design was set up in 1944 by the President of the
Board of Trade with the purpose of promoting the improvement of design in the
products of British industry. It is financed from public funds. The Council has
24 members, a majority being prominent industrialists, and there is a separate
Scottish Committee. The Council arranges exhibitions at home and abroad,
organizes conferences and courses, maintains Design Review, which is an up-to-date
illustrated record of good design in current production as well as a record of
designers, and publishes a monthly magazine, Design, for manufacturers, retailers
and designers. A permanent design centre will be opened in the Haymarket,
London, in 1956.
Architecture
The great interest in architecture shown in Britain since the end of the second
world war is reflected in the importance which the State accords to this branch of
the arts and in the number of professional, advisory and other societies and insti¬
tutions which exist to further the development of modem architecture and the
preservation of architecture of historic value.
The Government Departments chiefly concerned are the Ministry of Housing
and Local Government, the Department of Health for Scotland, and the Northern
Ireland Ministry of Health and Local Government, which are responsible in their
respective countries for approving the layout and design of local authority housing
schemes, and which issue reports and circulars setting standards for local authority
housing. The Education Departments are responsible for the supervision of building
for the public education service. The Ministry of Works is the Department concerned
with the preservation of historic buildings and ancient monuments in Great Britain.1
All these departments have architects on their staffs.
There are several State-sponsored organizations concerned with special aspects
of architecture. The Royal Fine Art Commission, appointed by Royal Warrant,
advises Government Departments and other public and quasi-public bodies on
questions of public amenity or artistic importance. The National Buildings Record
maintains a library (open to the public for consultation) of photographs of English
and Welsh architecture and an index of architectural records in public and private
possession. The Royal Commissions on Ancient and Historical Monuments for
England, for Wales and Monmouthshire, and for Scotland, record in detail all
ancient and historical remains in their countries and publish a series of surveys,
designed ultimately to cover the whole of Great Britain. The Ancient Monuments
Boards for England, Scotland, and Wales, set up under the Ancient Monuments
Acts, consider which monuments should be listed in accordance with those Acts
and advise the Minister of Works on any questions concerning ancient monuments.
The Historic Buildings Councils for England, Scotland, and Wales, constituted
under the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, advise the
Minister on the provision of grants towards the repair and maintenance of such
buildings and their contents.2 An Historic Buildings Bureau has been set up to find
new uses for unoccupied historic buildings of outstanding interest.
1 In Northern Ireland, responsibility for the preservation of ancient buildings is vested
in the Ministry of Finance.
* Between July 1953 and the end of September 1955, 241 grants to the total value of
£742,378 were made by the Historic Buildings Councils for England, Scotland, and Wales.
39i
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
The leading professional architectural institution in the United Kingdom is the
Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) which holds meetings at which papers
are read and discussed, publishes a Journal and holds exhibitions, promotes and
controls the training of architects through its Board of Architectural Education,
and has one of the largest and most important architectural libraries in the world,
housing over 65,000 books, periodicals and drawings. Well-known societies include
the Architectural Association, the Architecture Club, and a number of societies
interested in particular aspects of architecture, for example, the Mars Group
the English Branch of Les Congres Intemationaux d’Architecture Moderne
and the Modular Society. Among the preservation societies are the Georgian Group,
which is a society designed to awaken interest in Georgian architecture and to save
Georgian buildings from destruction; the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings; the National Trust in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the
National Trust for Scotland (see p. 362), which together own more than a hundred
houses of historic or architectural interest, many of which contain pictures and
other works of art which are on view to the public; and the Historic Churches
Preservation Trust, formed in 1952, under the chairmanship of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, with the aim of raising £4 million to supplement, by grants, the efforts
of parishes to put their churches into good repair. .
Education in architecture is given at 18 schools of architecture recognized or
exemption from the RIBA Intermediate and Final Examinations and 6 schools of
architecture recognized for exemption from the Intermediate Examination only.
There are also 50 schools of art and technical institutions (14 full-time) with facili¬
ties for the instruction of intending architects, which prepare students for taking
externally the examinations of the RIBA. It is against the law for any person to
practise or carry out work under any name, style or title containing the word
‘ architect ’ unless he or she is registered. The statutory body which regulates
registration is the Architects’ Registration Council of the United Kingdom.
LITERATURE
A knowledge of literature is fostered in the United Kingdom by the schools,
colleges and universities of the country, in all of which English literature is taug t
either as part of a general course or as a specialist subject. Interest in the subject is
thereafter maintained by the libraries, by the very large number of private literary
societies (both national and local), and by the numerous periodicals concerned m
whole or in part with literature, of which the best-known critical weekly is the
Times Literary Supplement. State support for literature is given throug t e
Council, which assists poetry—especially poetry readings—in Great Britain, and
through the British Council, which is active in encouraging a knowledge of English
literature abroad. Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given m the form ot
literary prizes, a number of which are awarded annually, e.g., the two James 1 ait
Black Memorial prizes for biography and literature, the John Llewellyn Rhys
Memorial prize for young writers of promise, the Hawthornden prize for imagina¬
tive writing, and the Somerset Maugham award for young writers.
Libraries
The largest library in Britain is that of the British Museum in London (more
than 6 million printed books). The National Library of Scotland (nearly 2 mi ion
volumes) is in Edinburgh and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (more than 1 million
volumes). Together with the Bodleian Library in Oxford (over 2 million volumes)
and the Cambridge University Library (over 2 million volumes) these comprise the

Other great libraries are1 2: the London Library (the largest public subscription
library, 600,000 volumes); the University of London Central Library (580,000)2;
Edinburgh University Library (625,000); Glasgow University Library (426,800);
St. Andrews University Library (519,500); the John Rylands Library, Manchester
(500,000); the Science Museum Library (390,000); the Patent Office Library
(356,000); the Victoria and Albert Museum Art Library (300,000); the National
Library for the Blind (300,000—Braille and Moon types); the British Library of
Political and Economic Science (350,000); the British Museum (Natural History)
Library (300,000); the India Office Library (280,000); Queen’s University Library,
Belfast (200,000); the Royal Institute of International Affairs Library (91,000); the
Royal Geographical Society Library (90,000); the Imperial Institute Library
(100,000); the Public Record Office Library (which contains the National Archives
and the National Register of Archives); the Royal College of Music Library
(160,000); the British Drama League Library (90,000); the Library of the Royal
Institute of British Architects (60,000); the Royal Academy of Music Library
(60,000); and the Central Music Library (29,000). The Arts Council has founded
a reference library of modem English poetry, which is housed with the National
Book League.
An important feature of library services in Britain is the co-operation within
the closely knit network of libraries which greatly increases the value of the service.
Library co-operation is organized regionally in the first instance, through Regional
Library Bureaux, and is finally centralized in the National Central Library with
its widespread system of outlier libraries (public, university and special) giving
access to a total stock of 21 million books.
The public libraries of Britain are maintained in every county and county
borough and in many boroughs and urban districts by 578 public library authorities.
Together, these authorities provide more than 31,000 service points; they hold
over 58 million books and make more than 380 million loans a year. A feature of
the service in rural areas is the travelling van, which is an itinerant library.
In addition to lending books, and providing special libraries for children, public
libraries engage in many kinds of extension activities, such as play readings, lec¬
tures, film shows, music circles and co-operation in University Extension adult
education.
The two principal professional bodies to which librarians belong are the Library
Association and the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux
(ASLIB). Whereas the Library Association, with a membership of over 11,000,
attempts coverage of the whole field of library work—public, university and special
—ASLIB, which is a documentation centre and is financed by the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research, operates in a more specialized field. One of its
activities, for example, is the maintenance of an index of translations, especially
from Russian and German, which have been or are being made in Britain.
Books
The output of new books in Britain amounts to over 13,000 new titles a year—in
I954> for example, British publishers issued a total of 19,188 separate titles, of
which only 5,846 were reprints or new editions. In that year, the annual figures for

otherwise stated these libraries are situated in London where there are more than 500
libraries; and see also p. 370.

2$ million volumes.

RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
new titles under literary subject headings were: bibliography and literary history,
248; biography, 437; essays, 81; fiction, 2,532; poetry and drama, 526.
Some classes of books are produced as Government publications by Her
Majesty’s Stationery Office, which is the largest publishing organization in Britain;
the great majority of books, however, are produced by commercial publishers,
including the university presses, notably the Clarendon Press (Oxford) and the
Cambridge University Press, which publish many outstanding literary works.
Leading organizations representing the interests of those concerned with book
production are the Publishers’ Association, the Booksellers’ Association, and the
Society of Authors.
Literary Societies and Institutions
Societies and institutions concerned with the promotion of literature in its various
forms include: the National Book League (13,000 members), which encourages the
reading of and an interest in books, and which holds exhibitions, including the
widely popular annual exhibitions of book design; the English Association (3,000
members), which aims at upholding the standard of English writing and speech;
the Royal Society of Literature (250 members and 250 fellows), which is concerned
with the advancement of literature; the Royal Society of Edinburgh (790 fellows),
which promotes science and literature; and the British Academy, which is an
organization concerned with humanistic studies and has a section dealing with
literature and philology.
Interest in poetry is encouraged by the Poetry Society (3,000 members); by the
annual National Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales, the origins of which
date back to the seventh century; and by the Apollo Society which, supported by
the Arts Council, presents a number of poetry readings in which music as well as
poetry forms part of the programme.
Among the specialist literary societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, and several societies
devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens Fellowship
(10,000 members).
There are also a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book Society (18,500
members), which exist to distribute selected new books to their members. The
most recently established is the Poetry Book Society (700 members), which was
set up in 1954 under the auspices of the Arts Council.
DRAMA
State patronage of the drama is expressed through {a) the Arts Council, which
grants subsidies to certain theatrical managements operating on a non-profit-
making basis (i.e. using profits to finance future productions), provided that suc^
managements have given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high
standards of practical competence, (b) the Customs and Excise Department, which
has power to grant remission of entertainments duty to certain managements, chosen
on the same principles as those applied by the Arts Council, and (c) the ^'ltis“
Council, which is responsible for making the British theatre better known abroad
by organizing and sponsoring international tours by important companies, includ¬
ing the Old Vic Theatre Company and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre
Company, and by sending overseas exhibitions of theatrical design and lecturers on
drama. Moreover, the Treasury is empowered, under the National Theatre Act,
1949, to support the scheme for a national theatre by contributing £1 million to the
cost of building and equipping a theatre, in London, which would operate under
public auspices.
394 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Professional Theatre
The centre of the professional theatre is in London, where there are some 45
principal theatres and a number of suburban and ‘little’ theatres. These are let to
producing managements on a commercial basis for every type of theatrical enter¬
tainment. There are also theatres in Scotland, Northern Ireland and in the pro¬
vinces of England and Wales, which are served by productions touring either
before or after London presentation, by companies specially formed for touring,
and by local repertory companies. No new theatres have been built in the United
Kingdom since the end of the second world war, but several damaged ones have
been reconstructed, some have been converted from other uses, and Coventry has
a plan for the building of a new theatre.
In addition to managements which rent theatres for limited or long runs, there
are a few producing organizations which possess theatres of their own. Among the
older and better known of these organizations are the Old Vic Theatre Company in
London and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company at Stratford on Avon,
both of which are permanent companies presenting their plays in true repertory.
Local repertory companies (some of which are assisted financially and otherwiseTy
the Arts Council or CEMA) may have the use of their own established repertory
theatres, e.g., the Bristol Old Vic Company at the historic Theatre Royal in Bristol,
or they may tour the various towns and villages in the locality, playing from one to
several nights in each place and using any building which can be made suitable for
the purpose. The London Children’s Theatre, a non-profit-making organization,
presents children’s plays in London and the provinces. The Open Air Theatre in
Regent’s Park, London, is used for a summer season of repertory, mainly of
Shakespeare and other poetic drama. The Ulster Group Theatre in Belfast
specializes in Irish drama. Inevitably, the work of repertory companies varies in
quality but, generally speaking, the standard of both production and acting is
high; many of the leading dramatists, producers and actors in the United Kingdom
started their careers with companies of this kind.
Both in London and in the provinces, most managers and artists are members of
one or another of the professional organizations which exist to maintain the stan¬
dards of the professional theatre, to regulate the industry and to promote and safe¬
guard the welfare of those who work in it. Organizations of this kind include the
London Theatre Council, the Provincial Theatre Council, the Society of West
End Managers, the Theatrical Managers’ Association, the Council of Repertory
Theatres, British Actors’ Equity (the actors’ trade union), and the League of
Dramatists. The trade union of theatre staffs is the National Association of
Theatrical and Kine Employees.
The Society for Theatre Research brings together those interested in the history
and technique of the British theatre.
Amateur Theatre
The amateur dramatic movement is widespread throughout the United Kingdom;
there are thousands of amateur dramatic societies. The movement is sponsored and
fostered by local education authorities, by other public bodies, and by four special
organizations—the British Drama League, the Standing Conference of Drama
Associations, the Scottish Community Drama Association, and the Ulster Drama
League.
The British Drama League, which was founded in 1919, operates on a basis of
affiliation and individual membership. Its many services to its members include
organizing courses, lectures and competitions in dramatic work; running an infor¬
mation bureau; and giving advice on many matters connected with the stage, e.g.,
395
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
play-writing, production, stage management and the organization of drama festivals.
The work of the Standing Conference is mainly that of co-ordination between the
various bodies concerned in the amateur dramatic movement; while the Scottish
Community Drama Association fulfils, in Scotland, the functions of both the
League and the Conference and is supported by the Scottish Education Department.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge have famous dramatic societies, and
there are drama clubs and societies in many other universities and colleges.
Dramatic Training
Dramatic training is provided mainly in the large number of dramatic schools
and institutions of all kinds which have been established throughout the United
Kingdom. Among the most important of such institutions are the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Art (which was founded in 1904 and is now grant-aided, and which
provides a two-year course in all branches of stage work), the Central School of
Speech Training and Dramatic Art, the Webber-Douglas School, the London
School of Music and Dramatic Art, the Sadler’s Wells School (which provides a
general education and training for the ballet), the Royal Academy of Dancing, all of
which are in or near London; and the Old Vic School in Bristol.
Some form of education in drama is also provided in many of the schools and
youth clubs of Britain, and a varying degree of recognition is given to the subject
in the universities. Bristol University leads in this direction in that it has created a
Department of Drama offering a course which an Arts student may take as part of
his or her general degree.
FILMS
The first cinematograph exhibition in Britain was given in 1896 and within ten
years Britain was in the forefront of film production. This early ascendancy did not
survive the impact of the first world war and since 1914 British films have had to
contend with keen American competition. Legislation, first introduced in 1927 and
continued by the Cinematograph Films Acts of 1938 and 1948, has given some
assistance by means of the quota system, under which a certain proportion of
British films must be shown in British cinemas each year. The proportion is fixed
annually by Board of Trade Order, after consultation with the Cinematograph
Films Council, and is subject to confirmation by Parliament.
During the second world war the British cinema re-emerged with new vitality
and began again to exert an important influence on film development by the pro¬
duction of many notable feature films depicting Britain s ordeals and achievements
in the war. These films were based on the documentary technique which had been
developed since 1929 for the making of factual informative films sponsored by the
Government or by commercial organizations. British feature films in the post-war
years have been influenced by this trend, and realistic treatment is now a charac¬
teristic of British feature production, both in dramatic films and in the light-hearted
satirical comedies that have won acclaim in recent years.
The art of film production is a costly one which depends upon a commercially
prosperous industry for its development and well-being, and needs adequate finan¬
cial backing combined with freedom for the film maker to experiment and to express
his own ideas. There is no State-owned feature production unit in Britain, but
the National Film Finance Corporation is empowered to lend money for film
production. The Corporation was established for a period of five years under the
Cinematograph Film Production (Special Loans) Act, 1949- In 1954 another Act
extended its life for a further three years. Its members a chairman, a managing
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
396
director, and three to five others—are appointed by the Board of Trade. Its funds
(limited by statute to £8 million) are provided, up to £6 million, by advances from
the Board of Trade; the remaining £2 million may be borrowed from non-
Governmental sources.
Another financial aid to film-making is provided by the British Film Production
Fund (the Eady Fund). Money for the Fund is raised by a levy on cinema admis¬
sions, and is paid out as a percentage of a film’s takings. Thus the more successful a
film is at the box-office, the more it receives from the Fund. The British Film
Production Fund, which was started in September 1950, is non-statutory and exists
as the result of a renewable agreement between the various trade associations,
subject to Board of Trade approval. The present agreement continues the life of the
Fund until the end of July 1957-
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film Institute
which is financed by Exchequer grants. The Institute administers the National
Film Archive and the National Film Theatre in London.
The number of production companies, studios and, to a lesser extent, cinemas in
Britain varies with the financial state of the film industry. In 1955 there were 37
feature production companies belonging to the British Film Producers’ Association,
56 short film or specialized film producers belonging to the Association of
Specialized Film Producers, and approximately 4,700 cinemas.
MUSIC, OPERA AND BALLET
In Britain today, music in all its forms is drawing large audiences; and orchestral
concerts, choral singing, music festivals, opera and ballet are important features of
British cultural life.
The British Council has done much to make British music and ballet companies
more widely known throughout the world. Tours of British orchestras, soloists and
opera and ballet companies are arranged, recordings of works by British composers
are sponsored, and libraries of British music (recorded and in printed score) are
maintained in 57 countries overseas. At the Council’s headquarters in London, a
central music reference library of music literature, scores and recorded music is
maintained for the use of visitors. Distinguished musicians from overseas are
invited to Britain as guests of the Council to gain some first-hand experience of
British music and musicians, and extensive arrangements are made to cover each
individual interest.
Music
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in all the large towns and
cities of Britain, some of which have well-known concert halls. In London, the
principal concert halls are the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank of the Thames,
which was opened in 1951 in connection with the Festival of Britain; the Royal
Albert Hall, Kensington; and Wigmore Hall, which is the premier recital centre.
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Symphony Orchestra, the
BBC Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic,
the Philharmonia, the Halle (Manchester), the Liverpool Philharmonic, the City
of Birmingham Orchestra, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, the Scottish
National Orchestra and the BBC Scottish Orchestra. There are also the specialized
string orchestras such as the Boyd Neel Orchestra and the Jacques Orchestra; and
a number of new orchestras which have been formed during the past few years.
Many of these orchestras receive financial aid from the Arts Council, to assist in the
cost of maintaining ensembles, of presenting new or unfamiliar works, and of
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 397
improving standards generally. The City of Belfast Orchestra is financed jointly by
the Belfast Corporation and CEMA.
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC Choral,
the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the
London Philharmonic Choir, and the Bach Choir. These and many other choral
societies are associated with famous orchestras in major choral works; most of
them, together with hundreds of similar choral and orchestral societies and music
clubs, are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies, through which
they are supported with funds provided by the Arts Council.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in existence
for over 200 years. The festival idea has developed considerably in recent years, and
festivals of music and other arts are now held annually in many cities and towns
throughout the United Kingdom. They range from the famous Edinburgh Inter¬
national Festival of Music and Drama, which lasts three weeks and attracts many
thousands of visitors, to those, such as the Aldeburgh Festival, lasting a week or
less. Among the better known are the Llangollen International Eisteddfod; the
National Eisteddfod of Wales; the National Gaelic Mod held at a different place
in Scotland each year; the Cheltenham Festival, devoted to contemporary British
music; and the Leeds and Norwich Festivals of choral music, which are held on a
triennial basis. An annual international festival of folk song and dancing is held by
the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is increasing. It is encouraged by the work of
County Music Committees,1 which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust and united in the Standing Conference of Music Committees.
Professional organizations, which look after the interests of music and musicians,
include the Musicians’ Union, the Incorporated Society of Musicians, the Com¬
posers’ Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild.
Specialized education in music is given at Colleges of Music, of which the most
prominent are the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music in
London, the Royal Manchester College, and the Royal Scottish Academy in
Glasgow, all of which receive grants-in-aid. There are also the Trinity College of
Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. Youth orchestras
are strongly encouraged, and children’s concerts, given by symphony orchestras
directed by prominent conductors, are a regular feature of the country’s musical
activities and have helped to develop among the youth of the community an appre¬
ciation of the world’s greatest music. The National Youth Orchestra, made up of
the most promising of the younger musicians, is noted for its high standard of
performance.
Opera and Ballet
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, which is leased by the Government2 to the Covent Garden Opera 1 rust,
which was formed in 1944 to make the famous opera house the home of a national
opera and ballet, and which receives a Government grant through the Arts Council.
The Royal Opera House has its own resident opera company and ballet company
(the Sadler’s Wells Ballet) which give performances both in London and elsewhere.
1 Some of these are voluntary committees and some are local education authority
sub-committees.
2 The Ministry of Works acquired a 42-year lease from Covent Garden Properties
Limited in 1949.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
398
The opera company, which numbers about 200 and has a permanent orchestra,
makes an annual tour of provincial centres; and the Sadler’s Wells Ballet has a high
international reputation gained during its visits in recent years to Canada and the
United States and through its European tours, arranged by the British Council.
Seasons of opera and ballet are also given at the Sadler’s Wells Theatre in
London, which, like the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, has its own opera
company and ballet company (the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet); and at Glynde-
boume in Sussex, an opera season, for which a company is specially assembled, is
held every year. Other opera companies include the Carl Rosa, one of the oldest
opera organizations in Britain; the English Opera Group, formed in 1947, and
noted for its small-scale performances of opera; and Intimate Opera, which tours
the provinces, giving performances in any hall available and introducing opera to
those who have hitherto been unfamiliar with it. There are also a number of
amateur opera clubs both in London and in the provinces, including the City Opera
Club (of London) and the Welsh National Opera Company, which is an amateur
society reinforced with professional soloists. Among the ballet companies are the
Ballet Rambert, the Festival Ballet and the recently established Ballet Comique.
Training in ballet is given at the Sadler’s Wells School, which has played a large
part in raising British ballet to its present high standard.
XIII. SOUND AND
TELEVISION BROADCASTING
Sound broadcasting services in the United Kingdom are undertaken solely by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which was created as a public corporation
by Royal Charter in 1927. The British Broadcasting Corporation was also solely
responsible for the television transmission services until September 1955, when an
alternative television service, controlled by the Independent Television Authority
(ITA), first came into operation (see p. 406). . .
The BBC derives its legal powers to maintain broadcasting stations from its
Licence and Agreement with the Postmaster-General. The Agreement contains
financial clauses and also certain general provisions concerning the manner in which
the broadcasting services should be operated. The basis of the ITA s operations is
a statutory one and is set out in the Television Act, 1954- The Postmaster-General
also licenses the Authority to operate its television transmitters.
It has from the first been the agreed policy of Parliament that the BBC and the
ITA should be free from control in the daily conduct of their business, including
both the content of programmes and general administration. Thus, although ar la¬
ment retains ultimate control and the Postmaster-General as the responsible
Minister, is answerable to Parliament on broad questions of policy, the Corporation
and the Authority have full freedom and responsibility for the day-to-day manage¬
ment of their affairs. .
Users of receiving sets must obtain licences from the Post Office. The annual
licence for the reception of sound broadcasting costs £t (except in the case of
registered blind persons whose licences are free); the licence for sound and tele¬
vision together costs £3 (except in the case of registered blind persons whose
licences cost £2). One licence covers all the receiving sets in a household, but a
separate licence is required for a set fitted in a motor car.
The number of current receiving licences in the United Kingdom at the end of
March 1955 was: sound 9,476,73° (including 62,506 free to blind persons, and
267,794 for sets fitted in cars), and television 4,5°3,766, making a total of 13,980,496.
By the end of September 1955 the total was 14,154,439, of which 4,883,849 licences
were for television sets.
THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION
Policy and Constitution . .
The policy of the BBC is governed by its Charter, granted for successive limited
periods, which establishes the BBC as a corporate body and refers to the value of
its services as a means of disseminating information, education and entertainment.
Under the current charter, which came into force on 1st July 1952 and expires in
1962 the Corporation consists of nine Governors (including a Chairman Vice-
chairman and national Governors for Scotland, Wales, and Northern ^
appointed for a period of not more than five years on a part-time basis by Orders-
in-Council on the advice of the Prime Minister. Subject to the parliamentary and
ministerial control described above, the Governors are responsible as a corporate
body for taking all final decisions regarding both sound and television broadcasting
services.
399
400
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In the discharge of this duty the Governors are advised by the Director-General,
who is the chief executive officer of the Corporation and with whom they must
discuss all major matters of policy and finance. The BBC’s Board of Management is
made up of the Director-General and six Directors, one of whom acts as chief
assistant to the Director-General, the other five being responsible, under the
Director-General, for Home Sound Broadcasting, Television Broadcasting, External
Broadcasting, Technical Services, and Administration. The number of staff em¬
ployed at 30th June 1955 was 13,789 (including 680 part-time personnel).
The BBC studies the needs and reactions of listeners through its Audience
Research system; it is assisted by 31 advisory bodies and is constantly consulting
outside authorities and experts, but its decisions are its own. In its various activities
the BBC devolves responsibility at all levels to the greatest extent consistent with
agreed policy and with its high standards of quality.
Finance
The services of the BBC are financed from (1) annual grants from the Exchequer
related wholly or partly to revenue derived from the sale (by the Post Office) of
wireless receiving licences; (2) profits from the BBC publications, mainly the
Radio Times, which has a weekly sale of over 8 million copies and attracts a large
advertising revenue; (3) a grant-in-aid from the Exchequer for the External
Services.
Before the second world war all the BBC’s operations were financed out of its
proportion of licence income. During the war it was completely financed by grant-
in-aid; but, as from 1st January 1947, the pre-war system of financing out of licence
income was restored for all home broadcasting services including television.
An Agreement of June 1954 provided that, for the next three years, the
Exchequer would retain £2 million each year from the licence revenue, and the
Post Office would receive its actual expenses, estimated at £1,500,000 a year, to
cover the cost of collecting licence fees and dealing with interference. In addition, up
to £750>000 a year might be allowed for the use of the Independent Television
Authority, otherwise it reverts to the Exchequer. The rest of the licence revenue
goes to the BBC.
The gross revenue from the sale of broadcast receiving licences during the year
ended 31st March 1955 amounted to £22,441,288 from which the Corporation
received a net income of £18,943,844.
Net revenue from publications in the year ended 31st March 1955 amounted to
£1,772,205 and grant-in-aid receipts were £5,015,000.
THE SOUND SERVICES
Sound broadcasting services provided by the BBC at home and overseas are as
follows:
For Home Listeners
The BBC provides three main services for home listeners:
1. The Home Service, running continuously from 6.25 a.m. (7.50 a.m. on
Sundays) to 11.8 p.m., is a carefully balanced programme designed to
appeal to all sections of the community. It is the vehicle for the majority of
the BBC’s most important talks, for plays, concerts, documentary features
and religious broadcasts, and also for all the educational broadcasts to
schools (see p. 342). Many national and sporting events are broadcast from
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
401
the scene of action. The Home Service also includes controversial discus¬
sions, and time is allotted for party political broadcasts in a ratio agreed
with the principal political parties.1
Linked with this basic Home Service are the six Regional Home Services
covering Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and the North, Midlands,
and West of England. These services carry many of the major items of the
basic Home Service, but also include their own programmes produced
within the region. Material is freely interchangeable over this network.
2. The Light Programme, running continuously from 9.0 a.m. (8.0 a.m. on
Sundays) to midnight, is devoted to entertainment in the widest sense, and
includes commentaries on every form of sport. It contains also a more
serious element including book reviews, discussions, and some classical
music.
3. The Third Programme, running continuously from 6.0 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.
(and from 3 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. on Sundays during the winter months), is a
cultural programme specially designed for the serious listener. It broad¬
casts, without regard to length or difficulty, programmes of music, art and
letters (including lesser known works) likely to be of particular interest to
such listeners, and it provides series of lectures by eminent speakers. It has
been in operation since 29th September 1946.
News. Five news bulletins are broadcast daily in the Home Service and three in
the Light Programme; in addition, a late night news summary is given on botn
programmes. For its sources of news, the Corporation relies on the leading news
agencies, the BBC’s correspondents at home and abroad, and the monitoring
service.
VHP Transmissions
Since 15th March 1950 the BBC has operated on the wavelengths allocated in
the Copenhagen Broadcasting Agreement.2 There is, however, serious and increas¬
ing interference from transmitters on the Continent (the number of broadcasting
transmitters in Europe is now almost double the number provided for in the
Copenhagen Plan) and the BBC has begun to reinforce existing long and medium
wave services by a network of Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, using
frequency modulation. The BBC estimates that it will need more than 7° of these
transmitters, placed at some 26 stations, to make the greatly improved reception
ensured by the VHF system available to 98 per cent of the population. Each VHF
station will transmit the Home, Light and Third Programmes on the broadcasting
frequencies in the VHF band of 87‘5 to 95 megacycles per second.
In May 1955 the first VHF station was opened at Wrotham in Kent. Ten more
stations are expected to be in service by the end of 1956, including one temporary
station. This will complete the first stage of VHF development and will cover
1A direction issued by the Postmaster-General in July 1955 laid down officially that no
BBC or ITA broadcast (other than such party political broadcasts) should discuss or make
ex parte statements on issues to be debated in either House of Parliament within a period
of 14 days before such debates take place. , , , . _ , . 0 , ,
2 A European Regional Broadcasting Conference held in Copenhagen in 1948 produced
a plan to minimize interference between medium and long wave broadcasting stations by
allocating wavelengths to individual transmitters in such a way that stations sharing wave¬
lengths, or using adjacent wavelengths, were so far from each other that interference with
reception in their respective service areas should be negligible. The maximum power of
each transmitter and the precision with which its allotted frequency must be maintained
are also specified in the Plan, which came into operation on 15th March 1950.

83 per cent of the population. Government approval for the construction of further
stations has been given.
External Services
The general purposes of the BBC in all its broadcasts to listeners within the
Commonwealth or in other lands, is to form a link of information, culture and
entertainment; to give news of world-wide importance; to show what the British
nation as a whole is thinking about the news; and to reflect the British way of life.
The BBC is entirely responsible for the content of the External Service broad¬
casts, but the relevant Government Departments prescribe the countries to which
services are to be directed and the time on the air to be allotted to each.
In its news services, the BBC has established a reputation for objectivity and
integrity. Every day a hundred news bulletins are directed to listeners overseas.
English by Radio lessons are a regular part of many of the transmissions in the
External Services.
The External Services of the BBC include:
1. The General Overseas Service in English (the descendant of the original
‘Empire Service’, begun in 1932) which is addressed to audiences in every
part of the Commonwealth, to British forces serving abroad, and to British
communities wherever they may be. It also has a large audience among
English-speaking people of many nationalities throughout the world. The
General Overseas Service, which is on the air for twenty-one hours in every
twenty-four, gives a complete programme service from news to light enter¬
tainment, and many of the programmes are taken from the domestic output.
2. Special Services directed to the Commonwealth in English and other
languages.
3. Services directed to foreign countries, mainly broadcast in the languages
concerned. The BBC now broadcasts in 43 languages other than English.
4. The Transcription Service, which records selected BBC programmes in
London, drawing on the entire output of the domestic and External Services.
These recordings are distributed to radio organizations all over the world
for re-broadcasting locally.
Oversea Offices
The BBC maintains oversea offices in Berlin, Bonn, Cairo, New Delhi, New York,
Paris, Singapore, Sydney, Toronto and Ottawa. Their purpose is to meet the pro¬
gramme requirements of the Home and External Services, to encourage local
stations to re-broadcast BBC transmissions and transcription recordings and to
disseminate information about the BBC External Services.
Apart from the oversea offices, the BBC maintains a high-power short wrave relay
station for South-East Asia, at Tebrau in the Federation of Malaya.
BBC TELEVISION SERVICES
Development
Experiments in television broadcasting started in Britain in the autumn of 1929,
and in November 1936 the BBC began to give from Alexandra Palace, London, the
first public service of high definition television in any part of the world. By
September 1939 (when the Alexandra Palace station was closed down for military
reasons) the programme technique had made considerable progress and the number
of receiving sets was approximately 20,000.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Television Service was reopened in June 1946 and by December 1952 five
high-power transmitting stations, capable of reaching some four-fifths of the popu¬
lation, were in operation: Alexandra Palace covering London and the Home
Counties; Sutton Coldfield covering the Midlands; Holme Moss covering the
North of England; Kirk o’ Shotts covering Central Scotland; and Wenvoe covering
South Wales and parts of the West of England.
The national coverage is now being extended by the building of six medium-
power and seven low-power permanent stations. By the end of 1955, three of the
medium-power stations were completed and, together with temporary low-power
stations which were already in operation, have extended television coverage to 94 per
cent of the population. This is a far higher proportion than has yet been achieved in
any other country.1
The three medium-power stations completed before the end of 1955 are at Pontop
Pike (Tyneside), Divis (Northern Ireland) and Meldrum (in the north-east of
Scotland), replacing temporary transmitters in these areas. In 1956, temporary
transmitters at Rowridge (Isle of Wight), North Hessary Tor (South Devon) and at
Norwich will also be replaced by permanent medium-power stations. A low-power
station is in operation in the Isle of Man, which will later be replaced by a perma¬
nent one of somewhat greater power, and a further low-power station came into
service in the Channel Islands in September 1955. To complete the BBC’s plan for
18 stations, low-power stations are to be built near Dover, Inverness, London¬
derry, Carlisle and Blaen Plwy (West Wales). In addition, a new and more powerful
London station, to replace Alexandra Palace, is being built on the Crystal Palace
site and will incorporate the most modern transmission technique; it is scheduled to
begin operation early in 1956, using a temporary mast and aerial. This programme
of construction will result in BBC television coverage for 98 per cent of the popula¬
tion of the United Kingdom by 1957.
The BBC has put forward proposals, subject to Government approval, and pro¬
vided that the necessary transmission channels can be made available, to inaugurate
a second BBC television service.
The BBC is building, on a 13-acre site at Shepherds Bush in London, a set of
studios and accompanying office accommodation which will, it is hoped, be the
‘ best television centre in the world ’. The existing television studios at Lime Grove
and the Television Theatre, near Shepherds Bush, are to be re-equipped with
modem cameras and associated apparatus. Two film studios at Hammersmith,
London, have been acquired and are being converted into television studios. In
addition to studio facilities in London, the BBC is putting into effect plans for
television studios in its other regions. In Bristol, the largest of the sound studios is
already being used for television productions, and improvements are being made.
Early in 1956 premises in Manchester and Birmingham will also be available for
studio productions—in Birmingham, initially, on a ‘drive in’ basis, which means
that equipment from the Midland outside broadcast vehicle will be unloaded and
used in the studio. In Cardiff, premises are being acquired which will provide a
‘ drive in ’ studio pending the provision of permanent equipment.
Programmes
Regular television programmes are broadcast daily by the BBC between 3.0 p.m.
and 11 p.m. There are intervals in each day’s transmissions which limit actual
1 In the five years from January 1950 to December 1954, the numbers of television
licences increased nearly twentyfold, and by the end of October 1955 one out of every
three homes possessed a television set.
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 4°5
viewing time to about 49 hours a week. In addition to these basic transmission
hours, outside broadcasts of national occasions, public events, and sporting fixtures
add to the viewing time, particularly in the summer months.
The BBC provides a daily television programme for children, and an experi¬
mental television service for schools is being planned. The first transmissions are
to begin in the autumn of 1957. Local education authorities will equip enough
schools with television sets to justify the inauguration of this experimental service,
which, at first, will provide two or three transmissions a week.
Research
The BBC maintains a Research Department the main function of which is to
solve technical problems in broadcasting, particularly those which will arise in the
course of future development. The department covers the whole field of broad¬
casting, including such subjects as acoustics, recording, aerials, wave propagation,
and the specialized problems of television. During the past few years attention has
been focused on the problems of colour television; considerable progress has been
made and experimental colour transmissions were introduced in the autumn of
1955. The choice of system to be used when a colour television public service
is introduced rests with the Postmaster-General, who will be advised by the
Television Advisory Committee. Before such a service is begun, the BBC is com¬
mitted to the completion of its plan for 98 per cent coverage in black and white
television, using the existing British 405-line standard.
The technical quality of the monochrome pictures now transmitted has been
steadily improved as a result of the BBC’s research and design activities.
Eurovision
During 1954 and 1955 a successful series of European television programme
exchanges took place using, in many instances, temporary equipment to link
together the countries taking part. In January 1955 the BBC ordered from the
Post Office a permanent two-way television link with France of which the first
section was completed by September 1955- The section consists of coaxial cables
joining London with the coast at St. Margarets Bay in Kent. The next section will
be a two-way radio link across the Channel, but this is unlikely to be completed
before 1958. Meanwhile, the provision of a temporary two-way radio link across
the Channel, installed and operated by the BBC and Radiodiffusion-Television
Fran9aises, has facilitated a further series of programme exchanges which began in
the autumn of 1955.
INDEPENDENT TELEVISION SERVICES
The development of the broadcasting services has from the outset been assisted
by the recommendations of successive independent committees of inquiry set up
by the Government, e.g., the Crawford Committee (1926) which recommended the
establishment of the BBC; the Selsdon Committee (1935) which recommended the
establishment of a high definition public television service to be run by the BBC;
and the Beveridge Committee (1951) which made recommendations designed to
guard against the evils of monopoly, but was in favour of maintaining the BBC
in much its present form as ‘something of which the country might be proud .
The idea of the public corporation as the most suitable administrative device
for the sound broadcasting services has, in fact, hardly ever been challenge ,
but since the issue in May 1952 of the Memorandum on Broadcasting (Cmd. 8550)
which contained Government proposals for introducing competition in television,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
406
discussions on the pros and cons of an alternative system for television services
have frequently been held in Parliament, in the press and by the general public.
In the 1952 Memorandum no details were published of the terms and conditions
under which competitive television would operate; and although it was stated that
safeguards would be established against possible abuses and that a ‘controlling
body would be required for regulating the conduct of the new stations, for exercising
a general oversight of the programmes and for advising on appropriate matters’,
a considerable body of opinion feared that the introduction of private enterprise
into a sphere of activity hitherto controlled by a public corporation might lead to a
debasing of entertainment standards.
On the other hand, there were many people who welcomed the idea of competi¬
tion, agreeing with the Government that ‘as television has great and increasing
power in influencing men’s minds, its control should not remain in the hands of a
single authority, however excellent that authority may be’.
The proposals outlined by the Government in the Memorandum on Television
Policy (Cmd. 9005), published in November 1953, were designed to reconcile these
two opposing viewpoints by combining effective control with greater freedom; and,
at the same time, to reduce to a minimum the financial commitments of the State.
Most of these proposals were embodied in the Television Act, I954-
THE INDEPENDENT TELEVISION AUTHORITY
The Television Act, 1954, set up the Independent Television Authority consist¬
ing of a chairman, a deputy chairman and eight ordinary members (three ofwhom
have special responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern
Ireland respectively). The Authority is appointed by the Postmaster-General and
is charged with the duty of providing television services additional to those pro¬
vided by the BBC for a period of ten years until 30th July 1964. The Authority
was established in August 1954.
The Act lays down that the programmes transmitted by the Authority are nor¬
mally to be provided by programme contractors who, on the one hand, receive
revenue from firms which advertise in the intervals of their programmes, and, on
the other, pay rent to the Authority for the use of the transmitters which are owned
and operated by it. Sponsored programmes, i.e. programmes the content of which
is provided or controlled by advertisers, are not allowed. The Authority’s finance
is drawn from the payments made to it by the programme contractors, but advances
may be made by the Postmaster-General with the consent of the Treasury for the
purpose of paying for initial expenses and capital expenditure and of providing the
Authority with working capital. The advances are limited to £1 million during
the first year of the Authority’s existence and to a total of £2 million in all during the
first five years. Any advances thus made will have to be repaid by the Authority out
of the money it receives from the contractors. There is also provision in the
Television Act for an annual Exchequer grant of up to £750,000 to be made to the
Authority.
The Act requires the Authority to ensure that the programmes do not offend
against good taste or decency, that they are balanced in their subject-matter and
that they maintain a high general standard of quality and due impartiality on
matters of public controversy, and that news is presented with accuracy and impar¬
tiality. The Authority must arrange for committees, representative of the organi¬
zations and persons concerned with these matters, to advise it as to the principles
to be followed on religious matters, on standards of advertising, and on the provi¬
sion of programmes for children. In June 1955 the Authority issued a statement
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 4°7
outlining the principles on which control of advertising standards will be exercised.
This was based on the recommendations of the Advertising Advisory Committee.
Under arrangements agreed between the Postmaster-General and the Indepen¬
dent Television Authority, the ITA may transmit programmes for a maximum ot
or hours from Monday to Friday each week and of 15 hours for Saturdays and
Sundays, with a maximum of 8 hours on weekdays and 7f hours on Sundays. ( i hese
limits apply also to BBC television services.)
Programme Contracting Companies
The programme contracts arranged by the ITA in 1955 were with our com¬
panies to provide the programmes for three stations: Associated TeleVision
Limited, operating on Saturdays and Sundays in the London area and on Mondays
to Fridays in the Midlands area; Associated-Rediffusion Limited, opera ing
Mondays to Fridays in the London area; Granada TV Network Limited, operating
Mondays to Fridays in the Lancashire area; and Associated British Cinemas ( e -
vision) Limited, operating on Saturdays and Sundays m the Mid an a
Lancashire areas. . . . ....
The four programme contractors pay a total of approximately £12 million a year
to the ITA for the right to use its transmitters and equipment.
A common news service is provided for the four companies y n epen
Television News Limited.
ITA Stations r
The first regular ITA service was inaugurated in September iQSS Lorn t
Authority's London station at Beaulieu Heights, Croydon. This station serves the
Greater London area with some n million potential ^^^ "^1X000
to be erected near Lichfield, Staffordshire (to serve the Mld'“^ bV!ee”
Chorley and Bolton in Lancashire, and in the Huddersfield/Sheffield area of
Yorkshire. It is expected that the Midland and Lancashire stations w U be in
operation by the spring of 1956. A Scottish station is also pianned and the IT
hopes to open about three stations a year until substantial national coverage
achieved. The Authority’s stations transmit on frequencies m Band

XIV. THE PRESS
The British Press caters for all political views, many different levels of education
and a wide range of interests. It is free from Government censorship and inter¬
ference.
The British public buys more newspapers per person than any other in the world.
For every 1,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom 611 copies of daily papers are
sold every day. Next comes Sweden with 490 per 1,000 inhabitants; in the United
States the figure is 353. Circulation figures of individual newspapers are propor¬
tionately high. For several years the Sunday News of the World has had the
world record newspaper circulation of about eight million copies,1 and at least ■
six of the daily newspapers have circulations in the millions. These high figures are
largely explained by the fact that the London morning papers have ‘national’
circulations, i.e. they are distributed throughout the British Isles, being available
on the day of publication everywhere except in a few outlying islands.
Britain is, however, less well served in the size of newspapers because of the
shortage of newsprint due to the fact that most of it has to be imported and so
involves the expenditure of foreign exchange, especially dollars. This has meant
restriction of supplies in recent years when the balance of payments has been
under pressure. But there has been some improvement: from an average of four
to six pages in the war and immediate post-war period, daily papers have risen to
an average of 8 to 12 pages. Supplies of newsprint rose from about 650,000 tons
in I953 t° 720>000 tons in 1954, and are estimated at 850,000 tons for 1955. In
March 1956 Government control on deliveries of newsprint to newspapers and
other users is to end.
Prices of daily newspapers vary from i^d. for some of the popular morning
papers to 4d. for The Times.
There are over 150 daily and Sunday newspapers: 15 London mornings, 3 London
evenings, 10 London Sundays; 24 mornings, 64 evenings and 4 Sundays in England
outside London; 1 morning and 3 evenings in Wales; 8 mornings, 9 evenings and
3 Sundays in Scotland; 3 mornings and 1 evening in Northern Ireland; 1 Isle of
Man daily and 3 Channel Islands evenings.
There are about 1,350 weekly papers which are published in Greater London
and almost every sizable town in the rest of the country. These papers deal mainly
with news of interest to the region where they are sold. There are also the sporting
papers, papers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other lands resident
in Britain, religious papers, and the junior, or children’s, papers.
In 1947 a Royal Commission on the Press was appointed to inquire into the
finance, control, management and ownership of the British Press. Its report was
issued in June 1949 (Cmd. 77°°) and has been recognized as a comprehensive and
authoritative analysis. Among other recommendations it suggested the establish¬
ment of a General Council of the Press and this was set up in 1953 (see p. 414).
The Commission found that the British Press ‘is completely independent of
outside financial interests and that its policy is the policy of those that conduct it’; j
there was evidence that the direct influence of advertisers on policy was ‘ negligible ’.
After studying management and ownership, the Commission concluded that ‘there
is nothing approaching monopoly in the press as a whole, or ... in any class of
newspaper ’.
1 The only higher circulation is that of the BBC’s weekly Radio Times (8,200,208).

Ownership
As Table 40 shows, several companies or groups own a number of newspapers.
The five largest press groups are: Associated Newspapers Limited, which, with
three London papers, owns through subsidiary companies linked under the
management of Northcliffe Newspapers Group Limited a total of eleven dailies
(with an interest in two more), nine weeklies and one Sunday; Kemsley Newspapers
Limited, which owns nine dailies, five weeklies and four Sundays and has interests
in eight other newspapers1; Westminster Press Group which controls thirteen dailies,
33 weeklies and one Sunday; Provincial Newspapers Limited, which owns four
dailies and twelve weeklies; and the Harmsworth Group, which runs four dailies
and eleven weeklies in the West country.
1 These figures take account of the changes in newspaper control which occurred in
November 1955 when the Daily Mirror and Sunday Pictorial companies acquired from
Kemsley Newspapers the control of the Scottish Daily Record, Sunday Mail and Glasgow
Evening News, and signed a ten-year contract for the use of Kemsley printing plant in
Manchester for northern editions of the Daily Mirror and Sunday Pictorial. The title,
goodwill and copyrights of the Daily Dispatch (Manchester) were bought from Kemsley
Newspapers by Daily News Limited, owners of the News Chronicle. The Sunday Chronicle
was amalgamated with the Sunday Empire News.
THE PRESS
411
Groups also exist in the periodical press; among the best known are the
Amalgamated Press, which publishes 70 trade, technical, women’s and children’s
papers; Odhams Press, which (in addition to two newspapers) publishes about
25 periodicals, including some with very high circulations; George Newnes and
C. Arthur Pearson Limited, which publishes 58 periodicals besides technical books
and papers for many branches of industry; Hulton Press Limited, which publishes
fewer titles but whose magazines have very large circulations; and the Thomson-
Leng group, the largest publishers of magazines in Scotland.
Certain newspapers and periodicals are controlled by trustees whose aim is to
preserve the character and traditions of the paper and prevent control from falling
into unsuitable hands. Various forms of trust govern the direction of The limes,
Manchester Guardian, News Chronicle and Star, Observer, Economist and Spectator.
The ‘National’ Press
Nine morning papers with headquarters in London, and one in Manchester,
are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout the British Isles, and there are
11 ‘national’ Sunday papers (see Table 40). In addition, the leading Scottish papers
(see below) circulate widely, and certain specialized daily papers also have a
circulation not limited by region, e.g., The Financial Times (circulation 78,953). The
three London evening papers each have affiliations with one of the national dailies,
but they draw their readership very largely from people living within fifty miles
of London.
Provincial Newspapers
The provincial newspapers, numbering nearly a hundred morning or evening
dailies and Sunday papers and about 1,100 weeklies provide the general ^nd local
news expected by readers whose daily life and interests are known to and shared
by the newspaper staff. Some 60 provincial papers still in existence were founded
before 1800; the oldest being Berrow's Worcester Journal, dating back to 1709.
With a few exceptions (e.g., Yorkshire Post, Newcastle Journal, Sheffield Telegraph,
Western Mail) they reflect no definite political tendency. The total circulation of
the dailies is estimated at about 9 million and of the weeklies at about 12 million.
The provincial newspaper, often read far more thoroughly than the national daily,
is a valuable medium for national and local advertising.
London suburban weeklies, of which there are about 60, are closer to the
provincial weeklies than to the national dailies in readership and appeal.
Ownership of the provincial press is varied: it includes individual owners, two
or more partner proprietors, local printing and publishing firms, newspaper
companies owning between one and half a dozen papers, or press groups con¬
trolling a chain of newspapers in different parts of the country.
Scotland
Scotland has eight morning, nine evening and three Sunday newspapers. Te
Glasgow Herald, founded in 1783, and The Scotsman, founded in 1817 and pub¬
lished in Edinburgh, are among the organs influencing serious opinion in Great
Britain. The circulation of the former is 76,379 and of the latter 56,091 (average
figures January-June i955)- Other morning papers are The ScotUsh Daily Express
the Scottish Daily Mail, The Daily Record and Mail, The Bulletin (a picture PaPer),
The Courier and Advertiser, and The Press and Journal. Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Dundee and Aberdeen are the centres of publication. Evening papers include the
Edinburgh Evening News and Evening Dispatch, Glasgow’s Evening Lines, Evening
News, and Evening Citizen, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph and Post, Aberdeen s
412
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Evening Express, and the Paisley Daily Press and the Greenock Telegraph. The
Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail, Scottish Sunday Express, and the Sunday Post.
Among the weekly papers are the Weekly Scotsman, the Aberdeen Journal, and
The People’s Journal, which also circulate outside Scotland; in all there are about
120 weekly papers published in Scottish towns.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has three morning papers and one evening paper, all printed
in Belfast. In addition to three newspapers in Londonderry which are each pub¬
lished three times a week, there are 48 weekly papers. The majority are published
by individual companies and all the counties have good coverage of local papers.
There are no Sunday newspapers.
Wales
One daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, a Kemsley newspaper, is
printed and published in Cardiff; it has a circulation of 84,254, mainly in the
southern half of Wales. In North Wales, the Liverpool Daily Post gives wide
coverage to events in the area. Evening papers published in Wales are the South
Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South Wales Argus, Newport, and the South Wales
Evening Post, Swansea. North Wales is served by the Liverpool Echo and Liverpool
Express and to a smaller extent by evening papers published in Manchester, the
Manchester Evening News and the Manchester Evening Chronicle.
Since October 1954 a special Welsh edition of the Sunday Empire News has been
printed in Cardiff. Other national Sunday papers carry columns of news on Welsh
affairs.
The weekly press includes 48 weekly papers in English, some of them carrying
articles in Welsh; nine bilingual papers; and 12 papers in Welsh, of which five
are denominational papers.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
The Channel Islands have three evening papers, one twice-weekly and two
weeklies. The Isle of Man has one daily of which a special weekly edition comes
out on Saturday, and four other weeklies.
Periodicals
Weekly, monthly and quarterly journals cover an enormous field. A salient
feature of the last twenty-five years has been the development of periodicals with a
mass appeal on the one hand, and the growth of the trade press on the other.
There are over 3,500 periodical publications: general magazines with circulations
ranging up to over a million; women’s magazines, which also have large circula¬
tions ; numerous publications for children; religious periodicals of various denomi¬
nations; magazines dealing with sports, hobbies, fiction and humour; periodicals
specializing in various subjects such as politics, finance and economics, science, the
professions, the arts; the large body of trade and technical publications whose
circulations are not confined to the United Kingdom; and lastly, the journals of
learned societies, trade unions, business houses, regiments, universities, colleges,
schools, and other associations.
At the high circulation end of the scale are the popular periodicals, such as
Illustrated, Picture Post, John Bull, Tit-Bits, Reveille for the Week End, Midweek
Reveille, and Week-End Mail; several of these have circulations of a million or more.
Three women’s weeklies {Woman, Woman’s Own and Woman’s Weekly) and one
women’s monthly {Woman and Home) also have circulations in the millions.
THE PRESS
413
Of considerable influence, although their circulations are only in the tens of
thousands, are the weeklies dealing with political, social and economic affairs:
The Economist, which covers topics of the day from a far wider angle than its title
would indicate and is politically independent; The New Statesman and Nation,
a review of politics, literature and the arts with an independent socialist political
tendency; The Spectator, which covers much the same subjects and is non-party;
Time and Tide, which has a right-wing tendency; Tribune, with a left-wing but
strongly anti-communist bias; and Truth, which is extreme right wing in its political
outlook. Other papers whose circulations are in the tens of thousands are the
illustrated weeklies such as The Illustrated London News, The Sphere, The Field,
and Country Life, while Punch is the leading humour periodical. The readership of
all these weeklies is greater than is apparent from their circulation figures, since
they are widely read in libraries, clubs and other institutions.
Monthly and quarterly journals, generally speaking, appeal to the more serious
type of reader, particularly the literary and political journals and those specializing
in international and Commonwealth affairs.
Four monthly illustrated periodicals are published in Scotland: The Scottish
Field Scotland's Magazine, The Scots Magazine (founded 1779) and Scotland-, and
two weeklies devoted to farming interests, The Farming News and The Scottish
Farmer. Among literary journals, probably the most famous are Chambers s and
Blackwood's, both published in Edinburgh.
Popular magazines are numerous: the Thomson-Leng group of Dundee alone
distribute about 10 million copies of weeklies in the British Isles and abroad.
In Northern Ireland, weekly, monthly and quarterly publications cover farming,
the linen industry, building, motoring and politics.
News Agencies
There are three principal British news agencies:
Reuters Ltd., a world agency with offices in many countries, which distributes
foreign and Commonwealth news to British newspapers and foreign and British
news to over 3,000 papers outside Britain. It is owned by the British Press and
three Commonwealth news agencies. All profits are used to develop the service.
Press Association Ltd., which distributes home news. It is owned by British
provincial newspapers. All profits are used to develop the service.
Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd., a public company which distributes home
and foreign news, mainly to British papers.
Two other agencies supply a general service of oversea news.
Associated Press, which is a branch of the Associated Press of America.
British United Press, which is a Canadian subsidiary of the United Press of
America.
There are besides some 60 United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign
agencies and news services with offices in London, specializing in some aspects of
newspaper and periodical requirements.
Training for Journalism
Until recently, and this therefore applies to most newspapermen working today,
journalists were, broadly, of two classes: those who entered newspaper offices on
leaving school and worked their way up, learning by experience; and umversi y
graduates who held some of the specialized posts, such as correspondents abroad
or on special subjects, leader-writers and editorial office staff. The second class has
4T4

always been comparatively small. The Kemsley Newspaper Group made provision
for combining instruction with the practice of journalism, and courses in journalism
were organized by the London Polytechnic, and by King’s College, London (until
the outbreak of war in 1939).
In 1952 an agreement was reached for a more comprehensive plan for the training
and education of junior journalists in newspaper offices. A National Advisory
Council, on which are representatives of the principal press organizations and
unions, was set up to administer the scheme, which is based on the voluntary co¬
operation of newspaper offices. Examinations are taken at two levels, the higher
obtainable only after three years of active journalism.
Press Institutions
Both employers and employees in the industry are well organized. On the
employers’ side, the most important organizations are the Newspaper Proprietors’
Association, whose members are proprietors of London (national) daily and Sunday
newspapers, the Newspaper Society, whose members are proprietors of provincial
daily and weekly newspapers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Scottish
Daily Newspaper Society, the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors’ Association, and
the Periodical Proprietors’ Association. On the employees’ side there are the
National Union of Journalists (NUJ) and the Institute of Journalists (loj). The
National Union of Journalists has a membership of about 13,180 working
journalists; editors who have powers of dismissal are excluded. The Institute of
Journalists, which has a membership of some 12,800, admits editors. Free-lance
journalists (who are not on the staff of any one paper or group of papers but send
contributions to any journal) may belong to the NUJ or loj. The aims of these
organizations are the improvement of wages and working conditions of journalists
and of the status of the Press.
The aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are, inter alia, to sustain
the dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of editors,
to protect the rights and freedom of the Press, and to improve the education and
training of junior journalists.
The largest of other organizations directly connected with the Press is the
National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA), which has
a varied membership connected with the production of newspapers and periodicals;
in addition to the groups indicated by the title of the society, its membership
includes clerical workers, dispatch hands and similar personnel. The largest of the
Printers’ Unions concerned is the London Typographical Society.
The General Council of the Press
Following the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Press, a
Press Council representative of the various Press organizations was set up in 1953.
Its aims are:
to preserve the established freedom of the British Press;
to maintain the character of the British Press in accordance with the highest
professional and commercial standards;
to keep under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of informa¬
tion of public interest and importance;
to promote and encourage methods of recruitment, education and training of
journalists;
to promote a proper functional relation among all sections of the profession;
THE PRESS
415
to promote technical and other research;
to study developments in the British Press which may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly;
to publish periodical reports recording its own work and reviewing from time
to time the various developments in the British Press and the factors
affecting them.
The Council consists of eight editorial representatives, four nominees of the
National Union of Journalists, three nominees of the Institute of Journalists, and
ten managerial representatives.
The Press and the Law
The Press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say what
it likes provided it does not transgress the law; and in general it enjoys very great
liberty of comment on matters of public interest. T. here are no special press laws
(other than those relating to such matters as the registration of newspapers), but
requirements which affect the Press occur in a variety of Acts of Parliament; for
example, the admission of the Press to meetings of local authorities is regulated by
the Local Government Acts and restrictions on the reporting of domestic proceed¬
ings and proceedings against juveniles are imposed by legislation governing pro¬
cedure in the law courts.
In particular, the Press must comply with the copyright laws and with the laws
against the publication of matters protected by the Official Secrets Acts, with the
laws of seditious libel, blasphemous and obscene libel, and defamation, with the
laws for the protection of children from publications which might do them moral
harm,1 and against fraudulent advertising, against breach of Parliamentary privi¬
lege, and against ‘contempt of court’—publication of anything affecting a case
before the courts which might tend to influence the result of the trial, or of com¬
ment on court proceedings which might tend to prejudice their reputation for
justice. ,
Public prosecutions of the Press for offences against these laws are nowadays
rare; the majority of such legal actions as do take place are brought by private
individuals seeking to protect their own interests, for example against libel. In any
legal action the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and distributor of the news¬
paper, as well as the author of the article, can all be held responsible.
