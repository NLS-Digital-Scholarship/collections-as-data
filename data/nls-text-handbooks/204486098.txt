INTRODUCTION
Britain 1970 is the twenty-first official handbook in the series prepared
and revised each year by Reference Division of the Central Office of
Information with the co-operation of other government departments and of
many national organisations. The handbook is widely known as an established
work of reference and is the mainstay of the reference facilities provided by
the British Information Services in many countries. It is available overseas
in a limited free edition and is on sale throughout the world.
This 1970 edition, which covers events up to September 1969, gives a
factual account of the administration and the national economy of Britain.
It describes the activities of many of the national institutions, both official
and unofficial, and shows the part played by the Government in the life of
the community.
The handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt
to cover Britain’s participation in Commonwealth or world affairs. The
factual and statistical information it contains is compiled from official and
other authoritative sources, and, while most sections of the book relate to
Britain as a whole, facts and figures for England, Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland are also given separately when relevant.
Readers who require more detailed information should consult the Annual
Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics, issued by the Central
Statistical Office, and also other government publications and standard
works of reference, some of which are listed in the bibliography towards the
end of the handbook. Readers are asked to note that the Central Office of
Information reference documents listed in the bibliography as free and
marked with an asterisk are available free of charge only at British Information
Offices overseas; they can, however, be obtained in Britain from Reference
Division, Central Office of Information, on payment of a small charge.

ADDENDUM
MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT
The main changes in the machinery of government since 30th September 1969, which
are not covered in the text, are:
Government Departments
The Department of Economic Affairs (see p. 49) has been discontinued.
The Ministry of Technology (see p. 56) has been merged with the Ministry of Power
(see p. 54), and at the same time has become the government department with the
main responsibility for industry both in the public and private sectors. Its new respon¬
sibilities include (a) responsibility for all primary fuels and plant industries for
electricity generation, together with other power and energy supply and plant industries,
(b) responsibility for all general questions relating to mineral development in both
public and private industries (except those which are closely linked with the construction
industry, (c) the responsibilities previously vested in the Department of Economic
Affairs in the field of regional economic development, (d) the distribution of industry
functions of the Board of Trade (see p. 56), (e) responsibility for the Industrial
Reorganisation Corporation (see p. 241), and (f) responsibility for investment grants.
The Department of Employment and Productivity (see p. 49) has assumed respon¬
sibility for a number of bodies concerned with the provision of certain of the productivity
services previously handled by the Board of Trade.
The Board of Trade continues to be responsible for overseas trade and export
promotion and for trade and commerce in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government has assumed the responsibilities
for regional planning and the organisation of the Regional Economic Planning Councils
and Regional Economic Planning Boards (see p. 238) previously vested in the Depart¬
ment for Economic Affairs.
The Treasury has assumed responsibility for medium- and long-term economic
assessment previously vested in the Department of Economic Affairs. It has also
assumed co-ordinating responsibility for those aspects of the National Economic
Development Council (NEDC—see p. 237) which relate to the process of preparing,
producing and following up planning documents and for co-ordinating the consultations
between department and industry on these.
The Cabinet Office has assumed responsibility for co-ordinating advice on the
content and priorities of the NEDC, and for supervising the Vote and staffing of the
National Economic Development Office.
Ministerial Appointments
A Secretary of State for Local Government and Regional Planning has been appointed
to co-ordinate the work of the Ministries of Housing and Local Government (see p. 52)
and Transport (see p. 57). The Minister has direct responsibility for regional planning
questions and special responsibility in relation to all aspects of environmental pollution,
and is in charge of the negotiations following the Maud report (see p. 66). The Ministry
of Housing and Local Government and the Ministry of Transport continue to exercise
their statutory functions and are responsible to the Minister of Housing and Local
Government and the Minister of Transport respectively.
Ministers of State
There are now three Ministers of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and
the Department of Education and Science, and two at the Ministry of Technology,
the Scottish Office, the Board of Trade, and the Department of Health and Social
Security. There is also a Minister of State with special responsibility for the North,
assisting the Secretary of State for Local Government and Regional Planning, and
there is one Minister of State at the Home Office, the Welsh Office, the Treasury, the
Ministry of Housing and Local Government, and the Department of Employment
and Productivity, respectively.
December 1969
1 THE LAND AND THE
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe with
a total area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest islands are Great
Britain proper (comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland)
and Ireland (comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west
are the Isles of Scilly; off North Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is
fringed by numerous islands and to the far north are the important groups of
the Orkneys and Shetlands. All these form administrative counties or parts
of counties of the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the
Channel Islands between Great Britain and France have a large measure of
administrative autonomy and are not part of England, Wales, Scotland or
Northern Ireland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border) has a
total area (including inland water) of 50,332 square miles and is divided into
39 geographical or 46 administrative counties; Wales (including Monmouth¬
shire), with a total area of 8,016 square miles, has 13 counties; Scotland,
including its 186 inhabited islands, has a total area of 30,412 square miles and
is divided into 33 counties; Northern Ireland, consisting of six counties, has
a total area of 5,452 square miles. Together, these countries constitute the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (or Britain), with a
total area of 94,212 square miles. The total land area of the United Kingdom
(excluding inland water) is 93,025 square miles: England 50,056; Wales and
Monmouthshire, 7,967; Scotland, 29,796; and Northern Ireland, 5,206.
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they
refer to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together
for many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which com¬
prises England, Wales and Scotland, or to Britain (the United Kingdom) as
a whole. The position is further complicated by the fact that the county of
Monmouth is sometimes included with England. United Kingdom statistics
and other data sometimes include the Isle of Man, 227 square miles, and the
Channel Islands, 75 square miles, which strictly are not part of the United
Kingdom but are dependencies of the Crown. Since southern Ireland became
independent, official statistics do not normally refer to the British Isles as a
whole.
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old Observatory of Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly i° 45' East and the westernmost point
of Ireland is approximately io° 30' West. It is just under 600 miles in a
straight line from the south coast of Britain to the extreme north and rather

over 300 miles across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous bays and
inlets no point in the British Isles is as much as 75 miles from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less
than 50 fathoms (300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental shelf.
To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly
from 600 feet to 3,000 feet. These shallow waters are important because they
provide excellent fishing grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish.
The North Atlantic Current, the drift of warm water which reaches the
islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out over the shelf and its ameliorating
effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect of tidal movement is also
increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main
geological periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant
to weather and have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south
and east, and the island can therefore be divided roughly into two main
regions, Lowland Britain and Highland Britain.
In Lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern
England have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and
rising to chalk and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet
above sea level. Its boundaries run roughly from the mouth of the Tyne in the
north-east of England to the mouth of the Exe in the south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and
moors of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands,
which extend from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the
Lake District in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the
Pennines, almost the whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of
England coinciding approximately with the counties of Devon and Cornwall.
Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of Great Britain and
extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet. This high ground, however,
is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains. Geologically the
mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old rocks (archaean
and palaeozoic), while the top strata in the valleys and plains are mainly more
recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern and western
parts of Lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal
measures which have been the foundation of Britain s industrial expansion.
The outcrops and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted
were found on the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high
land. Most of the present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors
of present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age,
and at one period or another during this time the whole of Britain north of
a line joining the river Thames and the Bristol Channel was covered by ice
caps and ice sheets. The ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground and
swept from the mountains of Scotland, northern England and Wales any
loose rock or soil which had previously been formed, so that, when the ice
eventually disappeared, the hills stood out as barren rocky areas, while a
thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders, boulder-clay, sands and gravels
lay distributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had blocked up previous

drainage channels and left large lakes, which have since gradually dried up,
leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by
the ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption
of the previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses1 are irregu¬
larly placed around central lowlands; the rocks of Ireland are of the same
types geologically as the Highland zone of Great Britain, and in the higher
parts the moorland vegetation resembles that of the higher parts of Highland
Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances,
particularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach
the coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the Pembrokeshire coast in
South Wales; the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumberland coast;
and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner
Hebrides. Even around Lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some
parts the soft, v/hite limestone—the chalk—forms the world-famous white
cliffs of Dover or the Needles off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the
south and south-east coastline have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern
coast of England between the Humber and the Thames estuary is for the
most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years some stretches of it have been
protected against the sea by embankments.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of
the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the
short British rivers2 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. It lies in middle latitudes
to the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but the
prevailing winds are south-westerly and the weather from day to day is
controlled mainly by a succession of depressions from the Atlantic which,
moving in a generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over or near
the British Isles. The climate is subject to frequent changes but to few
extremes of temperature. Although it is largely determined by that of the
eastern Atlantic, occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may
bring a cold, dry, continental type of weather which, once established, may
persist for many days or even weeks. During the summer months the Azores
high pressure system usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards
north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course, often
passing entirely to the north of the British Isles.
In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an
easterly quarter the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as
south-westerly ones although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in
the spring than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction
may differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography.
Winds are generally stronger in the north than in the south of the British
Isles, stronger on the coasts than inland, and stronger in the west than in the

east. The strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the average speed at
Lerwick, Shetland Islands, varies from about 19 m.p.h. in January to about
14 m.p.h. in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of
London, the average speed varies from about 10 m.p.h. in January to about
7 m.p.h. in August. The stormiest region of the British Isles is along the
north-west coast, with over 30 gales a year; south-east England and the east
Midlands are the least stormy, with gales occurring on about 2 days a year
inland and on some 15 20 days on the Channel coast.
Near sea level in the west of the British Isles the mean annual temperature
ranges from 8°C. (47°F.) in the Hebrides to ii°C. (52°F.) in the extreme
south-west of England; latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the eastern
part of Britain. The mean monthly temperature in the extreme north, at
Lerwick (Shetlands), ranges from 40C. (39°F.) during the winter (December,
January and February) to I2°C. (54°F-) during the summer (June, July and
August): the corresponding figures for the Isle of Wight, in the extreme south,
are 5°C. (4i0F.) and i6°C. (6i°F.). The average range of temperature between
winter and summer varies from 7°C. to i2°C. (i5°-230F.), being greatest
inland in the eastern part of the country. During a normal summer, the
temperature occasionally rises above 27°C. (8o°F.) in the south, but tempera¬
tures of 32°C. (90°F.) and above are infrequent. Extreme minimum
temperatures depend to a large extent on local conditions, but 7 F'' F’)
may occur on a still, clear winter’s night, — 12 C. (10 F.) is rare, and 18 C.
(o°F.) or below has been recorded only during exceptionally cold winter
periods.
The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches, while
England alone has about 34 inches. The geographical distribution of annual
rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure to the Atlantic, the
mountainous areas of the west and north having far more rain than the plains
of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches of rain fall on the summits
of Snowdon and Ben Nevis during the average year, whereas some places in
the south-east of England record less than 20 inches. Rain is fairly well
distributed throughout the year, but, on the average, March to June are the
driest months and October to January the wettest, the former period of four
months having about 60 per cent of the rainfall of the latter. A period of as
long as three weeks without rain is exceptional, and is usually confined to
limited areas. In successive years, however, remarkably contrasting weather
conditions are sometimes experienced.
The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a general decrease
from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with
altitude. During May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the
mean daily duration of sunshine varies from five hours in north-west Scotland
to eight hours in the Isle of Wight; during the months of shortest daylight—
November, December and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an
average of half an hour a day in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland and
in the Peak District (Derbyshire) and two hours a day on the south coast of
England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog
in winter.1 Fogs have become less frequent and less severe in recent years as a
result of changes in fuel usage and the operation of clean air legislation.
1 The number of mornings with less than 1,100 yards visibility ranges from less than
5 a year in areas of lowest incidence to about 55 in areas of the highest.
Soil and

Fauna
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE 5
Many parts of the surface of Highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with
the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of
Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valley lands and the plains where soils are deeper and richer;
villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, almost the
whole of Lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area
except where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land
drainage systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under
cultivation the fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and similar
areas in East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
natural vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands,
forests of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open
moorland. In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively
diminished and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry
Commission in the past 40 years, woodlands now occupy only about 7 per cent
of the surface of the country. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the
north and east of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England and in
Monmouthshire on the Welsh border. Midland Britain appears to be well
wooded because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees. The most
common trees are oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of
which about a third is arable and the rest pasture and meadow, a varied
semi-natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or wire fences
and, specially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents
a pattern of contrasting colour. The cool temperate climate of Britain and the
even distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season; streams rarely dry
up, grassland is green throughout the year and full of wild flowers from
spring to autumn; in most years there is scarcely a month in which some
flowers may not be found in hedgerows and sheltered woodland glades.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western
Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals,
including the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct;
but red deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish Highlands
and on Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are found in
Scotland and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow deer
(which are probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks and are
wild in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen; there
are foxes in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers and
streams. Both common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of the
coast, though not usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include
mice, rats, voles, shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey
more numerous than the native red), hares, rabbits, weasels and stoats.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are about 430 species of birds, including many song-birds. About
230 species are resident and the rest are regular visitors to Britain. The
chaffinch and the blackbird are probably the most numerous and are widely
and evenly distributed, but sparrows usually predominate near houses, and
huge flocks of starlings, which gather at certain seasons, sometimes congregate
in London and other large towns. These and some other species of small birds
have been on the increase for several decades owing to their success in adapting
themselves to a man-made environment, while small birds in general have
benefited by more considerate treatment from the public. The number of
large birds, on the other hand, has tended to decline, except for game birds
which are specially preserved, such as pheasants and partridges, and the red
grouse which is found in moorland areas.
Many species of gulls and other sea-birds nest round the coast and gulls
often fly far inland in search of food or shelter in rough weather. The drainage
and reclamation of marshlands have diminished the natural habitat of ducks,
geese and other aquatic birds. Such birds, however, now frequent reservoirs,
gravel pits and sewage farms in addition to the nature reserves and bird
sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
River and lake fish include salmon, trout, sea-trout, perch, roach, dace,
grayling and pike.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Of these, only
one species of newt and the common viviparous lizard are indigenous; the
other species of reptiles and amphibians that are now firmly established came
to Britain from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small,
in the British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly
(3 to 4 inches) and the stag beetle (2J inches). The insect fauna in Britain is
less varied than that of continental Europe and lacks a number of common
European species. With modern methods of pest control, extensive insect
damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks of diseases commonly spread
by insect vectors are exceptional in Britain but there is some anxiety among
naturalists that chemical protection against insects may be reducing the
populations of creatures which feed on them, and of their predators in turn.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from the
people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long
succession of invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of
Europe were the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian
Vikings who, after settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French,
and assimilating the French language and customs, crossed to England and
conquered it in 1066.
It is neither possible nor suitable to attempt in this chapter to estimate the
relative importance of various early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans,
Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the
present English, Scots, Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over
most of England and the Lowlands of Scotland the language which soon

and Population
Censuses
7
came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and
Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales,
Cornwall, the Isle of Man, the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not permit of any precise estimates of the size of
population or of the extent or direction of population movement until the
beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the end
of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about 2 million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century a reasonable contemporary
estimate put the population of England and Wales at 5^ million and that of
Scotland at about 1 million. The main factor in this gradual growth of
population was a slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in
Britain, as in all countries before the development of medical science, by high
death rates and, in particular, by very high infant and maternal mortality.
Immigration from the continent of Europe has been an influence at certain
times and immigration from other Commonwealth countries more recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the British
people—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births, deaths,
marriages, occupations, language and family structure—is relatively plentiful
and reliable. Most of it is derived from two main sources: the regular flow of
vital statistics (that is, statistical information based on statutory registration of
births, marriages and deaths) and the periodic census of population which
gives a national snapshot at a particular moment of time.
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is
carried out by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as
registrars of marriages. In England and Wales there are about 500 super¬
intendent registrars in charge of registration districts and about 1,200
registrars in charge of sub-districts. Registrars and superintendent registrars
are appointed by the county, county borough and London borough councils
but they act under the instruction of the Registrar General for England and
Wales, who is in charge of a central government department, the General
Register Office, concerned with regulating the registration of births, deaths
and marriages, with planning and carrying out population censuses, and with
the compilation and analysis of population and vital statistics. There are
corresponding authorities1 and similar arrangements in Scotland, Northern
Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
Censuses of the people of Great Britain have been taken regularly every ten
years since 1801, except that there was no census in 1941 because of the
second world war. The latest full census covering the whole of the British
Isles was taken in 1961 by the appropriate authorities in England and Wales,
Scotland, Northern Ireland, the islands of the British seas and the Irish
Republic. Censuses were taken throughout Great Britain (on a sample basis)
and Northern Ireland in 1966 and the first provisional figures were published
in 1967.
The short demographic account given in this chapter is based mainly on
census reports and on the regular returns of births, marriages and deaths,
though some use has been made of other special investigations, including the
Reports of the Royal Commission on Population.2
1 The various authorities are: the General Register Office, Somerset House, London;
the General Register Office, Edinburgh; the General Register Office, Fermanagh
House, Belfast; the Governments of Jersey, of Guernsey and its associated islands, and
of the Isle of Man.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The total estimated population1 of Britain (excluding the populations of the
Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, see p. 1, which are not strictly parts of
Britain) at mid-1968 was some 55,283,000 people, compared with 52,709,000
in 1961, 38-2 million in 1901, and 6-5 million in 1700. The main causes of
this great increase in numbers were a progressive reduction in death rates
and a continuance of high birth rates into the beginning of the twentieth
century.
Britain’s population density is one of the highest in the world: it was
approximately 587 persons per square mile at mid-1968, but in England and
Wales there were approximately 833 persons per square mile, and in Greater
London 12,600 persons per square mile.
On the basis of present trends in birth and death rates and migration,
Britain’s population is expected to continue growing to the end of the century,
reaching 55,970,000 in 1970, 59,259,000 in 1980, 63,165,000 in 1990, and
68,190,000 in the year 2000.
For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was about 35 per
thousand of the population, and the annual death rate was just over 20 per
thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the century,
but natural population increase changed little.
BIRTH RATES AND DEATH RATES
IN BRITAIN
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age
groups, produced a population of low average age. But when death rates in all
age groups fell by an average of about a third, as they did between 1880 and
1910, the results were a very low general death rate, which helped to maintain
the population increase in spite of a fall in the birth rate, and a gradual increase
in the average age of the population. By the 1930s the birth rate had fallen to
less than half the nineteenth century rate. The population continued to
increase slowly, but its average age rose more rapidly.
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
nearly stationary since 1920 at around 12 per thousand of the population
though death rates have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particu¬
larly among pre-school-children, school-children, and adults in their thirties

and forties, with a consequent lengthening of the expectation of life from about
48 years at birth for a boy born in 1900 to 1910 and 52 years for a girl, to
nearly 69 years at birth for a boy born in 1965 to 1967 and 75 for a girl.
EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH Years
Since 1933 the steady fall in the number of births has ceased. During the
second world war the birth rate began to rise and reached a temporary post¬
war peak of 20-7 per thousand population in 1947. It receded to slightly above
the pre-war level in the early 1950s, but from 1955 onwards began to rise,
reaching a peak of 18-7 per thousand in 1964. It has since been falling and was
17 per thousand population in 1968. The proportion of illegitimate births,
which reached a peak of 9-1 per cent of all live births in 1945, the last year of
the second world war, fell between 1945 and 1955, when it reached 4-5 per
cent; since then it has been rising again gradually and was about 8-4 per cent
in 1968.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on
mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant
and maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main
acute infectious diseases of childhood is less than a two-hundredth and
mortality from tuberculosis is about one-fifty-fifth of the rate prevailing in the
mid-nineteenth century. The infant mortality rate (that is, deaths of infants
under one year old per thousand live births) has fallen by about 85 percent since
1900 (18-5 in 1968) and maternal mortality by 93 per cent (17-3 in 1968). The
reported mortality from some of the diseases of middle and old age, such as
cancer of the lung and coronary thrombosis, has risen during the twentieth
century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement on diagnosis,
is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective measures to
combat some of these diseases, and improvement in positive health does not
always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but
stillbirth rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so
that in nearly all countries—and in Britain since records began—women
preponderate among the elderly and outnumber men in the total population.
In 1968 there were 105 females to every 100 males in Great Britain. Formerly
women outnumbered men in every age group from adolescence onwards.

Recently, however, the fall in stillbirths and infant mortality has reduced the
influence of these factors on sex ratio so that the age which women begin
to outnumber men has advanced and is now about 47* other hand, the
lengthening of the expectation of life, which has been rather more marked for
women than for men, has increased the preponderance of women among the
elderly—there are now some 28 women over 70 years old to every 15 men—
and made it a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole population.
Over the past 30 years the proportion of the population of Great Britain who
are married has risen from 42-1 per cent in 193^ to 51 Per cent in 1968, while
the proportion of single persons in the population over 15 years of age has
fallen from 36-1 per cent to 23-8 per cent. This change has been due mainly to
an increase in marriage rates among men and women in their late teens and early
twenties; whereas in 1938 only 25-4 per cent of young women aged 20 to 24
were married, in 1968, 57 per cent of them were. Earlier marriage has led to a
large increase in the number of children born to women under 30 years of age
and in recent years has contributed to a substantial acceleration of the total
flow of births into the population.
There were approximately 3-75 decrees of divorce made absolute in 1968 for
every 1,000 married couples in England and Wales; a substantial proportion
of divorced people marry again. Divorce is highest for girls marrying in
their teens; the ratio being twice as high as for women aged 20 to 24 at
marriage.
The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part
of the twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the size of the family
(that is, the number of children born per married couple) caused by the spread
of deliberate family limitation. Couples married a hundred years ago produced
on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline seems to
have set in with those married in the 1860s, and continued until, for couples
married in the decade 1934-43, the average family size for Great Britain fell
to below 2-i. It rose again for those married in 1944 to 2-13. Later data
suggest some increase, though the present position is not wholly clear, in view
of the latest trends in the birth rate.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20
and 30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to
replace the original generation, while those born at the beginning of the present
century had only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for
replacement. Since then the figure has been rising again and seems likely to
exceed full replacement with the generation born during the second world
war. The rise has been due mainly to the increased proportion of women
getting married and of children surviving to adult life.
The effect of the fall in the birth rate beginning in the latter part of the
nineteenth century was to reduce the ratio of children and old people to
adults of working age. This ratio was at a minimum in 1930. After 1936 the
number of children leaving school for work fell sharply owing to the drop in
the birth rate after 1921, but the population aged over 64, born during an era
of high fertility and representing successive generations of steeply rising
numbers, increased very rapidly; the population aged over 40 was also
increasing relatively faster than that between 15 and 40. The higher birth
rates after 1942 arrested the compensating fall in the number of children and
further reduced the proportion of people of conventional working age.

Because of this high proportion of the young and the old in the present
population, which is expected to increase still further (see diagram), there is a
special need to make the best use of national human resources. In 1966 about
93 per cent of men and 50-5 per cent of women between 15 and 64 in Great
Britain were economically active in remunerative work (this includes those
temporarily out of work or sick). In addition some 23-5 per cent of men and
6-7 per cent of women aged 65 or more were still economically active. At the other
end of the scale, some 25-7 per cent of both boys and girls between 15 and 19
were continuing their education. The scope for recruiting more men and women
into the paid working force is therefore limited, and emphasis is laid increasingly
on technological improvements and wider training to raise productivity.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the 1930s the balance
of migration was markedly outward. Between 1815 and 1930 well over
20 million people left Britain for destinations outside Europe, mainly in the
Commonwealth and the United States. Many emigrants later returned and
large numbers of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles, Germans and
Hungarians, entered the British Isles. Nevertheless, the net loss by migration
from Britain’s present area amounted to some 4 million between 1871 and
1931. Since then the balance of migration for Britain as a whole has been
inward, though Scotland and Northern Ireland have throughout continued to
have a net outward movement of population to countries overseas as well as to
England and Wales.
There have been two main periods of net inflow into Britain since 1931. The
first was in the years 1931 to 1940 when emigration was very low, many
former emigrants returned, there was considerable net immigration from the
Irish Republic, and extensive immigration from Europe, including about a
quarter of a million refugees seeking sanctuary in Britain. The second, from
the 1950s, resulted from a large increase in net immigration from Common¬
wealth countries, particularly West Indian countries, India and Pakistan.
In the three years 1960-62 total net immigration amounted to some 388,000
people, about three-quarters of them from the Commonwealth. It was
in these circumstances that the Government introduced the Commonwealth
Immigrants Act 1962, which gave it power to restrict the number of people
from the Commonwealth and, in principle, the Irish Republic who may
immigrate into Britain without assured prospects of employment or adequate
Nationality

means of self-support, and to deport unsuitable immigrants (that is, those
convicted of offences and recommended for deportation by a court of law).
Some 59,000 Commonwealth citizens were admitted to settle in Britain in
1968 of whom nearly 49,000 were dependants of Commonwealth citizens
coming to reside in or already resident in Britain. The Commonwealth
Immigrants Act 1968 extended immigration control to citizens of the United
Kingdom and Colonies formerly exempt from control but who have no close
links with Britain: broadly speaking, those neither born, naturalised, adopted
or registered in Britain nor having a parent or grandparent who was. (For
welfare of immigrants see p. 145 and for conditions of entry see p. 415.)
British emigrants from Britain to Commonwealth countries in 1968 num¬
bered about 141,000; approximately 69,000 emigrated to foreign countries.
About 210,000 others entered Britain in 1968 for long-term residence.
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, with insignificant exceptions, persons
who are born, or whose fathers were born, in the United Kingdom or in a
territory which was a colony of the United Kingdom on 1st January 1949, or
at the date of birth if later, or in a United Kingdom registered ship or aircraft,
are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. Citizenship may also be
acquired: by descent (subject to certain requirements) from a paternal grand¬
father bom in the United Kingdom or Colonies or from a more remote
paternal ancestor in the male line; by registration, for citizens of Common¬
wealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor children and for
women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies; in conse¬
quence of an adoption order; and by naturalisation. The requirements for the
grant of a certificate of naturalisation include five years’ residence in the
United Kingdom or Colonies or five years’ Crown service, good character, a
sufficient knowledge of English and the intention to reside in the United
Kingdom or a colony or to remain in Crown service; over 29,000 persons
acquired citizenship by registration or naturalisation in 1968.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizen¬
ship by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another
country; nor does a woman who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and
Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to an alien. Indeed, a citizen cannot
be deprived of his citizenship against his will except in very exceptional
circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisation or registration
as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen is, however, at
liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires the nationality
or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
is the first language of the majority of the population in most of the western
counties and was spoken by 26 per cent of the population at the time of the
1961 census. (The Welsh Language Act 1967 affirmed the equal validity of
Welsh with English in the administration of justice and conduct of govern¬
ment business throughout Wales.) In Scotland, in 1961, nearly 81,000
persons, mainly in Ross and Cromarty, Inverness, Argyll, and Lanark, spoke
the Scottish form of Gaelic,1 while a few families in Northern Ireland spoke
1 Most of the islands off the west coast of Scotland where Gaelic is spoken are included in
the counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness and Argyll.

the Irish form of Gaelic. The Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic are no
longer effectively living languages, although, in the Isle of Man, Manx is used
in addition to English for certain official pronouncements.
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French
patois is still also spoken there by some people. French is still the official
language of Jersey, used for ceremonial and official procedure; both French
and English are used in the courts. In Guernsey, however, English is now used
for almost all official proceedings.

of The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that
of all other parts of Britain. The distribution of the British population by
country, as enumerated by selected population censuses back to 1901 (or
nearest possible estimate), is shown in Table 1, which also gives figures for the
Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The populations of England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland were in every case greater in 1961 than in 1931
and in 1931 than in 1901, and they rose again between 1961 and 1968.
The high rate of increase in England is partly due to migration from the other
three countries.

time. The population figures given relate in England to areas defined at 1961 and at
1st April 1968.
6 Area at the date of the 1966 census.
Geography, history and economic factors have given rise to the differences
between the four countries and to an uneven distribution of the population
within them. Table 2 shows the areas and populations of the eight standard
administrative regions of England in 1961 and 1968, as well as those of Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, with forecasts for 1981. Table 3 gives figures
of Britain’s larger urban populations (over 250,000). Approximately half the
British population lives within the area of an ellipse drawn across England
enclosing south Lancashire and west Yorkshire at one end, and the London
area at the other, having the industrialised Midlands at its heart. Other areas
with large populations are the central lowdands of Scotland; 1,000 square
miles in the north-east of England from north of the river Tyne down to the
river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and the English Channel coast
from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less densely populated areas are the
eastern fringes of England between the Wash and the Thames estuary, and the
far south-west. Most of the mountainous parts of Britain, including much of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the central Pennine Chain in
northern England, are very sparsely populated.
These differences in average density between different regions have been
widening. Though in most places the population has been increasing, there
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
15

have been local differences in the rate of increase. Many places in the Midlands
and south-east England, some south-coast areas and some of the most
prosperous parts of northern England, Wales and Scotland have had increases
well above the average national rate, while many of the older industrial towns
and remote country areas in northern England, Wales and Scotland and some
coastal resorts have had relatively small increases. The differences result from
the combined effect of natural increase in almost all areas and net migration
towards the expanding employment opportunities of the Midlands and south
and towards certain retirement areas, mainly on the south coast.
Throughout Britain the population is predominantly urban and suburban,
although there may be access to large parks, commons and other expanses of
open country within the urban area. Table 4 shows the distribution of the
people of Britain between areas classified as urban for administrative purposes
and those classified as rural.

b Area at the date of the 1966 census.
c 1937 census figures.
During the nineteenth century the labour demands of newly developing
industry drew great numbers from the countryside; by the end of the century
three-quarters of the British population was living in towns and the large
conurbation was already the dominant type of British community. During the
twentieth century the suburbs of the towns in these population centres have
continued to spread and merge. Since 1921 nearly 40 per cent of the popula¬
tion has lived in the seven great conurbations whose centres are the cities of
London (Greater London), Manchester (South-East Lancashire), Birmingham
and Wolverhampton (West Midlands), Glasgow (Central Clydeside), Leeds
and Bradford (West Yorkshire), Liverpool (Merseyside), and Newcastle upon
Tyne (Tyneside).
A development which has been accelerating in recent years is the long-
established tendency for the number of people who actually have their homes
in the inner parts of an area (especially the town or city centre itself) to
decrease, and be balanced or surpassed by the increase of population in and
beyond the outer suburban fringes, where development commonly extends
without a break beyond the administrative boundaries and includes areas
which are administratively rural. This applies most strikingly to London. A
broad belt of almost continuous population increase now completely encircles
Greater London, includes and passes beyond the new towns around it and
extends along every major rail and road route from London. This belt contains
both commuters, who have moved their homes but continue to travel to work
in inner London, and people who have changed both home and workplace
from inner London to new or expanded towns. Other areas in which outward
movement and fringe development have been noticeably large are the outer
areas of the West Midlands and Merseyside conurbations and areas on the
edges of Bristol, Derby, Leicester, Norwich, Oxford, Portsmouth and
Sheffield. These two trends, the movement out of the centre and development
on the fringes, help to explain why the figures in Table 3 show apparent
decreases in some urban populations since 1961 or even 1951.

Mobility

Factors in the further dispersal of the last few years have been the spread of
car ownership, expansion in public transport serving journeys to work, private
property developments to meet the demand for housing, and planned transfers
of population to the new towns around London, Glasgow, the West Midlands
and Merseyside and to selected expanding towns near to the great cities.
The extent to which people in Britain move about the country for work,
housing or study purposes is shown by the finding that 10-7 per cent of residents
in Great Britain in 1966 had changed their address in the preceding year and
33 per cent in the previous five years; 4-2 per cent had moved between
England and Scotland or Wales, or from one region to another, during
1961-66.
A general summary of trends in social organisation, similar in scope to the
foregoing summary of population trends, is not practicable. It may be useful,
however, to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of British
households and social habits in Britain in order to provide a background to
the information given in later chapters on such matters as town and country
planning, housing, and transport.
The great majority of people enumerated in the 1966 sample census in Great
Britain (over 97 per cent) were living in private households1 (usually in
families or on their own). The remainder included residents in hotels or
boarding houses, people in hospital or homes for the elderly or disabled, and
others in the Armed Services, in educational institutions and in various
places of detention. Of 16-9 million private households in Great Britain in
1966, about 15 per cent consisted of one person only, 30 per cent of twT)
persons, 21 per cent of three, 18 per cent of four, and the remainder of five
or more.
The number of households (which had increased by 96 per cent since 1911)
and their small average size reflect a number of factors, including lower
birth rates, increased survival into old age, the higher proportion of married
people in the population and the general assumption that married couples and
old people in good health prefer and are entitled to have their own separate
homes. They are not to be taken as meaning there has been a general weaken¬
ing of family feeling, though family ties may link fewer people than in former
times. The volume of travel just before 25th December, the bulk of which
consists of people going to spend Christmas with their relatives, achieves
news value every year; only those involved know the hidden devotion in
thousands of homes where infirm old relatives or handicapped children are
cared for by their families. None the less, the small size of families, coupled
with the degree of mobility and wide dispersal about the country, do make the
role of neighbours and friends with kindred interests and of public and volun¬
tary social services of great importance.
In 1968 of 18-2 million dwellings about 8-8 million were owner occupied,
5-4 million rented from public authorities, and 3 million privately rented.
Of some 16-3 million households enumerated in the 1966 sample census in
Great Britain, 3-1 million were sharing a dwelling. About 85 per cent of all
households had exclusive use of a hot water system. 81 per cent in England and
Wales had exclusive use of a fixed bath and 76 per cent exclusive use of an
inside water closet. The proportions were higher in urban areas.
1 Counting people living alone as one-person households.
l8 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Most women, and many men living alone, do their own catering and house¬
work. Probably less than five per cent of households employ any regular paid
help and almost certainly less than one per cent have a resident servant.
Relatively few households (estimated to be less than one in 600), and those
mainly ones with small children, have a foreign girl living with them au pair
to give some help in the home while improving her English. Approximately
one household in 40 gets help through the local authority home help service
at some time in the course of a year because of the presence of an invalid, an
old person or a maternity case. Nowadays wives can normally expect some
help with household tasks from their husbands. Women who go out to work
(about half the women of working age are in employment) benefit, amongst
other things, from laundrettes with extended opening hours and from the
spread of automatic machines selling milk, groceries, stockings and other
supplies at any time of the day or night.
Much of the drudgery has been reduced by changes in habits and equipment,
for example, the relative popularity of easily cleaned plastic surfaces in place
of wood, tiles and metal in need of polishing; the availability of ‘convenience
foods’,1 non-iron fabrics and babies’ disposable napkins; and the spread of
labour-saving devices. More than four households in five now have a vacuum
cleaner, one in two a refrigerator, two out of three a washing machine, nearly
all an electric iron, one in two an electric blanket and one in five an electric
food mixer. About one in five has completely eliminated the traditional coal
fire in the principal living-room. There is also a trend towards ‘whole house
heating by means of off-peak electric storage heaters or boiler and radiator
systems with minimum effort required for re-fuelling.
Incomes, Compared with previous generations most people have considerably more
Leisure and time at their own disposal, higher real incomes, and more chance of developing
Opportunities their potentialities.
Agreed hours of full-time work are usually from 40 to 42 a week. Actual
hours worked by men average somewhat more because of voluntary over¬
time working; actual hours worked by women and girls average a little
less. On average another five to six hours a week are spent on travelling to and
from work. Few employees are entitled to less than two weeks’ paid holiday a
year in addition to public holidays and most have more. Probably more than
half enjoy a five-day week, which is widespread in manufacturing industry.
A further extension of five-day week working in distributive trades offering
six days a week service is in progress. Housewives are probably, despite
current aids in the home, the section of the community with least leisure and
fewest extended periods of free time—even compared with those older school-
children entered for examinations who spend hours nightly on homework.
At the other end of the scale, people who have ceased work or are approach¬
ing retirement are showing considerable interest in courses offering guidance
on the constructive use of their increased leisure time.
Average earnings have risen more than prices in the last decade. Women’s
earnings have risen rather less than men’s. The average earnings of women
in industry are rather under half the average earnings of men. In many
occupations the principle of equal pay for equal work is applied. The real
incomes of manual workers, especially unskilled workers and young people
under 18 years, have risen both in absolute terms and in relation to the
1 Those processed foods for which the degree of preparation has been carried to an
advanced stage by the manufacturer and which may be used as labour-saving alter¬
natives to less highly processed products.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
19
incomes of non-manual workers. The groups who are weakest economically
are retired people wholly or mainly dependent upon pensions, households in
which the father is absent or dead, and the families of low-wage earners with
a number of dependent children.
Opportunities for education and training have widened; these are
increasingly the keys to advancement. Of every 1,000 men in England and
Wales between the ages of 20 and 30 in 1961, 318 had continued at school
beyond 15 and 81 had continued their full-time education to the age of 20 or
beyond. By comparison, among those aged 65 or more, only 108 in 1,000 were
at school beyond 15 and only 28 continued their full-time education to the
age of 20 or beyond. A large majority of university undergraduates in Great
Britain are ‘first generation’ students, neither of whose parents have had a
university education. None the less, children from culturally articulate homes
in which they benefit from parental experience do have relatively more success
than others in achieving qualifications at every stage of the educational
system. However, distinctions based on occupation have become much less
clear-cut. Differences between the way of life of manual and other workers are
less pronounced, while many manual workers’ families have acquired habits
which were formerly regarded as ‘middle-class’. There is less disparity than
there used to be in the range of possessions to be found in the home. Modern
production and marketing methods, coupled with the declining proportion of
‘dirty’ jobs, have contributed to far greater homogeneity of dress and appear¬
ance ; style in clothes, for example, being more divided by age-group than by
income-group or occupation.
The general level of nutrition is high, and still rising. The combination of
greater household prosperity and pressure on most housewives’ time is
causing them to purchase the better quality cuts of meat and the more
expensive prepared foods which take less time to prepare and cook. Other
items consumed in greater quantities than a decade ago include poultry,
vegetables and butter. The consumption of bread and flour has declined. Tea
remains the principal beverage but the consumption of coffee, including
instant coffee, has increased greatly. The consumption of considerable
quantities of sweets and confectionery (some 7-7 ounces per person a week in
1968) continues to be a notable feature of British eating habits. Restaurants
and cafes offering alternatives to traditional British cooking are nowadays
much more in evidence throughout Britain, whereas they used to be limited
to the centres of the larger cities. Expenditure on wine has more than
quadrupled in the last decade (from £88 million to £203 million).
The share of food consumption in all consumers’ expenditure on goods and
services in Britain has declined from 26 per cent a decade ago to 21 per cent.
Clothing and footwear account for about 8 per cent. Features of recent
years have been the growing range of ‘leisure’ clothes, a greater adventurous¬
ness in men’s wear, and the large turnover in mass-produced fashions for
young people with frequent (even startling) changes in styles. Sectors taking
an appreciably larger share of consumer expenditure than a decade ago are
housing and travel.
Something of a counterweight to the greatly increased strength of the
production and distribution sides of a modern economy is the growth of
activity to help the consumer; this has received government support, notably
by the establishment of the Consumer Council. Which?, the magazine of the
Consumers’ Association, which publishes appraisals of selected consumer
goods, has some 500,000 subscribers and an estimated readership of 3
million. Over a million people a year make a personal visit to the Design

Centre in London to see its display of well-designed British consumer goods in
current production. State services do not escape the scrutiny of voluntary
groups such as the Association for the Improvement of Maternity Services and
the Confederation for the Advancement of State Education.
A considerable proportion of people’s free time and money is spent in and
on their homes. On a weekday evening roughly seven in eight of the
adult population are at home. About four out of five families do most of their
own decorating, which may often constitute the hardest physical effort under¬
taken by sedentary workers. The sales of hand-tools and of small power-tools
and powered garden implements testify to the extent and range of home
carpentry and joinery and to the interest and initiative that maintain Britain’s
homes and gardens. In spite of the high proportion of the population living
in urban areas, at least half the families in Britain have some garden, and the
standard of both town and country gardens is high. Over 3,000 local horti¬
cultural societies are affiliated to the National Allotment and Gardens
Society and there are a large number of unaffiliated societies; altogether there
are probably some 20 million spare-time gardeners. The numerous flower and
vegetable shows held in town and country are very popular and there is a large
attendance at the most important of them, including the annual Chelsea
Flower Show.
Other home pursuits include entertaining friends, looking after pets,1 and
pursuing hobbies. Many hobbies involve considerable financial outlay and
demand a degree of skill, for example, the use of still and cine cameras, and the
construction of both model and full-scale boats and vehicles.
A large majority of families in Britain have a television set. Although it is
generally acknowledged that the popularity of television has resulted in far-
reaching social changes, clear-cut indications of the nature of such changes are
lacking. Mass entertainments have suffered, especially where the quality and
amenities provided are not considered adequate. The lives of those housebound
by disability or the care of small children have been much enriched. Viewers in
general have been stimulated to an awareness of events and happenings which
was once confined to fairly narrow groups. There is no evidence that television
has brought any decline in those hobbies, recreations and spare-time interests
which people in Britain pursue so enthusiastically; in fact for many of them
it may well have provided a stimulus.
The enormous diversity of special interests, from angling to yachting, is
illustrated by the variety of magazines and periodicals, ranging from papers
dealing with sports to journals of opinion on social, political, scientific and
economic affairs (all of which command circulations in the tens of thousands),
and including ‘fan’ magazines about current ‘pop’ music favourites, do-it-
yourself and gardening weeklies (each commanding circulations of over a
hundred thousand), and illustrated instructional periodicals which build up
into encyclopaedias of art, science or general knowledge. The traditional
women’s weeklies, with their special blend of light fiction and meticulous
advice about family health and modern baby care as well as fashion and
beauty, still hold the loyalty of many hundreds of thousands.
Nearly one-third of the total population are registered members of public
libraries; and an increasingly wide range of titles, including works of scholar¬
ship, are bought in the comparatively cheap paper-backed form, which
constitutes about a third of total book production. One in four public libraries

also lends gramophone records. Some 49 million ‘medium play’ and ‘single’
gramophone records were pressed in Britain in 1968, over four times the
production in 1958, but nearly one-third less than in the peak year of 1964.
It is on the weekly sales of these records (almost entirely to young people)
that the ‘pop’ music popularity placings, known as the ‘Top Ten’ and ‘Top
Twenty’, are calculated. Production of long-playing records (including ‘pop’
albums) has increased sharply, partly in response to lower prices; sales in
1968, at 49 million, were one-third higher than in the previous year.
The most popular form of entertainment outside the home, particularly for
young adults and older children, continues to be the cinema (4-7 million a
week attendances in 1968 although the trend has been downwards for
several years).
Attendances at theatres are much smaller. There are probably only some
200 theatres offering professional performances compared with rather less than
2,000 cinemas, but new theatres opened during the last decade have been well
supported. There is an enthusiastic and growing public not only for plays
but for ballet, opera and concerts. Amateur dramatic societies and music¬
making flourish. Special art exhibitions often attract large attendances; over
200,000 visited the 1969 Van Gogh Exhibition at the Hayward Gallery,
which was opened in 1968 on the South Bank in London.
Dancing is very popular, especially with those under 35 years of age; it is
thought that about 6 million people go dancing every week. There are
estimated to be some 3,000 to 4,000 regular dance halls, including public dance
halls and halls operated by the major dance schools, which are open at least
three times a week, and about 4,000 other schools of ballroom dancing. Public
dances are often held in other halls, while many of the clubs and societies which
abound in Britain hold dances occasionally in their own or hired premises. In
addition, Scottish and English traditional dances have their own following.
Bingo is widely played in converted cinemas and in club rooms and village
halls, although total expenditure is not large. There has in recent years been
a considerable growth in the establishment of commercial gaming clubs; the
Government has introduced amending legislation to subject such clubs to
stricter control. There are rather less than 16,000 betting shops in Britain.
The turnover of money staked by the public on organised betting subject
to duty is of the order of £1,330 million a year. About three-quarters of
this is staked on horse-racing. Betting on football matches, both at fixed odds
and through the football pools, is widespread, but usually for smaller stakes.
Customs and excise duties on betting and gaming brought in £100 million
for public funds in the financial year 1968-69.
Increasing prosperity and leisure and the influence of television have affected
interest in playing or watching outdoor and indoor sports. Association football
remains the leading spectator sport. There is a tendency with most sports for
spectators to be attracted in large numbers only to the more important events,
for example, the Lawn Tennis Championship matches at Wimbledon and the
five ‘classic’ horse races. Higher standards of comfort and amenity are being
sought by the public and failure to provide these may be reflected in falling
attendances. But almost every sporting body reports a growing desire to take
part in outdoor recreations—golf, tennis, riding, angling, bowling, rugby and
association football, ski-ing and sailing are some examples—and steadily
rising sales of sports goods and membership of sports clubs indicate the
keenness with which open air leisure activities are pursued, especially among
younger people. Interest tends to fall off as people get older, though many

Clubs and Groups
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
campers are middle-aged (camping is a popular form of family holiday) and
the maiority do some swimming during the year (perhaps because a trip to the
sea is a popular component of holidays whether in Britain or abroad and a
favourite form of a day’s outing).
A number of people from all age-groups and occupations find their main
free-time interest in some form of sustained group activity connected, for
example, with the churches, trade unions, politics, study or other self-improve¬
ment; cultural pursuits, social welfare and reform. A feature of recent years
has been the forming of new groups, sometimes quite smal and local, outside
the existing welfare bodies to meet newly recognised needs or nelp in novel
ways, for example, fund raising by ‘sponsoring walks’.
Clubs and societies, which may be primarily social or devoted to some
particular purpose, range from small informal groups to great national an
international organisations with branches throughout the country. Organisa¬
tions of national importance in social life and in the promotion of social
gatherings include, in addition to those connected with religious denomina¬
tions the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen s Guilds
and the Women’s Institutes. There are some 3,900 clubs with over
^ million members (mainly but not entirely men), affiliated to the Working
Men’s Club and Institute Union. These clubs are primarily social and recrea¬
tional, though they also arrange lectures and classes. In recent years they have
given much attention to improving their premises and to arranging events ot
sufficient attraction to compete with the comforts of members homes an
the standard of entertainment obtainable on television. Over 2,700 I owns-
women’s Guilds, with a total membership of some quarter million, are
affiliated to the National Union of Townswomen’s Guilds. The guilds are
educational as well as social in purpose and they co-operate in many public
welfare activities. The declared objective of the National Federation o
Women’s Institutes is to improve rural life and amenities; in villages throug -
out England and Wales there are nearly 9,000 institutes with nearly halt a
million members; in Scotland and Northern Ireland there are Women s Rural
Institutes with similar aims and interests.
Holidays
Private Transport
At least 35 million people in Britain take an annual holiday. Many people take
more than one holiday during the year. One in every two holidaymakers
(three in ten going abroad) travel by car, most of them preferring to tour.
The number going abroad has risen from a million in the early 1950s to
slightly over 5 million a year since 1965. The popularity of holidays abroa
may be attributable to several factors besides rising incomes: the attraction
of a warmer climate, which makes Spain and Italy the most sought-atter
destinations for British tourists; the many charter and other airline services
available; and the readiness of the travel trade to provide relatively inexpensive
inclusive holidays. In this connection, the learning of foreign languages is
popular among adults, aided by radio and television programmes as well as
by attendance at adult classes. (Foreign languages are, of course, taught to
children in schools.) Active holidays, for example, canoeing, sailing and
pony-trekking, have a growing following.
Ownership of motor vehicles is now widespread. In mid-1968 there were
about io-8 million cars licensed on the roads in Great Britain (compared with
4-6 million in 1958). The number of motor cycles (including motor scooters)
was about 1-3 million (a sizeable fall from the 1-9 million in 1962). The
proportion of people to cars in Great Britain as a whole was about five to one
(car ownership is more widespread in rural areas).
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
23
The Changing
Face of Britain
Changes in
British
Society
As the number of motor vehicles increases, absolute casualty figures from
road accidents also tend to rise. However, the 1968 total of 6,810 people
killed was the lowest since 1959, and that of seriously injured (349,208)
almost the same as in 1963. The rate of deaths per 1,000 vehicles licensed
has been progressively reduced from 3-2 in 1930 to 0-5 in 1968 (partly
through improvements in medical resources as well as in vehicle design,
road construction and road safety legislation).
The spread of car ownership, making many people more independent of
public transport, is not only affecting the whole pattern of leisure activities
but also leading to a new and more scattered distribution of houses, changing
the siting requirements of factories, shops and offices, and making large-scale
urban reconstruction and road development urgent. At the same time, by
reducing the economic returns on public transport, resulting in reduced
services, it is in danger of impoverishing the amenity of those who for reasons
of age, health, income or personal preference do not possess their own
transport.
Increasing population and social developments are affecting the physical
appearance of Britain. Towns and cities are being altered to accommodate
more traffic and house more people; experiments are being tried in remodelling
town centres with pedestrian precincts; new blocks of flats and office blocks
pierce familiar skylines. Town and country mingle as new estates for migrating
townsfolk encircle the little-changed hearts of old villages. New roads and
motorways to carry the traffic on leisure and business, reservoirs to supply the
growing demand for water, lines to carry electric power for the growing
volume of appliances, and sites for the disposal of unwanted articles—from
tin cans to old cars—all have to be accommodated.
In a modern industrial society in a densely populated country there is much
scope for conflict between the need for new communal facilities and the desire
to preserve existing beauty or historic interest and between potential users of
a new service and people threatened with disturbance to accommodate it.
Both the long-term activities of general amenity societies supported by wider
public opinion and groups formed in connection with individual projects,
such as the choice of motorway routes or airport sites, channel concern and
may sometimes influence the ultimate decision.
As in other advanced individual societies traditional social groupings are
losing some of their former importance, and a variety of new organisations
and arrangements have emerged to meet the changing needs of the com¬
munity. While modes of life are becoming less stratified, British society
remains far from homogeneous, despite the pressures by way of mass-produced
goods and entertainment tending to favour uniformity. Individual family and
economic circumstances vary widely, regional and national differences
persist, and class and local loyalties (and antipathies) take on new forms as the
old fade away.
The growing complexity of society brought about by technological change
has encouraged trends towards centralised authority, but at the same time is
making people anxious to improve the machinery by means of which they can
take a greater part in arriving at decisions which affect their lives. There is,
in consequence, increasing pressure on social, political, religious and other
institutions to adjust their methods and outlook more readily and more
radically than in the past.

2 GOVERNMENT
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical State, whose origins and traditions
are to be found in the history of each of its four component parts. England,
Wales Northern Ireland and Scotland. England was unified under a Saxon
king in the ninth century; Wales became part of that kingdom and Irelan
was joined with it before the end of the thirteenth century; and the English
and Scottish thrones were dynastically united in the person of James I and
in Ido-, In 1707 the Treaty for the Union of England and Scotland provided
that the two countries ‘should be forever united into one kingdom , and one
Parliament (the Parliament of Great Britain) became the supreme authority
in both countries. In 1801 the Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ire an
1800 which joined the Irish Parliament to the Parliament of Great Britain
established the United Kingdom. In 1922 the 26 counties of Southern Ireland
(now the Irish Republic) became a completely independent country, outside
(the United Kingdom. Meantime, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 had
enacted a constitution for Northern Ireland which while preserving
the supreme authority of the United Kingdom Parliament, provided
Northern Ireland with its own legislature and executive, to deal wit
^Thfunited Kingdom is a unitary, not a federal, State but m®tho<Js ^
government are flexible and, to some extent adapted to the ^cds of 1
constituent countries. England and Wales on the one hand, and Scotland on
the other, continue as before the Union to have different systems of law a
different judiciary, different educational systems, different systems of local
government, national churches on a different footing and, for most domestic
matters, different government departments. In Scotland these dep—
have headquarters in Edinburgh and are grouped under the Secretary ot
State for Scotland, who is a member of the Cabinet. , . . . r
There is also a considerable measure of devolution in the administration of
Welsh affairs to the Welsh Office, under the Secretary of State for Wales, who
is a Cabinet Minister, assisted by a Minister of State and a
Under-Secretary. In Northern Ireland the law is derived from and similar to
the law of England but the judiciary is separate; the Northern I
government departments are responsible to the Northern Ireland Parliament.
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies
not part of the United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and
systems of local administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same
time, they have a special relationship with the United Kingdom because
their proximity to the mainland and the antiquity of their connection with the
Crown They are treated as part of the mainland for certain purposes, sue as
wireless and postal communication, and are ‘territories for whose international
relations Her Majesty’s Government is responsible’.
The United Kingdom Parliament has the ultimate responsibility tor the
good government of the British dependencies which are administered by
territorial governments and are at various stages of development towards tu
self-government. The United Kingdom is also one of the independent member
GOVERNMENT
25
nations of the Commonwealth,1 which all acknowledge the Queen as the
symbol of their free association and, as such, the head of the Commonwealth.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions,
which are not part of the law of the land since violation of them would not
lead to proceedings in a court of law, but which are nevertheless indispensable
to the machinery of government. The rules of the constitution have never
been codified; principles and practice are both alterable, and the rules of the
constitution can be adapted to changing conditions at any time by the passing
of an Act of Parliament, or by the general acceptance of a new convention,
without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
The organs of government in the constitution are readily distinguishable
although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They are:
1. the legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the
supreme authority in the realm;
2. the executive, which consists of: {a) the Cabinet and other ministers of the
Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national policy;
(b) government departments, most of them under the control of ministers
and all staffed by civil servants, which are responsible for administration
at the national level; (c) local authorities, which administer and manage
many services at the local level; and (d) statutory boards, which are
severally responsible for the operation of particular nationalised industries
or public services, and which are subject to ministerial control in varying
degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and
is independent of both the legislature and the executive.
The following pages describe these three organs of government in some
detail in order to show how the constitution of the United Kingdom works.2
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II
is a descendant of the Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the
year 829, and of Malcolm II, whose reign in Scotland (1005-34) was corre¬
spondingly important in that part of the realm.
According to the Royal Titles Act 1953, the royal title in the United
Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
The form of the royal title is varied for the other member nations of the
* The other members are: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon
Ghana, Malaysia, Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Jamaica, Trinidad and
lobago, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Malta, Zambia, The Gambia, Singapore, Guyana
Botswana, Lesotho, Barbados, Mauritius and Swaziland.
* A Commission on the Constitution is considering whether any changes are desirable
in the present constitutional relationships between the several countries, nations and
regions of the United Kingdom and also between the United Kingdom and the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man.

Succession
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, to suit the particular
^S^rflrmonarchy is in the United Kingdom the Queen being
renresented by a Governor in Northern Ireland. For the performance of
royal functions in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen 'S
represented by a Lieutenant-Governor. In the other member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown the Queen s representative
is the Governor-General, who is appointed by the Crown on tne advice of the
ministers of the country concerned and is wholly independent of the Uni
Kingdom Government. In the United Kingdom dependencies the Queen is
usually represented by Governors who are appointed by the Crown have
varying executive and legislative powers, and are responsible to the Unite
Kingdom Government for the good government of the countries concerned.
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement 1701, which
provided that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most
excellent Princess Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants .
Subsequent Succession to the Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration;
and although succession is not bound to continue in its present line, it canno
now be altered (under a provision of the Statute of Westminster 1931) except
by common consent of the member nations of the Commonwealth which owe
^The;11 inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which
provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the
Throne according to their seniority or, if there are no sons, the daug ers
in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-
Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as fully and effectively
as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of a king takes
rank and style of her husband; but the converse does not apply and the
constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the husband
of the Queen-Regnant.
Accession
Coronation
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession
of armther. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new
Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all membe
the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal the
Lord Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London,
and the High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the
Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval which
may last for a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the same m
substance for nearly a thousand years although the details have frequent y
been modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time. 1 he
service used at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II m 1953 was derived from
that used at the coronation of King Edgar at Bath in the year 973.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey m the presence of
representatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests
in the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members oi the
other Commonwealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.

Acts of
Government
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in
England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-m-chie
of fll the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal head of the established
Church of England. In practice, as a result of a long evolutionary process
during which the absolute power of the monarchy has been progressively
reduced, the Queen acts only on the advice of her ministers which she cannot
constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule. The Uni ed
Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the
Q Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation
during the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers
without any necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts o
government which require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; as a general ru e
she opens the new session with a speech from the throne (although this may
be read by the Lord Chancellor if the Queen is unable to be present), and
she must give Royal Assent before a Bill which has passed all its stages in
both Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enactment. The Queen is the
fountain of justice’ and as such can remit all or part of the penalties imposed
on people convicted of crime. As ‘the fountain of honour , the Queen confers
peerages, baronetcies, knighthoods and other honours/ and makes appoint¬
ment to all important State offices, including those of judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, and diplomats, and to all leading positions in e
established Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are
required before a minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In
realm of international affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the
State, the Queen has the power to conclude treaties, to cede or accept tern ory,
to declare war and to make peace.
These and similar acts of government involve the use of the royal preroga¬
tive2 which has been defined as ‘the residue of discretionary authority legally
left in the hands of the Crown’. Ministerial responsibility for the exercise
of this authority is shown in three constitutional ways in which the royal will
can be expressed: by Order in Council made ‘by and with the advice of the
Privy Council’; by Order, Commission or Warrant signed personally by the
Queen and generally bearing the signature of one or more responsible
ministers; or by Proclamation, Writs, Letters Patent, or other documents
under the Great Seal affixed by the Lord Chancellor in obedience to a Roya
Warrant countersigned by a minister. ,
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does n
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the
smooth working of government; for although the Queen has no personal
authority and must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be
informed and consulted on every aspect of the national life. The Queen holds
meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and other
holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions,
reads dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.  
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the adviceofthcPnme Mmister-a
few (the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order the Most Noble Order ot the
Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient Order of the Thistle) are in
Sovereign’s personal gift. . , „ ,
2 Other powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporationsbyRoyalChart
the construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of infants the admm
istration of charities; coinage; the grant of franchises, for example, markets, terries^ ^
fisheries; the right to treasure trove; and the right of printing or hcensi g
print the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer and State papers.
GOVERNMENT
29
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them
if the Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or is under the age of 18 years on
accession to the throne. The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act 1953—
laid down that the first potential Regent should be The Prince Philip, Duke
of Edinburgh, and thereafter those in succession to the throne who are of age.
In the event of the Sovereign’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision
is made for the appointment of Counsellors of State (generally speaking, the
wife or husband of the Sovereign, and the four adult persons next in succession
to the Crown1) to whom the Sovereign may delegate by Letters Patent certain
royal functions. But Counsellors of State may not, for instance, dissolve
Parliament (except on the express instructions of the Sovereign), nor create
peers.
Ceremonial and Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the
Royal Visits British Isles and, in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered
outlook of both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages
are the same today as they were many centuries ago. Royal marriages, the
birth of royal children and royal funerals are marked by ancient ceremonial,
although to a lesser degree than in former days. The birthday of the Sovereign
is officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on the Horse
Guards Parade and is also celebrated as Commonwealth Day. State banquets
take place when a foreign monarch or head of State visits the United Kingdom;
investitures are held at Buckingham Palace; and royal processions grace such
social occasions as the Ascot Race Meeting, known as Royal Ascot, and add
significance to the opening of Parliament, when the Queen drives in state from
Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating
from the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal
ordinances, established custom and the public will. The Queen and other
members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom every
year, and their presence at the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial,
and charitable works of national importance ensures nation-wide interest and
support. They also pay State visits to foreign governments and undertake
lengthy tours in other countries of the Commonwealth.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the
House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate; they are consti¬
tuted on different principles; they do different work in different places; and
they meet together only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the
coronation, or the opening of Parliament when the Commons are summoned
by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making organ of State, however,
Parliament is a corporate body and cannot legislate without the concurrence
of all its parts (except in the case of Bills passed under the Parliament Acts
1911 and 1949).
1 The Regency Act 1953 provided that Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother should be
added to the persons to whom royal functions may be delegated as Counsellors of State.
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Parliament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the
United Kingdom. It can legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole, or
any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination of them.
It can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, but in these
islands, and in Northern Ireland, it is not the only legislature, for the Northern
Ireland Parliament has power to legislate for Northern Ireland on most
domestic subjects (see p. 40), and the ancient legislatures of the two Channel
Island Bailiwicks (the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey) and of the
Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) legislate on domestic matters.1 Nevertheless,
the Parliament at Westminster retains supreme authority, and within practical
limits there is nothing that it cannot legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act 1911 the life of a United Kingdom
Parliament was fixed at five years (although it may be dissolved and a general
election held before the expiry of the legal term); and since one Parliament
cannot bind its successor (for otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not
be sovereign or supreme), each assembly has a period of time of up to five
years during which it may legislate exactly as it chooses. During its life, it
can make or unmake any law; destroy by statute the most firmly established
convention or turn a convention into binding law; or legalise past illegalities
and make void and punishable what was lawful when done and thus reverse
the decisions of the courts.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice
Parliament does not exercise its supremacy in this way. Its members bear
in mind the common law which has grown up in Britain throughout the
centuries and they act as far as possible in accordance with precedent and
tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parliament that has
been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the proper authority
cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be likely to pass an
Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system of party
government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its responsibility
to the electorate in mind.
The Meeting of A Parliament, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with
Parliament a proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council.
Such a proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and,
on the other, orders the issue of writs for election and announces the date on
which the new Parliament is to meet. This cannot be less than 20 days after
the proclamation, but it may be more.
The resignation of a government usually entails the dissolution of Parlia¬
ment. Formerly the death of a Sovereign also involved dissolution, but since
1867 both Houses stand adjourned only until their members have taken the
oath of allegiance to the new Sovereign, which they do immediately after the
Accession Council has made the order for proclamation.
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or
dissolution is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a com¬
mission under the Great Seal (see p. 28), which appoints the day and place
of its meeting in a new session. The date so appointed may be brought
forward or deferred by a subsequent proclamation. The effect of a prorogation

is at once to terminate all business (with certain minor exceptions) until
Parliament is summoned again.
During a session either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to such
date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business.
A reassembly of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or by
virtue of powers specially conferred by each House on its Speaker.
The average number of sitting days for the House of Commons is about
160, divided by custom into the following periods: one from November until
Christmas lasting 30-40 sitting days, one from January to Easter of 40-50
sitting days, one from Easter until Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and one
from Whitsun until the end of July lasting about 40 sitting days. Nowadays,
the session is sometimes concluded with a short period of up to 10 sitting days
in October, after the long summer adjournment. The House of Lords sits, on
average, for about no days in each session.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Temporal and the Lords Spiritual.
The Lords Temporal may be sub-divided into (1) all hereditary peers and
peeresses of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who
have not disclaimed their peerages under the Peerage Act 1963, (2) all life
peers and peeresses created by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act 1958,
and (3) Lords of Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed under the terms of the
Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 to assist the House in the performance of its
judicial duties and who remain members of the House after their retirement
from office. The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,
the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the
Church of England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops.
Peerages (both hereditary and life) are conferred by the Sovereign on the
advice of the Prime Minister. Hereditary peerages carry with them a right to
a seat in the House of Lords, provided the holder is 21 years of age or over,
but anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months of succession,
disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime. Those who disclaim their
peerages lose their right to sit in the House of Lords but they are able to vote
at parliamentary elections and are eligible for election to the House of
Commons.
Not all holders of temporal peerages with a right to sit in the House of
Lords attend the sittings of that House. Those who do not wish to attend may
apply for leave of absence, either for the duration of a particular Parliament
or for a single session.
Peers who frequently attend the House of Lords include elder statesmen
and others who have spent their lives in public service. They receive no
salary for their parliamentary work, but they are entitled to travelling
expenses from their homes to the Palace of Westminster (provided they attend
at least one-third of the number of sittings), and (with the exception of the
Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chairman of Committees and any member in
receipt of a salary as the holder of a ministerial office) they may claim payment
for expenses incurred for the purpose of attendance at the House (except for
judicial sittings) within a maximum of four and a half guineas (^4 14s. 6d.) a
day.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sits
on the woolsack and is ex officio Speaker of the House. The Crown, by
commission under the Great Seal, appoints several members of the House
to act as deputy speakers in the absence of the Lord Chancellor. The first
of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of Committees, who is appointed

each session and takes the chair in all committees, unless the House otherwise
directs. The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is
charged with keeping the records of proceedings and judgments and who
pronounces the words of the Royal Assent to Bills; the Gentleman Usher of
the Black Rod, who enforces the orders of the House; and the Serjeant-at-
Arms, who attends the Lord Chancellor.
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost
universal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections
of the community. There are at present 630 seats in the House of
Commons (511 for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern
Ireland).
Members of the House of Commons are paid a salary of £2,000 a year and a
parliamentary allowance of £1,250, and hold their seats during the life of a
Parliament. They are elected either at a general election, after a Parliament
has been dissolved and a new one summoned by the Sovereign, or at a
by-election, held when a vacancy occurs in the House as a result of the death
of a member, or of his acceptance of office under the Crown,1 or as a result
of his elevation to the House of Lords.
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
by the members to preside over the House immediately after a new Parliament
is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of
Ways and Means, and the Deputy Chairman, both of whom may act as
Deputy Speaker; these officers are elected by the House on the nomination
of the Government and, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote other than
in their official capacity.
Permanent officers of the House, that is, those who are not members of
Parliament, include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official departments under his control and is
charged with such matters as keeping the records, endorsing Bills and signing
orders, and the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Speaker in the House.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. Permanent
Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
undertake general reviews of constituencies throughout that part of the
United Kingdom for which they are responsible at intervals of not less than
ten and not more than 15 years and report on the changes they recommend.
A Commission is also empowered to submit interim reports on particular
constituencies if, for instance, it is necessary to bring constituency boundaries
into line with altered local government boundaries.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained principally in the
Representation of the People Acts 1949 and 1969. Under the provisions of
these Acts, election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot in
which British subjects (except members of the House of Lords) and citizens of
the Irish Republic are entitled to vote (voting is not compulsory), provided
that they are 18 years old or over, and are not subject to any legal incapacity
to vote. Those eligible to vote in any constituency are those who are recorded
1 If a member wishes to resign from the House, he may apply either for what is techni¬
cally an office of profit under the Crown (Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds and Steward
of the Manor of Northstead), but to which, in fact, no remuneration attaches, or for a
directorship by government nomination in a commercial company which is an
ordinary trading concern (see p. 33).

on the register1 of electors for the constituency as resident in that constituency
on a date fixed by statute. Each elector may cast one vote, normally in person
at a polling station, although members of the armed forces, Crown servants of
the United Kingdom and staff of the British Council employed overseas, and
wives or husbands of such persons, if resident overseas with their married
partners, may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or in certain cases by proxy,
may also be allowed if the voter cannot attend in person for such reasons as
physical incapacity or the nature of his work or on grounds of religious
observance.
Anyone, male or female, who is a British subject aged 21 or over, and is
not otherwise disqualified may stand as a candidate in any constituency at a
parliamentary election. Those who are disqualified include members of the
House of Lords, clergy of the Church of England, the Church of Scotland,
the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church, undischarged
bankrupts, and those expressly disqualified by the House of Commons
Disqualification Act 1957, for instance, holders of judicial offices, civil ser¬
vants, members of the regular armed forces and the police forces, and
government-nominated directors of commercial companies which are ordinary
trading concerns.
The conduct of elections, including the manner in which candidates can be
nominated for election, is likewise governed by provisions of the 1949 and 1969
Acts, the second of which which also prescribes a new maximum for the election
expenses which candidates may incur. This is £750, plus i jd. for each elector
in a borough constituency and 2d. for each elector in a county constituency.
The prescribed scale is not required to cover a candidate’s personal expenses,
for instance, the cost of his living at an hotel during the election campaign but
any such expenses beyond j£ioo must be paid by his election agent.
Parliamentary Each House of Parliament enjoys certain rights and immunities designed to
Privilege protect the House from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties.
These rights apply collectively to each House and individually to each
member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown
for the Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include freedom of speech in debate;
and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege of the
House. Further privileges include the right of the House to control its own
proceedings (so that it is able, for instance, to exclude strangers if it so wishes);
the right to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to
declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and the right to penalise those who
commit a breach of its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords include: freedom of speech in debate;
freedom of access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to
commit for contempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the
Speaker as in the House of Commons; they exist independently without grant.
The Party The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth
System century, and has now become an essential element in the working of the
constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political

parties, each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a
general election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for
election; any other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then
indicates, by its choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the
opposing policies it would like to see put into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority
of supporters in the House of Commons, forms the Government. By tradition,
the leader of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the
Sovereign, usually on the advice of senior ministers; and its most outstanding
members in the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial
appointments on the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party
becomes the official Opposition with its own leader1 and its own council of
discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties or
any Independents who have been elected may support the Government or the
Opposition according to their party’s or their own view of the policy being
debated at any given time.
In the general election held in March 1966, 75 Pei cent of the electorate
voted, compared with 77 per cent in October 1964. The number and peicent-
age of votes cast for the principal parties is shown in Table 5.

The distribution of seats in the House of Commons resulting from the
general elections of 1964 and 1966 is shown in Table 6.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests to a considerable
extent upon the fact that Government and Opposition alike are carried on
by agreement: that is to say, the minority agrees that the majority must
govern and therefore accepts its decisions; and the majority agrees that the
minority should criticise and therefore sets time aside for that criticism to
be heard. The detailed arrangements of government business are settled,
under the direction of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, by the
Government Chief Whip in consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip.
The Chief Whips together organise the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in
the House of Commons when the question of the possibility of finding time
for debating some particular issue is discussed. The direction of the business
of the House is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of the House, and it
is his duty to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters
about which it is concerned.
1 The leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons receives an annual salary of
£4,500 in addition to his parliamentary allowance; in the House of Lords the leader
of the Opposition receives £2,000 a year.

“ When a candidate at the polls the Speaker remains aloof from party issues, standing
as ‘the Speaker seeking re-election’. In the past it was customary to allow the Speaker
an unopposed election in his constituency but this is by no means settled practice and
since the end of the second world war the Speaker has, almost always, been opposed.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include maintaining the
voting strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at
important debates. The Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons is
Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and deputy leader of the House; of
the other Government Whips, five hold titular posts as Junior Lords of the
Treasury, three are officers of the Royal Household and six are paid Assistant
Whips. The Chief Opposition Whip also receives a salary. There are also
Government and Opposition Whips in the House of Lords. The former, who
hold offices in the Royal Household, sometimes act as spokesmen for the
Government in debates.
The main functions of Parliament are (i) to pass laws regulating the life of
the community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make
available finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the
funds necessary for the services of the State, and (3) to put relevant facts and
issues before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted before
the ratification of certain international treaties and agreements (in spite of
the fact that the making of treaties is a royal prerogative exercised on the
advice of the Government and, in theory, is not subject to parliamentary
approval).
Parliamentary procedure is based to a considerable extent on custom and
precedent, supplemented by standing orders governing details of practice in
each House. The system of debate is much the same in the two Houses: for
instance, every matter is determined upon questions put from the chair or
woolsack and resolved in the affirmative or negative, as the case may be;
members speak from wherever they have been sitting and not from a rostrum;
and members do not read their speeches. The main difference is that in the
House of Commons the Speaker exercises a greater measure of control.
In the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no inherent
authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the
general sense of the House. In the Commons, on the contrary, the Speaker
has full authority to give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and
orders of the House. He must carefully guard against abuse of procedure or
any infringement of minority rights, and it is his duty to allow or disallow
any closure motion (that is, a motion to end discussion so that the matter may
be put to the vote). He has certain powers to check irrelevance and repetition
in debate, and to save the time of the House in various other respects. In
36
Legislation
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
case of grave disorder, he has power to adjourn the House or suspend the
sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast, the Speaker, who has no original vote, must give the casting
vote; he does this (if possible) in such a way as to avoid change and leave the
question to be decided on another occasion. The procedure on voting in the
House of Lords is similar to that in the House of Commons, except that the
Speaker or chairman has an original, but no casting, vote. With the exception
of questions relating to Bills and delegated legislation, the House of Lords is
governed by the principle that unless there is a majority in favour, the
question is decided in the negative. When the House is sitting judicially
(see pp. 80 and 83) the question is put in such a way that, if the votes are
equal, there is no interference with the order under appeal.
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare
occasions; the minutes (in the House of Commons called Votes and Proceed¬
ings and in the House of Lords, Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches
(The Official Report of Parliamentary Debates, Hansard) are published daily.
Legislation can be initiated from either side of either House; but no Bill
involving taxation or the spending of public money can proceed very far
unless the Government agrees to introduce a ‘financial resolution to cover it.
This has the effect of giving the Government exclusive rights over a wide
field of legislation, and as a result most Public Bills are presented by the
Government. Certain days are, however, set aside for debating Private
Members’ Bills1; that is, Public Bills introduced by members of the House
not holding office in the Government, who have been successful in the ballot,
held early in each session, of members wishing to introduce Bills. Peers can
introduce Public Bills in the House of Lords at any time during a session
without notice. Also, persons and bodies outside Parliament can promote
Private Bills relating solely to matters of individual, corporate or local interest.
Bills may originate in either House, unless they deal with finance or
representation when they are always introduced in the Commons. As a rule,
however, Bills likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons
before the Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature are
frequently introduced and debated in the Lords before being sent to the
Commons.
The process of passing a Public Bill is basically the same in the House of
Lords as in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal First Reading
on introduction; it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies
between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it
is given a Second Reading after the result of a debate on its general merits or
principles. In the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to a
Second Reading Committee to recommend whether or not it should be taken
as read a second time. After a Second Reading in the Commons a Bill is
referred for detailed examination either to a standing committee or, if the
House so decides, to the whole House sitting in committee; in the Lords it is
referred to a committee of the whole House. The committee stage is followed
by the report stage, during which previous amendments may be altered and
additional amendments may be suggested and incorporated. In the Commons,
1 A private member may also present a Bill after question time on notice given, or seek
leave to introduce a Bill under the ‘Ten Minute Rule’, that is, the standing which
allows a brief speech proposing and another opposing the introduction of the Bill before
the House decides whether or not to grant leave.
GOVERNMENT
Parliamentary
Committees
37
if a Bill has been considered by a Second Reading Committee or the Scottish
Grand Committee (see p. 38) the report stage may be taken in that committee.
In the Lords, it is always taken in committee of the whole House. The final
stage of a Bill is the Third Reading (in the Commons a formality unless the
House decides otherwise) and it is then sent from the Commons to the Lords
or from the Lords to the Commons (depending on its place of origin), where
it enters on the same course again. Any amendments which the second House
makes to the Bill must be agreed to by the first House, or a compromise
reached, before the Bill becomes law.
In practice, the Lords pass without amendment all financial Bills,1 such as
the Finance Bill, which authorises annual taxation and amends existing
taxation, and the Appropriation Bill, which authorises expenditure on the
Supply Services from the Consolidated Fund. As a general rule, these Bills
are introduced upon resolutions in the House of Commons; they may be
initiated only by a Minister of the Crown.
When Bills have passed through their various parliamentary stages, they are
sent for Royal Assent, which is given by the Sovereign in Letters Patent and
is declared to both Houses by their Speakers or, periodically, by Royal Com¬
mission. The Sovereign’s power to refuse assent has not been exercised since
the early eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; they
are then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent.
However, should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would
never reach the Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it—
at any rate until a new government came into power, when it might be
reintroduced. The Lords, on the other hand, cannot prevent a Bill insisted
upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal course of
events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons and return it unchanged; or
they revise and improve it by amendments and return it for the consideration
of members of the other House, who frequently agree to the amendments made.
The Lords cannot veto financial measures; nor, in practice, can they delay
any other Commons Bill for more than six months. These limitations on the
powers of the Lords are based on the belief that the Upper House, which is a
non-elected assembly, has a valuable part to play in relieving the House of
Commons of some of its duties, in improving legislation, and in debating
important issues, but that its proceedings should not be used to frustrate the
decisions of the elected House.
In substance, a Private Bill goes through the same procedure as a Public
Bill but most of the work is done in committee, where the promoters must
prove the need for the powers or privileges that they seek and where any
objections raised by opposing interests may be heard.
Either House may resolve itself into a committee, known as a Committee of
the Whole House, to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after their
second reading. A Committee of the Whole House is presided over by a
chairman instead of the Speaker.
There are two other main kinds of parliamentary committee, both of which
exist to relieve their parent House of some of its more specialised and complex
work. They are:
1 It is provided in the Parliament Act 1911 that all Money Bills sent to the House of
Lords one month before the end of the session shall receive the Royal Assent notwith¬
standing, if they are not passed by the Lords without amendment within the month.

1. Standing Committees, which are appointed by the House of Commons as
necessary, for the consideration of the second reading, committee, and,
in certain cases, report stages of Public Bills and, in the case of the Scottish
and Welsh Grand Committees, other business referred to them. With the
exception of the Scottish Standing and Grand Committees1 (which
consider Scottish estimates and other matters relating exclusively to
Scotland), and the Welsh Grand Committee2 (for which parallel arrange¬
ments exist), standing committees consist of from 20 to 50 members
nominated for each Bill by the Committee of Selection (a body normally
consisting of 11 members drawn from the main parties in the House at
the beginning of each session)—the parties being represented in pro¬
portion to their numbers in the House. The procedure of a standing
committee is generally similar to that of a committee of the whole House.
2 Select Committees, which are appointed to enquire into and report to the
House on special matters. Select Committees may be appointed by either
House when the occasion for such an appointment occurs, or they may
be appointed at the beginning of a session to consider all aspects of a
particular subject that may arise during the session. The latter type of
committee is known as a ‘sessional’ committee and includes the Committee
of Privileges, the Public Accounts and Estimates Committees, and the
Committees on Nationalised Industries, Statutory Instruments, Public
Petitions and the House of Commons (Services). There are also a
number of specialist select committees: the Selection Committee; the
Standing Orders Committee which has duties relating to Private Bills; and
joint select committees of both Houses of Parliament which may be
appointed at the instance of either House.
In addition to the House of Commons committees there are the parlia¬
mentary party organisations; the Parliamentary Labour Party, which is a
corporate body comprising all members of the party in both Houses; and t e
Conservative and Unionist Members Committee, popularly known as the
1922 Committee, which consists of the back-bench membership of the party.
The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on
parliamentary time, empowers ministers and other authorities to regulate
administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the
risk that powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken
parliamentary government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in
Council or to authorities directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to ministers
of the Crown, to government departments for which ministers are responsible,
or to organisations whose regulations are subject to confirmation or approva
by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament for them. More¬
over, the Act which delegates power to issue rules and orders3 generally defines
its precise limits and, in the more important cases, gives Parliament the right
to confirm or annul the orders themselves. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation, before rules and orders are made, with organisations which wi
be affected thereby.
1 The Scottish Standing Committee consists of 30 members nominated from Scottish
constituencies with up to 20 other nominated members; in its plenary torm, as tne
Scottish Grand Committee, it comprises all the members for the Scottish constituencies
and not less than ten nor more than x 5 others.
2 The Welsh Grand Committee consists of 36 members for constituencies in Wales and
Monmouthshire, with up to 5 other nominated members.
3 Statutory instruments (‘SI’) are made in accordance with the provisions of the
Statutory Instruments Act 1946.

Parliamentary
Control
Parliamentary
Commissioner
The House of Commons is aided in its supervision of delegated legislation
by the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. The Special Orders
Committee of the House of Lords examines and reports on all Statutory
Instruments requiring affirmative resolution.
Control of the Government in power is exercised in the final analysis by the
ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign either
by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of
confidence’; but Parliament has not used its power in this way for many
years. A number of opportunities for a searching examination of government
policy by both the Opposition and the Government’s own back-benchers are,
however, provided in parliamentary procedure. Such opportunities include:
1. Question Time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in rotation,
answer questions put to them on matters for which they are responsible.
So much parliamentary time is devoted to scheduled public business that
questions are regarded as the best means of eliciting hitherto unpublished
information about the Government’s intentions, as well as an effective way
of airing, and possibly securing some redress of, grievances brought to the
notice of members by their constituents. (The other means available to
members is by way of the Parliamentary Commissioner—see below.)
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the House to
initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern.
There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public business; on
a day when public business ends before the scheduled time the time saved
may be used for adjournment debates; and immediately before the
adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter, Whitsun and the Summer)
there is a whole day spent discussing topics raised by private members.
Moreover, if a member wishes to discuss a ‘specific and important matter
that should have urgent consideration’ he may, at the end of Question
Time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House; if the Speaker
accepts the motion and if, the matter being referred to the House, leave is
given unanimously, or on an objection being made, 40 or more members
support the motion, the matter is usually debated on the following day.
3. The practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates, in Committee of
Supply, has ceased to be a consideration of the financial requirements of
the Government and has become an occasion for the examination, initiated
by the Opposition, of some aspect of the Government’s administrative
policy, the cost of which has been included in the Estimates.
The involvement of Parliament, and more particularly the House of
Commons, in the management of the revenues of the State and payments for
the public service are described in Chapter 14, Finance.
The Parliamentary Commissioner is an officer of the House of Commons,
independent of the Executive. His function is to investigate complaints of
maladministration brought to his notice by members of Parliament on behalf
of members of the public. His powers of investigation extend to actions taken
by central government departments in the exercise of their administra¬
tive functions, but not to policy decisions (which are the concern of the
Government). Certain administrative actions are, however, outside his
jurisdiction; these include matters affecting relations with other countries and
the activities of British officials outside the United Kingdom.

In the performance of his duties, the Parliamentary Commissioner has
access to all departmental papers, and reports his findings to the member of
Parliament who presented the case. The Commissioner reports annually to
Parliament and may submit such other reports as he thinks fit. A Select
Committee has been appointed to consider these reports.
The Parliament of Northern Ireland consists of the Sovereign, a Senate and
a House of Commons. The Sovereign is represented in Northern Ireland by
a Governor, who summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament in Her
Majesty’s name; the Senate is composed of two ex officio senators (the Lord
Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor of Londonderry) and 24 senators who hold
office for an eight-year term, 12 being elected by the House of Commons every
four years under a system of proportional representation; while the House of
Commons consists of 52 members, elected by a system of parliamentary
franchise similar to that which operates in Great Britain. The House continues
in existence for a period of five years unless it is dissolved earlier.
The Northern Ireland Parliament has power to make laws for the peace,
order and good government of Northern Ireland in relation to all matters
except those especially reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom,
which include the Crown or succession to the Crown; foreign relations;
defence; the postal services; the Supreme Court; customs and excise; income
and profits taxes; coinage; standards of weights and measures; trade marks;
submarine cables; wireless telegraphy; aerial navigation; and lighthouses,
buoys and beacons. Under the constitutional practices which have developed
since the passing of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 the United Kingdom
Parliament does not legislate on matters within the powers of the Northern
Ireland Parliament unless the Government of Northern Ireland requests that
this should be done. But, because certain matters have been reserved to the
United Kingdom Parliament, provision was made in the Government of
Ireland Act 1920 for the continued representation of the Northern Ireland
constituencies in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; in
accordance with this provision, 12 members are returned to Westminster.
The Parliamentary Commissioner of the House of Commons at Westminster
is also the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Northern Ireland House of
Commons.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent.
Many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner Committee
of the Privy Council, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
government departments, some of which were originally committees of the
Privy Council. The present-day Privy Council is the body on whose advice
and through which the Sovereign exercises his or her statutory and a number
of prerogative powers. It also has its own statutory duties, independent of the
power of the Sovereign in Council.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy
Council (which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister as an honour to persons who have

reached eminence in some branch of public affairs in any country of the
Commonwealth. There are usually about 300 Privy Counsellors.
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk of the Council and is presided
over by the Sovereign or, when the Sovereign is abroad or ill, by Counsellors
of State. Three Privy Counsellors form a quorum, but, as a rule, not fewer
than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy Council is called together
only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his or her
intention to marry.
The Privy Council is responsible for advising the Sovereign to approve
Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing fundamentally in
constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal prerogative, for
example, Orders approving the grant of Royal Charters of Incorporation; and
those made under statutory powers, which are the highest form of delegated
legislation. It is an accepted principle that members of the Privy Council
attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not thereby
become personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders are based;
this rests with the minister whose department is responsible for the subject
matter of the Order in question, whether or not he was present at the meeting.
Notice of certain Orders in Council must be published in the London Gazette,
an official periodical published by the authority of the Government.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclama¬
tions, some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of
Parliament.
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These committees, which have advisory functions, may be
prerogative, such as the committee which deals with legislative matters
submitted by the legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man; or
they may be provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford
and Cambridge and the Scottish universities, and that which deals with
applications for the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out
in the Privy Council Office under the control of the Lord President of the
Council.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council derives its appellate jurisdiction
from the right of subjects of the Crown to appeal for redress to the Sovereign
in Council if they believe that the courts of law have failed to do them justice.
It is now the final court of appeal from the courts of the United Kingdom
dependencies, from the courts of those independent members of the Common¬
wealth (including certain countries of which Her Majesty is no longer Queen)
which have not elected to discontinue the appeal, from prize courts1 in the
United Kingdom and dependencies, from the courts of the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man, and from certain professional disciplinary committees.
It also has jurisdiction in a limited class of English ecclesiastical appeals.
Appeals come to the Judicial Committee either where a right of appeal has
been specially created—for instance, by statute, Order in Council or Letters
Patent—or by special leave of the Sovereign in Council on the advice of the
1 Prize courts deal with matters concerning property captured in time of war which, by
grace of the Crown, falls to the forces which assist in the capture.

Judicial Committee. They are heard by a board of the committee, whose
members are usually selected from the Lord Chancellor, ex-Lord Chan¬
cellors and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, although other members of the
Privy Council who have held high judicial office (including chief justices and
certain other judges from Commonwealth countries overseas) are asked to
sit from time to time. In theory the Judicial Committee does not deliver
judgment. It advises the Sovereign who acts on its report and approves an
Order in Council to give effect thereto. Its decisions, though not binding on
the English courts, are treated with great respect by them.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time being
with the administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. There
are, however, always some ministers in the House of Lords, partly because
there is a statutory limit to the number of ministers who may sit and vote in
the Commons while receiving salaries from the Crown, and also because
every Government must be assured of spokesmen to expound and justify its
intentions and its actions to the House of Lords. The Lord Chancellor is
always a member of the House of Lords.
Ministerial salaries range from £14,000 a year for the Prime Minister and
£8,500 for senior ministers to £3,75° f°r juni°r ministers. The Prime
Minister and ministers in the House of Commons also have the £1,250
parliamentary allowance paid to all members of the House. The Lord
Chancellor receives £14,500 a year, including £4,000 as Speaker of the
House of Lords.

Ministers
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The usual
ministerial offices may be classified under the following heads:
The Prime Minister, who is also First Lord of the Treasury and, at present,
Minister for the Civil Service.
Departmental Ministers, who are ministers in charge of government depart¬
ments. The holders of nine offices (some ancient and others of recent creation)
are known as ‘Secretaries of State’; others have special titles, for instance, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury and a
number of sub-departments) and the President of the Board of Trade. The
remainder hold the formal title of ‘Minister’.
Non-Departmental Ministers, who include the holders of various traditional
offices—the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster,1 the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and Ministers
without Portfolio. Usually these ministers have few or no departmental duties
and are thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime Minister
may wish to entrust to them.
1 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed
by the reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and
is separately administered by the Chancellor.

The Prime
Minister
The Lord Chancellor has departmental functions; he is also in a special
position as a Minister of the Crown who is also head of the judiciary in
England and Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England
and Wales, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the
Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State are appointed to government departments in which the
work is particularly heavy and complex or where it involves frequent
travelling abroad. There are now five Ministers of State in the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office; three each in the Board of Trade and the Department
of Education and Science; two in the Department of Health and Social
Security; and one each in the Home Office, the Scottish Office, the Welsh
Office, the Ministry of Technology, the Treasury, and the Department of
Economic Affairs. The two Ministers of Defence under the Secretary of
State for Defence (one for administration and one for equipment) and the
Minister for Planning and Land in the Ministry of Housing and Local
Government also rank as Ministers of State.
Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or,
where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under¬
secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to relieve
their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in parliamentary
debates and answering parliamentary questions, and by assisting in their
departmental duties. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and the
Junior Lords of the Treasury are in a different category as Government
Whips.
The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister during
the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority enjoyed by the
holder of this office derives from his ability to command a majority in
Parliament and from his power to submit his own choice of ministers to the
Sovereign and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. Nowadays,
by convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise a
general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences and
approving important departmental decisions where reference to the Cabinet
is not required. The Prime Minister speaks for the Government in the House
of Commons on the most important topics and answers questions on its
general administration in that House.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as
for appointments to high judicial offices, such as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices of Appeal. He also advises the Crown
on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord Lieutenants of counties1 and
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower,
and some university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The
Prime Minister makes similar recommendations for appointments to various
public boards and institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation,
as well as to various royal and statutory commissions. He likewise makes

recommendations to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and
distinctions and of Civil List pensions and selects the trustees of certain
national museums and institutions.
The Cabinet is composed of a number of ministers (usually about 20) who
are selected by the Prime Minister personally. Its origins can be traced back
to the informal conferences that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers,
independently of the Privy Council, during the seventeenth century. After
the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an active role in politics in the eighteenth
century, and the development of organised political parties stimulated by
successive extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet
assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of the policy to
be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive
in accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous
co-ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments.
The exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet
is a group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the
support of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the
publication of Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they
have been in existence for 30 years they may be made available for inspection
in the Public Record Office) and a resigning minister desiring to make a
statement involving disclosure of Cabinet discussions should first obtain the
permission of the Sovereign through the Prime Minister. From a practical
point of view, this secrecy is essential in the interests of full and frank discus¬
sion, which can be maintained only if there is no risk of publicity for ever\
statement made and every point conceded.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. To keep the
amount of work coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a great
deal of the work of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system,
which involves the reference of any issue either to a standing Cabinet
committee or to an ad hoc committee composed of the ministers primarily
concerned. The committee then considers the matter in detail and either
disposes of it or reports upon it to the Cabinet with recommendations for
action. Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend its meetings when
matters affecting their departments are under discussion; they may also be
members of Cabinet committees.
The Secretary of the Cabinet and senior officials of the Cabinet Office attend
meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate. A record is kept of
the conclusions and of the main points made in discussion.
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which
ministers share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual
responsibility of ministers to Parliament for the work of their departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, means that the Cabinet is bound to offer
GOVERNMENT
45
unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject. Consequently it means that the policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. In principle, once the Government’s policy on a particular matter
has been decided, each minister is expected to support it, unless he chooses
to resign, as he is free to do if he cannot agree with his colleagues on a matter
of general policy or on a single major issue.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of admin¬
istration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since
the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in
person. Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be
represented in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually their Parliamentary Secretaries.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they will usually wish to consult
their colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee. Any
decision by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way
of bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any
departmental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament
discourages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to
government policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation.
They may, and frequently do, work with and through local authorities,
statutory boards, and government-sponsored organisations operating under
varying degrees of government control.
A change of government does not necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments, although a radical change in policy may
be accompanied by organisational change. The widening scope of government
activity in the past half-century, however, has led to the formation of many
new departments. A few have existed for over 200 years.
The work of some departments, for instance, the Board of Customs and
Excise, covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments, for
instance, the Department of Employment and Productivity, cover Great
Britain (England and Wales, and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland); others,
such as the Ministry of Housing and Local Government cover England only,
and there are similar but separate departments for Scotland and Northern
Ireland. There is also a separate department with responsibility for affairs in
Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in
which questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent
official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, Treasury ministers are responsible for a number of departments,
including Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, the Central Office of Information,
46
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Department of the Government
Actuary, the Royal Mint, the National Debt Office, the Public Works Loan
Board, and the National Savings Committee. The staff of departments are all
members of the Civil Service, a body of Crown servants recruited into the
service as a career.
Internal Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
Organisation work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging
its duties there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments,
however, have certain features in common: for example, the minister of a
major department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent
secretary (known as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State in those depart¬
ments where the minister is a Secretary of State), one or more deputy secre¬
taries, and a varying number of under-secretaries and assistant secretaries.
Usually major departments also have a principal finance officer and a principal
establishments and organisation officer. A number of establishment divisions
have their own organisation and methods (‘O and M’) branch, the members
of which act in an advisory capacity. Many departments also have their own
legal advisers or solicitors, and their own information division.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that ha\e
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.
Advisory Bodies Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or com¬
mittees (several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect
information, mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before
coming to a decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases
there is a statutory obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee,
but usually advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister
concerned because he feels the need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved. Some are expert committees; others
include civil servants and representatives of varying interests and professions,
for instance, industrialists, trade unionists, university and industrial scientists,
educationists, lawyers and local government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recom¬
mendations on specific matters. For certain important enquiries Royal
Commissions, whose members are selected on the grounds of their vide
experience and diverse knowledge, may be appointed (by Royal Warrant).
Royal Commissions examine written and oral evidence from government
departments and other interested organisations and individuals, and on this
evidence submit recommendations. The Government may accept the recom¬
mendations in whole or in part, or it may decide to take no further action or
to delay action. Enquiries may also be undertaken by departmental committees,
appointed by the head of the appropriate department.

The Cabinet Office is in essence a secretariat, headed by the Secretary of the
Cabinet, serving ministers collectively. It operates under the direction of the
Prime Minister as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy at the highest
level. Its functions include circulating the memoranda and other documents
required for Cabinet or Cabinet committee business, preparing the agenda for
meetings of the Cabinet and its committees, recording their discussions and
circulating the minutes, keeping in touch with the progress of action on
decisions and safeguarding the security of documents. The Cabinet Office
also includes an historical section, which is responsible for the preparation of
Official Histories of the War.
Attached to the Cabinet Office, and an integral part of it, is the Central
Statistical Office, which is charged with the collection from departments of
statistics relating to the national economy, their analysis, and their preparation
as an agreed body of statistics to assist the Government in formulating its
economic and financial policy.
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (now always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and five Junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners
never meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, assisted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the
Financial Secretary and a Minister of State. There is also a Parliamentary
Secretary to the Treasury, who is the Chief Government Whip in the House
of Commons.
The Treasury is responsible for financial policy and financial relations with
overseas countries. It supervises public expenditure—balancing it against
national resources and organising its control by functions, for instance, defence,
social services and transport. It has prime responsibility for short-term
economic assessments and works in co-operation with the Department of
Economic Affairs on economic analysis, forecasting, and other subjects.
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of
all Government Bills, except those Bills or provisions of Bills extending
exclusively to Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Depart¬
ment. The Office drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and
amendments moved by the Government during the passage of Bills; it advises
departments on questions of parliamentary procedure; and attends sittings
(and committees) in both Houses. It also drafts subordinate legislation when
specially instructed, and advises the Government on legal, parliamentary and
constitutional questions falling within its special experience.
The office of Minister for the Civil Service is held by the Prime Minister. The
day-to-day work of the Department is under the control of the Lord Privy Seal.
The Permanent Secretary of the Department is the official head of the Home
Civil Service.
The Department is responsible for personnel management in the Civil
Service, which includes policy and central arrangements for recruitment,
training, promotion, general career management, welfare and retirement.
It is also responsible for the control of numbers in the Service and for grading
standards in individual departments; and it deals with questions of pay,
pensions, and conditions of service in the Civil Service, and with pay and
pension policies in the public sector as a whole. The Department is further
responsible for promoting the development of administrative and managerial

techniques and provides a central management services consultancy—dealing
with organisation and methods, computers, operational research and similar
matters—to other departments.
The Civil Service Commission, which is responsible for the selection of
permanent civil servants, forms part of the Civil Service Department, but
specific and formal arrangements have been made to ensure its independence
and impartiality in the performance of its task.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible in England
and Wales for administering government policy for agriculture, horticulture
and fishing. The Ministry administers deficiency payments schemes and
various grants and subsidies designed to improve the efficiency of the
industries, and gives free technical advice.
Schemes for the control and eradication of animal and plant diseases are
also administered by the Ministry, whose responsibilities extend to Scotland
in the operational control of certain diseases of animals.
In England and Wales the Ministry deals with certain questions relating
to legislation about food, including labelling and advertising, slaughter¬
houses, and the quality and cleanliness of milk. Questions relating to the
supply and manufacture of food, its consumption, composition, preservation
and nutritional qualities, are dealt with by the Ministry for Great Britain or
the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign
countries and participates in certain of the activities of a number of international
organisations concerned with agriculture, fisheries and food, such as the Food
and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development and the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
The primary work of the Board of Customs and Excise is to collect and
administer the customs and excise duties imposed from time to time in the
annual Finance Acts or by other legislation, and to advise the Chancellor of
the Exchequer on any matters connected with them. The Board is also
responsible for preventing and detecting evasion of the revenue laws.
The Board undertakes, for other departments, a wide range of non-revenue
agency work, for instance, the enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions on
the importation and exportation of certain classes of goods, exchange currency
control, and the compilation of United Kingdom overseas trade statistics
from customs import and export documents.
The Ministry of Defence is the government department responsible for the
formulation of defence policy and for the control and administration of the
three fighting Services. The Secretary of State for Defence is in charge of
the department and there are two Ministers of Defence—Administration and
Equipment. The first is responsible for personnel and logistics, and the
second for research, development and production and also for procurement and
sales. There are also three Parliamentary Under-Secretaries with responsibi¬
lities for the respective Services.
The Meteorological Office provides the national weather service and
meteorological library. It is responsible for: forecasts required for aviation
and for sound and television forecasts; much of the weather information
published by the press; and forecasts provided on the Automatic Telephone
Weather Service. Weather centres have been opened in London, Glasgow,
GOVERNMENT
49
Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne and Southampton to deal with industrial,
commercial and popular demands.
The Meteorological Office is also responsible for research into various
problems related to weather forecasting and to atmospheric physics.
The Department The Department of Economic Affairs, under the Secretary of State for
of Economic Economic Affairs, is concerned with the general allocation of real resources
Affairs and the co-ordination of industrial policy; it works in close co-operation with
the Treasury and other departments.
The Department is organised in three inter-related groups: the Industrial
Group, which deals with industrial policies and the promotion of industrial
efficiency and which works closely with the Economic Development
Committees on industrial matters; the Economic Group, which works on
growth policies and the preparation of medium-term assessments of the
development of the economy and of long-term and very long-range forecasts;
and the Regional Group, which is responsible for regional economic planning,
including the regional aspects of industry, employment, land use, and trans¬
port, and which has staff in each of the English regions and a Central Planning
Unit to study projects for large-scale development.
The Department of Education and Science, under the Secretary of State
for Education and Science, is organised in branches severally concerned with
schools, further education (including vocational, recreational and adult
education and the youth service), teachers and kindred subjects in England and
Wales; and with the universities, civil science and support for the arts and sport
throughout Great Britain. There are also specialist branches, which advise
on health, building, planning (including educational research and statistics),
and law, and an information service.
The Department’s responsibilities for the development of primary,
secondary and other education include dealing with the supply, training and
superannuation of teachers, the building of new schools and other institutions,
the school health service, the special educational treatment of handicapped
children, and the provision of school meals and milk. In these matters the
Department works in co-operation with local education authorities—the
Inner London Education Authority and the councils of counties, county
boroughs, and the outer London boroughs—whose duty it is to secure
adequate facilities for all forms of education in their areas. Its relations with
the universities are conducted through the University Grants Committee
(appointed by the Secretary of State to advise on State aid to universities).
Its activities in the field of civil science are discharged through five research
councils: the Medical Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council,
the Natural Environment Research Council (which carries out and supports
research in earth sciences and ecology), the Social Science Research Council,
and the Science Research Council (which carries out scientific research and is
responsible for research grants and postgraduate training awards in those
fields which are not specifically the responsibility of the other councils, and
also supports research in engineering and technology in the universities).

distribution of manpower between industries and occupations. It also has
overall responsibility for the Government’s policy on productivity and prices
and incomes, including co-ordination of prices policy.
In matters of employment policy, one of the Department’s principal
functions is to help employees to find the work best suited to them and
employers to obtain suitable employees; to this end, it operates a national
system of employment exchanges, which includes a Professional and
Executive Register at 40 of the larger exchanges and a limited number of
Occupational Guidance Centres for adults. It also administers the Industrial
Training Act; operates government schemes for vocational training and
industrial rehabilitation; is concerned with the central administration of the
Youth Employment Service, which is provided locally by the Department or
the local authority; and provides the Disablement Resettlement Service,
which helps disabled persons to secure employment.
Other functions of the Department in this field include: the resettlement in
civilian employment of men released from the armed forces; the supervision,
through the Factory Inspectorate, of safety, health and welfare measures for
workers in industry and commerce; the collection and publication of labour
statistics of all kinds; the promotion of good industrial relations; the provision
of services for conciliation, arbitration and investigation in industrial disputes;
the administration of the Redundancy Payments Act 1965; and dealing with
questions arising from the administration of the Wages Councils Act 1959
and the Selective Employment Payments Act 1966.

the International Labour Organisation rests with the Department, which also
deals with overseas questions about labour and employment and with the
employment of foreign workers in Great Britain.
Besides these principal functions, the Department undertakes agency work
for other government departments in connection with social security benefits,
repayment of income tax to unemployed persons, and the issue of pass¬
ports.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, under the Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, acts as a channel of communication
between the British Government and the governments of foreign and overseas
Commonwealth countries for the discussion and negotiation of all matters,
including economic issues, falling within the sphere of international and
Commonwealth relations. The department provides the means by which the
British Government is represented in the United Nations and on other
international bodies and is kept informed about developments in countries
overseas; by which British subjects and interests abroad are protected and
trade promoted; and by which British policy is explained to governments and
peoples overseas. It also discharges the British Government’s responsibilities
in the associated states and dependent territories in the Commonwealth. In
the case of the associated states, these responsibilities relate mainly to defence
and external affairs. In the dependent territories, each of which has its own
internal administration, the British Government is finally responsible for
good government and for the relations between these territories and other
countries.
The Forestry Commission is the national forest authority in Great Britain;
it has its own annual Vote in the Estimates and is responsible for promoting

The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax
and surtax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty, estate duty and
certain other direct taxes, and advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any
matters connected with them. It is also responsible for the valuation of real
property for such purposes as compensation for compulsory purchase, local
rates in England and Wales, and estate duty; it collects tithe redemption
annuities; and it makes payments, under compensation schemes, for war
damage to land, buildings and chattels.
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales (the Attorney General
and the Solicitor General) are responsible for the legal advice given to the
Government; in addition, they have a wide range of duties in relation to the
courts. The Attorney General, who is the senior Law Officer, is the Crown’s
representative in the courts, and legal proceedings for the enforcement of
public rights and on behalf of the interests of charity are conducted in his
name; he is assisted by the Solicitor General, who is the junior Law Officer.
The Attorney General’s consent is required to the institution of criminal
proceedings for certain offences, and the Director of Public Prosecutions is
subject to his superintendence. The Queen’s Proctor, who has certain duties
connected with the operation of the divorce laws, also exercises his functions
under the direction of the Attorney General. The Solicitor General is subject
to the authority of the Attorney General, with the same rights and duties. The
Law Officers, who are appointed from among the leading members of the
English Bar and are always members of the House of Commons, are assisted
by a small professional staff.

General’s Office departments other than the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and
Excise, for which separate arrangements exist. Money granted by Parliament
is transferred (in such sums as may be required from day to day) from the
Exchequer account to the account of the Paymaster General at the Bank of
England. Most departmental payments are made by means of payable orders
drawn on the Paymaster General’s Office; these are similar to cheques, and
their recipients obtain payments through the commercial banks, whose
accounts at the Bank of England are in turn reimbursed by the Paymaster
General’s Office.

The Secretary of State’s statutory functions are discharged by four main
departments of equal status (the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland, the Scottish Development Department, the Scottish Education
Department, and the Scottish Home and Health Department), each under a
Secretary responsible to the Secretary of State.
The responsibilities of the Secretary of State for the preparation and
implementation of the economic plans for Scotland are discharged through
the Permanent Under-Secretary of State and other Scottish Office staff
with the advice of the Scottish Economic Planning Council and the assistance
of the Scottish Economic Planning Board and the officials of the departments
principally concerned.
The day-to-day administration of the departments is conducted in
Edinburgh, but each department has representatives in London for liaison and
parliamentary duties. The London office is generally known as the Scottish
Office, the term also used to describe all Scottish administration for which the
Secretary of State is responsible.
The Scottish Ministers are advised and assisted (particularly on questions
with which more than one of the departments are concerned or which fall
outside the province of any of them) by the Permanent Under-Secretary of
State, Scottish Office.
The Department has a general responsibility for, and in most cases admin¬
isters, government measures for the promotion and development of farming
in Scotland. It also has responsibilities for the oversight and protection of the
Scottish inshore, deep sea and fresh-water fisheries, and functions relating
to certain harbours.
The Scottish Development Department is concerned with a number of
services affecting the physical development of Scotland, such as town and

aid and the services needed by the courts, and is directly responsible for the
administration of prisons and borstal institutions. It is also the central
authority in Scotland for the fire service, for civil defence, and for legislation
concerning shops, theatres, cinemas and licensed premises (which are directly
maintained by the Department in districts in which State management is in
operation).
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Scottish Information Office,
which undertakes information services on behalf of the Scottish departments
and, to some extent, for Great Britain departments in Scotland, and acts as
the agent in Scotland of the Central Office of Information; the Department
of the Registrar-General for Scotland (the General Register Office); the
Scottish Record Office; and the Department of the Registers of Scotland.
There are also Scottish branches of the Great Britain and United Kingdom
departments under the direction of controllers, who are responsible for
ensuring that the execution in Scotland of the policy and procedure of their
departments is in accordance with Scottish conditions and needs.
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely
concerned with questions of legal policy and administration and is
himself responsible for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on
indictment in Scotland, and the control of summary prosecutions in the
sheriff court.
In some of this work the Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate’s

an Exchequer and Audit Department which, together with the Ministries of
Home Affairs, Education, and Agriculture, have functions indicated by their
titles. The other departments have duties of a varied nature, which are
summarised below.

THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of
a political or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose
remuneration is found wholly and directly out of money voted by Parliament.
The term is generally used only to cover ‘non-industrial’ members of the
staffs of the various government departments in the United Kingdom or
working overseas. They total about 480,000,1 a third of them women. In

one whole-time officer.

addition, however, there are over 200,000 government industrial employees
in such establishments as Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Dockyards.
Civil servants work in support of ministers in their public and parliamentary
duties. Their functions range from the formulation of policy proposals and the
management of the machinery of government to carrying out the day-to-day
duties that public administration demands. Stability of administration is
ensured by the political neutrality of the Service. Although a civil servant
works under the authority and direction of the minister of the department to
which he is appointed, legally he is a servant of the Crown. A change of
minister, whether due to ministerial changes within a government or the
advent of a government of a different political complexion, does not involve a
change of permanent staff.
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years.
Before then, departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying
standards were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political
jobbery was rife. Nineteenth century reforms included the substitution of open
competition for the practice of obtaining Civil Service appointments by favour
or purchase, and the establishment of an independent body, the Civil Service
Commission, to control recruitment. The great expansion in State activity in
the first half of the twentieth century, and the consequent increase in the
numbers of civil servants and the scope of their duties, led to further
reorganisation, including the creation of service-wide scientific and pro¬
fessional classes; recruitment was adapted to a developing educational system,
and co-ordination between the various departments improved. Civil servants,
though they remained employees of their departments, became members of
an integrated service with common conditions of employment and traditions
and standards of conduct belonging, not to individual departments, but to the
Civil Service as a whole.
Following government acceptance in June 1968 of the main recommendations
of the Fulton Committee,1 the Civil Service is introducing major evolutionary
reforms which will help it to deal with the changing tasks facing government.
Several years will be needed for their fulfilment but new developments are
already taking place. The Civil Service Department (see p. 47) was set up
in November 1968; the establishment of a Civil Service College for training and
research is expected during 1970 and, in the meantime, a greatly expanded
training programme is being introduced. The Government has accepted the
recommendations for the abolition of the existing structure of occupational
classes, and work directed to the reform of the grading structure is in hand.
Because modern government touches almost every aspect of life, the Civil
Service comprises officers with a wide variety of professional and technical
qualifications. Where officers of a particular type are required in more than
one department they are at present organised in general service or linked
departmental classes. The main classes are:
1. The Administrative Class, which numbers about 3,900 including equiva¬
lent grades in the Diplomatic Service (see p. 62). The duties of this class
include the formulation of policy, and its members comprise the majority
1 The committee appointed by the Government in 1966 under the chairmanship of
Lord Fulton, then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sussex, to examine the
structure, recruitment and management, including management training, of the Civil
Service published its report on the Civil Service in June 1968 (see Bibliography, p. 469).

of those civil servants responsible for advising ministers. The class is also
responsible for the co-ordination and improvement of government
machinery and the general administration and control of government
departments. Most new entrants are appointed soon after leaving univer¬
sity, but there is some recruitment of more mature people and civil
servants from other classes (mainly the Executive Class) may be promoted.
About 40 per cent of the present Administrative Class started their careers
in the Civil Service in this way.
2. The Executive Classes (General and Departmental) which number some
84,000. These classes are broadly responsible for the day-to-day conduct
of government business, including, for instance, the higher work of
accounts and revenue collection, within the framework of established
policy. The increasing size and scope of the work of the Civil Service
means that the duties performed by officers of the higher grades of this class
are often indistinguishable from those performed by the corresponding
grades of the Administrative Class.
3. The Specialist Classes (General and Departmental), which number about
120,000, include the Scientific, Professional and Technical Classes and
other classes which carry out the wide range of specialised activities now
undertaken by the Government. The categories include accountants,
architects, doctors, economists, engineers, lawyers, librarians, statisticians,
surveyors and scientists in all branches of science. The professionally
qualified staff are assisted by a large number of other suitably qualified
people, for instance, technical and drawing office staffs.
4. The Clerical Classes (General and Departmental) comprise about 191,000
officers who undertake all the usual clerical work involved in running
departmental business: for instance, the preparation of accounts and the
keeping of records, the handling of particular claims in accordance with
known rules, and the summarising and annotation of documents for the
assistance of senior officers. The personal secretaries of senior officers are
included in this group, together with officers directly responsible for the
supervision of clerical work.
5. The Typing and Machine Operating Classes (about 41,000), which include
duplicating grades, photoprinters and teleprinter operators.
6. Messengerial Classes (with some 27,000 members) which, in addition to
messengers, include paperkeepers, office cleaners and similar workers.
In addition there are many other departmental classes where employment
is peculiar to one department: for instance, the Inspectorate of Childrens
Department of the Home Office; the Factory Inspectorate of the Department
of Employment and Productivity; the Schools Inspectorate of the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science; and the Mines Inspectorate of the Ministry
of Power.
The Diplomatic The Diplomatic Service is a separate self-contained service of the Crown,
Service which provides the staff (comprising some 6,200 civil servants) for service in
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom diplomatic
missions and consular posts in foreign and in independent Commonwealth
countries. Its functions include advising on policy, negotiating with overseas
governments and conducting business in international organisations; pro¬
moting British exports and the advancement of British trade; presenting

British ideas, policies and objectives to the people of overseas countries;
and protecting British interests abroad.
The Service has its own grade structure, corresponding by salary with the
grades of the Administrative, Executive and Clerical Classes1 of the Home
Civil Service; it also has Secretarial, Communications and Security Guard
branches. Various specialists and advisers from home departments or the
armed forces may serve at overseas posts on secondment or attachment to the
Diplomatic Service.
The Government of Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which deals
with matters transferred to its jurisdiction under the Government of Ireland
Act 1920. Subject to regional differences, the Northern Ireland Civil Service
is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, recruitment being effected
through its own Civil Service Commission. Interchange of staff between the
two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for depart¬
mental agreement in individual cases.
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but
when vacancies cannot be filled by this means, the Ministry for Overseas
Development and the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Adminis¬
trations are asked to recruit other candidates, principally from the United
Kingdom.
The main principle of recruitment to the permanent Civil Service is that of
entry by open competition, in which all eligible candidates (both within and
outside the Service) are considered on equal terms. Limited competitions,
designed to afford special opportunities of permanent appointment or pro¬
motion for particular categories of staff already employed in the Service,
are also held for many general service classes or departmental grades.
The main point of entry into each of the general classes corresponds with a
specified level in the British education system, and selection is by interview
and/or qualifying examination. Entry to the Professional and Technical
Classes usually requires appropriate qualifications in the subject concerned,
and selection is by record and interview. The Civil Service Commission is
responsible for conducting the examinations and interviews, and for issuing
to departments certificates to the effect that candidates are qualified for
particular posts. The appointment of the candidate after certification is carried
out by the department in which he is to be employed.
Recruitment to clerical and certain other junior posts may be undertaken by
the departments themselves, with the Commission acting in an advisory
capacity and issuing the certificates necessary for permanent appointment.
Temporary civil servants are also normally recruited by the department
concerned; no special qualifying examinations are required.
In all except the smallest government departments, there are full-time training
officers and instructors whose task it is to help to identify the training needs of
the staff and to organise courses, both general and technical, to provide for
their varying requirements. The number of management courses run within
the Civil Service, as well as the use made of external management courses
at business schools, the Administrative Staff College and elsewhere, have
1 The numbers in these separate classes are included in the equivalent Home Civil
Service Grades.

increased substantially during recent years with the growing emphasis on
the provision of training in all aspects of management, and will continue
to do so.
Methods of training within the Service include lectures, discussion groups,
instructional visits, case-studies, closed-circuit television and Video-tape
recordings, instructional films and programmed learning, as well as ‘on-the-
job’ training. Civil servants are regularly moved between the different
branches of their department and sometimes between departments so that
they can gain as wide an experience as possible of Civil Service work.
In order that they may continue their studies, civil servants under the age of
18 are released, usually on one day a week (‘day release’ schemes) to attend
local technical colleges, while adult staff are assisted financially, and by giving
them ‘time off’, to undertake private studies leading to recognised educa¬
tional or professional qualifications in approved subjects. There are also
opportunities for civil servants in mid-career to obtain fellowships or other¬
wise go on sabbatical leave to undertake research in areas of interest to
themselves and their departments.
Training is co-ordinated by the Centre for Administrative Studies and the
Training and Education Division of the Civil Service Department. The
Centre arranges a large number of centrally run management courses and
seminars covering such subjects as organisation and staff management,
economics, statistics, industrial growth, social administration, operational
research, computers and information systems, as well as a number of
specialised courses. The Division gives guidance and encouragement to
departments in the organisation and implementation of their training effort,
and a small team of Training Liaison Officers assists in the discharge of these
responsibilities. The Division is also responsible for the preliminary work in
relation to the establishment of the Civil Service College in 1970.
A period of probation (varying according to grade, with extensions in certain
instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent Civil Service.
Promotions from grade to grade are made by departments; those from class
to class partly through centrally conducted competitions and partly by
departments themselves. Promotions or appointments to most of the highest
positions in the Civil Service, for instance, permanent secretaries, deputy
secretaries, principal establishments officers and principal finance officers,
must be approved by the Prime Minister, who is advised in these matters by
the head of the Home Civil Service.
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service
as a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council, which is composed
jointly of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate
sections of the service is provided through the various staff associations which
civil servants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil Service Clerical
Association, the Society of Civil Servants, the Institution of Professional Civil
Servants, and the Association of First Division Civil Servants), and through
departmental Whitley Councils.
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is based on a fair
comparison with that paid for similar work outside the service and usually he
receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to
which he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the
pleasure of the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice
he enjoys a considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every permanent
GOVERNMENT 65
civil servant, who is capable and efficient, may reasonably expect a full career
in the public service and a pension on retirement.1
Civil servants are required to work a specified number of hours each week.
Certain grades are eligible for overtime pay for any hours worked in excess of
the standard hours, but this does not apply to the higher grades whose salaries
are determined on the assumption that they will work such long hours as may
be necessary without additional pay. The standard working week for office
staffs is 41 hours in London and 42 hours in the provinces. Annual leave varies
according to grade and length of service up to a maximum of six weeks, that
is, 30 working days a year. Sick leave on full pay, less any national insurance
benefit received, may be granted to permanent civil servants for up to six
months in any 12 months, and on reduced pay up to a maximum of one
year’s sick leave in any four years; any officer whose health is permanently
impaired may be retired on medical grounds.
Political and
Private
Activities
The position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the government of the
day irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which he is free,
as a private individual, to participate in political activities varies according to
grade. For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: those who
are completely free to engage in all kinds of national and local political
activities (although if they intend standing for Parliament, they must resign
their appointment before nomination day on the understanding that if not
elected they will be reinstated in their previous capacity within a week of the
declaration of the election result); those who are free, subject to the acceptance
of the need for discretion and with the permission of the department, to take
part in most activities except parliamentary candidature; and those who are
debarred from national political activities though they may seek permission
to take part in local government political activities. In the non-industrial
Civil Service, the completely free groups are members of the minor classes
such as cleaners and messengers. The intermediate group includes mainly
members of the clerical and typing classes and the granting of permission by
the department depends, broadly, on the nature of the work done. The group
which is not allowed to take part in national political activities includes
members of the Professional, the Scientific and Technical, and the Executive
and Administrative classes. Departments are encouraged to permit members of
this group to engage in local political activities to the maximum extent
consistent with the reputation of the Service for political impartiality, having
regard to the nature of the duties of the officer concerned and the extent of
contact with the public that these duties involve. Where permission is granted,
it is subject to a code of discretion and to the obligation to notify the depart¬
ment of election or co-option to a local council.
Civil servants in all classes enjoy the right to register their private political
opinions on appropriate occasions, for instance, at general or local authority
elections. They may also engage in such private activities as they wish, pro¬
vided that these do not in any way conflict with their official duties, nor with
the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1920, and the Prevention
of Corruption Act 1906. However, since a civil servant must not use his
official position to further his private interests, he is subject to certain

immediate superannuation benefits at any time after the age of 60, but there is no
fixed age of retirement, and it is possible for a civil servant to continue to work after
the age of 60, provided that he is in good health and that there is work for him to do.
66 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
restrictions in commerce and business: for instance, he may not hold private
interests in public contracts and he may not use official information in writing,
broadcasting or lecturing without the approval of his department.
Security The private political views of civil servants are not as a general rule a matter of
official concern, but there are some Civil Service duties in which secrecy is
so vitally important to State security that the Government does not feel
itself justified in employing anyone to carry them out whose reliability is in
doubt. For this reason no one who is known to be a member of, or actively
associated or in sympathy with, the Communist Party or with Fascist
organisations, or is liable to be a security risk in any other respect, is employed
in connection with secret work.
Each government department is responsible for its own internal security
and the Security Service, which operates independently under a Director
General who is responsible for its efficiency to the Home Secretary, deals
with national security. In addition, there is a Security Commission which, if
requested by the Prime Minister in consultation with the leader of the
Opposition, may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public
service and, in certain circumstances, advise whether any change in security
arrangements is necessary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of
the United Kingdom for many centuries. In its present shape much of it dates
back to the late nineteenth century, when the conception of a comprehensive
system of locally elected councils to manage various services provided for the
benefit of the community was first incorporated in statute law. Since that time
there has been a large increase in the population, and a massive transformation
in the range, complexity and scale of local authority functions. Because of
this, local government in Greater London was reorganised in the 1960s and
radical changes1 in the existing structure in Great Britain have been recom¬
mended by the two Royal Commissions (one for England and the other for
Scotland) set up in 1966 to carry out a comprehensive review. Proposals for
the modernisation of the local government structure in Wales and in Northern
Ireland have been formulated.
Relationship

Central and

Government
Local government is conducted by elected local authorities, acting in accord¬
ance with powers and duties conferred on them by Parliament. The actual
administration and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits, are the
1 In England and Wales there would be 58 elected ‘unitary authorities’, singly responsible
for all services; and three metropolitan authorities and 20 district councils, each respon¬
sible for certain functions in the three proposed new metropolitan areas of Merseyside,
Selnec (south-east Lancashire, north, east and central Cheshire) and the west Midlands.
In addition there would be eight provincial councils elected by the authorities in the
unitary and metropolitan areas to determine provincial strategy and planning. To
represent communities, an elected local council would be set up for each present
county borough, borough, urban district and parish where there is at present a parish
council.
In Scotland there would be two levels of authorities independently elected, consisting
of seven regional authorities responsible for the major services and 37 district authorities
responsible for a wide range of local services. At the most local level there would be
community councils, which would not be local authorities but would be able to express
local opinion and promote local opinion.

responsibility of the local authority, but in respect of certain services, Acts of
Parliament dealing with local government give ministers of the Crown defined
powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure of national uniformity
in the standard of service provided, or to safeguard public health, while
others are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens. For some
services the minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for others
there are strictly limited powers.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local
government give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory
circulars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main link between
local authorities and the central Government in England; in Scotland the
Scottish Development Department is responsible for general policy in regard
to local government; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ireland,
the Ministry of Development.
The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
(outside the Greater London area) and Northern Ireland is at present a
division of the country into county boroughs and administrative counties.
The county boroughs (mostly with populations of over 75,000) are separate
from the counties and independent of them. The administrative counties are
subdivided into county districts—non-county boroughs, urban districts and
rural districts, the last-named being further divided into parishes1 (except in
Northern Ireland). Scotland is divided into counties (including 4 counties
of cities) which are independently administered, large and small burghs, and
districts. Each local authority area is administered by its own elected council.
In England and Wales (outside the Greater London area) there are 58 county
councils, 83 county borough councils, 259 non-county borough councils,
532 urban district councils, 470 rural district councils,2 about 7,500 parish
councils and some 3,300 parish meetings (in parishes not large enough to
have a parish council); in Scotland, 33 county councils (two pairs being com¬
bined for certain purposes), 201 town councils (including 4 for counties of
cities) and 198 district councils (2 counties not being divided into districts);
and in Northern Ireland, 1 county borough council, 6 county councils,
9 non-county borough councils, 24 urban district councils, 26 rural district
councils, and 2 Development Commissions exercising ministerial functions.
The Greater London area is administered by the councils of 32 London
boroughs and the City of London, and by the Greater London Council.
Local councils comprise a number of unpaid elected councillors (and, in some
cases, aldermen elected by the councillors), presided over by a chairman who
has varied ceremonial and civic duties to perform in addition to his work on
the council. In most boroughs of England and Wales and Northern Ireland
the chairman is the Mayor; in the City of London and certain important
boroughs, the Lord Mayor; in the Scottish counties, the Convener; and in the
burghs, the Provost or Lord Provost.
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local
government is three years; aldermen normally hold office for six years. In
some local authority areas the whole council retires every third year and
another is elected immediately; in other areas elections are held annually,

when one-third of the councillors retire. Procedure at local government
elections in Great Britain is governed by rules laid down in the Representation
of the People Acts 1949 and 1969 or made for a specific type of authority.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote
at a local government election in Great Britain provided that he or she is 18
years of age or over, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is
not subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector
for the area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for registration as a
local government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register (compiled
annually), he or she is resident in the council area. In Northern Ireland, in
order to qualify for registration as a local government elector, a person must be
21 years of age or over, must have been born in Northern Ireland or,
alternatively, have resided continuously in the United Kingdom for seven
years immediately prior to the qualifying date and, in the past, must have had
either a resident occupier’s or a general occupier’s qualification although
legislation has been proposed to remove this condition for the future.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer
concerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is
similar to that for parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting
are more restricted. Each elector has one vote for each seat contested in his
electoral area: he need not record all his votes, but must not give more than
one vote for each candidate.
A candidate for election as councillor normally stands as a representative
of one of the national political parties, as a member of an association repre¬
senting some local interest, or as an independent. He must be of British
nationality, over 21 years of age, and must either be registered as a local
government elector in the register of electors for the area of the local authority
to which he seeks election, or have resided within that area (or within three
miles of it in the case of a rural borough or parish council) during the whole
of the 12 months preceding the day on which he is nominated as a candidate.
A candidate is also subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed
to ensure that unsuitable persons do not offer themselves for election.
Procedure at local government elections in Northern Ireland is governed
by the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1962 and regulations made
thereunder by the Ministry of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland. These
regulations are, in general, similar to those which apply in Great Britain,
though differing in certain particulars; for instance, there is no postal voting
and the only persons who may vote by proxy are Service voters.
Most local authority areas are divided into electoral areas for local council
elections. Administrative counties are divided into single-member electoral
divisions in accordance with orders made by the Secretary of State for the
Home Department, the Minister of Housing and Local Government, or the
Secretary of State for Scotland. Boroughs and urban districts in England and
Wales, and burghs in Scotland, are either divided into wards , or, if they are
small, left as single units. For rural district council or parish council elections,
each parish or ward of a parish (or, in some cases, a combination of parishes)
forms an electoral area which returns one or more members.
For the purposes of elections to the Greater London Council, each London
borough forms an electoral area returning two, three or four councillors.
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer such
services as Acts of Parliament require it to provide and administer. It may
GOVERNMENT 69
provide additional services under the permissive powers of a general Act or
under powers granted to it by local or Private Bill legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon their type, as follows:
in England (outside the Greater London area) and Wales county borough
councils are all-purpose authorities, while both county councils and county
district councils have particular functions allotted to them,1 which they
exercise independently to a considerable extent, although there is a certain
degree of delegation from county councils to county district councils,
especially of duties connected with town and country planning and the
education, health and welfare services. Parish councils or parish meetings
have a few functions of local interest which they may exercise of right. In
Scotland the town councils of the counties of cities are all-purpose authorities;
elsewhere, the county councils, the town councils and the district councils
all share in local government work. In Northern Ireland the position is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales, except that local authorities are
not called upon to provide or administer police or (except in Belfast) fire services;
moreover, county councils do not in general delegate any of their functions to
county district councils.
In Greater London the basic units of local government are the London
boroughs; the GLC is responsible only for those services which, by their
nature, require unified administration and control over the whole area. In the
City of London (an area of approximately one square mile in the centre of the
metropolis) the City Corporation exercises the general powers administered
and duties performed by the London borough councils.
Local authority services may be classified under three heads: environ¬
mental, protective and personal. The environmental services are designed
to secure local good order, amenity and public health. They include the
inspection and abatement of nuisances, drainage, sewerage, street cleansing,
refuse collection and disposal, litter prevention, rodent control, the supervision
of water supplies, measures for ensuring food hygiene and for preventing
air pollution, and the provision of baths and washhouses. They also include
the services for bridge and highway construction and maintenance, for street
lighting, public safety on the roads, and the provision of recreation grounds,
parks and similar amenities. Town and country planning is the major environ¬
mental service. The protective services are the fire service and the police
service, while the personal services range from health services, education and
housing to the provision of public entertainment.
Services concerned primarily with health and welfare cover the provision
of ante-natal, post-natal and child welfare clinics, and some residential and
day nurseries; the provision and supervision of midwifery services, health
visitors and home nursing facilities; measures for the prevention of illness and
the aftercare of physically or mentally sick persons; the provision of domestic
help where necessary; the ambulance service; the provision of facilities for
vaccination and immunisation against certain infectious diseases; and the
services for the permanently disabled or handicapped, for the aged and infirm
and for children deprived of a normal home life. Education and culture are
promoted by the establishment and maintenance of various types of schools;
by the provision of adult education centres, and art and technical colleges;
by the award of grants and scholarships to students of all kinds; and by the
provision of libraries, art galleries and museums. Housing needs are met, as

defence services, while the district councils administer most of the environmental and
sanitary services.

far as possible, by building new houses (mainly to let), acquiring old houses
and converting them to provide additional accommodation, clearing slums,
and laying down the standards to be maintained in both newly built and older
houses.
Some local authorities engage in trading services, such as passenger
transport, water supply, and harbour, dock and pier services; they also have
power to initiate schemes to attract industrial development.
The above is only a brief outline of local authority services. Fuller
information is given under the relevant subject headings in later chapters of
this book.
Internal
Organisation
of Local
Authorities
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own
internal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they
will discharge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system,
whereby questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and
committees are appointed to carry out the detailed administration of the
various services. Parish councils and the smaller district councils are often
able to do their work efficiently in full session although they appoint com¬
mittees from time to time, when any special study or experience is required.
The more important of the committees of the larger authorities may divide
their work among sub-committees, which stand to the parent committee in a
relation similar to that of the main committees to the whole council. The
execution of the policy decided upon by the council and the committee rests
with salaried officers and employees, whose number may vary from about half
a dozen in a small rural district to several thousands in the large counties and
in the larger county boroughs and burghs.
Apart from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of
specialists on committees and the length of time certain members may hold
office, committees of councils are free from legal restrictions; even those
which are mandatory committees are constituted according to individual
requirements and not according to any set pattern laid down. For purposes
of classification, however, they may be divided into two kinds: ordinary
committees and joint committees. Ordinary committees may be further
divided into mandatory committees, the appointment of which is compulsory
under an Act of Parliament; other standing committees, which are appointed
in accordance with the standing orders of the council on a permanent basis
according to the extent of the council’s business; and special committees,
which a council may set up for a limited period to deal with a particular
problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
Joint committees or joint boards consist of representatives of more than
one authority. They may be established, outside the Greater London area,
for services that can be more effectively administered over a wider area than
that controlled by a single council, for instance, town and country planning,
water supplies and the police service.
The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be
advisory or executive) are usually laid down in the appointing council s
standing orders. A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees,
except its powers in connection with raising loans, levying rates, or making
financial demands on other authorities liable to contribute (raising precepts
in England and Wales and levying requisitions in Scotland) which are legally
reserved to the council as a whole. County and county borough councils exercise
their powers of delegation to a considerable extent, but in most districts
and parishes councils use their committees only in an advisory capacity.

The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of the council (and of
some committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered
if the council resolve that publicity for that matter would be prejudicial to the
public interest.
Generally speaking, councils are free to make such appointments as they think
necessary for carrying out their work, although certain posts, for instance, the
clerk, the treasurer, and the medical officer of health, are compulsory in almost
all councils, and a borough or city architect must be appointed in each London
borough and in the City of London. Otherwise choice of personnel is left to a
great extent to the individual council: in theory, the appointment of certain
chief officers is subject to some central control but, in practice, the nominee of
the council is nearly always accepted.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or
chief officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial
kind; subordinate officers employed in a professional, clerical or technical
capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical work for
which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually made
at the instance of the committee or committees particularly concerned; most
junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who are also
responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engagements
are always made in conformity with the council’s set establishment and
committees are informed of any appointments which they have not made
themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within
the jurisdiction of the employing council (except for the rare case where the
proposed salary of an officer requires the approval of a government depart¬
ment, as in the case of the clerk of a county council in England and Wales).
They are based on recommendations made by the Whitley Councils,
of which the largest, in England and Wales, are the National Joint Council
for Local Authorities’ Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical
Services and the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Services
(Manual Workers) and, in Scotland, the Joint Negotiating Committee
for Chief Officials of Local Authorities (Scotland) and the National
Joint Industrial Councils for Local Authority Services (Scotland). In
England and Wales conditions of service and salary scales for senior local
government officers are determined by separate joint committees. The local
government service in Northern Ireland has its separate joint negotiating
machinery at various levels.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of
conduct; as public servants they ‘must not only be honest in fact, but must
be beyond the reach of the suspicion of dishonesty’.
There are three sources of local authority income: government grants (about
two-fifths); local rates, paid by occupiers of land and buildings (about two-
fifths); and rents from municipal houses, dividends and interest (about
one-fifth). Capital investment is, for the greater part, financed by borrowing.
Government grants occasionally take the form of capital grants, paid on
approval of claims made by local authorities for specific services, principally
roads and public lighting, and annual subsidies are payable for local authority
housing. Most government grants are, however, revenue grants, related to
local authority revenue expenditure (other than contributions towards
deficits on housing and trading accounts). These are payable, both in aid of
72
Rates
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
revenues generally (when they are known as rate support grants) and for
specific services; in England and Wales they amount to about £1,528 million
and £138 million respectively for 1969-70.
The rate support grants are distributed among authorities (in England and
Wales, the county, county borough, county district, and London borough
councils; in Scotland, the county and town councils) in three parts: the ‘needs’
element composed of a basic payment which takes into account total heads of
population and, in particular, the number of children of school age, together
with supplementary payments which may take into account the numbers of
children under five years old and of people over 65, the cost of various stages of
education, density of population and road mileage; the ‘resources’ element
which is paid to authorities whose rateable resources are below the average for
all authorities in relation to population; and the ‘domestic’ element which
compensates rating authorities for loss of rate income from reductions in rate
poundage which they are required to give to householders—in England and
Wales icd. in 1968-69 and is. 3d. in 1969-70, and in Scotland, where the
general level of rate poundage is higher, is. 8d. and 2s. 6d. respectively.
Services attracting specific grants include the police and comprehensive
rebuilding schemes. Grants are also made towards the cost of rate rebates for
people with low incomes. The aggregate revenue grants are estimated to shift
the balance from rates to taxes on revenue account by about 1 per cent
annually.
In Northern Ireland there is a system of grants towards the cost of specific
services (for instance, education, roads, housing, health and welfare, water
supplies and sewerage), supplemented by a General Exchequer Contribution
which compensates for derating and takes account of the needs and resources
of individual authorities. A grant is also paid to rating authorities to compen¬
sate them for prescribed reductions in rate poundages, which they are required
to give to householders.
Rates are a local tax paid by the occupiers of land and buildings as a contrib¬
ution towards the cost of local services—the only major class of property
exempt being agricultural land and buildings. The amount of each payment
is calculated by multiplying the rate poundage, determined by the rating
authority, by the rateable value of the property. The rateable value reflects
the rental value of the property in the open market and is assessed in England
and Wales by valuation officers of the Board of Inland Revenue, who are
independent of the local authorities. In the latest valuation lists (1963)
assessments of all classes of property were based on rental values current at
that time. New valuation lists will come into force in 1973. Disputes about
assessments are heard by local valuation courts, each consisting of three
members of an independent local valuation panel and then, on appeal, to the
Lands Tribunal.
Rate rebates are available for householders with small incomes and all
householders pay lower rates than do commercial and industrial ratepayers.
In addition householders have the right to pay in ten instalments a year.
Charities pay half the full rate on property they occupy for charitable purposes
but may be given further reliefs by the rating authorities, which are
empowered to reduce or remit the rates for a wide range of non-profit-making
bodies. Half rates may be levied on the owners of all empty properties.
To offset the extra rate burdens caused by the reorganisation of London
government, transitional assistance is being given for eight years to the
councils of the home counties (Essex, Surrey and Kent) of which parts have

been absorbed into the Greater London area. There is also a scheme for
reducing disparities in the rates levied in Greater London.
In Scotland valuation is on a basis similar to that in England and Wales;
but it is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of counties and
counties of cities. Appeals are heard by the valuation appeal committee of each
valuation area and thereafter by the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the
Court of Session. A Scottish Valuation Advisory Council has been established
by the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Northern Ireland the valuation
authority is the Commissioner of Valuation, whose department is part of the
Ministry of Finance. Industry and freight transport in Scotland are rated at
half and in Northern Ireland at a quarter of their net annual value.
In England and Wales the responsibility for levying and collecting the rates
lies with the councils of county boroughs and county districts, with the
London borough councils and with the Common Council of the City of
London. The rate poundage for each county district consists mainly of a
district rate and a county rate, calculated in accordance with the respective
requirements of the two authorities, and the proceeds of the latter are passed
on to the county council. In rural districts the rate levied in each parish takes
into account precepts issued by the parish council or parish meeting. In
Greater London the GLC raises revenue by precepting on the London
boroughs and the City. Rates in Scotland are levied by the town councils in
burghs and by county councils elsewhere; to cover their expenditure, district
councils levy a requisition each year to the county council; a town council has
to meet an annual requisition from the county council in respect of the
burgh’s share of the expenditure on functions exercised by the county council
throughout the county, including the burgh. In Northern Ireland, county
councils are responsible for making, levying and collecting the rates, except
in such parts of the county as fall within the jurisdiction of the county
borough, borough, or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by local authorities for financing such items of capital
expenditure as are sanctioned by the Minister of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment, the Secretary of State for Wales, the Secretary of State for Scotland,
or, occasionally, the government department responsible for the service for
which the capital is required. The Greater London Council applies annually
for parliamentary sanction to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure.
In Northern Ireland the government department responsible for the service
also issues the appropriate loan approvals. Borrowing powers for specific
purposes may also be taken under Acts of Parliament of local application.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by issuing mortgages, by issuing
stock upon the Stock Exchange and by bonds which may or may not be quoted
on the Stock Exchange. Although these bonds may be for any period, local
authorities normally issue them for one year. Local authorities also have right
of access to the Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exchequer, or, in
Northern Ireland, to the Government Loans Fund, for a proportion of their
long-term borrowing, and may borrow temporarily for a limited proportion
of their outstanding loan debt.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned
by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy of
the council under constant review. In England and Wales an external audit
is carried out (except for certain general accounts in most of the county
borough and about two-thirds of the borough councils) by district auditors
appointed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. County

borough councils must use the services of the district auditor for accounts
which relate to police, children and education, and local health and welfare
services. In both county and non-county boroughs rating and coast protection
are also subject to district audit. For their other accounts borough councils use
mainly professional auditors; a small number use ‘elective audit’, which
provides for the appointment of three auditors: two elected by the local
government electors and one appointed by the mayor. In Scotland the accounts
by each authority are audited by a professional auditor appointed by the
Secretary of State for Scotland and paid by the council concerned, and in
Northern Ireland by special local government auditors appointed by the
Ministry of Development.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to
a measure of central control exercised by the Home Secretary (in England
and Wales) and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The fire services in
Northern Ireland are controlled by two authorities, the Belfast Corporation
and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, which are responsible to the
Minister of Home Affairs. Every part of the United Kingdom is covered by a
public fire brigade.
There are 132 local authority fire brigades in England and Wales and 11 in
Scotland. In England and Wales, under the Fire Services Act 1947, separate
fire brigades are administered by the county and county borough councils,
which are the fire authorities for their areas and have powers and duties
which they exercise either separately or as combined authorities where
neighbouring councils care to make such arrangements in the interests of the
efficiency of the service. The Greater London Council is the fire authority for
the London Fire Brigade. In Scotland the local authorities are grouped in
11 areas each with a single brigade; with the exception of Glasgow, where the
town council of the city is the responsible authority, each area is administered
by a joint committee representative of the councils of the counties and large
burghs in the area.
There are also fire-fighting organisations outside the local authority service;
for instance, those maintained by the Service departments of the Ministry of
Defence and by some large industrial and commercial concerns.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland may make
regulations regarding discipline, training, appointments and promotions,
pensions, the design and performance of equipment, and the uniformity
of fire hydrants in local fire brigades, and their approval is necessary for
certain reductions in establishment schemes. In matters affecting the fire
brigades as a whole (excluding discipline and conditions of service), each
minister is advised by the appropriate Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council,
consisting of officers of the respective home departments, representatives of the
local authority associations, representatives of the chief fire officers (firemasters
in Scotland) and other members of the brigades, and other persons having
special qualifications. The National Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Fire
Brigades in Great Britain and the National Joint Council for Chief Officers

of Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain are the negotiating
bodies on ranks, pay and conditions of service of members of the brigades.
Inspectorates of fire services advise the Secretaries of State on operational and
technical matters.
Each fire authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment
of officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and
location of fire stations and the number and type of appliances considered
necessary for the provision of an all-over cover of its area. Establishment
schemes differ according to the fire risks in the area concerned; in the whole of
England and Wales there are about 24,100 whole-time and 16,300 part-time
firemen, operating more than 3,700 fire-fighting appliances (including pumps,
turntable ladders, water tenders, and emergency and salvage tenders) housed
in some 1,600 fire stations. In Scotland there are approximately 2,700 whole¬
time and 2,800 part-time firemen, 530 fire-fighting appliances, and 320 fire
stations. In addition some 850 women in England and Wales and about 140
in Scotland are members of the fire service (see p. 76).
It is the duty of each fire authority to buy such vehicles and equipment as
are required under the establishment scheme. Certain items of equipment
are standardised so that there is complete interchangeability when men and
appliances of more than one brigade combine to fight a fire. Appliances are
bought by fire authorities to requirement specifications approved by the
Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Scotland, on the advice of the
respective Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. These specifications ensure
that minimum standards are maintained and at the same time allow sufficient
freedom of design to meet special circumstances and encourage further
developments.
Each fire authority must appoint a chief fire officer (firemaster in Scotland)
to be the head administrative and executive officer for its fire services. The
appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary or by the Secretary of
State for Scotland. The chief fire officer or firemaster is responsible to the
fire authority for seeing that the fire brigade is organised and managed in
accordance with policy.
Central control rests with brigade headquarters and local control with
divisional officers in charge of the geographical divisions into which most areas
are divided, who are responsible for mobilising their forces in the strength
necessary for dealing with any outbreaks of fire in their divisions. Constant
communication is maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters and
if at any time an outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a division,
help is sent from one or more neighbouring divisions, or even from the area of
another fire authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire
authorities, the nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire, regardless
of area boundaries.
In England and Wales the approximate number of fire calls (in 1968),
including false alarms and special service calls for such purposes as rescuing
persons and animals trapped in dangerous situations, dealing with crashed
aircraft, and pumping and salvage operations, was 396,000. In Scotland the
number of fire calls was approximately 43,800.
Estimated fire losses in the United Kingdom in 1968 amounted to about
j£ioo million, some £10 million more than the corresponding figure for 1967.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
About three-fifths of the total number of firemen in local authority fire
brigades work on a whole-time basis. The part-time firemen include retained
firemen who, in return for a retaining fee, undertake to attend fires if called
upon, and volunteer firemen, who receive no remuneration. Many fire
authorities employ women on communications and mobilising duties, some
have also introduced schemes for the employment of junior firemen between
the ages of 16 and 18 years, with a view to their being enrolled as regular
firemen at the age of 18. .
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at training schools run by fire
authorities. In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central training
school which is the responsibility of the Scottish Home and Health Depart¬
ment. Advanced and specialised training courses and command and promotion
courses are provided for the middle and higher ranks at the Fire Service Staff
College, Wotton House, near Dorking, Surrey; training, including fire
prevention, practical fire service training and general and technical education,
for lower and middle ranks is provided at the Fire Service Technical College,
Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. Both these establishments are main¬
tained by the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department.
Facilities for properly accredited officers from overseas fire services to study
the organisation, current training methods, apphances and equipment of the
British fire brigades are arranged by the Home Office Fire Department.
The fire authorities bear the cost of maintaining the fire service, but they
receive an Exchequer contribution which is included in the aggregate amount
of the local authority rate support grant (see p. 72). For the purpose of
arriving at the amount of this contribution, the Government receives from fire
authorities (at the time when the grant is to be considered) details of the last
known actual expenditure for a year, together with estimates for the impending
grant period.
Fire authorities are required, under the 1947 Act, to make efficient arrange¬
ments for giving advice, when requested, about fire prevention, limiting the
spread of fires, and means of escape in case of fire. In addition, they have been
made the enforcing authority for fire precautions under a steadily growing
number of Acts of Parliament (of which the most notable are the Factories
Act 1961, and the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963), and they
are concerned with provisions relating to fire and fire prevention in a large
number of other Acts.
Within brigades, the work of fire prevention is entrusted to a staff of fire
prevention officers. Other sources of advice on fire prevention include the
various insurance companies which advise their policyholders, and the Fire
Protection Association, a non-profit-making body established by the Fire
Offices’ Committee1 as an advisory centre on a nation-wide basis for industry
and the general public on protection of life and property against fire.
Research into the causes, development and prevention of fire is undertaken
by the Joint Fire Research Organisation under the general direction of a
steering committee, whose members are drawn from the Ministry of Techno¬
logy, the Home Office, the Fire Offices’ Committee, the independent
insurance companies and industry. The annual cost of the Organisation is over

balance being met by the Ministry of Technology. The Organisation operates
from the fire research station at Boreham Wood, Hertfordshire.
An Operational Fire Research Group has been established in the Home
Office to undertake research into the factors affecting fire cover, fire service
performance and fire losses.

In Northern Ireland the Belfast Corporation controls the Belfast Fire Brigade
and is responsible for the area inside the city boundary, and the Northern
Ireland Fire Authority covers the rest of the country outside Belfast.
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains five whole-time stations and has an
establishment of 293 officers and men manning 18 appliances, while the
Northern Ireland Fire Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry
and 44 other stations throughout the remainder of the area, and an establish¬
ment of 109 whole-time officers and men and 700 part-time firemen, manning
108 appliances.
The amount of fire service grant payable to the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority is 50 per cent of the loan charges in respect of capital expenditure
which do not exceed £90,000 and 25 per cent of the amount (if any) by which
the loan charges exceed £90,000, together with 50 per cent of the first £240,000
of other net expenditure and 25 per cent of the excess over that amount.
Expenditure in excess of the fire service grant is apportioned among the local
authorities liable to contribute to the funds of the Authority. Under the Fire
Services Acts, the Belfast Fire Brigade does not qualify for the payment of fire
service grant.
3 LAW AND ORDER
THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary state, it does not have a single
body of law applicable universally within its limits. Scotland has its own
distinctive legal system and law courts, and although the existence of a single
Parliament for Great Britain since 1707, common opinions on broader issues,
and a common court of appeal in civil cases have resulted in substantial
identity on many points, difference in legal procedure and practice remain. In
Northern Ireland on the other hand, the structure of the courts and legal
procedure and practice have closely resembled those of England and Wales for
centuries but, as Northern Ireland has its own Parliament with defined powers
(as well as being represented in the Parliament at Westminster), its enacted
law derives in certain spheres from a different source and may differ in
substance from that which operates in England and Wales. A large volume of
modern legislation, however, particularly in the social field, applies through¬
out the United Kingdom.
A feature common to all the systems of law in the United Kingdom (which
differentiates them from some continental systems) is that there is no complete
code.1 The sources of law in all the systems include legislation and unwritten
or ‘common’ law.
Legislation includes some 3,000 Acts of Parliament and delegated or
subordinate legislation (orders, rules or regulations made by ministers and
others under powers conferred by Parliament). It is absolutely binding on all
courts of the United Kingdom, taking precedence over any other source of
law. The common law of England originated in the customs of the realm and
was built up by decisions of the courts. A supplementary system of law,
known as ‘equity’, came into being during the Middle Ages to provide and
enforce more effective protection for existing legal rights. It was administered
by a separate court and later became a separate body of legal rules. In 1873
the courts of equity were fused with the courts of common law, so that all
courts now apply both systems but, where they conflict, equity prevails.
In Scotland the basis of common law, which largely depends on the canon
law of Rome, helped by continental commentators, is embodied in the
writings of certain seventeenth, eighteenth and early nineteenth century
lawyers of great repute who, between them, described systematically almost
the whole field of private and criminal law as existing in their times. Broadly
speaking, the principles enunciated by these lawyers, together with the many
judicial decisions which have followed and developed from those principles,
form the body of Scots non-statutory law. Scotland has never had a separate
system of equity—equitable principles having always permeated the ordinary
rules of law.
A feature common to the legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. Criminal law
is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole; civil law is
1 The Law Commission (see p. 90) is working on the codification of certain branches
of law, for instance, criminal law (in conjunction with the Criminal Law Revision
Committee) and the law of landlord and tenant.

AND WALES

concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members of
the community between themselves.
The courts of ordinary criminal jurisdiction in England and Wales include:
magistrates’ courts, which try the less serious offences; courts of quarter
sessions, which try most of the more serious offences; and courts of assize,1
including the Central Criminal Court (for Greater London) and the Crown
Courts in Liverpool and Manchester, which try the very grave or difficult
cases. Trial by jury is the rule at quarter sessions and assizes.
Most magistrates’ courts consist of two to seven lay magistrates, known as
justices of the peace, whose function it is to hear and determine charges
against people accused of summary offences—that is, those offences that may
legally be disposed of by the justices sitting together without a jury. In
addition, they may also try certain offences which would normally be tried on
indictment,2 if the accused consents to forgo his right to trial by jury—and,
in fact, about 98 per cent of all criminal cases are disposed of by justices of
the peace. Magistrates may also sit as ‘examining justices’ to conduct
preliminary enquiries to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to
justify the committal of the accused for trial in a higher court.
In inner London and a few large provincial cities there are, in addition to
justices, stipendiary magistrates, who are full-time salaried lawyers, and
usually sit alone. In the City of London, the courts consist of the aldermen
of the City, who are justices ex officio by virtue of charters, and of justices.
Benches of lay magistrates work with the help and advice of the Clerk of
the Court—a barrister or solicitor or other person with court experience.
To hear cases involving young offenders, or children brought before the
court as being in need of care and protection, as being beyond control or
as persistent truants from school, and to deal with applications for the adoption
of children, magistrates’ courts sit as juvenile courts. These courts sit either in
a different room or building from other courts, or at a different time, and
only limited publicity is allowed.
Quarter sessions must be held four times a year; in the busier places they are
held much more frequently.
All counties have courts of quarter sessions, each consisting of a bench of
lay magistrates under a chairman who may be legally qualified. Most boroughs
do not have their own quarter sessions—their criminal work being done in
county quarter sessions—but in the 94 boroughs which have the right to hold
their own courts, the bench consists of a single judge, known as the Recorder,
who is a practising barrister appointed to act part-time in this capacity.
Quarter sessions for the City of London are held in the Old Bailey. In the
rest of Greater London there are five quarter-sessions areas, presided over by
full-time chairmen or deputy chairmen. The work of quarter sessions in
Liverpool and Manchester is taken in the Crown courts.
Courts of assize are branches of the High Court presided over by High Court
judges and held at assize towns—generally the county town of each county
1 A number of radical changes in the court system is recommended by the Royal
Commission set up in 1967 to enquire into the present arrangements for the adminis¬
tration of justice at assizes and quarter sessions outside Greater London and the effect

and certain of the other larger towns and cities. The judges go round ‘on
circuit’ three times a year—on the autumn, winter and summer assizes. Each
town is visited once on each circuit; the larger towns are visited twice. After
the trial of criminal cases in each town, the judges deal with civil cases.
The assize court for Greater London is the Central Criminal Court, which
sits at the Old Bailey. The jurisdiction of the court is entirely criminal and it
is virtually in continuous session. The court may sit in two or more divisions;
sometimes as many as nine courts sit at the same time, each presided over by
a salaried judicial officer.
The Crown Courts of Liverpool and Manchester act as courts of assize
(and of quarter sessions) in and for two divisions of south Lancashire. The
courts are in continuous session; their functions are entirely criminal , and
they are presided over by the Recorders of Liverpool and Manchestei
respectively.
Appeals may be brought on a point of law, by either the prosecutor or the
defendant, direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court; but the more
usual appeal is that of a convicted person against his conviction or his sentence,
which is heard by quarter sessions.
Appeals against convictions or sentences by quarter sessions, assizes or
Crown Courts go to the Court of Appeal—Criminal Division.1 2 Appeals
against conviction may be brought to the court by right on any point of law,
and with leave of the trial judge or the court on any question of fact or mixed
fact and law. Appeals against sentence come with the leave of the court,
provided that the sentence was in the discretion of the trial judge and not
fixed by law. The Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal presides
in the Criminal Division and Queen’s Bench judges sit with Lords Justices of
Appeal. A further appeal from the Court of Appeal to the House of Lords
can be brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords
that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
There is no restriction on the right of a private citizen to institute criminal
proceedings, but most prosecutions in England and Wales are, in fact,
initiated and conducted by the police. In some cases the consent of the
Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions or, less frequently,
a government department is required. The Director of Public Prosecutions
is also concerned with prosecutions in all the more serious cases of indictable
offences; in courts where a substantial number of cases with which he is
concerned are tried, standing counsel are appointed by the Attorney General
to appear on his behalf. At the Central Criminal Court in London, for
instance, there is a panel of counsel known as Treasury Counsel, who are
retained to prosecute in the Director’s cases.
In criminal cases arrest may be effected either on a warrant issued by a judicial
authority on sworn information laid before it or, in certain cases, without
warrant. In the latter circumstances, a police officer may release the defendant
on bail, that is, he may discharge him temporarily, subject to his entering into
a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a reasonable sum of money, to
appear in court or at a police station at an appointed time, and he must so

release him, unless the offence of which he is suspected is serious, if he cannot
be brought before the magistrates’ court within a day.1
Once a person has been charged with an offence, the Judges’ Rules2 require
the police not to put any further questions, save, in exceptional circumstances,
to prevent or minimise harm or loss to any person or to the public, or to clear
up an ambiguity in a previous answer or statement.
If anyone is detained in custody and thinks that the grounds for his
detention are not lawful,3 he (or, if he is unable, someone acting on his behalf)
may sue out a writ of habeas corpus against the person who detained him, this
person then being required to appear before the court on the day named to
justify the detention. An application for such a writ is normally made to
a divisional court. If no court is sitting it may be made to a single judge who
may, and in some cases must, direct that it should come before a divisional
court. An application on behalf of anyone under 18 is always first made to a
judge sitting in chambers or in private. A writ may be refused only by a
divisional court.
Since criminal law in Britain presumes the innocence of the accused until
his guilt has been proved the prosecution is not granted any advantage,
apparent or real, over the defence. A defendant has the right to employ a legal
adviser for his defence and if he cannot afford to pay he may be granted legal
aid at the public expense; if remanded in custody he may be visited in prison
by his legal adviser to ensure that his defence is properly prepared. During
the preparation of the case, it is customary for the prosecution to inform the
defence of any relevant documents which it is not proposed to put in evidence
and to disclose them if asked to do so.
Criminal trials are (v/ith rare exceptions) held in open court and the rules
of evidence (which are concerned with the proof of facts) are rigorously
applied. For instance, although the uncorroborated evidence of one witness is,
as a matter of English law, sufficient, conviction in criminal cases solely on the
evidence of an accomplice (or accomplices) is, in practice, never allowed unless
the judge has warned the jury of the danger of convicting without corroboration.
During the trial the defendant has the right to hear and subsequently to
cross-examine (normally through his counsel) all the witnesses for the
prosecution; to call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial of
their own free will, may be ‘subpoenaed’, or legally compelled, to attend; and
to address the court either in person or through his counsel—the defence
having the right to the last speech at the trial. Moreover, the defendant
cannot himself be questioned unless he consents to be sworn as a witness in
his own defence. The right to cross-examine him, even when he is so sworn,
is limited by law, with the object of excluding enquiry into his character or
into past offences not relevant to the particular charge on which he is being
tried. Furthermore, although confessions made in the course of previous
judicial proceedings are admissible as evidence if they have been made upon
oath, no confessions made in any other circumstances are admitted unless it
can be proved that they were made voluntarily, that is, without fear of
1 Magistrates also have discretion to grant bail, and exercise this discretion according
to well-defined principles. If bail is refused by the magistrates, the defendant is
entitled to apply to a judge of the High Court, and must be informed of this right.

3 Lawful grounds are: in pursuance of criminal justice; for contempt of court or of
either House of Parliament; detention of persons found to be mentally disordered;
detention of children by their parents or guardians; and detention expressly authorised
by Act of Parliament. The writ of habeas corpus runs in both criminal and civil cases.

prejudice or hope of advantage held out to the person to whom the confessions
were made.
In criminal trials by jury the judge determines questions of law, sums up
the evidence for the benefit of the jury, and acquits the accused or passes
sentence according to the verdict of the jury; but the jury alone decides
the issue of guilt or innocence. Verdicts in criminal proceedings need not
necessarily be unanimous; in certain circumstances the jury may bring in a
majority verdict provided that, in a normal jury of 12 people, there are not
more than two dissentients.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of
appeal and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. If a
defence of insanity is accepted by the jury the verdict is ‘not guilty by reason
of insanity’ and the defendant will be detained in a suitable hospital. From a
verdict of ‘guilty’ or of ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’ there is a right of
appeal on the part of the defendant to the appropriate court.
The main civil courts in England and Wales are the county courts, which are
the courts for the lesser cases, and the High Court, where the more important
cases are heard. Magistrates’ courts have limited civil jurisdiction.1 Most
appeals in civil cases go to the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and from
there may go to the House of Lords.
The civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial proceed¬
ings for separation and maintenance orders, adoption, and affiliation and
guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction in respect of such
matters as nuisances under the Public Health Acts. Committees of magistrates
exercise quasi-administrative functions in relation to the licensing of public
houses and of betting shops and clubs.
County courts (of which there are nearly 400) are so located that no part of
a county is more than a reasonable distance from one of them. They are
presided over by a paid judge, who almost always sits alone, although he may
sit with a jury consisting of eight persons if either party wishes it and the court
makes an order to that effect. There are about 100 county court judges now in
office, each having a circuit, which is either one court, or a group of courts,
depending on the amount of work to be done.
The jurisdiction of the county courts covers: actions founded upon contract
and tort (except libel, slander, seduction, and breach of promise of marriage)
where the amount claimed is not more than £^oo2; equity matters, such as
trusts and mortgages, where the amount does not exceed ^5oo3; and actions
concerning land where the net annual value for rating does not exceed £400.
Cases outside these limits may be tried in the county court by consent of the
parties, or may be transferred to the High Court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include adoption cases,
bankruptcies (which are dealt with in certain courts outside the London
Bankruptcy Districts); undefended divorce cases4 (which are heard and deter¬
mined by county courts designated as divorce county courts); and complaints
of racial discrimination brought by the Race Relations Board (which are dealt

with by specially designated courts sitting with two assessors, having know¬
ledge and experience of matters of race).
A few local courts survive from the medieval borough court system and
exercise a jurisdiction similar to that of the county courts. The most important
are: the Liverpool Court of Passage, the Court of Pleas of the Borough of
Preston, the Norwich Guildhall Court of Record, and the Salford Hundred
Court. The Mayor’s and City of London Court, formed by statutory
amalgamation in 1920, is also indirectly a survival from the medieval system.
The High Court of Justice, which is divided into the Chancery Division, the
Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division and the Queen’s Bench Division,
forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature. Its jurisdiction is both original
and appellate, and covers virtually all civil causes and some criminal causes.
Distribution of work among the divisions is governed by statute, the rules of
court and the practice of the court. The High Court’s jurisdiction is vested
in all the divisions, but some matters are assigned to a particular division.
Although the judges can sit in any division they are, in fact, assigned
to a particular one.
The High Court is staffed by 65 puisne1 judges. The Lord Chancellor is
president of the Court of Appeal and of the Chancery Division. The Probate,
Divorce and Admiralty Division is presided over by the president, and the
Queen’s Bench Division by the Lord Chief Justice of England, who ranks
next to the Lord Chancellor in the legal hierarchy.
For the hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly.
Appellate jurisdiction in civil matters from inferior courts is exercised by
divisional courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of
the appropriate division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
The High Court also has original criminal jurisdiction—nowadays very
rarely exercised.
Appeals in matrimonial proceedings heard by magistrates’ courts lie to a
divisional court of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High
Court, and in adoption and guardianship proceedings to a single judge of the
Chancery Division. Affiliation appeals are heard by quarter sessions, as are
appeals from decisions of the licensing and betting licensing committees of
magistrates. Appeals from the decisions of judges sitting in chambers2 are
heard in the first instance in the appropriate divisional court of the High
Court; while appeals from the High Court, the county courts and assizes
(in civil cases) are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and may
(with leave of the court or of the House of Lords) go on to the House of Lords,
which is the ultimate court of appeal in civil cases in the United Kingdom.
The ex officio members of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) are the
Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls; the
ordinary members are 13 Lords Justices of Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the ten Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and
sometimes even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals
(which normally takes place in a committee room and not in the legislative
chamber), but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit.
The president of the House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved
person; no preliminary enquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is
required. The most common form of proceedings is an action commenced
by a writ on summons served on the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies
the defendant that the plaintiff has a claim against him and states the nature
of the claim. If the defendant intends to contest the claim, he ‘enters an
appearance’ by informing the court to this effect and documents setting out
the precise question in dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court.
Because civil proceedings are a private matter, they can generally be
abandoned or compromised at any time without leave of the court1 and, in
fact, in the great majority of cases, the parties to a dispute are able to settle
their differences through their solicitors before the stage of actual trial is
reached. Actions that are brought to court are usually tried by a judge
without a jury, except in cases involving claims for defamation, false imprison¬
ment, unlawful arrest, seduction, or breach of promise of marriage when
either party may insist on trial by jury, or in a case of fraud, when the defendant
may claim this right. In trials where a jury is present, the jury is responsible for
deciding questions of fact (as in criminal trials) and also the amount of
damages to be awarded to the injured party.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Refusal to obey a judgment directing the defendant to do something or to
abstain from doing something may result in imprisonment for contempt of
court. Arrest under an order of committal may be effected only on a warrant
of the court.
As a rule, the court orders that the costs of an action (the barrister’s fees,
solicitor’s charges and essential disbursements) should be paid by the losing
party, although in practice the winning party always pays part of them. In
certain circumstances (for instance, extravagance or negligence in the conduct
of the case), the court may, in its discretion, refuse to order that one party’s
costs should be borne by the other.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, when
proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury, or under
summary procedure, when the judge sits without a jury. All cases in the
High Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff court are
tried under solemn procedure. Proceedings are taken under summary
procedure in the less serious cases in the sheriff court, and in the justice of
the peace and burgh (or police) courts.
These courts are established in burghs. The judges are town councillors who
are serving (or have served) in the office of magistrate of the burgh. In
Glasgow stipendiary magistrates act as judges of two of the courts.
These courts are organised on a county (and county of city) basis, the judges
being the justices of the peace for the county (or county of city).
Any court of summary jurisdiction may sit as a juvenile court. Special
justice of the peace juvenile courts have been established in three counties
and in the city of Aberdeen.
Scotland is divided into sheriffdoms, each consisting of a county or combina¬
tion of counties, and these sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court
districts. A sheriffdom has a sheriff-principal and a number of sheriffs who

act as the judges of the court. The sheriff courts exercise an extensive civil
jurisdiction, as well as a criminal jurisdiction.
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court of first instance.
Any one of the following judges is entitled to try cases in the High Court: the
Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of Session),
the Lord Justice Clerk, or any one of the 16 Lords Commissioner of Justiciary
who are also judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the court is in
Edinburgh, but the judges go on circuit to preside at trials in other towns.
A person convicted in the High Court or in a sheriff court on indictment may
appeal to the High Court of Justiciary (a) against his conviction on any ground
which involves a question of law alone, or, with leave of the High Court or
upon the certificate of the judge who presided at the trial that it is a fit case
for appeal, on any ground, and (b) against his sentence, with the leave of the
High Court, unless the sentence is one fixed by law. Appeals are heard by
three or more judges, and there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
A person convicted summarily may appeal to the High Court, but only on
questions of law and procedure, and not on issues of fact.
In Scotland the police make preliminary investigation of all cases of crime
discovered by or made known to them, but it is for the Public Prosecutor
concerned (the Lord Advocate in the High Court, the Procurators Fiscal in
the sheriff court, and the justice of the peace fiscal and burgh prosecutor in
the justice of the peace and burgh courts respectively) to decide whether or
not to prosecute and, in the case of the Procurator Fiscal, to decide whether
to proceed summarily or to charge the accused by petition with a view to
proceedings on indictment.
The police in Scotland have very broadly the same powers of arrest as have
the police in England and Wales. The Judges Rules do not apply in Scotland,
but when anyone is arrested he must be cautioned and have the charge read
over to him. Thereafter, only his voluntary statements are used in evidence
at his trial, and the court will reject any statements made by him unless it is
satisfied that they have been fairly obtained.
As in England and Wales, when anyone is apprehended in Scotland, he
must be brought before the court competent to deal with his case with the
least possible delay. Where a prosecution on indictment is contemplated,
the accused is brought before a magistrate for judicial examination and the
magistrate may then commit him for trial or for further examination. Eight
days may elapse between commitment for further examination and commit¬
ment for trial.
People in custody, other than those charged with murder or treason, may
be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the jurisdiction
of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or by the police.
Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be granted at the discretion
of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a right of
appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of bail,
by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against the
amount fixed.
The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High Court
of Justiciary has power to release anyone unlawfully detained and trials must,
in any event, be brought to a conclusion within no days of committal.

In trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ diet takes place in the sheriff court,
when the accused person is called upon to plead guilty or not guilty. If he
pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ diet in the appro¬
priate court. If he pleads guilty, and it is a case which is to be dealt with in the
sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it is a High Court case
it is continued to the second diet in the High Court for disposal.
The second diet is held at least nine days after the pleading diet, either
before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury. Evidence is led (without
opening speeches) and there are closing speeches for the prosecution and for
the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the jury. The jury may return
a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of which result in acquittal, or
they may find the accused person ‘guilty’, in which case the court proceeds to
deliver sentence. The verdict may be by a majority of eight to seven. Fairness
to the accused is ensured by the fact that, with a few minor exceptions, no
person may be convicted without the evidence of at least two witnesses, or
corroboration of one witness by facts and circumstances which clearly impli¬
cate the accused person in the crime.
At summary trials the accused person is asked to plead to the charge at the
first calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the
case. Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or
it may appoint a trial diet for a later date.
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in Scotland are the sheriff courts which,
in their civil capacity, correspond roughly to the county courts in England
and Wales, and the Court of Session, which is the supreme civil court in
Scotland.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to nearly all actions and is
unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the sheriff
against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal or
directly to the Court of Session. Minor civil matters (actions not exceeding
£5 in value) may be tried by justices of the peace.
The Court of Session has universal jurisdiction, sits only in Edinburgh, and
has sole jurisdiction, inter alia, in divorce actions. The court is divided into
two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House,
which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions
of equal status, each consisting of four judges—the first division being
presided over by the Lord President and the second division by the Lord
Justice Clerk. From the Inner House an appeal may lie to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural
matters. The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank
and dignity of a judge of the Court of Session.
In Scotland civil proceedings are initiated by the service on the defender of
a writ or summons, which sets out the nature of the decree which the pursuer
seeks, a statement of facts upon which the pursuer founds his claim, and a
statement of the legal propositions upon which the pursuer maintains that he
is entitled to the remedy which he seeks. In Court of Session actions the next
step is the calling of the summons, which is the publication of the action in
the court lists. If the defender intends to contest the action, he must ‘enter
appearance’ within two days of calling and thereafter lodge defences to it. In
ordinary sheriff court actions ‘entering appearance’ is followed by the ‘tabling
of the cause’, which involves a formal appearance in court by solicitors or, in

some cases, by the parties to the dispute. In summary and small debt actions
the defender is simply given notice of the date on which the action will be
heard. It is much more common in Scotland than in England and Wales to
have legal debates in court as to the competency or relevancy of the written
pleadings prior to the proof.
In Scotland a pursuer can abandon his case, including any matrimonial
case, at any time, but where abandonment is sought after the commencement
of the proof or trial, only with leave of the court. Trial by jury in civil action
in Scotland is more common than in England and Wales, being the usual
form of procedure in actions for damages for personal injuries.
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in
England and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller
community. The superior courts comprise the Supreme Court of Judicature
(consisting of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal) and the
Court of Criminal Appeal. The High Court is the superior court of first
instance, is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s Bench Division
(including probate, matrimonial and Admiralty proceedings) and the
circuit courts (assizes) and is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice, as
president, and four judges. The Court of Appeal, which is the appellate
tribunal, is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice and two Lords Justices of
Appeal.
The inferior courts are the county courts and courts of summary jurisdiction
(petty sessions). The county courts exercise both civil and criminal jurisdic¬
tion and are presided over by county court judges, of whom there are five
(two of them having a title of Recorder—of Belfast and of Londonderry). At
least four sittings of the court are held annually in each division. Petty
session courts are composed of one resident magistrate (who corresponds to
a stipendiary magistrate in England and Wales) who sits alone except in some
specific cases, for instance in a special crimes court, where two may adjudicate.
Juvenile courts are composed of one resident magistrate and two lay members,
one of whom must be a woman.
JPECIAL COURTS Coroners’ courts are common law courts convened when a person appears to
Coroners’ ^ave a vi0lent or unnatural death or a sudden death of which the cause
Courts ’s unknown, and in certain other circumstances. In such cases, it is the duty
of the local coroner (who may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical practi¬
tioner of not less than five years’ standing, appointed by county, county
borough, or certain borough councils) to hold an enquiry into how, when,
and where the deceased died; he may hold an inquest in court for this purpose,
and he must do so if he has reason to believe that the deceased has died a
violent or unnatural death or has died in prison or in circumstances for which
an Act of Parliament provides that an inquest must be held. If he has reason
to suspect that the death was due to murder, manslaughter, or infanticide, or
was caused by an accident arising out of the use of a vehicle on the public
highway, he must summon a jury.
Cases may be brought to the notice of the coroner by medical practitioners,
by police, by various public authorities or by members of the public. The
amount of work varies considerably according to the type of locality.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal
enquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and
may report the result of his enquiries to the Crown Agent in order that Crown
Counsel may consider what proceedings, if any, are required.

Administrative
Tribunals
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Northern Ireland coroners are appointed by the Minister of Home
Affairs and must, on appointment, be either barnsters-at-law of not less than
five years’ standing practising in Northern Ireland or practising solicitors of
the Supreme Court of Judicature in Northern Ireland of not less than five
years’ standing.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a
rule, they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by
statute, which also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in the
social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions
on which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration,
with a group of people or another individual; consequently there has been
a substantial growth in the number of tribunals (there are over 2,000 in
existence) and in the range of their activities (in one year they hear some
6 000 cases) during the past 20 years. Their constitution follows a fairly
general pattern: all, for instance, consist of an uneven number of persons so
that a majority decision can be reached; members are usually appointed by
the minister concerned with the subject but other authorities (for instance,
the Crown, the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls) have the power
of appointment in appropriate cases and the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord
President of the Court of Session in Scotland, makes appointment in most
cases where a lawyer chairman or member is required; and, with some
exceptions, members of tribunals hold office for a period specified in the
warrant or instrument by which they are appointed. Administrative tribunals
may be broadly classified as follows:
1. those which have permanent members appointed for their special
knowledge, and a chairman who must be a lawyer of experience: for
instance, the Transport Tribunal, which hears appeals relating to road
carriers’ licences throughout Great Britain, and the Lands Tribuna,
which has jurisdiction in a variety of matters relating to the value of
property;
2 those which deal exclusively with matters of interest to one government
department or public authority: for instance, the Pensions Appeal
Tribunals, which hear appeals against the rejection by the Secretary of
State for the Social Services of war service pension claims, and the Special
Commissioners of Income Tax who hear appeals on income tax matters
from the rulings of the Inland Revenue officials, and
o those appointed by a minister to arbitrate between individuals: for
instance, the Rent Tribunals, which have jurisdiction in the determination
of rents of certain properties.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline, such as
the General Medical Council and the Disciplinary Committee of The Law
Society, but these are entirely different in constitution from the statutory
tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.
Although there is no general provision respecting appeals from statutory
tribunals, the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1958 and other Acts provide for an
appeal, at least on a point of law, from all the more important tribunals to the
High Court, or, in Scotland, to the Court of Session. An appeal may also he
to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister of the Crown or to an
independent referee. An advisory body known as the Council on Tribunals

(appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for
Scotland) exercises general supervision1 over tribunals and reports on
particular matters, those peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by the Scottish
Committee of the Council.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board consists of a chairman of wide
legal experience and eight other legally qualified members appointed by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consultation
with the Lord Chancellor. Its function is to entertain applications for ex gratia
payments of compensation, in certain circumstances, to victims of crimes of
violence in Great Britain or on a British vessel or aircraft. Compensation,
which is assessed on the basis of common law damages and usually takes the
form of a lump sum payment, amounts to nearly £2 million a year. Some
7,000 applications are received annually.
Courts martial have jurisdiction, under the Army Act and the Air Force Act
of 1955 (as amended) and the Naval Discipline Act of 1957 (also as amended),
over serving members of the armed forces and, in certain circumstances, their
dependants and other civilians who accompany them outside the United
Kingdom. Courts martial may not deal with charges involving treason, murder,
manslaughter or rape, if the offence is committed in the United Kingdom.
Civil offences committed in the United Kingdom by members of the armed
forces are normally also dealt with in the ordinary courts.
A court martial (which consists of a president and members, all of whom
are serving officers) may be convened by any authorised officer. A judge
advocate is appointed to sit with the court in more serious cases brought
under the Army and Air Force Act (and at every trial brought under the Naval
Discipline Act) to advise upon law and procedure and, in the former case,
to sum up the evidence. The judge advocate in the case of the Army and the
Air Force is a civilian and a barrister appointed by the Office of the Judge
Advocate General. In the case of the Navy he is a legally qualified serving
officer appointed by the convening authority.
Appeals lie to the Courts Martial Appeals Court, and from that court to
the House of Lords if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords that
the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
In the United Kingdom no single minister is responsible for the operation of
the law. Responsibility for the administration of the judicial system in
England and Wales, when it does not rest with the courts themselves, lies
partly with the Lord Chancellor and partly with the Home Secretary; in
Scotland it lies with the Secretary of State. In England the Lord Chancellor
is concerned with the composition of all courts, both criminal and civil, with
parts of criminal procedure and with everything relating to civil law, and the
Home Secretary with criminal law, preventing offences, apprehending
offenders, part of the process of trying them, and virtually the whole of their
treatment. The Prime Minister is also concerned in that he is responsible for
recommending to the Crown the highest judicial appointments.
The administrative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature and the
appointment of the officers of the court is partly in the hands of the Lord
Chancellor and partly in the hands of the appropriate judges. The Lord

Chancellor is concerned with legal procedure in that he is a member of the Rule
Committee (which makes the rules of the Supreme Court) and of the Matri¬
monial Causes Rule Committee, appoints the County Court Rule Committee,
and has power to alter or disallow the rules made by it. He is concerned with
law reform in that he appoints the members of the Law Commission for
England and Wales, which is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of
high standing, charged with the duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its
systematic development and reform, including the possibility of codification,
the elimination of anomalies, the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary en^t'
ments and the reduction of the number of separate enactments. The
Commission submits to the Lord Chancellor programmes of reform which
may recommend their further examination by itself or by some other body,
such as a Royal Commission or the existing Law Reform Committee or
Criminal Law Revision Committee.1 The Lord Chancellor may also ask the
Commission to prepare draft Bills or to advise government departments. In
the course of its work the Commission has power to consider the legal systems
of other countries. .
Magistrates’ courts are mainly administered by the magistrates themselves,
chiefly through committees known as magistrates’ courts committees (com¬
mittee of magistrates in inner London) but the local authorities, with financia
assistance from the Government, are responsible for meeting their costs, and
the Home Secretary, besides exercising a general oversight, has certain specific
responsibilities, including the approval of boundary changes, approval of the
appointment of justices’ clerks, and deciding disputes on financial matters.
In Scotland the Secretary of State appoints the staff of the High Court of
Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the staffing and
general organisation of the sheriff courts. He is also responsible, jointly with
the Lord Advocate, for appointing the members of the Law Commission
for Scotland (which has functions similar to those of the English Law
Commission). .
In Northern Ireland the administration of the superior courts has been
reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament. The judges are appointed by
the Crown and are removable only on an address of both Houses of that
Parliament. The Minister of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland is responsible
for the staffing and general organisation of the county and petty sessions
courts; the judges of the county court and resident magistrates of the
magistrates’ courts are appointed by the Governor of Northern Ireland.
THE PERSONNEL The operation of the law requires the participation of judges with whom, aided
OF THE LAW in certain cases by juries, the decision of disputed cases rests; of the officers
of the court, who have general or specialised functions of an administrative
(and sometimes of a judicial) nature in the courts to which they are attached;
and of the barristers (advocates in Scotland) and solicitors who are entrusted
with representing the interests of the parties to a dispute.2

The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts (since the Crown
is the historic source of all judicial power) and the Sovereign, acting on the

advice of ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary. In
England and Wales appointments to the highest positions—the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the
President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division and the Lords
Justices who are the judges of the Court of Appeal—are made on the recom¬
mendation of the Prime Minister, while the Lord Chancellor recommends
the appointment of the puisne judges, the county court judges (except in
Lancashire where they are recommended by the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster), the chairmen of quarter sessions, the recorders of boroughs, and
the metropolitan and other stipendiary magistrates. Justices of the peace are
appointed on behalf of the Crown by the Lord Chancellor,1 who is advised,
as to a county by the Lord Lieutenant2 with the assistance of a local advisory
committee, and as to the boroughs by separate advisory committees.
In Scotland the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appointment
of the Lord Justice General and Lord President and also of the Lord Justice
Clerk. Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies with the
Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State is responsible for the
appointment and removal of justices of the peace.
Judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor who, as
well as being head of the judiciary, is a leading member of the Government
in power. With the exception of justices of the peace, judges are normally
appointed from practising barristers, advocates or solicitors and neither their
training nor their career is in any way dictated by the State. Justices of the
peace need no legal qualifications, being appointed for their qualities of
integrity and understanding and as broadly representative of the community
which they serve, but, on appointment, they give an undertaking to complete
a period of basic training, so that they may obtain a sufficient knowledge
of the law, including the rules of evidence, and may understand the
nature and purpose of sentencing. In certain circumstances (for instance, in
cases of misconduct or proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in
England and Wales may be removed from their position by the Lord
Chancellor, and in Scotland, subject to specified conditions, by the Secretary
of State on a report prepared at his instance by the Lord President of the
Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk. In order to safeguard and
perpetuate the independence of the judiciary from the executive, however,
superior judges in England and Wales (other than the Lord Chancellor who,
as a Cabinet Minister, changes with the Government) are subject to a power
of removal only by the Sovereign on an address presented by both Houses of
Parliament, while in Scotland there is no statutory provision for removal of
judges of the Court of Session or High Court of Judiciary from office and it is
probable that special legislation would be required to effect such a dismissal.
A jury in England and Wales summoned to assizes or quarter sessions, or in a
civil action, consists of 12 persons (except in county courts, where it consists
of eight persons). In Scotland the jury consists of 15 persons in criminal cases
and 12 in civil cases and in Northern Ireland of 12 in criminal and seven in
civil cases. Most householders in Britain (men and women alike) are liable
for jury service if they are British subjects between the ages of 21 and 60, but

people following certain occupations can claim exemption and certain persons
with criminal records are disqualified. .
A jury is completely independent of both the judiciary and executive.
In criminal cases the accused can have up to seven jurors (in Scotland, five)
changed without giving reasons and both defence and prosecution can object
for cause shown (for instance, lack of impartiality), but once members of the
jury have been sworn, they are protected from interference of any kind. It is
an offence to assault, threaten or attempt to corrupt a juryman before or
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland and at fatal accident enquiries in Scotland, a jury is required to be
present to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person died.
Juries in this instance consist of from seven to eleven jurors, and the coroner
may accept a majority verdict provided that the minority consists of not more
than two. A jury is also required at an inquest held by a coroner to decide
whether objects of gold or silver found in the ground are ‘treasure trove .
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers^ (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Each performs distinct duties—solicitors undertake
legal business for lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems
submitted through solicitors and conduct proceedings in the higher courts
though certain functions are common to both.
To become a barrister in England a student must have reached an accepted
educational standard, have passed a legal examination prescribed by t e
Council of Legal Education and have become a member of one of the four
Inns of Court—Lincoln’s Inn, the Inner Temple, the Middle TemPle ai^d
Gray’s Inn—where he must keep eight terms. He may then be called to the
Bar but is normally not allowed to practise until he has kept a further four
terms and completed six months’ pupillage with a practising barrister of at
least five years’ standing. A barrister with a substantial junior practice may
apply to the Lord Chancellor for a patent appointing him Queen’s Counsel—a
proceeding known as ‘taking silk’. Most of the higher judicial offices are
filled from the ranks of Queen’s Counsel. The professional conduct of a
barrister is subject to the scrutiny of the General Council of the Bar; discipline
is vested in the Senate of the four Inns. . , . ,
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable by
the appropriate committee of The Law Society (the professional organisation
of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising
solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his professiona
career. The term of articles lasts for two, three or five years, depending upon
the educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must pass the
necessary examinations prescribed by The Law Society and, unless he has been
a barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally required to attend
a course of studies at a recognised law school. Once a solicitor is qualified,
he may become a member of The Law Society.
In Scotland a prospective advocate must show evidence of his general
scholarship (normally by holding an arts degree) and his knowledge of law
(normally by holding a law degree of a Scottish university). The conditions
applying for the admission of solicitors are broadly similar to those applying
in England and Wales. The analogous professional organisations are the
Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland.

Legal Aid in
Criminal Courts
93
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.
In Britain legal aid is available for nearly all types of civil and criminal
proceedings in nearly all courts of law. It is also available for oral legal advice
and in certain circumstances where the assistance of a lawyer is needed but
which do not (or do not yet) involve litigation.
Free legal aid in civil cases is available to persons with very small incomes and
capital, and contributory legal aid to those with larger but still limited means.
The majority of people are financially eligible for legal aid.
The legal aid scheme in England and Wales is run by The Law Society
under the general guidance of the Lord Chancellor. It is operated by 13 area
committees and a network of local committees composed of barristers and
solicitors (who may be paid a fee), with a salaried staff. The cost is met from
the Legal Aid Fund, drawn from three sources: contributions from assisted
persons; costs recovered from opposite parties in litigation; and a grant from
the Exchequer.
Applicants for free legal aid must show that they have reasonable grounds
for asserting or disputing a claim. A successful applicant is allowed to select
from a panel a solicitor who, if necessary, instructs a barrister, and the case
is then conducted in the ordinary way. Certain types of action, including libel
and slander, are excluded from the scheme.
In Scotland the legal aid scheme is administered by the Law Society of
Scotland through a supervisory central committee, the Supreme Court
committee and 16 local committees. To obtain legal aid for litigation an
applicant is required to show ‘probable cause’ and produce in support of his
application a statement corroborated according to the requirements of Scottish
law. Assistance is available in connection with appeals to the House of Lords
from the Court of Session, in civil proceedings before the Court of Session,
the Lands Valuation Appeal Court and the sheriff courts, and in matters not
involving litigation. Where litigation is not involved, the applicant must show
he has reasonable grounds for taking the proposed legal action.
In Northern Ireland the legal aid scheme is administered by the Incorporated
Law Society of Northern Ireland under the general guidance of the Ministry of
Home Affairs. The scheme provides for legal aid in proceedings in the Supreme
Court, the county courts and in certain civil proceedings in magistrates’ courts.
In the criminal courts in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made
by the court or courts concerned (and must be made when a person is
committed for trial on a charge of murder) if it appears that a defendant’s
means are such that he requires financial help in meeting the costs of the
proceedings in which he is involved. No limit of income or capital above
which a person is ineligible for legal aid is specified, but the court has power
to order applicants to pay a reasonable contribution towards the cost of the
case according to their means. Generally, legal aid in criminal proceedings
consists of representation by a solicitor and counsel assigned by the court,
but in proceedings in magistrates’ courts the recipient is normally entitled
only to the services of a solicitor, and in assize and quarter sessions proceedings
the court may, in cases of urgency (when there is no time to instruct a
solicitor), order that legal aid shall consist of representation by counsel only.
94
Legal Advice
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In appeal cases at quarter sessions legal aid may be granted by a magistrates
court or a court of quarter sessions. The granting of legal aid for appeals to
the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) rests with that court which may
also grant legal aid for the purposes of a further appeal to the House of Lords
The cost of legal aid in magistrates’ courts is paid out of the Legal Aid
Fund. In the higher courts payments are made in the first instance out of
local authority funds and the cost is reimbursed by the central Government.
Legal aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland is available to all persons in
custody on their first appearance in the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff
courts and the special juvenile courts. Otherwise, it is granted for
proceedings in these courts at the discretion of the courts themselves except
in appeals, when the final decision whether or not it should be granted is in
the hands of the Supreme Court Committee of the Law Society of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland free legal aid is available in trials on indictment before
courts of assize and in county courts and in criminal proceedings before
magistrates’ courts. It is also available for appeals from magistrates courts
to the county court and in appeals from county courts and courts of assize
to the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal.
Oral advice on legal matters is available, both in England and Wales and in
Scotland, free of charge to persons in receipt of social security benefit and at
a very reasonable cost, that is, at 2s. 6d. for an interview of up to 30 minutes
to those of limited means. Advice is given by practising solicitors paid out of
the legal aid funds of the two countries. The scheme is administered by the
two law societies, which also run voluntary schemes (for a fee of £i) tor
those who do not qualify for statutory assistance.
Penalties
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The chief aims of the penal systems of the United Kingdom are to deter tne
potential law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of
deterrence is intended to lie in the fear of detection, public trial, and possibility
of punishment rather than in the severity of the punishment itself. In England
and Wales the Home Secretary is assisted by an Advisory Council on the Penal
System, which makes recommendations on specific aspects of the prevention
of crime and the treatment of offenders.
Methods current in British penal practice include imprisonment (and, for
certain categories of offender, other forms of custodial treatment); probation;
fines; and absolute or (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) conditional
discharge for up to three years. In addition, an offender may be bound over
that is to say, required to pledge money, with or without sureties to keep the
peace and be of good behaviour’. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
if sentenced to imprisonment for two years or less, an offender may be given
a suspended sentence, which means that the sentence will not actually be
served unless he commits a further offence within a period of between one
and three years. If, however, he does commit an offence the suspended
sentence will normally take effect and a further sentence may be imposed
Under the provisions of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act
196^ (which is to operate until 31st July 1970 after which its continuance
in force will be subject to approval by both Houses of Parliament) the
LAW AND ORDER
95
Administrative
Authorities
automatic penalty for murder in England, Wales and Scotland is imprison¬
ment for life—a sentence which may also be imposed for manslaughter
and certain other offences, including rape, robbery with violence, and arson.
In Northern Ireland the death penalty has been abolished except for two
categories of ‘capital’ murder: murder of a constable or other person in the
service of the Crown in the course of duty involving enforcement of the law,
maintenance of law and order, or the administration or advancement of
justice; and murder done in the course of furtherance of any seditious con¬
spiracy or of the activities of an unlawful organisation.
The penalty for murder is prescribed by law; otherwise the responsibility
for choosing the method of dealing with any particular offender rests with
the criminal courts, which have discretion to select the penalty that they
consider most suitable in the light of the nature and gravity of the offence
and the information made available to them about the character and needs
of the offender. In certain cases this discretion is modified by statutory provi¬
sions (designed for the most part to ensure that prison sentences are kept to
a minimum): for instance, in England and Wales, no offender under the age
of 17 may be sentenced to imprisonment, while those aged 17 and under 21
may not be sent to prison for any period between six months and three years,
unless they are persistent offenders, in which case a sentence of 18 months
or more may be passed. In Scotland no offender under 21 may be sent
to prison; where neither borstal training nor detention in a detention centre
is thought appropriate, he may be sent to a young offenders’ institution. In
England and Wales the courts must suspend sentences of up to six months’
imprisonment unless the offender has been in prison before or the crime
involved violence. On the other hand, special sentences of somewhat longer
duration (extended sentence) may be imposed on persistent offenders.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary is the minister generally responsible
for legislation relating to the treatment of offenders, for collecting statistical
and other information about the operation of the penal system, for reviewing
the advantages and defects of the various methods of treating offenders, and
for bringing information about these methods to the attention of the courts.
He is specifically responsible for supervising the approved schools, for
promoting the efficiency of the probation service, and for providing, main¬
taining and managing prisons, borstal institutions, detention centres, remand
centres and attendance centres. Prison policy is carried out by the prison
department of the Home Office through the agency of the prison service which
operates under the direction of an inspector-general and includes the senior
officers at headquarters, the governors and staff of the penal establishments,
and members of particular professions, such as medical officers, chaplains
and social workers, with their own professional status.
The general supervision of penal institutions is the responsibility of visiting
committees or boards of visitors. Visiting committees of justices of the peace
are now appointed for local prisons by the various courts of quarter session
in the area, in numbers fixed by the Home Secretary. For all other prisons and
for borstals, detention centres and remand centres a board of visitors is
appointed by the Home Secretary; not less than two members must be
justices of the peace. The main functions of these bodies are to act as the
superior disciplinary authority for reports of a more serious nature against
prisoners and provide an independent channel of complaint for any prisoner
having a grievance, and to report direct to the Home Secretary, both by
formal annual report and as occasion may require, on the administration of the

establishment. The boards of visitors also advise on the release on licence of
the inmates of borstals. Their work, which helps to preserve local interest,
is voluntary and unpaid.
The penal systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland are based on principles
similar to those applied in England and Wales. In Scotland the system is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland
of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Rules to regulate the lives of all those sentenced to custodial treatment in
prisons in England and Wales—known as the Prison Rules—are made by the
Home Secretary. In furtherance of these rules, which state that ‘the purpose
of the training and treatment of convicted prisoners shall be to encourage
and assist them to lead a good and useful life’, prisoners are classified into
groups, according to their record, character, potentialities and the risk they
present to security, and assigned, so far as circumstances permit, to the
establishment best suited to their needs. Untried prisoners are separated
from convicted prisoners and, as far as practicable, those under 21 are
separated from adults.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known
as ‘local’ prisons; all are closed establishments. Other prisons, which may be
open or closed, receive prisoners on transfer from local prisons.
To meet the need for additional accommodation caused by the rise in the
prison population and to facilitate the application of modern methods of
treatment and training, an extensive programme for the construction of new
prisons and the modernisation of existing establishments has been embarked
upon. In England and Wales the number of men’s prisons has increased from
46 to 57 since 1960 and a further I4> of which two are in the course of building,
are planned. In Scotland three new prisons are planned.
On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to
imprisonment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their
sentence provided that this does not reduce their sentence below 31 days
(in Scotland, 30 days). In addition, except in Northern Ireland, prisoners
serving fixed sentences become eligible for parole after serving one-third of
their sentence, subject to a minimum of one year. Each eligible prisoner is first
considered by a local review committee which reports to the Home Secretary
or Secretary of State for Scotland on his suitability for parole. The Minister
concerned then refers the recommendations with which he agrees to the
Parole Board or Parole Board for Scotland. Where a Parole Board recommends
favourably, the decision whether or not to release the prisoner depends
finally on the Minister, but where the Board does not recommend release
the Minister has no power to grant parole.1 The licence remains in force until
the date on which the prisoner would have been released if he had not been
licensed or, for prisoners serving extended sentences (in England and Wales
only) and offenders sentenced while under 21 years of age, until the end of
the sentence.
Prisoners serving life sentences are also eligible for release on licence, the
Home Secretary or Secretary of State for Scotland being empowered to
1 Bodies appointed by the Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Scotland
respectively to advise on release on licence, the conditions of such licences, the
revocation of licences and allied matters. Each Board consists of a chairman and a
number of other members (20 in England and Wales, and 8 m Scotland), who must
include a holder or former holder of a judicial office, a psychiatrist, an expert in
after-care and an expert in delinquency.

release such prisoners at any time (although normally they do not do so until
the prisoner has served seven years) on the recommendation of the Parole
Board concerned and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice in
England and the Lord Justice General in Scotland (as the case may be) and,
if he is available, with the judge who presided at the trial.
In prison training, efforts are being made to provide (i) work of a type likely
to help fit prisoners to earn their living after release, with technical training
in skilled trades for certain persons, (2) suitable educational facilities,
(3) opportunities for the development of a sense of personal responsibility,
including (for suitable prisoners) training in open conditions, and (4) treat¬
ment techniques, such as group counselling, which may help a prisoner to
solve his problems and improve his future life.
In England and Wales prison work is centrally controlled by the Direc¬
torate of Industries and Stores of the Prison Department of the Home Office,
which comprises both executive and technical staff. Workshops are supervised
by a headquarters staff of travelling supervisors and by industrial managers
at the prisons; farms and gardens are in the charge of the Chief Farms and
Gardens Officer and the farm managers. In Scotland there is a Supervisor
of Industries and Training, who advises the Director of the Prison Service
on industrial employment (including agriculture) and training. A deputy
supervisor, two technical officers and four industrial managers work under
the supervisor. In Northern Ireland general supervision of prison work is
exercised by the Ministry of Home Affairs in consultation, where necessary,
with other government departments.
The primary source of work for prison inmates lies in the requirements
of the prison service itself, that is to say, building and maintenance, domestic
services, and equipment. Goods and services are also supplied to other
government departments and, on an increasing scale, to other purchasers,
both inside and outside the public services. Vocational training courses under
skilled instructors are provided for selected prisoners, who may take pre¬
liminary internal examinations and external examinations conducted by such
bodies as the City and Guilds of London Institute, the Union of Educational
Institutions, and the Royal Society of Arts. A few prisoners are employed
outside prison on work such as archaeological excavation and the preservation
of canals.
In England, Wales and Scotland, small payments are made to inmates for
the work they do, and in some prisons payments above the minimum are made
on the basis of output and skill; in Northern Ireland a progressive system of
earnings, related to work done, is being gradually introduced.
Specially selected prisoners among those sentenced to long-term imprison¬
ment are allowed to work in ordinary civilian jobs outside prison during the
months immediately preceding their discharge. These prisoners, some of
whom live in prison hostels, are paid normal wages from which they support
their families and meet their own expenses.
Educational arrangements are made in prisons in Great Britain by local
education authorities, which are advised in England and Wales by the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science, and in Scotland by the Scottish Education
Department. Most prisons have a tutor-organiser and a number of voluntary
teachers, and assistance is given by members of the prison staff. A wide choice
of evening classes and correspondence courses is available, and other educa¬
tional facilities, such as physical training, concerts, plays, films, lectures and
group discussions, are arranged where facilities allow. Prisoners use the prison

libraries which depend largely upon the local public libraries for their stocks.
Education in prisons in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Home Affairs.
Medical attention is provided by full-time and part-time medical officers whose
duties include the care of the physical and mental health of prison inmates,
and the oversight of those services which affect health in prisons.
In a few prisons there are large, fully equipped hospitals where major
surgery can be undertaken and treatment by visiting specialists given both to
inmates and to prisoners from other establishments.
Several prisons also have their own psychiatric clinics, to which
prisoners from other establishments may likewise be referred. In England
and Wales there is one psychiatric prison, with accommodation for some 350
people, and a prison psychological service, whose officers assist governors and
medical officers in their work of examining and classifying prisoners. The
hospital facilities of the National Health Service (see Chapter 5) are also
available for the treatment of prisoners in appropriate cases and arrangements
may be made, where necessary, for prisoners to receive treatment after release.
Depending on the facilities available at individual establishments prisoners,
from the beginning of their sentence, are granted such privileges as the use
of books, periodicals and newspapers, dining and recreation in association,
making purchases from the canteen with money earned in prison, and
watching television in the evening. They may also write and receive letters
regularly, and may be visited by their friends and relatives at specified
intervals.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, visiting
committee or board of visitors, who have power to order, among other
penalties, forfeiture of remission and forfeiture of privileges.
Welfare in prisons is the general concern of the prison staff as a whole, and in
particular of the chaplains and assistant governors, but special responsibilities
attach to prison welfare officers, who, in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, are probation officers seconded by the probation and after-care
service. (In Scotland, prison welfare officers are especially appointed for this
purpose.) The functions of these officers include helping the prisoner in his
relationships with individuals and organisations outside the prison, and
making plans for the prisoner’s after-care, working closely in this connection
with colleagues in the probation and after-care service and with other
agencies in the community whose help the prisoner or his family may need
either during sentence or after release.
For the spiritual welfare of the inmates, a chaplain of the Church of
England (in Scotland, of the Church of Scotland and in Northern Ireland, of
the Church of Ireland and Presbyterian Church), a Roman Catholic priest
and a minister of the Methodist Church are appointed to every prison.
Ministers of other denominations are either appointed or specially called in as
required. Chaplains not only hold regular services, they also visit every
prisoner soon after reception, shortly before release and regularly during
sentence, and pay daily visits to all prisoners who are sick or confined to
their cells and any others who apply to see them.
Prisoners may also receive visits from specially appointed prison visitors,
whose work is voluntary and in England and Wales, is co-ordinated and
guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
In England and Wales pre-release courses are conducted at all prisons.
During these courses experts hold open forum with prisoners nearing their

release on the domestic, social and employment problems with which they
are likely to be faced. Home leave, allowing five clear days at home, is exten¬
sively granted to many categories of prisoners with sentences of two years or
over towards the end of their sentences to enable them to make family
adjustments and contacts with potential employers.
Adult offenders released on licence (see p. 96) and all young offenders
(see below), except the few committed to detention centres in default of
payment of a fine or other sum of money, are subject to statutory supervision
after release. The sanctions for failure to observe the conditions of supervision
are recall to prison, borstal or detention centre. Statutory supervision is
carried out by probation officers of the probation and after-care service, to
which offenders not subject to compulsory supervision may also apply for
help.
In Northern Ireland after-care duties are likewise carried out by probation
and after-care officers; in Scotland, responsibility for statutory and voluntary
after-care is vested in social workers from the local authority social work
departments.
In England and Wales the Government has published legislative proposals1
designed to provide a flexible system for securing the most effective help for
children in need. These include eliminating court proceedings if effective
action can be taken informally with the co-operation of the parents; dealing
with children under the age of 14, if court proceedings prove necessary,
under care, protection and control procedure and not by prosecution; and
restricting the prosecution of young persons aged between 14 and 17 to
certain defined cases. The proposals also include reshaping2 the methods of
treatment available to the courts in dealing with children and young persons.
At present, a child under the age of ten cannot be charged with an offence;
between ten and 16 years old, a child charged with an offence other than
homicide, must be dealt with in a juvenile court unless charged jointly
with an adult; while a young person (that is, one between 14 and 17 years
of age) charged with an indictable offence may be dealt with summarily
(as is usually the case) or committed for trial by jury.
In Scotland, a system of children’s panels and hearings (which will, broadly
speaking, replace the court system) will come into operation about the end
of 1970 to deal with children up to 16, or in certain cases 18, who have
committed offences, or in respect of whom there are certain other conditions
which suggest that they may be in need of compulsory measures of care. It
will be for the children s hearing to decide on the most appropriate treatment
in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and for the new local authority
social work services to ensure that the decision is implemented.
In Northern Ireland a child or young person between the ages often and 17
is normally dealt with by a juvenile court unless charged jointly with an adult
or committed for trial by jury in the case of an indictable offence. Such
1 A bill to give effect to these proposals is at present before Parliament.
2 Under care proceedings the court, if satisfied that the child before it was in need of
care or control, would either place him under supervision in his own home or commit
him to the care of the local authority. Provision would be made for the development
of a system of short term treatment midway between supervision and removal from
home, which the court could prescribe as a condition of a supervision order. Com-
mumty homes, which would include the present approved schools and which would
make comprehensive residential provision for all children in the care of local
authorities, would be established. The approved school order would be abolished and
attendance centre orders and detention centre orders would cease to be made for
children under 17.

committal may take place at the request of the accused’s parents or at the
discretion of the juvenile court.
Methods of treatment at present available in law for dealing with children
and young persons found guilty of committing an offence include: absolute
discharge; conditional discharge (in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland); fines imposed upon the offender which, in certain circumstances
his parents may be called upon to pay; probation; committal to the care of
a fit person (normally the appropriate local authority) until the age of 18; or
committal to an approved school. Offenders aged not less than 10 and under
21 years may be ordered to attend an attendance centre; aged not less than 14
and under 21 (not less than 16 and under 21 in Scotland), they may be
detained in a detention centre; aged not less than 15 and under 21 (not less
than 16 and under 21 in Scotland and Northern Ireland), they may be sent
for a period of borstal training; and aged not less than 17 and under 21 they
may be given a prison sentence ranging from up to six months to over three
vears. In Scotland offenders of 17 and under 21 found unsuitable for
detention centre or borstal training may be detained in a young offenders
institution.
In England, Wales and Scotland remand homes are provided by local
authorities for the custody of boys and girls under the age of 17 before their
appearance in court, between court appearances (while enquiries are made as
to the best method of treatment for them) or while they are awaiting vacancies
in approved schools. In Northern Ireland the responsibility for providing or
arranging for the provision of remand homes rests with the Ministry of Home
a flairs •
In addition to remand homes, remand centres are being established in
England and Wales (and are planned for Scotland), to which a court may send
offenders aged 17 and under 21 who would otherwise be remanded to prison,
and those between the ages of 14 and 17 who are unsuitable for remand homes
The system of remand offers valuable opportunities for the observation of
any young offender on whose physical or mental condition a medical report
may be desirable to help the court in deciding the most suitable method of
dealing with the case.
Approved schools are boarding schools to which boys and girls under the age
of 17 may be sent either because they have committed an offence or because
they are in need of care and protection or control. The schools maybe provided
by local authorities, by voluntary organisations concerned with the welfare
of children and young people on a national scale, or by local committees
formed by people interested in such work. In England and Wales the schools
must be approved by the Home Secretary; in Scotland, by the Secretary of
State for Scotland; and in Northern Ireland, where they are known as training
schools, by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Supervision is exercised on behal
of the Ministers by inspectors who pay regular visits to the schools.
The schools, which are for boys only or for girls only, are classified according
to age on admission, and within each age group there are separate schools tor
Roman Catholic children. Assignment to a school in the appropriate age
group is determined in the light of the child’s needs, the distance of the school
from his home, and the type of training provided. .
A child under the age of 12 years and 4 months at the time of committal
may be kept in an approved school until the age of 15 years and 4 months; it
he is more than 12 years and 4 months he may be kept in the school for three
years from the date of committal or until he reaches the age of 19, whichever
LAW AND ORDER
101
is the shorter period. The upper age limit may be extended to 19I in certain
circumstances, and the period of detention of an absconder is lengthened by
any period spent unlawfully absent from the school.
The primary object of approved school training is to help boys and girls
adjust themselves for their return to the community, and contact with their
homes is maintained while they are in the schools. Managers of approved
schools are under an obligation to review the individual progress of the
children in their care with a view to releasing them as soon as they have made
sufficient progress in their training. After release children remain under the
care and supervision of the managers for two years or until they reach the
age of 21, whichever is the earlier.
Attendance Centres Over 50 attendance centres have been established in England and Wales to
deal with boys and youths between the ages of ten and 21 found guilty of
offences for which older people could be sentenced to imprisonment. This
form of treatment imposes punishment by deprivation of free time: boys
ordered to attend must do so during their spare time on Saturday mornings
or afternoons; they may be required to attend for up to three hours on any
one occasion and for a total of not less than 12 hours (with certain exceptions)
and not more than 24. The activities include physical training and instruction
in handicrafts or some other practical subject. Efforts are made at the centres
to induce the boys to join a youth club or other suitable organisation.
Detention Centres Detention centres are intended to deter from further crime young offenders
for whom a long period of residential training in an approved school or borstal
does not seem necessary but who cannot be taught respect for the law by such
measures as fines or probation. In England and Wales five junior centres are
available for boys of not less than 14 and under 17, and 14 senior centres for
youths aged 17 and under 21. One centre is also available for girls of 16 and
under 21. In Scotland there is one senior centre. Detention in England and
Wales may be for not less than three and not more than six months; if
consecutive sentences are passed, the total term may not exceed nine months
at any one time. Remission of up to one-sixth of the sentence may be earned
for good conduct. In Scotland the fixed period for all detention centre
sentences is three months and the age ranges from 16 to 21.
The regime at detention centres, which is brisk and firm, with strong
emphasis on hard work and high standards of behaviour, provides a normal
working week of 44 hours, including one hour daily devoted to physical
training. Boys of compulsory school age have day-time and evening classes,
and further education is provided for others in the evenings. Nearly all young
offenders discharged from detention centres are subject to statutory super¬
vision for 12 months.
Borstal Institutions The borstal training system, which is available for boys and girls who have
reached the age of 15 but are not yet 21 (16 to 21 in Scotland and Northern
Ireland), consists of different borstals specialising in different types of young
offender, classified according to such criteria as age, intelligence and criminal
sophistication. There are also a few borstals for special purposes, such as
allocation or recall. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the period of
detention ranges from six months to two years and is followed, in England and
Wales, by supervision for two years and in Northern Ireland for one year
from the date of release. In Scotland, where there is no minimum period of
detention, the maximum is two years and the supervision period is for one
year from the date of release from the institution. The system is essentially
remedial and educational, based on personal training by a carefully selected

staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled trades; there is
much freedom of movement and many borstals are open establishments.
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while he
remains at work or at school under the supervision of a probation officer,
whose duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal feature of the
service is that it relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before making a
probation order, the court must explain its effects and make sure that the
probationer understands that if he fails to comply with the requirements of
the order he will be liable to be dealt with for the original offence. A probation
order cannot be made without the consent of the person concerned unless
(in England, Wales and Northern Ireland only) he is under 14 years of age.
The order usually requires the probationer to keep in regular touch with the
probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an industrious life. It
may also require him to live in a specified place, or to submit to treatment foi
his mental condition. A probation order is made for not less than one year and
not more than three years. .
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation officers
(who also undertake social work in penal institutions and duties in connection
with statutory supervision and voluntary after-care of discharged offenders)
are available to every criminal court. In England and Wales their appointment
is the responsibility of probation and after-care committees, composed for
the most part of justices, first appointments, except in the case of pro¬
fessionally trained officers, being subject to confirmation by the Home
Secretary. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Home Affairs appoints
probation officers. Training facilities in England and Wales are provided by
the Home Office on the advice of the Advisory Council for Probation and
After-Care and are made available by arrangement to Northern Ireland
officers. . .
In Scotland, where there is no separate probation service, the local authority
social work departments provide the services and officers required by the
criminal courts in their areas. Offenders subject to probation orders and those
on after-care supervision following release from a penal institution are super¬
vised by specially approved social workers from these departments. Recruit¬
ment is the responsibility of the local authority concerned, and appointments
are not subject to ministerial confirmation. Unqualified staff appointed to posts
in social work departments may be seconded for professional training after a
number of years in post.
Criminological research, particularly research directed to the question of the
treatment of offenders, is carried out by the Home Office Research Unit (which
also serves the Scottish Home and Health Department), by university depart¬
ments and by various other research organisations; much of it is financed by
the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department. Studies
undertaken by the Home Office Research Unit are mainly concentrated on
subjects of direct interest to the home departments. Research and teaching in
criminology are provided at the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge
University and at Edinburgh University, at both of which postgraduate
courses are available. Courses in criminology are also available at the universi¬
ties of Durham, Reading, Oxford, Manchester and Southampton; the London
School of Economics, and University College in the University of London;
and the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Strathclyde in Scotland.
These institutions likewise conduct research.

THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organised in a number of large forces
linked with local government and subject to the influence and eventual control
of the Home Secretary in England and Wales and the Secretary of State for
Scotland in Scotland. In Northern Ireland the police force is controlled by an
Inspector General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
During the past three years a large number of police forces in Great Britain
have amalgamated in a nation-wide reorganisation of the police service,
and there are now 47 regular police forces in England and Wales and 20 in
Scotland. Each police force is responsible for a separate police area, but there
is constant co-operation between them.
In England and Wales the forces are defined according to area of responsi¬
bility as: county forces (5); county borough forces (6); combined forces (34),
which are forces whose area of responsibility extends over two or more
counties or county boroughs; the Metropolitan Police Force, which is
responsible for an area of approximately 15 miles radius from Charing Cross,
but excluding the City of London; and the City of London force. In Scotland
there are county forces, burgh forces and combined forces.
The strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is approximately
101,000, the size of individual police forces depending on the area and
population which they serve. In England and Wales, outside Greater London,
establishments range from 700 to 7,000, the majority being in the 1,000 to
2,500 range. The strength of the Metropolitan Police Force is about 25,000.
In Scotland forces range in strength from about 100 to 3,000.
In addition to the regular police forces, there are constabularies maintained
by the statutory transport and other public authorities, and by the Ministry
of Defence.
Each of the regular police forces is maintained by a police authority. In the
counties of England and Wales the authority is a police committee and in the
county boroughs a watch committee. Both are committees of the local council
and consist of councillors and justices in a proportion of two to one. Combined
police authorities, which also consist of councillors and justices, contain
representatives from each constituent area covered by an amalgamation
scheme.
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home
Secretary. In the City of London the Court of Common Council is the police
authority, although it usually appoints a standing committee to deal with all
police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland the police authority for the counties is the county council; in
the large burghs it is the town council; and where there are combined forces
there is a joint police committee.
The primary duty of the police authority is to provide an adequate and
efficient police force for the area for which it is responsible. To enable it to
carry out this duty, it is empowered, subject to the approval of the Home
Secretary or Secretary of State for Scotland, to appoint the chief constable
and the deputy and assistant chief constables of the force, and fix the author¬
ised establishment. It may also retire the chief constable in the interests of
efficiency, if the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland agrees,
and must keep itself informed of the way in which the chief constables deal
with complaints from the public against police officers. In addition, police
X04 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
authorities, with the consent of the Secretary of State, provide the buildings
and equipment needed for their forces. In the Metropolitan Police District
the chief officer of police and his immediate subordinates are appointed by the
Crown on the recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police
forces and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below
deputy or assistant chief constable; they are, however, generally responsible
to the police authorities on matters of efficiency, and are required to submit a
written annual report.
Central The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who have a
Authority general responsibility for the preservation of law and order throughout Great
Britain, are concerned both in the overall organisation of the police service
and in its administration and operation. In this regard, they must not only
approve the appointment of chief constables, but may require a police
authority to retire a chief constable in the interests of efficiency, call for a
report from a chief constable on any matters relating to the policing of his
area, or cause a local enquiry to be held. They are also empowered to make
regulations as to the government, administration and conditions of service
in police forces.
The police regulations cover such matters as ranks; the qualifications for
appointment, promotion and retirement; discipline; hours of duty, leave,
pay and allowances; and uniform and equipment. Some of these are first
negotiable on the Police Council for Great Britain; the others are discussed
on representative advisory bodies along with any general questions affecting
the police service.
The Home Secretary is advised on all matters concerning police efficiency
by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and nine inspectors, of
whom two are concerned with crime and traffic respectively, and one is in
charge of the Police Research and Development Branch. Six are individually
responsible for the inspection of a number of forces, and must be satisfied of
their continuing efficiency through formal annual inspection, and informal
visits and consultations when particular problems arise. The inspectors
report to the Home Secretary on the condition of all the forces, with the
exception of the Metropolitan Police Force. The Secretary of State for
Scotland is similarly assisted by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary
in Scotland and one other inspector.
All police authorities receive a government grant equal to half their net
expenditure except the Common Council of the City of London, which
receives one-third. The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scot¬
land are empowered to withhold the grant, in whole or in part, permanently
or for such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a police
area is efficiently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered,
or that the rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
Police Officers In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the
ages of 19 and 30. Women entrants in England and Wales must be between
the ages of 19 and 35, and in Scotland between 20 and 30 years old. Men
over 30 years old, and women over 35, may, however, be appointed on the
recommendation of the appointing authority in special circumstances approved
by the Home Secretary in England and Wales. In Scotland the Secretary of
State may approve appointments of both men and women over 30 years old.
The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
Police Cadets
Civilian Staff
Special
Constables

LAW AND ORDER IO5
Police District, are: chief constable, superintendent, inspector, sergeant and
constable. Intermediate ranks may also be adopted in areas where varying
degrees of responsibility make them necessary. In the Metropolitan Police
District the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.
He is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four assistant commissioners.
Next in rank are commanders, then deputy commanders; the other ranks are
the same as in the rest of the country. In the City of London the ranks are the
same as in the regions except that the chief officer is the Commissioner of
Police and the second in command is an assistant commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a
basic principle of the service that its members must not only be free from
political bias, but must also be seen to be free of it. All ranks, however, have
their own representative associations which can make representations to
ministers or to police authorities on matters of interest or concern to their
members.
Police cadets are recruited by most forces from among boys between 16 and
18 years of age. They have no police powers but are given some training in
police work, partly as useful preparation for subsequent appointment as
constables and partly to give them sufficient insight into police duties to
enable them to decide whether or not they wish to make a career in the police
service. Some forces also recruit girl cadets.
Most police authorities employ civilians as shorthand-typists, switchboard
operators, mechanics, canteen staff and cleaners, in order to release uniformed
personnel for police duties.
All police forces have an attachment of special constables, who are volunteers
willing to perform police duties without pay in their spare time. In England
and Wales the function of special constables is to act as auxiliaries to the
regular force when required. In Scotland they are employed only in emer¬
gencies although they may be assigned for duty for training purposes.
Traffic wardens are extensively employed to discharge specified duties
connected with road traffic and vehicles, normally undertaken by the police.
In this connection they may be authorised to serve fixed penalty notices1 for
minor offences to which the fixed penalty system applies. They may also be
employed to act as parking attendants at street parking places, and as school
crossing patrols, if the police agree. Traffic wardens remain under the control
of the chief constable of the force to which they are attached, whatever duties
they may perform.
A police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office
and exercises his powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by
common law, by virtue of his office; he is an agent of the law of the land, not
of the police authority nor of the central Government and although his chief
officer of police has a vicarious liability for any wrongful act he may commit
in the performance of his functions as a constable, he himself may also be
sued in respect of his own wrongful act.
The many and varied functions of a police officer as a constable range from
the protection of persons and property, road or street patrolling and traffic
control to criminal investigation and the apprehension of offenders.
1 A fixed penalty notice gives the recipient the option of paying a specified sum to the
clerk of the appropriate magistrates’ court, instead of having his case tried in the
ordinary way.

Services
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The main departments in all police forces are the uniform department and
the criminal investigation department; many forces have specialised depart¬
ments, including traffic departments, river police (in districts which include
long stretches of navigable waterway), a mounted branch (for maintaining
order and safety in large crowds), and police dogs.
During recent years a number of common services have been provided by
the central government departments for the benefit of all forces; they supple¬
ment those provided by the police authorities for their own use and by
communal arrangements made between the forces themselves. The most
important of these services are: training services, which in England and Wales
provide training centres for recruit training and a central police college for
higher training and in Scotland a central police college with courses of recruit
training and higher training; a forensic science service in England and Wales
which provides eight regional laboratories (in addition to the Metropolitan
Police Laboratory); regional wireless services and wireless depots, which in
England and Wales supply and maintain wireless equipment for the police;
and central and provincial criminal records which are available to all forces.
In addition, regional crime squads, consisting of teams of experienced
detectives from several forces, operating under a committee of chief con¬
stables, are employed to investigate major crimes involving enquiries in
more than one police area. Arrangements are also made for everyday
assistance by one force to another.
The Home Office Police Research and Development Branch, directed by an
Inspector of Constabulary and staffed by senior police officers and scientists,
is charged with the planning of police methods, the development of new
equipment and the study of new techniques throughout Great Britain. A
considerable amount of the work in which the Branch is engaged involves
the use of operational research techniques.
Services provided by the Metropolitan Police Force for other forces include
(1) the publication of the Police Gazette,1 which contains particulars of people
wanted for crime and details of stolen property, and is supplied without
charge to the police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain other Com¬
monwealth and foreign forces; (2) the organisation and control of the special
branch of the criminal investigation department at New Scotland Yard,
whose duties include the protection of royalty, some ministers, and dis¬
tinguished foreign visitors; and (3) the carrying out of extradition orders
made by the courts. The Metropolitan Police Force is also available, on
request, to assist any other police force in England and Wales in criminal
investigations. Similarly, the services of the Fraud Squad, run jointly by
the Metropolitan Police Force and the City of London Police, are available
throughout Great Britain for the investigation of serious company frauds.
The National Central Bureau, which handles the business of the International
Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) on behalf of Great Britain and the
British dependencies, is part of the Metropolitan Police Force. For certain of
these services, the Metropolitan Police Force receives an additional Exchequer
grant.
POLICE IN The Royal Ulster Constabulary comes under the direction of the Inspector
NORTHERN General who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs. It undertakes
IRELAND ’ r

LAW AND ORDER
107
the policing of the whole of Northern Ireland, its cost being borne by the
Northern Ireland Exchequer.1
The strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is approximately 3,200. The
Inspector General has, under his immediate command, a deputy inspector
general, a commissioner for the City of Belfast, and a county inspector for each
of the six counties. The area is further sub-divided into districts, each district
coming under a district inspector and each sub-district under a head constable
or a sergeant. Conditions of service and pay follow closely on the lines of the
police service in Great Britain, and the general duties pertaining to the various
ranks are much the same. Although the more senior ranks bear different titles,
the ranks of head constable, sergeant and constable are broadly equivalent to
the three junior ranks in the police service of Great Britain.
The Ulster Special Constabulary, which may assist the Royal Ulster
Constabulary on special occasions, also comes under the direction of the
Inspector General. In the main, this force is a part-time body of some 8,700
part-time members, with a small nucleus (90) of full-time personnel for
organisation and training purposes.
1 An advisory board, under the chairmanship of Lord Hunt, is to advise the Northern
Ireland Government on the structure, organisation and recruitment of both the Royal
Ulster Constabulary and the Ulster Special Constabulary, and on the functions they
are required to perform.
4 DEFENCE
The foundation of Britain’s security now, as always, lies in the maintenance
of peace in Europe. Accordingly, the first priority of British defence policy is
to continue to give the fullest possible support to the North Atlantic Alliance,
and Britain’s defence effort is being concentrated mainly in Europe and the
North Atlantic area. The withdrawal of British forces from Malaysia and
Singapore is being accelerated for completion by the end of 1971, and
British troops will be withdrawn from the Persian Gulf by the same date.
Thereafter Britain will no longer maintain any special capability for use
outside Europe, but will still have a general capability, based in Europe,
which can be deployed overseas as—in the judgment of the British Govern-
ment—circumstances demand, and which could support United Nations
operations as necessary.
Britain still has, however, a great interest in the stability of the Middle and
Far East, and continues as a member of the Central Treaty Organisation
(CENTO) and the South East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO). Also,
Britain is ultimately responsible for the defence and internal security of her
remaining dependencies. More generally, the British Government is anxious
to strengthen the peace-keeping capacities of the United Nations and to make
progress in arms control and disarmament. Britain has signed, and strongly
supports, the 1963 treaty banning nuclear tests and the treaty agreed in 1967
governing the peaceful uses of outer space. After taking a leading part in the
preparatory negotiations, Britain became one of the three depositary powers
of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of 1968 and was the first nuclear
weapon power to ratify the treaty.
Information about defence policy and the armed forces is provided by the
Government in an annual Statement on the Defence Estimates (Cmnd. 3927 in
1969) usually published in February.
The highest possible proportions of Britain’s regular forces are kept in
effective combat units. The Army has had more recent and varied fighting
experience than any other European army; the Royal Air Force, equipped
with the most modern combat aircraft, is second to none in Europe; while
the size and striking power of the Royal Navy is second only to that of the
United States within the North Atlantic Alliance.
The Government is concerned to keep defence costs within the country s
resources, and since the 1965-66 estimates were published there have been
successive reductions in the annual defence estimates as calculated at constant
prices. The defence estimates for 1969-70 totalled £2,266 million, which
was expected to amount to under 6 per cent of the gross national product.
PLANNING AND CONTROL
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Prime Minister and
the Cabinet, who are responsible to Parliament. Defence problems and their
implications for foreign and economic policy are dealt with on the Cabinet s
behalf by the Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy, under the chair¬
manship of the Prime Minister.

The formulation of defence policy is the responsibility of the Secretary of
State for Defence. The two Ministers of Defence and the three Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State (see p. 48), together with the Chief of the Defence
Staff, the Chiefs of Staff, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, the Chief
Adviser (Projects and Research) and the Chief Adviser (Personnel and
Logistics), sit on the Defence Council under the chairmanship of the Secretary
of State. The Defence Council deals mainly with major defence policy. The
Chiefs of Staff Committee, comprising the Chief of Defence Staff as chairman
and the Chiefs of Staff of the three Services, is responsible for giving pro¬
fessional advice on strategy and operations and the military implications of
defence policy.
The emphasis in defence organisation has been, in recent years, on a greater
degree of integration between the three Services and on overall, functional
planning of the defence effort as a whole. To this end, the three former Service
departments were amalgamated under a unified Ministry of Defence.
The day-to-day management of the three Services is the responsibility of the
Admiralty, Army and Air Force Boards of the Defence Council. The Service
Boards are chaired by the single-Service Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of
State, although the Secretary of State is formally chairman of each Board and
the functional Ministers are members and take the chair on occasions.
The Royal Navy has four main arms. These are: the Naval General Service,
which mans and maintains the surface fleet; the Fleet Air Arm; the Submarine
Service; and the Royal Marines, who provide a seaborne and airborne land
striking-force.
The Army is organised into some 30 arms and services which include the
Household Cavalry, the Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal Regiment of
Artillery, the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals, the five
regiments of Foot Guards, the Infantry of the Line (being grouped into
divisions), the Army Air Corps, the Royal Corps of Transport, the Royal
Army Medical Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and the Royal
Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.
The Royal Air Force is organised in commands, on a functional basis at
home and on a geographical basis overseas.
The three women’s services, the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the
Women’s Royal Army Corps (WRAC) and the Women’s Royal Air Force
(W RAF), are integral parts of the Navy, Army and Air Force respectively.
Servicewomen serve alongside servicemen in Britain and overseas. Nursing
services are provided by Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval Nursing Service,
Queen Alexandra s Royal Army Nursing Corps and Princess Mary’s Royal
Air Force Nursing Service.
Operational control of the Forces in the Persian Gulf and Far East is exercised
through Unified Command Headquarters in Bahrain (see p. 113) and
Singapore respectively by a single commander, who may belong to any one of
the three Services; he is supported by an inter-Service staff co-ordinated by a
Chief of Staff.
The home and overseas commands of the Services are set out below.
Under a phased programme shore commands are being reorganised under a
single Commander-in-Chief in Portsmouth. Sea command has been
reorganised to bring under a single major operational commander, the

Entrants to the non-commissioned ranks of the three Services are given basic
training, and further training is given during the course of their careers.
Young servicemen have the opportunity to read for the General Certificate of
Education ‘O’ level (see p. 153). Trade and technical training, though
primarily designed for Service purposes, leads in many cases to nationally
recognised qualifications; completion of many Service trade or technical
courses followed by experience is recognised by trade unions as a qualification
for membership by men who have left the Services.
Commissions may be granted for short, medium or long terms. Promotion
from the non-commissioned ranks is possible in all three Services. In the
Royal Navy, the normal method of entry is through cadetships in the Britannia
Royal Naval College, Dartmouth; in the Army through cadetships in the
Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. This is followed by specialist training
which may include degree courses. In the RAF entry is through cadetships
in the RAF College, Cranwell, or civilian universities. There is special

provision in all three Services for the entry of men with appropriate qualifica¬
tions, including doctors, dentists and other graduates.
Selected officers of all three Services who have had previous staff training or
have been to the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich (London), the Army
Staff College at Camberley (Surrey), or the Royal Air Force Staff Colleges
(due to be merged in 1970) at Bracknell (Berkshire) or Andover (Hampshire)
go to the Joint Services Staff College at Chesham (Buckinghamshire), where
particular attention is paid to the inter-Service aspect of staff work. A few
specially selected and more senior officers from the Services, the Civil
Service, and from other Commonwealth and allied European countries are
sent to the Imperial Defence College in London. Considerable training is
done through Joint-Service and inter-allied exercises, on which increasing
emphasis is being placed.
In the defence estimates for 1969-70 £22 million is allocated to Reserve and
Auxiliary Formations.
The Regular Reserve consists of various categories of former full-time officers
and ratings liable to recall in emergency. The Voluntary Reserves comprise
the Royal Naval Reserve (with its associated women’s reserve) and the Royal
Marines Reserve, and carry out part-time training.
The Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, a civilian organisation composed of
men and women volunteers, is responsible in time of war for minewatching
duties around the coast and the waterways, and other duties.
Men who have completed the Colour portion of their service with the Regular
Army are retained on the Regular Reserve to complete a total engagement of
seven or 12 years, according to their initial commitment; they are liable to
recall to the Colours. Thereafter they are transferred to the Long Term
Reserve (LTR) where they remain until the age of 45 and are liable to recall
in an emergency.
The Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (T and AVR) consists of
independent and sponsored units. Independent units are recruited from a
limited area as existing formations. Sponsored units consist of specialists and
have to be recruited on a nation-wide basis. These units are divided, for
administration purposes, into Group A which have a liability for call-out
when war-like operations are in preparation or in progress; and Group B
which consists of miscellaneous units (for example, University Officer
Training Corps) with various liabilities.
The Regular Reserve consists of former full-time officers and airmen, of whom
a few are detailed for specific tasks in emergency and the remainder have a
statutory liability for recall. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force, consisting of
three maritime headquarter units controlled by Coastal Command (see p. 110),
and the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which includes the 16 University
Air Squadrons, are liable for part-time training and for recall in an
emergency.
The Government decided in 1968 to put civil defence arrangements on a care
and maintenance basis. The physical assets of civil defence organisations are
being preserved so far as is practicable, and training and planning continues
at the minimum level required to maintain knowledge and techniques and to

enable more active preparations to be resumed if this should appear to be
necessary. Total annual expenditure on home defence by civil departments—
which is additional to that carried on the Defence Budget—was reduced to
about £13 million in 1968-69, and is intended to fall in subsequent years to
about £7 million.
The arrangements being maintained include an emergency system for
decentralised governmental control and communications, and the United
Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation, including the Royal
Observer Corps, which would provide public warning of an attack, of the
location and power of nuclear explosions, and of the distribution and level of
radioactive fall-out.
NATO COMMITMENT
From November 1968 the following British forces were assigned or ear¬
marked for assignment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).
Virtually the whole of the Royal Navy is earmarked for assignment.
The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) is assigned; 3 Division, which
includes 16 Parachute Brigade (two battalions), 22 Special Air Service Regi¬
ment, a logistic battalion, and an armoured reconnaissance squadron, are
earmarked for assignment.
Germany: RAF Germany is assigned. Britain: V-Bomber Force is assigned;
Canberra and Victor reconnaissance aircraft are earmarked; air defence
aircraft of Strike Command are assigned; long-range maritime reconnaissance
aircraft are earmarked; the short-range and close-support aircraft of No. 38
Group are earmarked. Malta: Canberra reconnaissance aircraft are assigned;
long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft are earmarked.
DEPLOYMENT
In January 1969 British and locally enlisted uniformed troops were deployed
roughly as follows:
Britain, 246,000; European continent, 59,600 (nearly all in Germany);
Mediterranean and Near East, 17,500; Middle and Far East, 51,500
(including Gurkhas); and elsewhere, 37,000 (mostly Royal Navy at sea).
The deployment of forces is summarised below.
The Western Fleet operates in European sea areas; frigates, submarines and
coastal minesweepers carry out training, trials and fishery protection, and
ships of all classes spend periods at home for refitting. All ships at home have
NATO commitments in the Channel, Eastern Atlantic, and Mediterranean;
a frigate is assigned to the standing Naval Force Atlantic.
Stationed in Britain are Army Strategic Command, certain other field
headquarters and combat units, and training and logistic units.
The Royal Air Force in Britain consists of units of Strike Command,
comprising aircraft of the former Bomber and Fighter Commands, strategic
reconnaissance and tanker aircraft; Air Support Command, with strategic and
tactical transport aircraft, and ground-attack reconnaissance forces whose

main role is to support the Army. Long-range maritime reconnaissance
aircraft for protection of sea routes, in conjunction with the Royal Navy, will
come within the Maritime Group of Strike Command. There are also units of
the Royal Air Force Regiment. The Ballistic Missile Early Warning Station at
Fylingdales Moor, Yorkshire, built under an Anglo-American agreement of
i960, is part of a chain of such stations starting in Alaska and Greenland.
Britain has stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany an army corps of
three divisions—BAOR—with associated troops and a tactical air force
including light bomber, reconnaissance and air-defence squadrons; also
fighter reconnaissance aircraft and a brigade in Berlin (which the NATO
powers have agreed to treat as part of the Atlantic Treaty area): giving a total
force of some 60,000. BAOR equipment includes, as tactical nuclear weapons,
the Honest John free-flight missile and the 8-inch howitzer. A brigade of
BAOR, together with a heavy air-defence regiment, is stationed in Britain.
In the Mediterranean Britain’s maritime presence generally includes an
aircraft carrier, a commando ship or an assault ship, and two frigates which are
earmarked for assignment to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR);
a guided-missile destroyer will be added in 1970.
Britain contributes towards the defence infra-structure of the Central
Treaty Organisation (CENTO) area and keeps an RAF bomber force in
Cyprus for the defence of the region. Britain also supplies at its own expense
over 1,000 men for the United Nations Force in Cyprus (about 30 per cent
of the total). There are also small garrisons in Malta, Gibraltar and Libya.
British Land Forces in the Persian Gulf consist of infantry supported by
artillery, armoured cars and engineers stationed at Bahrain and Sharjah. RAF
forces also based at Bahrain and Sharjah include ground-attack and fighter
reconnaissance, tactical transport and long-range maritime reconnaissance
aircraft. Royal Navy frigates and coastal minesweepers, based at Bahrain,
operate in the Gulf.
In the South East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) area, Britain provides
training facilities and, in particular, has built an airfield in Thailand with the
help of Australia and New Zealand.
Naval forces in Far East Command contain most types of warships and fleet
auxiliaries, including a commando ship, an assault ship, submarines, and
frigates. These forces operate in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and undertake
patrol duties in the Mozambique channel. Ships of the Royal Australian and
Royal New Zealand Navies operate with the Far Eastern Fleet.
Britain has retained in the Far East only army units required to assist in the
defence of Malaysia and Singapore, and of British dependencies, and for
commitments to SEATO. The reduction in the Brigade of Gurkhas has
continued towards the level of 6,000 men to be reached by 1971.
A small garrison of Gurkhas is stationed in Brunei. A substantial garrison,
including a Gurkha brigade, remains in Hong Kong.
The Far East Air Force, made up of units of the RAF and Royal Australian
and Royal New Zealand Air Forces, includes fighter, light-bomber, ground-
attack, tactical sea and long-range maritime reconnaissance, support heli¬
copter, short- and medium-range transport and surface-to-air missile
squadrons as well as squadrons of the Royal Air Force Regiment.

Two frigates, normally carrying a detachment of Royal Marines, operate in
the Caribbean. A small Royal Marine force and a hovercraft unit are main¬
tained in the Falkland Islands, and the Navy’s ice-patrol ship, HMS
Endurance, operates there seasonally.
A small Army garrison remains in British Honduras.
COMBAT FORCES
Combat forces can be divided into six major groups, according to their
functions and corresponding equipment, as described below.
During 1969, the Royal Navy took over from the V-bombers of the Royal
Air Force the entire task of making the British contribution to the Western
nuclear strategic deterrent. Three Polaris submarines, HMS Resolution,
HMS Repulse and HMS Renown are now operational, and a fourth, HMS
Revenge, has been accepted into service. Transferred to a tactical role the
Vulcan aircraft remain committed to NATO.
Each Polaris submarine carries 16 missiles with nuclear warheads and a
range of some 2,500 nautical miles. The submarines’ nuclear-powered engines
enable them to cruise, submerged, for long periods. The Polaris and other
submarines are supported by the Clyde submarine base completed in 1968.
Britain also provides facilities for a depot ship for United States Polaris
submarines at Holy Loch on the Firth of Clyde.
Britain has assigned its strategic nuclear forces to NATO. The British
Government considers it essential to associate the non-nuclear members of
NATO closely with the nuclear policy of the Alliance, and thus to strengthen
the nuclear interdependence of its members, and Britain has played an active
part in discussions for this purpose.
The cost of nuclear strategic forces for 1969-70 is estimated at £5 million
for the bomber force, and £55 million for the Polaris fleet.
The European theatre ground forces consist of the BAOR and an independent
brigade in Berlin. Their cost in 1969-70 is estimated at ^203 million. (RAF
Germany, is included among RAF Combat Forces, see p. 116.)
Armoured regiments are being equipped with the Chieftain main battle tank,
which incorporates many new features in protection and mobility, in succes¬
sion to the Centurion. Two armoured car regiments are equipped with the
Vigilant anti-tank guided weapon mounted on the Ferret scout car. Swingfire,
a long-range, guided, anti-tank weapon, was introduced into certain units
during 1969. The field artillery has been re-equipped. New weapons include
the British Abbot self-propelled 105 mm. gun with good cross-country
mobility, range, fire power and protection for its crew, and the American self-
propelled 155 mm. Mi09 and 175 mm. Mi07 guns. Missile regiments
equipped with the Honest John free-flight rocket and the 8-inch howitzer
provide surface-to-surface tactical nuclear support for the ground forces.
Infantry battalions have tracked armoured personnel carriers. Some armoured
personnel carriers in each battalion are being converted to fire the 81 mm.
mortar or the Wombat anti-tank gun, and some are being fitted with a mount
for the general purpose machine gun. The infantry have also been provided
with Carl Gustav anti-tank weapons, and with improved chemical and
nuclear defensive equipment. Brigade headquarters are equipped with Scout
helicopters, used mainly for reconnaissance. A semi-automatic multi-channel

trunk system for communications in the combat area came into operation
during 1968.
The naval general purpose combat elements of the Fleet1 comprise the
following: amphibious forces; aircraft carriers and squadrons; submarines
(excluding the Polaris force); cruisers, destroyers and frigates; mine counter¬
measures forces; and support and other ships. Any of these forces can be sent
to other theatres if needed in an emergency, either as reinforcements or to
carry out joint operations with the Army and Royal Air Force. Their cost in
1969-70 is estimated at £280 million.
The aircraft carriers HMS Eagle and HMS Hermes are to be in commission
during 1969. The carriers are equipped with the angled flight deck, the steam
catapult, the automatic aircraft positioning device for the catapult and the
projector sight (all British inventions). After refit and conversion HMS Ark
Royal will carry Phantom aircraft early in 1970. The main strike and fighter
strength is at present provided by Buccaneer, Sea Vixen and Phantom aircraft.
The Buccaneer Mark 2 is a long-range low-level strike aircraft with an
advanced weapon system. The Sea Vixen Mark 2 carries air-to-air missiles
Firestreak and Red Top for use against high-flying and supersonic targets.
An advanced air defence aircraft with true supersonic performance, the
Phantom, is equipped with both Sparrow and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.
The carrier force will be phased out when the withdrawal of British forces
from Singapore and Malaysia is complete.
Amphibious forces are provided by the commando ships HMS Albion and
HMS Bulwark, the assault ships HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid, and the
Royal Marine Commandos. Commando ships are equipped with landing
craft, Wessex Mark 5 helicopters, which can be armed with the SS 11 anti¬
tank guided missile, and Sioux helicopters. Of the three Tiger class cruisers
HMS Blake has been converted to carry Sea King helicopters and HMS Tiger
is being converted; it is planned to convert HMS Lion later. The cruisers have
fully automatic armament and the most modern control equipment. Destroyers
and frigates, the largest part of the Fleet, give the main surface protection
against enemy submarines and surface and air forces. Work on three new
classes of surface ship—cruisers, destroyers and frigates—is going ahead and
the first Type 82 guided-missile destroyer, HMS Bristol, launched in July
1969, will introduce into the Fleet in 1971 the new advanced area anti-aircraft
and anti-missile weapon system Sea Dart, as well as the anti-submarine
weapon, Ikara, specially developed to counter fast submarines.
The six County class guided-missile destroyers are to be joined by two more
in 1969. Leander class frigates have advanced anti-submarine equipment
including variable-depth and medium-range sonar and mortars; both they
and Tribal class frigates can carry Wasp anti-submarine helicopters.
All ships of frigate size and above are to carry helicopters. The Whirlwind
Mark 9 helicopter carries out search and rescue duties, and the Wessex Mark 1
and Wasp are for anti-submarine tasks. The yet more advanced Wessex
Mark 3, with a new anti-submarine system, is now in service, to be followed
in 1969 by the introduction of Sea King, a British-built and British-engined
1 In 1969 the following ships of the Fleet were operational, preparing for service, or
engaged on trials and training: 2 aircraft carriers, 2 commando ships, 2 assault ships,
1 cruiser, 6 guided-missile destroyers, 2 other destroyers, 54 frigates, 29 submarines,
45 minesweepers, and an ice-patrol ship. In addition the following were in reserve or
undergoing long refit, conversion, etc.: 1 aircraft carrier, 2 cruisers, 11 destroyers,
14 frigates, 12 submarines and 20 minesweepers.

version of the Sikorsky SH-3D, of still greater capacity. Naval helicopters, in
addition to their anti-submarine function, will be able, if required, to carry
out reconnaissance and light surface attack with air-to-sui face missiles.
The submarine has been revolutionised by nuclear power propulsion,
which enables it to operate submerged for prolonged periods at sustained high
speed. Three nuclear-powered Fleet submarines are now in service—
Dreadnought, Valiant and War spite. Two more, Churchill and Conqueror have
been launched; three more are under construction.
Support-ships replenish the Fleet and offer it maintenance and repair
facilities. They include submarine depot ships (equipped with workshops
and plant to support a squadron or more of submarines), a heavy repair and
maintenance ship and mine counter-measures support ships, all manned by
naval personnel. Ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service provide afloat
logistic support such as fuel, food, ammunition, stores and spare gear. These
ships fly the Blue Ensign and are manned by Merchant Navy officers and
seamen. The dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham and Rosyth
provide the Navy with major supplies and repair facilities in Britain.
Army general purpose combat forces consist of the ground forces deployed
outside Europe; the Army Strategic Command; and other front line units in
Britain. Their cost in 1969-70 is estimated at £154 million.
Army Strategic Command consists of most of the field force units stationed
in Britain and their supporting services. These units are capable of varying
operations and are available to NATO for use in Europe.
A general-purpose machine-gun has been introduced to replace the Vickers
and Bren in infantry battalions, which have also all been issued with the
81 mm. mortar. Some battalions have the Conbat, an improved version of the
Mobat heavy anti-tank weapon, while others are equipped with Vigilant anti¬
tank missiles. Other equipment includes night-fighting devices, engineer
equipment for crossing obstacles, and the Stalwart high-mobility load-carrier.
Field Artillery Computer Equipment (FACE) is being issued to units in
Britain. A new British air-portable bridge came into service early in 1969.
The Army’s force of helicopters is being increased. These can be used for
reconnaissance, to carry patrols, casualties and urgently needed stores, and
as airborne command posts. Armed helicopters have been used successfully
in operations. The Army also has Canadian Beaver light aircraft for liaison
purposes. The Landing Ship Tank (LST), for support operations, has been
superseded by the faster and more advanced Landing Ship Logistic (LSL).
An Army Hovercraft Unit has been formed, of four Westland hovercraft
modified for military use.
The Royal Air Force combat forces comprise all the front-line formations
and units, including the medium bomber force (when it is transferred to a
tactical role) but excluding transport and tanker forces. They fall into five
main categories: air defence, ground attack and fighter reconnaissance;
medium and light bomber and tactical reconnaissance; maritime recon¬
naissance; headquarters; and general support, including the Royal Air Force
Regiment, which is responsible for protecting bases. Their cost in 1969-70
is estimated at £367 million.
Fighter squadrons are equipped with Lightning Mark 3 and Mark 6 supersonic
aircraft, which carry Firestreak or Red Top air-to-air missiles and can be
refuelled in flight. Air defence is also the function of the Bloodhound Mark 2

surface-to-air missile. Air defence squadrons are controlled by ground radars.
New military radars and centralised data-handling equipment are being
installed in Britain as part of the integrated plans for air defence and national
air traffic control. The Ballistic Missile Early Warning Station at Fylingdales
(see p. 113) would provide warning of a missile attack on Britain and also
detects, tracks and identifies objects in orbit.
The Royal Air Force is being re-equipped with Phantom, Buccaneer and
Harrier aircraft. A first Phantom squadron became operational in May 1969,
replacing the Hunter in ground attack and army support roles. A squadron
for maritime air defence will be formed by the end of 1969. Transferred from
the Royal Navy, Buccaneer aircraft formed an RAF maritime strike squadron
during 1969; these will be supplemented by an additional order. On entering
squadron service in 1969 the Harrier became the first vertical take-off and
landing aircraft in the world to do so. A further squadron was ordered in
November 1968. It is planned that a strike version of the Anglo-French
Jaguar light-strike and trainer aircraft should release further Phantoms from
this role to replace the Lightning fighters. Overseas fighter-reconnaissance
squadrons are equipped with Hunter FR10 aircraft.
Reconnaissance forces comprise the Canberra PR7 and Victor Mark 2
aircraft. Maritime-reconnaissance squadrons are equipped with modernised
Shackleton Mark 2 and Mark 3 aircraft. In addition to their reconnaissance
functions they can also be used for attacking surface ships and submarines,
and as transport aircraft. The Shackleton Mark 2 is being replaced by the
Nimrod (the first all-turbo-jet maritime reconnaissance aircraft); a first
squadron will be operational early in 1970.
Air mobility forces are made up of the strategic and tactical transport forces,
tanker aircraft to refuel combat aircraft in flight, support helicopters and
communications aircraft. Their cost in 1969-70 is estimated at £98 million
(which includes £3 million on civil charter).
The strategic transport force includes Comet 4C, Britannia, Belfast and VC 10
aircraft. Tactical transport is supplied by United States Hercules aircraft and
the Argosy. The short-range tactical transports are the Pioneer and Twin
Pioneer aircraft, the Belvedere, Whirlwind and Wessex helicopters, and the
Andover Mark 1 short-range military freighter. The Victor tanker aircraft can
refuel two or three aircraft at the same time. The Basset (Beagle B 206) and
Andover C Mark 2 aircraft are used for communications.
WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT
Responsibility for the supply of aircraft, guided weapons, nuclear weapons
and certain radar and other electronic equipment lies with the Ministry of
Technology. The Ministry of Defence is responsible for the procurement of
other weapons, stores and equipment. Total expenditure on research and
development for 1969-70 was estimated at ^236 million.
A substantial part of the equipment used by the Services is developed and
produced in Britain, some by private industry on a contract basis and some
by the Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal Dockyards and other establish¬
ments operated by the Ministry of Technology and the Ministry of Defence.

(see p. 200) under contract with the Ministry of Technology. In some cases—
particularly where development costs would be disproportionately high—
aircraft, weapons and other equipment are bought from overseas. Converse y,
British defence equipment has been adopted by allied and friendly nations :
for example, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany Denmark
and Sweden are using the British 105 mm. tank gun, and British early warning
radar equipment has been adopted by several countries and by N A i U.
Britain also undertakes manufacture in collaboration with other countries.
Projects in progress are: with France, the Jaguar light strike and trainer
aircraft the Martel stand-off air-to-surface guided missile, an air-portable
helicopter (SA 330) for the RAF, and a light helicopter (SA 34°) ^d a utility
helicopter (WG 13), each for all three Services; with Canada and the Federal
Republic of Germany, a reconnaissance drone; with the Federal Republic of
Germany, artillery and electronics projects; and with Australia the ,0^"
range anti-submarine Ikara system; and with Australia, Canada and e
United States, the Mallard tactical trunk communication system tor the 1970s.
Britain has signed an agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany
and Italy to continue joint development of an advanced multi-iole combat
aircraft (MRCA) for the 1970s. . , c initial
Trials have been carried out successfully for the United States. Imtia
Defence Satellite Communication System (IDSCS) in which Britain is
participating. Britain will acquire an operational satellite communication
system Sky net, when the first of two satellites is launched at the end of 1969.
Research and development are undertaken at a number of the Ministry of
Technology’s specialised establishments. Civil work is also done in these
establishments, and the progress of military research often contributes to related
civil fields.
Much experimental work has been carried out by the Navy and the Atomic
Energy Authority on nuclear-propelled submarines (see p. 116), and a nuclear
submarine power unit prototype is in operation at Dounreay (see p. 201). T e
Royal Naval College, Greenwich, has a low-power training reactor whic
provides facilities for basic education in nuclear engineering and research.
Guided missiles are tested at the Ministry of Technology’s research establish¬
ments and at the Woomera range set up in Australia under the Joint United
Kingdom/Australia Guided Weapon Project. Service firing trials of air-to-air
and surface-to-air missiles are carried out at Aberporth and at the Army
gunnery range in Anglesey; a range for testing surface-to-surface missiles has
been set up on South Uist in the Hebrides.
Research into nuclear weapons began in Britain during the second world war
It was continued, as an allied project, in the United States where the firs
atomic bomb was produced. After a subsequent period of independent
development in both countries, collaboration was resumed in 1955, and in
19C8 an agreement was concluded which made possible the exchange o
information on the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons This was
supplemented by a further agreement in May 1959, which contained provisions
to enable Britain to buy from the United States component parts of atomic
weapons and weapons systems other than actual warheads, and to make
possible the exchange of nuclear materials between the two countries.
Britain’s nuclear programme is based on an agreement of 19 3 ^ ^
Britain buys from the United States a number of Mure missiles, to be fitted
with British nuclear warheads, for submarines to be built largely by Bnta. .

In addition to research and development, there is support of a general nature
supplied in Britain to the Services as a whole. The major items include:
general training; the overhead costs of naval dockyards, ordnance factories
and repair, maintenance and storage units; Ministry of Defence and local
administrative services in Britain; and military pensions. The total estimated
cost for 1969-70 is £846 million.
USE OF MANPOWER AND RESOURCES
Long-term reductions in defence manpower of some 75,000 uniformed
personnel and 80,000 civilians were originally envisaged in July 1967, to be
completed by the mid-1970s. These reductions are being accelerated, and it
is now expected that the reduction in uniformed personnel will be somewhat
greater and that it will be achieved during the financial year 1973-74. The
civilian reduction will also be larger and completed earlier than previously
forecast. Tables 7 and 8 below and diagrams on p. 120 show the actual
strengths of the three Services for 1st April 1969 and those estimated for 1st
April 1970, the allocation of expenditure allowed for in the Defence Estimates
for 1969-70 between government departments, and the estimated use of this
expenditure and of both military and civilian personnel according to defence
functions irrespective of departmental and Service divisions.

5 SOCIAL WELFARE
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is responsible, through either central or local govern¬
ment, for a range of services covering family allowances, social insurance, help
for war victims, financial assistance when required, health and welfare services
for mothers and young children, the sick, mentally disordered, elderly and
handicapped and for families in difficulties of various kinds, and the care of
children lacking a normal home fife (all described in this chapter); and for
education (see Chapter 6) and housing (see Chapter 7). Public authorities in
the United Kingdom are spending nearly £8,700 million a year on this range
of services; that is, over £157 a year per head of the population.
Voluntary organisations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of
nearly all the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics,
dispensaries, and social and recreational, clubs before these were provided by
the State. They made themselves responsible for the welfare of the very young
and the very old, the homeless and the handicapped. Gradually the State
accepted the primary responsibility for the major services, supplementing the
voluntary services and developing a comprehensive structure that ensured a
minimum standard of living and well-being for all citizens.
State and voluntary social services are now complementary and co-operative.
The State may work through voluntary agencies specially adapted to serve
particular needs and ensures that necessary standards are maintained. The
officers of central and local government, in carrying out their duties, co-operate
with the workers of many voluntary social service societies, while the resi¬
dential provision made by the State and by local authorities for the care of the
chronic sick and the aged is supplemented by voluntary homes of various
types. Most of the sick and elderly receive State pensions or benefits.
The Charity Commission, a government department, gives free advice to
trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their purposes or facilitate
their administration when necessary; it maintains central and local registers
of charities which are open to public inspection; and it works to promote
co-operation between charities and State services.
Voluntary The number of voluntary societies and institutions in Britain runs into
Organisations thousands; they range from national organisations to small individual local
groups. Most organisations, however, are members of larger associations or
are represented on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees.
Some are chiefly concerned with giving personal service, others in the forma¬
tion of public opinion and exchange of information. A number are concerned
with giving help to immigrants. In recent years there has been an increase in
organised service by young people.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems and misfortunes
include the voluntary family casework agencies, of which the Family Welfare
Association, working mainly in London, is the best known; marriage guidance
centres affiliated to the National Marriage Guidance Council; the Family
Service Units; and the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her
Child.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by the British
Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade and the
Leagues of Hospital Friends, but a number of societies exist to help people
with particular disabilities, such as the Royal National Institute for the
Blind, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, the National Association for
Mental Health, the constituent members of the Central Council for the
Disabled and their Scottish equivalents.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specificall} religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the
Committee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of
England Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work,
the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian
Association, the Society of Friends, the Crusade of Rescue, the Society of
St. Vincent de Paul, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Jewish
Welfare Board. J
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women s Royal
Voluntary Service, which gives help in every kind of practical difficulty, brings
‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and old people, piovides flatlets and
residential clubs for the elderly, helps with family problems and assists in
hospitals and clinics, as well as doing relief work in emergencies.
A central link between voluntary organisations and official bodies concerned
with social welfare is provided in England and V ales by the National Council
of Social Service, which brings together most of the principal voluntary
agencies for consultation and joint action, either as a whole or in groups of
those concerned with particular aspects, such as youth work or old people’s
welfare. There are also the Scottish Council of Social Service ana the Northern
Ireland Council of Social Service, which perform similar functions. The
Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, of which there are now nearly 500 in Britain,
are steadily increasing in number. The primary role of the bureaux is to give
explanation and advice to the citizen who is in doubt about his rights or who
does not know about the State or voluntary services which could help him.
While the voluntary worker giving full-time or part-time service has done
pioneer work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an
essential part, social services of all kinds increasingly depend for their opera¬
tion chiefly on professional social workers, that is, full-time salaried workers
trained in the principles and methods of social work. Most proxessional social
workers are employed by local authorities (for child care, welfare, mental
welfare and probation work), by hospitals (for medical and psychiatiic work),
or by voluntary organisations. Training for many forms of social work
consists of a basic university degree, diploma or certificate course in social
science followed by a university course in applied social studies or specialised
training for a particular service. The latter is sometimes organised by the
profession concerned. The Council for Training in Social Work also
promotes the training, in the first instance, of workers in the local authority
health and welfare services and similar services run by voluntary bodies.
Full-time courses lasting two years, which may be taken at colleges of further
education, lead to the Council’s Certificate in Social Work. Advice on social
work training is given by the Social Work Advisory Service.
A four-year urban programme providing for Government-aided local
authority expenditure of some £20-£2$ million was launched at the end of
1968 to assist areas of special social need, in particular to relieve problems
SOCIAL WELFARE
123
resulting from overcrowding, inadequate housing and schools, and other
forms of deprivation. Projects being undertaken include help for play-groups
and the provision and improvement of nursery schools and classes, day
nurseries, playgrounds, language classes for immigrants, in-service training
courses for teachers, children’s homes, and family advice centres.
An experiment in community development has also been started by
the Government. This will involve bringing together those services, both
statutory and voluntary, which are concerned with reheving various forms of
social handicap and encouraging the resources of self-help within the
community.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National insurance, industrial injuries insurance, family allowances and
supplementary benefits together with (in a special category) war pensions
constitute a comprehensive system of social security in the United Kingdom.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers these services
in Great Britain; within the Department the Supplementary Benefits Commis¬
sion is responsible for the system of supplementary benefits. In Northern
Ireland the first four of these schemes are administered by the Ministry of
Health and Social Services which contains the Supplementary Benefits
Commission for Northern Ireland. Pensions and welfare services for war
pensioners and their dependants are the responsibility of the Department of
Health and Social Security throughout the United Kingdom. Appeals
relating to claims for insurance benefits, family allowances, war pensions, or
for supplementary benefit, are decided by independent authorities.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain
can be traced back for several centuries (the Poor Relief Act of 1601 may be
regarded as specially important in England and Wales), the modern system of
comprehensive provision is a creation of the twentieth century. Non-contri¬
butory old age pensions were introduced in 1908, and the first contributory
pensions for old people, widows and orphans in 1926. A contributory National
Plealth Insurance Scheme was begun in 1912, and in the same year a scheme
of unemployment insurance was introduced which in 1920 was extended to
cover the great majority of employees. By the beginning of the second world
war social security provision in Britain was among the best in the world, but
lacked co-ordination because of its piecemeal development, and not everyone
came within its scope. In the immediate post-war years a series of Acts
introduced the present comprehensive system, which became fully operative
on 5th July 1948. Statutory provision for the war disabled goes back to the
end of the sixteenth century, but the main lines of the present war pension
provisions were laid down during the first world war.
Family allowances and national insurance benefits or allowances, other than
maternity, unemployment or sickness benefit, are included in the taxable
income on which income tax is assessed. On the other hand, various income
tax reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the
support of dependants. War disablement pensions are not taxable.
leciprocity The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate as a
single system. Reciprocal agreements on industrial injuries, family allowances
and most national insurance benefits are in operation with Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Jersey and Guernsey, Norway,

Sweden, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. Agreements with France, the Republic
of Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, and Turkey
cover industrial injuries and most national insurance benefits. With Australia
and New Zealand there are agreements on family allowances and most
national insurance benefits. An agreement with Cyprus covers all national
insurance benefits. There is a limited agreement with Canada. Northern
Ireland and the Isle of Man are also party to most of these agreements with
other countries.
Family allowances are provided in Great Britain under the Family Allowances
Act 1965 (which consolidated the Acts of 1945-64), and in Northern Ireland
under its own legislation. Over 6-6 million allowances are being paid in Great
Britain to more than 4 million families with two or more children, and in
Northern Ireland to 129,000 families. An allowance is paid for each child other
than the first child below the age limits. The age limits are 15 years for
children who leave school at that age, 16 years for certain incapacitated
children, and 19 for children who remain at school or are apprentices.
The rate of the allowance is 18s. a week for the second child below the age
limits and 20s. a week for the third and each subsequent child. .
Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to benefit
the family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid either to
the mother or to the father. There is no insurance qualification for title to
the allowances, but there are certain residence conditions.
The National Insurance Acts apply, in general, to everyone over minimum
school-leaving age living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in
Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. (The National Insurance Act 1965
consolidated the provisions of the National Insurance Acts 1946-64.)
The national insurance scheme1 provides benefits in specified contingencies
where contribution conditions have been fulfilled. The benefits are paid for
partly by insured persons’ contributions, partly by contributions of employers
in respect of their employees, and partly by a contribution made by the
Exchequer out of general taxation. . _
The original system was based on flat-rate contributions and benehts.
Contributions varied only with the sex and insurance class of the insured
person and benefits were at standard rates. (In both cases lower rates apply to
those under 18.) Two modifications were subsequently introduced to provide
additional earnings-related contributions and benefits, dor retirement,
graduated contributions and pensions were introduced in 1961. For the first
six months of sickness, unemployment or widowhood the National Insurance
Act 1966 introduced a scheme for earnings-related supplements to the flat-rate
benefit and contributions. In November 1969 changes are to be made in the
graduated contribution scheme as a step towards the new fully earnings-related
scheme (see above) and new contributions and benefit rates are to be
introduced. The rates given in the following pages are those in force from
that date.
Contributors under the national insurance scheme are divided into three classes:
Class 1. Employed people. Those who work for an employer under a contract
of service or are paid apprentices—over 23 million.  
1 In a White Paper published in January 1969 (see Bibliography p. 473) the Government
proposed a sctemeof earnings-related social security to replace the present national
insurance scheme.
SOCIAL WELFARE
Contributions
125
Class 2. Self-employed people. Those in business on their own account and
others who are working for gain but do not work under the control of an
employer—about milhon.
Class 3. Non-employed people. All those insured who are not in class 1 or
class 2—about a quarter of a million.
There is a general liability to pay flat-rate contributions according to this
classification but certain people are excepted. These include full-time students,
prisoners, people whose weekly earnings are £4 or less, and most people in
receipt of national insurance benefits. Self-employed and non-employed
persons whose income is about £312 a year can apply for exception. Married
women can choose to pay contributions and receive benefit in their own right
or not to pay flat-rate contributions (if they are working they must pay
graduated contributions) and rely upon their husband’s insurance for
maternity grant, retirement pension (at a lower rate), widow’s benefit, and
death grant. If a married woman works for an employer he must pay his
full share of the flat-rate contributions even if she has chosen not to pay
flat-rate contributions.
Flat-rate contributions are credited to students up to the age of 18,
and to most people in receipt of national insurance benefits. People who are
excepted from liability to pay but are not entitled to credits may pay contribu¬
tions at the non-employed rate if they wish to safeguard entitlement to
retirement pension and widow’s benefit.
An employed person ceases to be liable for national insurance contributions
at the age of 70 for men, 65 for women, or when he retires from regular
employment after reaching minimum pension age (65 for men, 60 for women),
whichever is the earlier. If he does any work as an employed person thereafter,
he must pay an industrial injuries contribution; the employer still has to pay
his full share of the flat-rate contribution.
Flat-rate contributions are normally paid by means of national insurance
stamps bought from a post office and fixed, for each contributor, to a single
contribution card. All three classes pay flat-rate contributions (see Table 9).
The stamps for class 1 contributors also include the employer’s redundancy
contribution (to help to provide for payments in certain circumstances to
employees whose work is terminated, see p. 418) and the selective employ¬
ment tax paid by employers (see p. 365); and for all contributors the National
Health Service contribution (which for convenience is paid with the national
insurance contribution although the two services are separately administered).
It is the employer’s responsibility in the first place to see that the class 1
contributions are paid, but he can deduct the employees’ share from their
wages. The self-employed and non-employed must stamp their own cards.
Flat-rate contributions are usually credited for weeks of unemployment,
sickness or injury, or if widow’s benefit is being paid.
In general graduated contributions are payable by employed people (includ¬
ing married women but not retirement pensioners) aged between 18 and 70
(65 for women) who earn more than £9 a week. The range of graduated
contributions is given in Table 9. Employees whose job provides them with
an occupational pension of at least £3 9s. yd. a year for each year of service
(£2 18s. for women) may be ‘contracted out’ of the graduated pension part
of the scheme. Contracted out employees pay graduated contributions at the
rate of half per cent of that part of their weekly pay lying between £9 and
£18 and 3J per cent on earnings between £18 and £30; their employers pay

Graduated contributions provide a graduated addition to retirement pension
and meet the cost of earnings-related supplements to sickness and unemploy¬
ment benefit and widow’s supplementary allowance. The contributions are
collected through the same machinery as is used to collect Pay-as-you-earn
(deduction at source) income tax.
The scheme provides payments to contributors in the event of unemployment
(if normally working for an employer), sickness (if normally working for an
employer or self-employed), and confinement and the weeks immediately
before and after (for women normally working for an employer or self-
employed and paying national insurance contributions at the full rate).

even if they continue to work; widows receive benefit in the first 26 weeks
after bereavement and subsequently while they have young children or if they
have reached the age of 50 when widowed or when their children have grown
up; and there are two kinds of allowance in respect of orphan children where
a widow’s pension is not payable. The scheme also provides lump-sum cash
grants for two expensive contingencies—the birth of a child and a death.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before
benefit can be paid at all, a minimum number of contributions must actually
have been paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit
cannot be paid unless a specified number of contributions have been paid or
credited over a specified period. There are special rules to help a widow who
does not become entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood or when her
children have grown up, to qualify for sickness or unemployment benefit in
the period before she can have established or re-established herself in insur¬
ance through her own contributions; there are also provisions to help a
divorced woman who was not paying contributions during her marriage.
The basic amount of the majority of flat-rate benefits is -£5 a week which
may be reduced if insufficient contributions have been paid, but is not affected
by other unearned income or the previous level of earnings. Earnings received
while the benefit is in payment, however, may cause its reduction or with¬
drawal: unemployment benefit cannot be paid to a person earning more than
a specified amount from a subsidiary occupation; retirement pensioners under
the age of 70 (65 for women) have their pensions reduced in step with earnings
over certain specified amounts; sickness benefit, though not affected by
continued payment of wages during illness, is not normally payable to a person
doing any actual work. Exceptions to the basic flat rate are the higher rate of
£7 a week payable to widows during the first 26 weeks after bereavement and
the increased retirement pension earned by someone who has continued at
work and paid contributions beyond minimum pension age; and the lower
rate of £3 10s. a week unemployment or sickness benefit payable to married
women who pay contributions. The standard rate of retirement pension for a
woman on her husband’s insurance is £3 2s. a week.
Standard increases of flat-rate benefit are payable for dependants at the rate
of ^3 2s. for an adult (generally a wife), £1 1 is. for the first or only child under
the family allowances age limits; 13s. for the second child and ns. for each
other child over and above any family allowances payable (see p. 124). The
sum payable to a widow for her children is £2 9s. for each child inclusive of
family allowances.
The allowance provided for a child who has lost both parents (one of whom
was insured under the National Insurance Acts) is a guardian’s allowance of
£2 9s. a week. It is paid to the person in whose family the child is, for the
time being, included. For certain fatherless children there is a child’s special
allowance also of £2 9s. a week inclusive of family allowances; this is
payable to a woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled and who
has not remarried, if her former husband dies and she has a child to whose
support he was contributing before he died.
The graduated addition to retirement pension is at the rate of 6d. a week
for each £7 10s. of all graduated contributions paid by a man and for each £9
of such graduated contribution paid by a woman (with, in each case, the
matching amount of graduated contribution coming from the employer). The
earnings-related supplements to flat-rate unemployment and sickness benefit
are one-third of that part of a person’s average weekly earnings between
£<) and £30, but the supplements cannot raise the total benefit, including
128

increases for dependants, beyond 85 per cent of earnings. The supplement is
also paid to widow beneficiaries who have the appropriate record of earnings,
if they become unemployed or sick.
An earnings-related supplement is paid on top of the widow’s allowance to
widows whose husbands were under 70 and had not retired from regular
employment; this supplement is one-third of that part of the husband’s
average weekly earnings between £9 and £30.
The rates of grants are varied: £25 maternity grant is payable for a confine¬
ment and a further -£25 grant for each additional child born at the same
confinement living 12 hours after birth; and £30 death grant on the death of an
adult (less for a child, or for an adult who was within 10 years of minimum
pension age when the scheme started).
In general, national insurance payments are paid as long as the situation
requiring them lasts. However, sickness benefit cannot be paid for more than
a year if fewer than 156 contributions have been paid (possible in three years
for a contributor continuously at work) and unemployment benefit is payable
for a maximum of one year. The supplement to unemployment and sickness
benefit is paid for a maximum of six months starting from the thirteenth day
of unemployment or incapacity for work. Maternity allowance begins 11 weeks
before the expected week of confinement and ends after the sixth week
following the expected week or the actual confinement if this is later.
Similarly, a widowed mother’s allowance at the full rate ceases when her
children are no longer dependent on her, though a mother can continue to
receive £5 a week for herself while she has living with her a son or
daughter under 19. The widow’s pension payable to the childless widow,
provided she is over 50 (and had been married at least three years when her
husband died), or the similar pension normally paid to the widowed mother
who has reached 50 when her widowed mother’s allowance ends, continues
until she has reached minimum pension age and retired, or at most till the age
of 65. If she has satisfied the conditions she then becomes entitled to a
retirement pension.
The industrial injuries insurance scheme, which, in July 1948, replaced the
workmen’s compensation scheme (first introduced by the Workmen’s
Compensation Act of 1897), provides benefits for personal injuries caused by
accidents arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for prescribed
diseases due to the nature of employment. It covers practically everyone in
class 1 of the national insurance scheme and certain others. Like the national
insurance scheme, the industrial injuries scheme is financed partly from
contributions (see Table 9) and partly from taxation. The legal basis of the
scheme is the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965 which
consolidated the 1946 Act and subsequent legislation. Similar cover against
industrial injuries and diseases in Northern Ireland is provided by Northern
Ireland’s legislation.
Injury benefit for an adult is .£7 15s. a week plus £3 2s. for an adult dependant,
j£i ns. for the first or only child under the family allowances age limits, 13s.
for the second child and ns. for each other child in addition to any family
allowance payable. It is paid when the insured person is incapable of work as
a result of an industrial accident or prescribed disease, and payment can
continue for a maximum of 26 weeks beginning on the date of the accident or
development of the disease. A person entitled to sickness benefit who draws

injury benefit instead, also receives any earnings-related supplement (see
p. 126) to which he is entitled.
Disablement benefit may be paid (but not at the same time as injury benefit)
when, as the result of industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a loss
of physical or mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the
disablement as assessed by a medical board; it varies from 8s. for 100 per
cent disablement to ^1 14s. a week for 20 per cent disablement, but for
disablement of less than 20 per cent a gratuity of up to £550 is normally paid.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement, at the weekly rate of ^5; constant
attendance allowance of up to ^3 6s. weekly normally, or a special rate of
£6 12s. a week in exceptionally severe cases; an allowance of £3 a week
for a person entitled to constant attendance allowance at more than the
normal maximum rate whose need for an allowance at such a rate is likely
to be permanent; a special hardship allowance of up to £3 7s. for a person
who is unfit to return to his regular job or work of an equivalent standard;
and hospital treatment allowances which raise the benefit to that for a 100
per cent assessment during hospital treatment for the industrial disability.
Increases of benefit for dependants are payable with unemployability sup¬
plement and hospital treatment allowance.
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit
may be paid to the dependants.
For a widow a pension of £7 a week is payable for the first 26 weeks of
widowhood. In addition she receives any earnings-related supplement (see
p. 128) that would have been paid had she claimed widow’s allowance under
the main national insurance scheme. Thereafter, the widow can receive a
pension of £5 1 is. a week if she was aged 50 at the date of her husband’s death,
or has dependent children or other special needs; otherwise she receives
10s. a week. If she had been living apart from her husband, the pension is
limited to the weekly rate of maintenance he was paying, if less than the rate
otherwise appropriate.
In addition, allowances are paid for children under the family allowances
age limits. For widows, these allowances together with any family allowance
payable amount to fiz 9s. a week for each child. For other beneficiaries,
the rate is £1 ns. each.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be
entitled to pensions (of up to ^ 1 a week), allowances or gratuities.
The Ministry of Social Security Act 1966 provided for a scheme of supple¬
mentary benefits to replace the system which had been administered by the
former National Assistance Board since 1948. The Act established within the
then Ministry of Social Security a Supplementary Benefits Commission
responsible for guiding the scheme and for determining awards of benefit. The
parallel legislation in Northern Ireland made similar provision.
Every person in Great Britain aged 16 or over who is not in full-time work,
attending school or involved in a trade dispute and whose resources are
insufficient to meet his requirements is entitled to a supplementary benefit.
The benefit takes the form of a supplementary pension for those over the
statutory retirement age, and of a supplementary allowance for others. The
benefit is the amount by which a person’s requirements exceed his available
resources, both being defined by rules laid down by the Act. The calculation
of requirements is based on different amounts for single people and family
groups (for blind people there are special higher amounts) with, in each case,
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
an addition for rent. For the old and most other long-term cases a special
addition is made. Available resources include certain income and capital; the
main national insurance and industrial injury benefits, family allowances and
maintenance payments from a husband or the father of the claimant’s children
are taken into account in full but some part of all other resources is disregarded.
There is a right of appeal if the claimant is dissatisfied with the decision of the
Commission.
The payment of a supplementary allowance in the case of an able-bodied
man of working age may be subject to the condition that he registers for
employment at an employment exchange of the Department of Employment
and Productivity; the allowance is then paid at the exchange. Otherwise the
supplementary benefit is paid weekly through a post office.
The Supplementary Benefits Commission also has a duty to influence people
without a settled way of living to lead a more normal life. The Commission
provides temporary accommodation for them in 18 reception centres, four of
which are administered by local authorities on behalf of the Commission.
For men who have been unemployed for long periods and who are receiving
supplementary allowances or are using reception centres, it runs 13 non-
residential and three residential re-establishment centres where they are
given help to fit them again for work.
Pensions and allowances for people disabled or bereaved through war or
service in the Forces since the second world war are paid under Royal
Warrants and other instruments administered by the Department of Health
and Social Security.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier
is £8 8s. a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the degree of
disablement. The latter is assessed by comparing the condition of the person
disabled by service with that of a normal healthy person of the same age and
sex. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic
pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the main ones
being for unemployability (£5 9s. a week), constant attendance (up to £3 6s.
and, exceptionally, £6 12s. a week), comforts (12s. 6d. or £1 5s. a week), and
lowered standard of occupation (up to £3 7s. a week). An additional allowance
°f £2 a week is payable to war pensioners who are receiving constant attend¬
ance allowance at a rate above the normal maximum. An age allowance
(between 7s. 6d. and £1 a week) is payable to disablement pensioners who
are aged 65 or over and whose assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary allowances are
free of income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any
allowances payable under the Family Allowances Acts.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate
of pension for widows of private soldiers is £6 10s. a week, with additional
allowances for their children (a maximum of £2 13s.), and, in certain cases,
an allowance for rent (up to £2 13s. a week). There is an additional allowance
of 15s. a week for widows aged 70 or over. Parents or other relatives who were
dependent on a person wrhose death resulted from sendee in the Forces may
receive pensions if they are in financial need.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service
for war pensioners and war orphans which is available to help any wrho
require advice and assistance. War pensioners have priority for treatment of
their war disablements in National Health Service hospitals subject only to
needs of emergency and other urgent cases.
SOCIAL WELFARE
Many voluntary associations and ex-Service organisations give financial aid
and personal service to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
The Department’s welfare officers work in close co-operation with these
voluntary bodies and with the specialist government welfare agencies.
HEALTH
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of
the years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second half
of the nineteenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental
or public health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal
of refuse and cleaning of streets, and the first half of the twentieth century
tor the development of publicly provided personal health services, as distinct
from environmental services, culminating in the introduction in 1948 of a
comprehensive National Health Service available to every resident. Scientific
discoveries of importance to medicine and health, including the development
of new drugs, and the improved services of the last 60 years, particularly in
maternity and child welfare, school health services and school meals, are
reflected in declining mortality rates (see p. 9) and improved physique. The
infant mortality rate has more than halved since the National Health Service
was inaugurated; this and the maternal death rate are among the lowest in the
world. The health of children has steadily improved and the percentage of
school children considered to be in an ‘unsatisfactory’ condition of health
is now—at 0-38—the lowest recorded. Deaths from such diseases as tubercu¬
losis, poliomyelitis and diphtheria have fallen so markedly that they are no
longer major health problems. Diseases now in the forefront of research
programmes include cancer and diseases of the central nervous system, such
as muscular dystrophy. Efforts are also being made to combat some of the
most prevalent diseases, which include, besides the common cold and
influenza, bronchitis, rheumatism and arthritis, and heart diseases.
PUBLIC HEALTH The Public Health Acts of 1936 and 1961 constitute the present basic public
health code in England and Wales. Local authorities (under the general
direction of the Department of Health and Social Security or the Welsh
Office and the Ministry of Housing and Local Goverment) have extensive
powers for making and administering by-laws on matters of public health.
The local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of county and non¬
county boroughs, London boroughs and the City of London, urban and rural
district councils and, to a limited extent, parish councils.
Public health services in Scotland and in Northern Ireland have developed
on much the same lines as in England and Wales, although they are based on
separate Acts and there is a different allocation of services between the various
types of local authority (working under the direction of the Scottish Home and
Health Department and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and Social
Services). The Public Health (Scotland) Acts 1897-1945 and the Burgh
Police (Scotland) Act 1892 as amended by later Statutes constitute the basic
legislation for Scotland. The local authorities concerned are the councils of
counties and burghs. In Northern Ireland the councils of county and non¬
county boroughs and urban and rural districts are mainly responsible for
administering the Public Health Acts (Northern Ireland) 1878-1966.

Control of
Infectious
Diseases
Pure Food
BRITAIN I97O :AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Medical Officers of Health of local authorities are responsible for
investigating outbreaks of infectious diseases and for disinfection and other
preventive measures. They must also keep records of the incidence of
‘notifiable’—the more dangerous—infectious diseases.
Port health authorities supervise health control at seaports and airports, the
primary object of which is to prevent the introduction of infectious disease into
the country. This health control is undertaken by health authorities using
the services of medical officers, public health inspectors, rodent inspectors
and others.
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by the Food and
Drugs Act 1955 in England and Wales, by the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act
1956 in Scotland, and by the Food and Drugs Act (Northern Ireland) 1958 in
Northern Ireland. .
In England and Wales the question of the composition, adulteration and
description of food are the concern of food and drugs authorities (county,
county borough, London borough and City of London councils and, generally,
the larger borough and urban district councils) and questions of soundness,
purity and hygiene are the concern of all local authorities, except parish
councils. The Department of Health and Social Security and the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are the central departments responsible for
living advice and making regulations. Places where food for sale for human
consumption is prepared, sold or stored must conform to certain hygienic
standards. Authorised officers of the councils may take for analysis or for
bacteriological or other examination samples of any food for sale for human
consumption. Special regulations are in force for certain foods such as milk,
meat and ice-cream. -if
In Scotland the local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils ot
counties and large burghs. ,
In Northern Ireland administration is in the hands of the county and
county borough health authorities, the central department being the Ministry
of Health and Social Services.
Other Public Local authorities are also responsible for the public health aspects of water
Health Duties supply, sewerage and drainage; street paving and housing; ana the abatement
of noise nuisance. They have power to establish smoke-controlled areas to
secure cleaner air, and to arrange with statutory water undertakings for the
addition of fluoride to water supplies to reduce dental decay.
THE NATIONAL
HEALTH SERVICE
The Acts setting up the National Health Service—the National Health
Service Act 1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947, and the
Health Services Act (Northern Ireland) 1948—came into force simultaneously
on <;th July 1948. , . . ^ .
The object of the National Health Service Act 1946 is to promote the
establishment in England and Wales of a comprehensive health service
designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health ot the
people of England and Wales and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment ot
illness, and for that purpose to provide or secure the effective provision of
services’. The service is available to all according to medical need without
regard to any insurance qualification; it was originally free to users but certain
small charges were introduced under subsequent legislation. The removal ot
anxiety about the cost has encouraged people in need of treatment to seek it
where previously they might not have done so.

National insurance contributors are required to pay a separate weekly
national health contribution (see Table 9) but contributors and non-contri¬
butors are entitled to the same full range of services. Visitors from other
countries who come to Britain for treatment are expected to pay for it, but
treatment can be given under the emergency provisions of the National
Health Service to any who fall ill during a visit to Britain.
The services provided by the National Health Service fall into three main
groups1:
1. The hospital and specialist services for which the Secretary of State for
Social Services, the Secretary of State for Wales,2 or the Secretary of State
for Scotland is directly responsible. These are administered through
20 regional hospital boards and over 460 hospital management committees,
or, in the case of teaching hospitals in England and Wales, boards of
governors. The three special psychiatric hospitals in England for people
with criminal propensities are directly administered by the Secretary of
State for Social Services and the similar hospitals in Scotland by the
Secretary of State for Scotland.
2. The general practitioner services consist of the family doctor service, the
dental service, the eye service and the pharmaceutical service, for which
the Health Ministers are indirectly responsible. They are administered by
1 The Minister of Health (whose functions were transferred to the Secretary of State
for Social Services in November 1968) published in July 1968 proposals for unifying
the administration of the medical and related services. Broadly similar proposals have
been published for Scotland.
2 The Secretary of State for Wales assumed responsibility for health matters in Wales
in April 1969.

some 160 local executive councils on which doctors, dentists and pharm¬
acists are represented. Each council in England and Wales has an
ophthalmic services committee; in Scotland there are five joint ophthalmic
services committees.
3. The local authority health and welfare services.
In addition, the Secretary of State for Social Services has power to conduct,
or assist others to conduct, research work and he provides a public health
laboratory service and a blood transfusion service. He is advised by th^
Central Health Services Council and by standing advisory committees on
various aspects of the service.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the Health
Ministers in England and Wales but it is their responsibility to provide
clinical facilities for the training of medical students. The universities are
responsible for the provision of teaching.
The Secretary of State for Scotland has similar duties. The teaching
hospitals in Scotland come under the control of the regional hospital boards,
but special medical education committees consider matters relating to medical
teaching. The Scottish Health Services Council and the standing advisory
committees advise the Secretary of State and keep closely in touch with the
Central Health Services Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Services are described separately on page 141.
Expenditure on the health and welfare services in Britain was estimated at
£1,825 million in 1968-69. The greater part of the cost falls on the Exchequer,
and is met from general taxation, and a small part is met from local rates.
Other income is derived from the national health service contribution paid
with the national insurance contribution.
There are charges for prescriptions (except for children, expectant ana
nursing mothers, the elderly, patients in specified medical categories, war
pensioners and people in receipt of supplementary benefits), for treatment in
the dental service (but not for examination only or for treatment given to
people under 21 years or to nursing or expectant mothers), for aentures
(except for children under 16 or still at school, and expectant and nursing
mothers) and spectacles (except children’s spectacles in standard frames),
and for some local health authority services. Certain exemptions or refunds
are made and anyone may apply to the Supplementary Benefits Commission
for help in meeting any of these charges. A limited number of beds may be
made available for hospital patients wishing for privacy, provided that this
accommodation is not needed on medical grounds for non-paying patients.
Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients to be treated as private
patients on payment of the whole cost of their accommodation and treatment.
Such patients may make private arrangements for treatment by doctors of
their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-
time medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept
private patients. General medical practitioners in public service are paid
according to the amount of work and responsibility they undertake; certain
practice expenses are also directly reimbursed.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions
they dispense. Doctors and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the

supplementary ophthalmic service are paid prescribed fees for each sight test
made; opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number and
type of pairs supplied.
The general practitioner services cover the medical attention given to indi¬
viduals by doctors and dentists of their own choice from among those
enrolled in the service. Doctors and dentists normally work at their own
surgeries; practice in health centres established under the National Health
Service Acts is developing. About 24,000, or almost all, general medical
practitioners (principals and assistants) in Great Britain take some part in the
service, more than three-quarters of them in partnership.
Doctors wishing to enter practice have to apply through their executive
councils to the central Medical Practices Committee, so that a balanced
distribution of doctors throughout the country may be facilitated. The maxi¬
mum number of patients’ names permitted to be on a family doctor’s list is
normally 3,500; the average number in England and Wales is about 2,480. It
is normally through the patient’s own doctor that access to most other parts
of the health service is obtained.
There are nearly 10,500 dentists in England and Wales and over 1,000 in
Scotland in the general dental service.
Some 880 ophthalmic medical practitioners and nearly 6,300 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians in England and Wales, and 64 ophthalmic medical
practitioners and about 700 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in Scotland
are engaged in the supplementary ophthalmic service. These services provide
for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Cases requiring treatment
are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
Nearly 14,000 retail pharmacists take part in the National Health Service.
They are responsible for the dispensing of all prescriptions except for the
small number dispensed by certain general practitioners.
The hospital and specialist services provide hospital accommodation of all
kinds, including district general hospitals with treatment and diagnostic
facilities for in-patients, out-patients and day-patients, hospital maternity
departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric hospitals and units, con¬
valescent homes and rehabilitation centres, and all forms of specialised
treatment.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service in Great
Britain were built in the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much
earlier charitable foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’s and St.
Bartholomew’s Hospitals in London. Much has been done in recent years to
improve and extend existing hospitals, some of which are housed in incon¬
venient buildings, and a number of new hospitals have been built. In 1962
long-term plans for hospital building were published by the Government and
revisions were made in 1963, 1964 and 1966. The plans set out the probable
future pattern of the hospital service and contain assessments of the work to be
undertaken in the ten years ahead; it is expected that roughly ,£1,000 million
will be spent in England and Wales on hospital building during the ten-year
period beginning 1966-67 and over £60 million in Scotland during the five-
year period 1966-71.
Over 2,500 of the existing hospitals in the National Health Service are in
England and Wales, including the 26 teaching hospitals in London (actually
groups of hospitals, convalescent homes, branches, annexes, or treatment
centres, numbering over 100 altogether) and the 10 teaching hospitals

elsewhere in England and Wales (comprising some 80 hospitals and other
establishments). They have 467,500 beds available for use and a nursing and
midwifery staff of some 189,000 full-time and about 79>®®® part-time.
There are 380 hospitals in Scotland with nearly 63,000 beds and more than
27,000 full-time and nearly 11,000 part-time nurses and midwives.
A small number of hospitals remain outside the service for special reasons.
Most of these are run by religious orders. Some, such as the Italian and Jewish
Hospitals, serve a special group of patients; others are maintained for the
chronic sick or for convalescents by charitable organisations. There are also
private nursing homes which must be registered.
Rehabilitation is an important aspect of medical care and today hospital
treatment is not limited to the relief of pain or cure of pathological conditions
but aims at helping people to resume normal living as soon as possible.
Experience has shown that efficient medical rehabilitation reduces the stay in
hospital, the incidence of permanent disability and the period of incapacity
for full work. It has been applied with advantage in the care of the chronic
sick, the mentally disabled, the aged and the handicapped and has enabled
many patients to become self-sufficient and to resume an independent life in
their own homes. Specialised rehabilitation facilities are provided at the main
hospitals and in a few other associated centres. The work is carried out under
the guidance of the appropriate medical specialist by physiotherapists,
remedial gymnasts, occupational therapists and social workers acting as a
team. The hospital departments work closely with the Disablement Resettle¬
ment Service of the Department of Employment and Productivity.
Medical rehabilitation includes the provision, free of charge, of artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, invalid chairs, certain types of
invalid vehicles, and other appliances. Nursing aids for the handicapped at
home, ranging from special carriages to feeding cups, can be borrowed through
the service.
Most hospitals have social work departments in which aspects of the patient’s
environment which may affect diagnosis, treatment and recovery, are assessed
and interpreted. They help in tackling social and emotional problems
resulting from or associated with illness and are concerned with the
rehabilitation and resettlement of patients especially where the illness has
been long or where the disability results in changes in the patient’s life.
The National Blood Transfusion Service in England and Wales is administered
by the regional hospital boards under the National Health Service. Donors give
their blood voluntarily without payment. There are two central laboratories
administered by the Medical Research Council on behalf of the Department of
Health and Social Security: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, which
prepares grouping serum and investigates blood grouping problems referred
to it, and the Blood Products Laboratory, which prepares dried plasma and
plasma fractions. In Scotland the Blood Transfusion Service is under the
direction of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Association, which
is an independent voluntary body but is supported in the main by a grant
from the Scottish Home and Health Department. In Northern Ireland the

each year, concentrating increasingly on specially susceptible groups in the
population.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection
of Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms.
In Scotland there is no separate public health laboratory service and
bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital laboratories. In Northern
Ireland a central public health laboratory shares the bacteriological work with
hospital laboratories.
The Committee on Safety of Drugs, set up by the Health Ministers, reviews
and assesses new drugs before they are put to clinical trial or marketed in the
United Kingdom. It is also responsible for collecting and studying reports of
suspected adverse reactions to drugs in use.
Local authorities play a major part in promoting the health and welfare of
people in the community often in co-operation with voluntary organisations,
to which they may make grants, lend premises or give help in other ways.
Most of the needs for which the services are designed arise among four
broad groups of people: mothers and young children; the elderly; the mentally
disordered; and the physically handicapped. Other smaller groups include the
ill and convalescent at home, and the temporarily homeless. To ensure that the
services bring the maximum benefit to those who use them, local authorities
work in close co-operation with the general practitioner and hospital and
specialist branches of the National Health Service.
The authorities responsible for health and welfare services are the councils
of counties, county boroughs, London boroughs and the City of London and,
in Scotland, counties and large burghs. Plans for the development of health
and welfare services in England and Wales over the ten years ending 1975-76
were published in 1966 and the authorities keep the plans constantly under
review. Proposals to co-ordinate the administration of the personal social
services were made in July 1968 by the Committee on Local Authority and
Allied Personal Social Services (Seebohm Committee).
In Scotland, the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, which provides for the
reorganisation of the personal social services, including the child care service,
into one social welfare service, is being implemented.
Charges may be made for some local authority health and welfare services
(for example, domestic help, welfare foods for young or handicapped children
and nursing or expectant mothers, supplies from family planning clinics, day
nurseries, the loan of equipment and laundering of bed linen for people being
nursed at home, and chiropody services) but arrangements are made for free
provision to people with very low incomes.
Vaccination against poliomyelitis by local health authorities is normally
restricted to people under 40 years of age (apart from people liable to special
risk who may be vaccinated at any age); those over 40 may be vaccinated, free
of charge under the National Health Service, by their general practitioner.
BCG vaccination against tuberculosis by local health authorities is available
to children of ten years and over and to others exposed to particular risk of

infection. Vaccination is also available against diphtheria, smallpox, tetanus,
whooping cough and measles.
Maternity and child health centres offer regular supervision by doctors,
midwives and health visitors to expectant and nursing mothers and young
children. Special sessions are held for vaccination and inoculation and for
early testing of babies for deafness and other defects. A feature of the service
is the education of mothers before and after the birth by means of talks,
discussion groups, demonstrations and classes. Some 75 per cent of babies
born in England and Wales and some 64 per cent of those born in Scotland in
1967 were taken to the centres. Family planning clinics, often run by the
Family Planning Association on behalf of local authorities, are frequently held
at maternity and child health centres. Health visitors also visit the homes of
babies and young children to give advice on their care and health, and under¬
take school nursing and tuberculosis visiting (for all age groups).
The expectant mother may arrange to have her baby in hospital or at home
according to the advice given by the doctor or midwife. Some 75 per cent
of confinements in England and Wales and 90 per cent in Scotland take place
in hospital. For a home confinement the services of either a general practitioner
obstetrician or her own family doctor besides those of a trained midwife and,
if necessary, a consultant obstetrician, are available to every mother.
The majority of premature babies are cared for in hospital but special
arrangements for premature babies who are fit to remain in their own homes
are made by many local health authorities who lend equipment and appoint
experienced nursing staff to supervise their care.
Domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’) is made available by local
authorities during periods of special need, for example, confinement or during
the absence of the mother when children might otherwise have to be cared
for away from home.
Some local authorities make direct provision for the special needs of
unmarried mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work
done by voluntary organisations and other bodies (see p. 141).
Under the welfare foods service expectant and nursing mothers, children
up to five years and one month and certain handicapped children can obtain
a pint of milk a day at a reduced price. Where three or more members of a
family are entitled to welfare milk, it is provided free for all but two of them.
Other welfare foods distributed by local health authorities to the same group
of people are dried milk, as an alternative to liquid milk, orange juice, cod liver
oil and, for expectant and nursing mothers only, vitamins A and D tablets all
at welfare price. Welfare foods, including liquid milk, may be provided free of
charge to all beneficiaries in families of low income. Some authorities also
provide other proprietary foods at special clinic prices.
There are about 510 day nurseries (apart from nursery schools and play
groups) for children under five in Great Britain provided by local health
authorities or voluntary associations working with them. Private or factory
nurseries must be registered with the local authority to ensure that their
premises and management are satisfactory. People who mind children (other
than relatives) under five years of age in their homes for payment must also
be registered.
A number of services for elderly people in their own homes are provided by
statutory and voluntary bodies to help them to live there for as long as possible.
Local authorities supply, under the National Health Service Acts, home
nursing and domestic help and many arrange a chiropody service, sitters-in,

night attendants and special laundry services. Under the National Assistance
Amendment Act 1962 the authorities may provide day centres, clubs,
recreational workshops and meals for old people. Health visitors and social
workers employed by local authorities are spending an increasing proportion
of their time helping old people with their problems and in most areas ‘good
neighbour’ and friendly visiting services are also arranged by the local
authority or a voluntary organisation.
Local authorities provide residential accommodation, under the National
Assistance Act, for the elderly and infirm and have powers to register homes
run by voluntary organisations or privately (see p. 141). The newer homes
provided by local authorities for elderly and other infirm people usually have
accommodation for 30 to 50 residents; for the elderly mentally infirm the
present development is towards homes of not more than 35 places. Some
2,000 new homes have been opened in England and Wales since 1945.
For many years local authorities have, under the Housing Acts, provided an
increasing number of smaller dwellings for old people, and flatlets for frail or
infirm old people who can lead independent lives with some help. County
councils may make grants to county district councils towards the cost of
providing a resident warden and other welfare services for elderly people
occupying these special groups of dwellings.
Treatment for mental disorder is provided as part of the National Health
Service. Patients can consult the family doctor, and receive specialist advice
at hospital out-patient clinics as they would for any other kind of illness, and
can enter hospital for in-patient treatment without formalities.
In England and Wales under the Mental Health Act 1959, and in Scotland
the Mental Health (Scotland) Act i960, mentally disordered patients can,
where necessary in the interests of their health or safety or for the protection
of other people, be compelled to enter hospital for treatment. There are
procedural safeguards to protect patients from unnecessary detention in
hospital; in England and Wales patients may apply to a Mental Health
Review Tribunal for discharge and in Scotland to the sheriff.
Local health authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping the
mentally disordered in the community, and before or after hospital treatment.
Recent developments in the treatment of mental illness, which enable patients
to be discharged from hospital more quickly provided support is available in
the community, are adding to the demands for these services. Arrangements
include training centres for mentally subnormal children1 and adults,
occupational centres for the mentally ill, as well as social centres and residential
accommodation for the mentally disordered of all ages. If necessary, the local
health authority can place a mentally disordered person under guardianship
within the community. In Scotland education authorities share the responsi¬
bility for providing training or occupation.
Local authorities have a duty to provide welfare services for people who are
blind, partially sighted, deaf, hard of hearing, or otherwise substantially and
permanently handicapped. Voluntary organisations give important help in
providing these services. To become eligible for the services a person must
apply to the welfare department of the local authority for registration as a
handicapped person.
1 Agreement in principle to the transfer of responsibility for the education of mentally
handicapped children in England and Wales (that is, those not attending special
schools, see p. 152) to the education service was announced in November 1968.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A wide range of facilities is available under authorities’ welfare schemes,
including advice on occupational, social and personal problems arising from
disability; assistance in overcoming the effects of disability; help in carrying
out adaptations in the home—for example, by fitting ramps, wide doorways,
ground floor toilets, guide rails, and the provision of various aids to living to
meet individual needs; social and occupational centres and clubs; teaching of
handicrafts and other occupations either at home or in centres; and the
provision of recreational facilities, outings and holidays. The blind welfare
services are staffed by social workers who are specially qualified to assist the
blind in all matters including teaching them craftwork and the use of
embossed symbols for reading and writing. Services for the deaf are also
staffed by specialist welfare officers qualified to communicate with the deaf.
Benefits available from other sources include financial aid, preventive and
medical treatment, special education, training for employment and placement
in suitable occupations.
(For the provision of special educational treatment for handicapped children
see p. 152, and the child health clinics and the school health service, which
keep a watch for abnormalities, pp. 137 and 150.)
Health Centres There has been a marked increase of interest in health centres at which
facilities can be made available for the provision of medical, dental and
pharmaceutical services and consultant and other hospital out-patient
services in association with local authority services. In December 1968, 93
were in operation in England and Wales, 69 were under construction and many
more planned. In January 1968 in Scotland, where the provision of health
centres is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, there were
seven centres in operation, two under construction and many more planned.
Health Education Health education is primarily the responsibility of local authorities who may
employ specified officers to organise and promote health education, much of
which is carried out in child health clinics and by health visitors.
An entirely new Health Education Council was set up in 1968 to take over
the work of the Central Council for Health Education and the health education
promotional activities of the Department of Health and Social Security. The
main functions of the new Council, which is financed both by central and
local government, are to plan and promote national programmes of health
education and to assist in the development of projects in co-operation with
local authorities and other bodies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
It also undertakes research into health education techniques and fosters the
training of staff engaged in health education.
In Scotland central services are provided by the Scottish Council for Health
Education and the Scottish Home and Health Department. A new health
education unit, which works in close association with the Council, has been
set up within the Scottish Office.
Ambulance Services Free conveyance by ambulance in England and Wales between home and
hospital is provided, where needed, by local authorities either directly or by
arrangement with voluntary organisations. The Hospital Car Service (organ¬
ised by the St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade, the British Red
Cross Society, and the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service) augments the
ambulance service in many areas for the conveyance of sitting patients. In
Scotland ambulances are run by the St. Andrew’s Scottish Ambulance Service
on behalf of the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Northern Ireland they are
run by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.

AND WELFARE
SERVICES IN
NORTHERN

VOLUNTARY AID
SOCIAL WELFARE 141
The health services established under the Health Services Acts (Northern
Ireland) 1948-67 correspond fairly closely to the medical care system
established under the National Health Service in Great Britain and they are
financed in the same way as in the rest of the United Kingdom. Welfare
services are provided under the Welfare Services Acts (Northern Ireland)
1949-61 by separate statutory welfare authorities.
The hospital and specialist services, which include mental health services,
are administered on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Social Services by
the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority (which corresponds approximately
to a regional hospital board in Great Britain) through hospital management
committees. The Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority has under its control
83 hospitals containing in all about 17,000 beds. The administration of the
general medical, dental, pharmaceutical and supplementary eye services is in
the hands of the Northern Ireland General Health Services Board, which
takes the place of the executive councils in Great Britain. There are some
750 general practitioners (with an average of 2,020 patients each), 317 dentists,
13 ophthalmic medical practitioners and 128 ophthalmic and 13 dispensing
opticians. The provision of health centres is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Health and Social Services. Local health and welfare services are admin¬
istered by the six county councils and the two county borough councils in
Northern Ireland. The range of local authority services and the arrangements
made by the Northern Ireland General Health Services Board for the provi¬
sion of services, and for the remuneration of the people providing them, are
similar to those already described for the rest of the United Kingdom.
A number of voluntary organisations provide extensive health and welfare
services in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the provision made by
central and local authorities.
In many areas invalid children, old people and others needing care in their
own homes are visited and helped by voluntary organisations. The National
Society for Mentally Handicapped Children, for example, gives help through
advice and services. The National Association for Mental Health does
advisory, educational and therapeutic work. There are specialist societies
concerned with the blind, the deaf and people with other handicaps. The
extensive work done for elderly people is co-ordinated by Old People’s
Welfare Committees which have been established in 1,600 areas. They and
corresponding bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland are affiliated to the
National Old People’s Welfare Council. A National Corporation for the
Welfare of Old People, established by the Nuffield Foundation, is now
concentrating on services in the home. At the end of 1967 some 2,612 homes
for old and disabled people, run by voluntary bodies or privately, were
registered with local authorities under the National Assistance Act. In
Northern Ireland voluntary homes are registered with the Ministry of Health
and Social Services and private homes with the welfare authorities.
Most of the homes and hostels for unmarried mothers and their children are
provided by voluntary organisations, which employ specially trained workers
to help the mothers to plan their future.
A great deal of help is given to hospitals by voluntary bodies and individual
voluntary helpers. Many hospitals have their own Leagues of Friends or
similar groups of voluntary workers who organise and undertake a variety of
services. Many hospitals also have help from the British Red Cross Society,
the St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade, the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, and other organisations. The operation of canteens for

out-patients, and trolley-shops and book and picture library services for
in-patients, visiting in the wards, escort services in out-patient departments,
and mending linen are among the tasks commonly undertaken. Many
convalescent homes are provided by voluntary effort.
There are a number of private health insurance schemes, membership of
which has grown considerably in recent years. It is estimated that some
2 million people are now covered by these schemes. Subscribers who wish for
private medical treatment outside the National Health Service can insure
against all or nearly all the cost of hospital treatment and certain medical
treatment outside hospital.
THE MEDICAL,
DENTAL AND
ALLIED
PROFESSIONS
Only people whose names are on the medical and dental registers respectively
may practise as doctors and dentists under the National Health Service.
Registered medical practitioners may practise dentistry in spheres other than
the general dental service of the National Health Service. Dental auxiliaries
(who have undergone a two-year training course) may carry out some kinds of
simple dental work, but only under the direction of a registered dentist. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’
training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year s experience
as a resident assistant doctor in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years at
a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical profession is
the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the dentists is the
General Dental Council, which succeeded the Dental Board in 1956. The
British Medical Association is the doctors’ main professional association; that
of the dentists is the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration
as a general trained nurse is normally three years. Training may be for general,
sick children’s, mental or mentally sub-normal nursing qualification. An
enrolled nurse takes a two-year course. The examining bodies of the nursing
profession in England and W ales and in Scotland are the General Nursing
Councils, and in Northern Ireland the Joint Nursing and Mid wives Council.
Midwives in England and Wales and in Scotland must have the certificate of
the appropriate Central Midwives Board, and in Northern Ireland of the
Joint Nursing and Midwives Council. Most pupil midwives are already state
registered general nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the two-year
midwifery training period is reduced to one year and, for state enrolled nurses,
to 18 months. The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of
Midwives are the professional bodies for nurses and midwives. Health visitors
are state registered general nurses who have undergone at least the first part
of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing before taking a year’s course in
health visiting, promoted by the Council for the Training of Health Visitors.
To practise as a pharmacist, a pharmaceutical chemist must have his or her
name entered in the register maintained by the Pharmaceutical Society of
Great Britain, the governing body of the profession, or by the Pharmaceutical
Society of Northern Ireland. Qualifications requiring four or five years’
academic study and practical training are necessary for registration. The sale
of certain specified medicines and their dispensing on National Health Service
prescriptions can be carried out only by, or under the supervision of, a
registered pharmaceutical chemist. Under the Opticians Act 195^ General
Optical Council regulates the professions of ophthalmic optician and dispens¬
ing optician; only registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered medical
practitioners) may test sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes four years

including a year of practical experience under supervision. Dispensing
opticians may take a two-year full-time course with a year’s practical
experience or a part-time course.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory technicians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists,
radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight boards
(called, for example, the Chiropodists Board or the Dietitians Board) under
the general supervision of the Council for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine. A professional training lasting two or three years or more is needed
to qualify for registration. Only members of these professions who are state
registered may be employed in the National Health Service and some other
public services.
Medical social workers must obtain the certificate of the Institute of
Medical Social Workers, or have taken a recognised university course to
qualify them for membership of the Institute. Psychiatric social workers are
required to have a certificate showing they have attended the mental health
course provided at certain universities. Speech therapists need a good general
education and three years’ professional training.
Medical research in Britain receiving support from government funds is
carried out by the Medical Research Council, the universities and their
associated medical schools, and in hospitals in the National Health Service.
Further support for medical research is provided by private organisations, of
which the British Empire Cancer Campaign and the Nuffield Foundation are
among the largest. There is close co-operation between the Medical Research
Council and these organisations to ensure the best allocation of their respective
resources. A considerable amount of medical research is undertaken by the
pharmaceutical industry (see also p. 197).
Local authorities in Great Britain have a duty under the Children and Young
Persons Act 1963 to make available such advice, guidance and assistance as
may promote the welfare of children by diminishing the need to receive or
keep them in the authority’s care or to bring them before a juvenile court.1
This help may include assistance in kind or, exceptionally, financial help, and
may be given through a voluntary organisation or directly. However, if a child
seems to be in need of care, protection or control because of adverse circum¬
stances in which he is not receiving the standard of care to be expected from a
good parent or because he is beyond the control of parent or guardian, the
local authority may initiate court proceedings and the child may be committed
by the juvenile court to the care of a ‘fit person’, usually the local authority,
till he or she reaches the age of 18. Local authorities have a further duty, under
the Children Act 1948, to receive into their care any child under the age of 17
who has no parent or guardian, or who has been abandoned or whose parents
are unable to provide for him temporarily or permanently. A child so received
remains in the care of the local authority until he is 18 years old unless the
authority finds it to his advantage to return him sooner to his parents or
guardian or to entrust him to friends. Both categories of children are to be
treated so as to further their best interests and afford them opportunity for
their proper development.
1 The Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 provides for the abolition of juvenile courts in
Scotland and the establishment of children’s panels.
i44
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents,
who receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home
cannot be found for a child, or he is not suitable for boarding out, he may be
placed in a children’s home provided by a local authority or a voluntary
organisation. Many children’s homes are now provided in small houses, on
housing estates or in ordinary streets, where a group of 12 or fewer children
live in the care of a housemother or houseparents, the husband following his
normal employment. Other children may be placed in hostels or lodgings or
in other accommodation specially suited to their needs. The desirability of
returning a child to his family circle as soon as possible is fully appreciated,
and work is carried out to rehabilitate the family where this is necessary.
To carry out its functions under the Children Act 1948 each local authority
in England and Wales (county, county borough and London borough council)
is required to appoint a children’s committee and a children’s officer to be
responsible for the care and upbringing of children in the authority’s care.
In Scotland child care work is undertaken by local authority social work
departments set up under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. Children’s
officers are assisted by a staff of child-care officers who undertake enquiries
and who supervise children placed in foster homes. Regulations for England
and Wales safeguarding the boarding out of children by local authorities and
voluntary organisations and the conduct of children’s homes have been made
by the Home Secretary, and, for Scotland, by the Secretary of State for
Scotland. The cost of the local authorities’ child-care service is shared
between the local authorities and the Exchequer.
In Northern Ireland the welfare authorities of each county and county
borough (under the general direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs) are
responsible for caring for homeless and neglected children under the Children
and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland) 1968. Legislation relating to
children and arrangements for their care follow the same general principles as
in Great Britain.
Voluntary War orphans are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Social
Organisations Security.
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue
to play a valuable part in this work. The larger societies, such as Dr.
Barnardo’s, the Church of England Children’s Society and the Catholic Child
Welfare Council, are constituent societies of the National Council of Voluntary
Child Care Organisations, to which a large number of smaller voluntary homes
are also affiliated. In Scotland a valuable contribution is also made by the
Church of Scotland Committee on Social Service, and by other voluntary
organisations. Children’s homes provided by voluntary organisations (of
which there are some 620 in Britain) are required to be registered under the
Children Act (in Northern Ireland under the Children and Young Persons
Act). The boarding out of children and all children’s homes, whether local
authority or voluntary homes, are subject to inspection by the Child Care
Inspectorate of the Home Office, of the Scottish Office or of the Northern
Ireland Ministry of Home Affairs.
Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own homes
include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units, which
undertake prolonged and intensive casework with families. The old-established
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its Scottish
counterpart between them maintain inspectors and visitors throughout the

Provision for legal adoption was first made in England and Wales in 1926, in
Northern Ireland in 1929 and in Scotland in 1930. About 25,000 adoption
orders are made annually by the courts in Great Britain and some 400 in
Northern Ireland. Adoption is now regulated by the Adoption Act 1958 in
Great Britain and by the Adoption Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 in Northern
Ireland. The Registrars General keep registers of adopted children; adoption
societies (over 70 societies arrange adoptions) must be registered with the
local authority (in Northern Ireland with the Ministry of Home Affairs).
Local authorities, through their children’s committees, have had the power
since 1959 to act as adoption agencies and increasingly do so.
IMMIGRATION, COMMUNITY AND RACE RELATIONS
Since the 1950s a large number of people have entered Britain from Common¬
wealth countries in Asia, Africa and the West Indies to take up employment,
many with the intention of settling permanently (see pp. 11 and 415).
Immigrants from the Commonwealth and their families now comprise about
2 per cent of the total population or some 1-2 million.
Commonwealth immigrants are making an important contribution to the
economy and public services by relieving shortages of labour; but the arrival
of large numbers during a relatively short period and their concentration in
certain areas of full employment (many of them living in the congested parts
of London and such industrial cities as Birmingham) led to a suddenly
increased demand for housing where it was already scarce and caused
additional pressure on the social services. The central Government, local
authorities and a variety of voluntary agencies are seeking in different ways
to help immigrants and other citizens through this period of adjustment and
to deal with special social problems as they become evident.
The welfare of immigrants is promoted by local authorities through the
everyday work of their departments, by voluntary liaison committees and by
voluntary societies. Many authorities have appointed liaison officers who
speak the language of the immigrant groups—usually immigrants them¬
selves—and have issued explanatory leaflets about local services.
The co-ordination of government action to promote the welfare of immigrants
is the responsibility of the Home Office. Voluntary efforts to achieve the
integration of immigrants as part of a wider aim of promoting harmonious
community relations are co-ordinated nationally by the Community Relations
Commission, a statutory body set up under the Race Relations Act 1968.
Discrimination on grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origin in
places of public resort was made unlawful in Great Britain by the Race
Relations Act 1965 which established a Race Relations Board to secure com-
146
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
pliance with the Act. The Race Relations Act 1968 similarly made unlawful
discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, and in employ¬
ment and housing. The Race Relations Board has a statutory duty to receive
and investigate complaints and seeks to resolve them by conciliation. The
Board constitutes regional conciliation committees which between them cover
all areas of Great Britain. If conciliation fails the Board can seek remedies in
the courts. Employment complaints are dealt with in the first instance by the
Department of Employment and Productivity whose function it is to see
whether voluntary machinery exists within the industry to deal with them.
Where no such machinery exists the complaints are investigated by the Board.
6 EDUCATION
Educational
Administration
There are over 10 million children and young people in full-time attendance
at schools, universities, colleges of education and technical colleges in Britain.
The great majority of schools, attended by over 90 per cent of school children,
are publicly provided or assisted. Most technical colleges and other centres of
further education are also publicly maintained. Universities are autonomous
self-governing institutions but are aided from public funds.
The bulk of expenditure on education in Britain comes from public funds
although many of the older-established schools and colleges continue to
benefit from private endowments. In 1968-69 estimated total public expendi¬
ture on education, including university education and school meals and milk,
was £2,237 million (more than double the expenditure in 1960-61), which
was 15 per cent of all public expenditure.
In England and Wales the main development of publicly provided primary
education started a hundred years ago. In 1833 the Government had begun to
make annual grants to the voluntary societies which were providing schools,
but the Elementary Education Act of 1870 first established the principle of
compulsory education. By the end of the nineteenth century elementary
education had become virtually both compulsory and free of charge. Public
provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales) started in England
under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public
education in England and Wales. The Scottish and Northern Ireland educa¬
tional systems both have long histories independent of that of education in
England, but the same general policy is now being implemented throughout
Britain, with some national variations. The governing acts are the Education
(Scotland) Act 1962 (a consolidating measure) and the Education Act
(Northern Ireland) 1947.
All aspects of education in England and Wales, and of universities, civil
science, sport and the arts (see p. 49) throughout Great Britain are the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education and Science. (The
Secretary of State for Wales is concerned with the general oversight of the
national educational policy in Wales.) The Secretary of State for Scotland
and the Minister of Education for Northern Ireland have corresponding
educational responsibilities, except that the Secretary of State for Scotland is
consulted about Scottish universities but is not responsible for them.
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is divided
between the central government departments, local education authorities, and
various voluntary organisations. The relation between these three groups is
based on consultation and co-operation, both by direct contact between them
and through Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Schools who act as liaison officers,
particularly between local education authorities and the departments.
The local education authorities are responsible for ensuring that adequate
provision is made in their areas for the two stages of school education (primary
and secondary), and that those pupils who would profit by proceeding to
higher education are not deterred by lack of financial means. They are also
responsible for the provision of further education (see p. 154).
The planning of the curriculum is largely in the hands of the head teacher
of each school and the individual teachers (see pp. 149 and 150).

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Schools Council for the Curriculum and Examinations, representative
of all educational interests in England and Wales, acts as an advisory body and
carries out research and development work on curricula, teaching methods
and examinations in primary and secondary schools. In Scotland a similarly
representative Consultative Committee on the Curriculum advises the
Secretary of State for Scotland on the development of the curriculum.
In England and Wales colleges of education (for teacher training) are under
the financial and administrative control of local education authorities or
voluntary organisations. The organisation of courses is based on university
institutes of education. The Scottish colleges of education are under the
control of specially appointed governing bodies; in Northern Ireland they are
under the control of the Government or voluntary agencies.
The universities are administratively independent of the Department of
Education and Science (in Northern Ireland the Ministry of Education);
the Government exercises its responsibilities in relation to the universities
through the University Grants Committee (see p. 159). Their governing
bodies are appointed according to the terms of their individual charters.
SCHOOLS
Management
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive efficient
full-time education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 15.
(The school-leaving age is to be raised to 16 in 1972-73.)
At present there are over 9-4 million school children at about 38,100 schools.
In England and Wales there were 7-6 million children in publicly maintained
schools in 1968 besides some 128,500 others at schools receiving direct grants
from the Department of Education and Science; there were also about 429,500
children of all ages at some 3,000 independent schools. In Scotland 929,830
children were attending education authority or grant-aided schools and over
17,000 were at independent schools. In Northern Ireland about 326,000
children were attending publicly maintained or assisted schools; there were
few at independent schools.
The number of school children in Britain is increasing mainly because the
birth rate rose steadily between 1955 1964* Each year, too, more children
stay on at school beyond the minimum leaving age. The school population is
expected to rise, altogether, by 2 million by 1975" There is, therefore, a
continuing need for more teachers and more school buildings.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it is usual for boys and girls to
be taught together in primary schools but about half the secondary schools
are for boys or girls only. Mixed schools are more common in Wales and in
Scotland, where most city schools take both boys and girls. In the independent
sector more than half the schools are co-educational; but of those providing
secondary education the majority are either for boys or for girls.
Schools supported from public funds are of three kinds in England and
Wales: county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained
by local education authorities wholly out of public funds; voluntary schools
(mostly ‘aided’ or ‘controlled’ schools) which have been provided by a
voluntary body, usually of a religious denomination,1 and direct-grant schools
1 The local education authority is responsible for the running costs of all voluntary
schools and for the cost of all building work at controlled schools. Aided schools have
more independence than controlled schools and are responsible for part of the cost ol
external repairs and any building work (see p. 153)- Over a third of the 28,500 schools
maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary schools
and the majority of these are Church of England schools. There are some 2,400 Roman
Catholic voluntary schools and smaller numbers belonging to other religious bodies.

which are completely independent of local education authorities but receive a
grant-in-aid from the Department of Education and Science. These last (the
smallest group) mostly provide education of the grammar school type; they
include some schools of ancient foundation. In Scotland most of the schools
supported from public funds are provided by education authorities and are
known as public schools (in England this term is used for a type of independent
school, see p. 152). There are also a few grant-aided secondary schools
comparable to the English direct-grant schools. In Northern Ireland county
schools, managed by local education authorities, and voluntary schools, under
voluntary (usually clerical) management, are both grant-aided by the
Government.
Fees
Curricula
Religion in
Schools
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
schools maintained by local education authorities (that is over 90 per cent of
the school population) and books and equipment are supplied free. The
direct-grant grammar schools take pupils paid for by local education
authorities as well as those whose fees are paid wholly or partly by parents.
(For independent schools, see p. 152.) In Scotland education authorities may
charge fees in a limited number of schools but, under the Education (Scotland)
Act 1969, will not be able to do so after 1st August 1970. In Northern Ireland
no fees are charged to parents of children attending grant-aided schools,
with the exception of grammar schools, where qualified pupils receive from
the local education authorities scholarships which cover the whole or most of
the fees charged by the school.
In England and Wales school curricula are under the control of the local
education authorities, though there is in practice a high degree of devolution
to the schools themselves. Teachers may seek help and advice from Her
Majesty’s Inspectors, who are responsible for the inspection of all schools
including independent schools; they review and report on the content and
value of the education provided and are available as advisers. Local education
authorities also employ inspectors to advise on the schools which they
maintain. Further advice and encouragement for school-based research and
development is made available to teachers through the Schools Council. In
Scotland the function of Her Majesty’s Inspectors is in general the same as
that of the Inspectorate in England and Wales. The extent and balance of the
curriculum is kept under continuous review by the Consultative Committee
on the Curriculum. In Northern Ireland the curriculum of each grant-aided
school is subject to the approval of the Ministry of Education. In each
country considerable latitude is afforded in the scope both of the curriculum
and the teaching methods employed.
The schools’ freedom to frame their own curricula has facilitated a rapid
increase in study and experiment in recent years, partly stimulated by the
Schools Council and other organisations and partly prompted by the plans
to raise the school-leaving age in 1972-73. The general purpose is to adapt
the curriculum to the everyday life and needs of children and young people.
Many interesting developments are taking place in the teaching of mathe¬
matics, science and foreign languages as well as in physical education, drama
and art.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools
receive religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents wish them to be withdrawn. In county schools, and in
!^0 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
certain circumstances in voluntary schools, religious instruction of an
undenominational Christian character is given. In all kinds of voluntary school
there is opportunity for denominational instruction. In Scotland, subject to
safeguards for the individual conscience, religious instruction must be given,
but the content is entirely in the hands of the education authorities; in the
more populated areas there are separate schools for Roman Catholics. In
county schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access to give
religious instruction to children of their denomination for a limited period
each week.
Health and Physical education, including organised games, is a part of the curriculum
Welfare of of all schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must
School Children iiave the use of a playing field and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Organised games include tennis, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse and netball.
The School Health Service provides medical inspection and arranges,
usually in co-operation with the National Health Service, for free medical and
dental treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local
education authorities. Treatment facilities include dental clinics and child
guidance centres.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to children in primary
and special schools who wish to have it. The Schools Meals Service provides
a midday meal at a subsidised price (remitted where there is need) to 70 per
cent of the pupils in England and Wales and 49 per cent of the pupils in
Scotland in education authorities schools. Education authorities have power
to provide free transport for children who live more than a certain distance
from the schools they attend.
Nursery schools provide informal educational and play facilities for a small
proportion of children between two and five years old; many more are needed
to meet the demand and under the Urban Aid Programme started in 1968
(see p. 151) additional schools and classes are being provided in areas of special
need. Compulsory education begins at five when children in England and
Wales go to infant schools or departments; at seven they go on to junior
schools or departments. At present the usual age of transfer from primary to
secondary schools is 11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but an
increasing number of local authorities in England are adopting the recom¬
mendation of the Plowden report on the establishment of ‘middle schools’
(see p. 151). In Scotland, the primary schools take children from 5 to 12,
normally having infant classes for children under 7, although in some areas
there are separate infant schools.
The content of curricula is very largely a matter for the schools themselves.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are no compulsory secular
subjects but generally a curriculum includes the teaching of reading, writing,
arithmetic, English, music, art and handwork, nature study, history and
geography. Additionally, in Wales, the Welsh language is taught. Children
who speak Welsh at home normally receive the early stages of their primary
education in Welsh and are taught English as a second language. A report
on Primary Education in Wales, published in 1968 (see Bibliography, p. 475)>
proposed some extension of the teaching of Welsh. In Scotland the scope of
the curriculum is outlined in the Schools (Scotland) Code, but it is for each
head teacher and his staff to determine precisely what is to be included. The
principles on which it is thought primary education should be based are set out
in Primary Education in Scotland, published in 1965 (see Bibliography, p. 4750

Primary education is undergoing considerable change with the introduction
of new subjects and new teaching methods, and a greater emphasis on meeting
the needs of the individual child. In England recommendations of the
Plowden report, Children and their Primary Schools, published in 1967 (see
Bibliography, p. 475), are being adopted by a number of local education
authorities, including the establishment of ‘middle schools’ for children from
8 to 12 or 9 to 13 years of age, the increased use of teachers’ aides in primary
schools, more in-service training for teachers facilitated by the rapid growth
of the number of teachers’ centres (now about 250) for the dissemination of
new ideas, and the channelling of special help to ‘educational priority areas’
in poorer neighbourhoods in the form of more teachers, increased salaries for
teachers in schools of exceptional difficulty, and the authorisation of an
additional £16 million school-building programme for 1968-70.
The public or state system of education aims to give all children an education
suited to their particular abilities. As a matter of national policy, all secondary
education in England and Wales is being reorganised on a comprehensive
basis.
Comprehensive schools take pupils without reference to ability and provide
a wide range of secondary education for all or most of the children of a district.
They can be organised in a number of ways including the comprehensive
school that takes the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; the
middle schools whose pupils move on to senior comprehensive schools at
12, leaving at 16 or 18, or at 13, leaving at 18; and the comprehensive school
with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a sixth-form college for
pupils over 16. In 1969 there were 771,117 comprehensive school pupils, or
26-1 per cent of all pupils in maintained secondary schools; 128 out of 163
education authorities have schemes for comprehensive education either
implemented or approved.
The comprehensive system is replacing the ‘separatist’ system, which
consists of the following types of secondary school to which children are
allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11 (hence the term ‘eleven-
plus’): grammar schools which provide an academic education orientated
towards university entrance (these include a small number of direct-grant
grammar schools); secondary modern schools which give a general education
with a practical bias; a few secondary technical schools offering a general
education related to industry, commerce and agriculture; and schools
providing all three, or any two types of education, in separately organised
streams and known as multilateral or bilateral schools.
Secondary education in Scotland is also being reorganised on comprehensive
lines and in 1968 nearly 146,000 pupils (51-5 per cent of all pupils in educa¬
tion authority secondary schools) were in schools with a comprehensive intake.
All 35 education authorities have had their schemes for reorganisation wholly
or substantially approved. Where a selective system still exists Scottish
secondary schools fall mainly into one of three categories or are a combination
of all three: (1) junior secondary schools for pupils likely to leave school at
the statutory leaving age (15, rising to 16 in 1972-73); (2) schools which, in
addition to junior secondary courses, provide courses leading to the Ordinary
grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education; and (3) senior secondary
schools which provide Certificate courses of four, five and six years.
In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools, secondary (intermediate)
schools, which are the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in England

and Wales, and technical (intermediate) schools, which offer the same facilities
as secondary technical schools in England and Wales.
Special educational treatment is provided for children who require it because
of any physical or mental disability, including maladjustment, either in
ordinary schools or special schools (including hospital schools). For children
at special schools attendance is compulsory up to the age of 16, and a number
of children remain at school beyond this age. There are about 1,130 special
schools in Britain, including hospital schools, day and boarding schools. There
are also boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary schools.
There are ten categories of handicapped pupils in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland and nine in Scotland for whom local education authorities
must provide special educational treatment: blind, partially sighted, deaf,
hard of hearing, delicate, educationally subnormal, epileptic, maladjusted,
physically handicapped and children suffering from speech defects. There is
no separate category for the delicate in Scotland.
Independent schools in England and Wales receive no grants directly from
public funds but all are open to inspection and must register with the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science which has power to require them to remedy
any objectionable features in their premises, accommodation or instruction
and to exclude any person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or to be the
proprietor of a school. In default, the Department can, in effect, close a school
but schools have a right of appeal to an Independent Schools Tribunal against
any of the Department’s requirements. The schools whose standards are
regarded by the Department as broadly comparable with those required of
the grant-aided schools are, on application, granted the status of ‘recognised
as efficient’. Such schools (some 1,450 of about 3,000 independent schools
registered) contain over two-thirds of the pupils in independent schools. The
position in Scotland is the same except that there is no ‘recognised as efficient’
status.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages and abilities. They include
the preparatory schools and the public schools.1 A high proportion, parti¬
cularly among the recognised efficient schools, provide a boarding education.
(All registered boarding schools are being required to reach the standards
for recognition as efficient within the next few years.) The preparatory schools
cater mainly for boys from about 8 to 13 years of age who are intending to
enter public schools, the largest and most important of the recognised
efficient independent schools. Combined tuition and boarding fees in public
schools generally range between ^250 and £650 a year. There are justunder
300 public schools about half of which are for girls. The boys’ schools in
particular include a high proportion of boarding schools and it is among
these that some of the most famous schools are numbered. The Public
Schools Commission, set up by the Government to advise on the best way
of integrating public schools with the state system of education, published
in 1968 its first report on independent boarding schools. The Commission
is working on a second report dealing with direct grant and independent day
schools.
1 ‘Public schools’ are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of the Head¬
masters’ Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of
Girls’ Schools Association. Some other schools, mainly direct grant, which are not
independent schools, are also represented on these bodies. They should not be confused
with the state-supported public schools in Scotland.
EDUCATION
I53
School Leaving The minimum school-leaving age for all but children at special schools (see
and Secondary above) is, at present, 15; it will be raised to 16 in 1972-73. Most grammar
School . school pupils remain at school at least until they are 16; many leave between
xaminations ^ ageg ^ an(^ ^ num^er Gf pUpiis in ap schools staying on
beyond the minimum leaving age has been steadily increasing, and in 1968
32-2 per cent of the 16-year-old age group in England and Wales was still at
school.
There is no national leaving examination in England or Wales, but secondary
school pupils (and candidates not attending school) may take the General
Certificate of Education (GCE) or the Certificate of Secondary Education
(CSE). The GCE is conducted at ‘Ordinary’ (O) and ‘Advanced’ (A) levels.
Most candidates for the O-level are about 16 years of age, although many
take it earlier, at the discretion of their head teacher. Most grammar, direct-
grant and independent school pupils and an increasing number from other
secondary schools take the O-level examination, and passes in various
subjects are widely accepted for entry to courses of vocational training.
Between 1957 and 1967 the annual number of O-level GCE passes almost
doubled. The advanced examination is at university entrance level (supple¬
mented by special papers to help university authorities in selecting students)
and is accepted also for purposes of entry to many forms of professional
training. Since 1955 the number of school-leavers obtaining two or more
A-levels (often regarded as the minimum qualification for university entrance)
has almost trebled. The CSE is designed for pupils completing five years’
secondary education at the age of 16; it is controlled by teachers serving in the
schools providing candidates. The highest grade of pass in the CSE is widely
accepted as being of the same standard as a pass in the GCE O-level. Control
over the definition of scope and standards of examinations is exercised by the
Schools Council for the Curriculum and Examinations (see p. 148) to ensure
national comparability. It does not lay down model syllabuses or examination
papers but it puts forward ideas and promotes research and development.
In Scotland examinations are conducted by the Scottish Certificate of
Education Examination Board. School pupils in the fourth year of secondary
courses sit an examination at 16 years for the award of passes on the Ordinary
grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education, and pupils in the fifth or sixth
year are presented for the Higher grade. For those who have completed their
main studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their studies in
particular subjects there is a Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Junior Certificate Examination
at about the age of 14 and the Northern Ireland General Certificate of
Education at about the age of 16.
School Building Local education authorities and voluntary bodies are responsible, under the
general supervision of the central departments, for providing the schools and
other buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central
departments announce the levels of annual building programmes, frame
regulations, fix cost limits and decide on the size and nature of the authorities’
individual programmes in the light of national priorities; they also offer
guidance to authorities by means of building bulletins and in other ways.
An extensive school building programme has been carried out in recent
years. This has resulted in the completion of over 11,750 new schools in
Britain since 1945; together with extensions, alterations and remodelling of
existing state schools, over 6 million new places have been provided, at a
cost of about -£1,360 million. In England and Wales new work to the value of

£130 million is planned for the year 1969-70. In Scotland the comparable
authorisation is about £31 million, and in Northern Ireland over £10 million.
Grants of up to 80 per cent of the approved cost are normally available from
the Department of Education and Science for the building of new voluntary
aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to existing aided schools.
The extensive school building programme has been accompanied by new
ideas and methods in design and construction. Industrialised building
techniques have been widely adopted. The new schools are light, airy and
colourful, with a high standard of finish and generous provision of teaching
area and outdoor games space. In primary schools especially, traditional
classroom designs are being modified to allow more flexible use of space.
Further education is a broad term which covers all education beyond the
secondary stage; it may be full-time or part-time, vocational or non-voca-
tional. It includes adult education (see p. 155) and higher education (defined
on p. 158). For convenience, advanced work at the level of higher education,
but carried out at institutions regarded as within the further education
system, is included below.
In England and Wales there are 738 major establishments of further education
providing some full-time education, including technical colleges, colleges of
commerce, colleges of art, and a number of agricultural colleges and
institutes. They provide courses up to the levels of first and higher degrees.
There are also nearly 7,500 evening institutes (see p. 156). Following plans
announced in 1966, the Government is concentrating courses of higher
education in ‘polytechnics’ (see p. 161).
In Scotland there are about 90 local further education colleges offering
full- and part-time day courses and a number of evening courses and 13 central
institutions for further education doing advanced work.
In Northern Ireland there are 31 institutions of further education, of which
9 conduct advanced courses.
Since most of the technical colleges and other further education establishments
in Britain are either maintained or aided from public funds, tuition fees are
moderate, and often remitted for young people under 18 or 19 years of age.
Many full-time students are helped by awards from local education authorities.
The awards, generally based on the results of the General Certificate of
Education or a corresponding examination, are assessed to cover tuition fees
and a maintenance grant, but parents who can afford to contribute towards the
cost are required to do so. There are also some scholarships available from
endowments, and from particular industries or companies for the most
promising of their young workers.
Capital expenditure on further education institutions in England and Wales
totalled ^301 million in the ten years to 1968-69. In Scotland the total for
these ten years was more than ^33 million, and in Northern Ireland over
^6 million.
In 1967 there wrere 258,000 full-time and sandwich course (see p. 155) students
and 3-15 million (including evening) part-time students in technological,
technical, art and commercial colleges in Britain (a total of 3-19 million in
England and Wales, 157,130 in Scotland and 64,878 in Northern Ireland).
In 1968 the total number of students on advanced courses in England and
Wales wras 188,006, in Scotland 15,313, and in Northern Ireland 2,470.

The courses provided are full-time, sandwich (up to five years in length,
generally consisting of alternate periods of about six months of full-time study
in a technical college and supervised experience in industry), block release (on
similar principles, but with shorter periods in college), day release (generally
attendance at a technical college for one day a week during working hours),
and evening classes.
Sandwich courses in higher education are becoming increasingly popular.
At the lower levels the numbers of day release and block release courses are
expanding, and to a large extent replacing evening classes in certain vocational
subjects through the work of the Industrial Training Boards (see p. 416).
There is a wide variety of courses for young people in various trades and
occupations, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course of up
to five years. Other, more academic, courses lead to the National Certificates
and Diplomas approved by joint committees consisting of representatives of
the education departments and the appropriate professional bodies. These
courses are normally at two levels, ordinary and higher. The Ordinary
National Certificate courses last two years part-time and students usually
follow them between the ages of 16 and 19; the level of the certificate is
generally considered to approach that of GCE A-level. The Ordinary National
Diploma courses are the full-time or sandwich counterparts of the Ordinary
National Certificate. In 1968 3,494 Ordinary National Diplomas wrere
granted, more than three times the number for 1963. The Higher National
Diploma, which requires a further three years’ full-time or sandwich study,
is recognised, within its more restricted field, as approaching the standard of
a pass degree; the Higher National Certificate (after two further years’ part-
time study) is somewhat lower in standard and more narrowly based. (For
degree courses, see p. 159.)
Many technical colleges, evening institutes and independent colleges offer
courses in shorthand, typing and book-keeping. Most local technical colleges
offer some lower-level work in business and commerce; higher-level work is
generally concentrated in colleges with a department of business studies or
in specialised colleges of commerce. There are a number of courses for young
entrants to clerical and other non-technical posts including a two-year part-
time course leading to the Certificate in Office Studies.
Some business education is related to the specialised examination require¬
ments of various professional bodies; large numbers of the candidates taking
such courses do so through correspondence courses. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland there are part-time courses leading to the Ordinary National
Certificate and Higher National Certificate in Business Studies. There are
also full-time and sandwich courses leading to the Ordinary National Diploma
and Higher National Diploma in Business Studies. In Scotland, broadly
similar courses lead to the Scottish National Certificate, the Scottish Higher
National Certificate and the Scottish National Diploma in Business Studies
awarded by the Scottish Council for Commercial, Administrative and
Professional Education.
Adult education is generally taken to mean courses of non-vocational education
for people over 18. In 1968 an estimated 1-5 million people registered for
these courses which were provided by local education authorities, various
voluntary bodies, of which the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA) is
the most notable, certain residential colleges, and the adult education (‘extra¬
mural’) departments of universities.
156
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The residential colleges, the university departments and the voluntary
bodies, such as the WEA, recognised as competent to provide adult education,
receive government grants. So do various national bodies which promote
educational activities of a non-political kind, such as the National Federation
of Women’s Institutes. Many of these bodies also receive grants from local
education authorities for services rendered locally.
A major share in the provision of adult education is increasingly being
assumed by local education authorities. Most of it is on a part-time basis,
mainly in the 8,450 evening institutes, which have a total of well over a million
students, and also in colleges of further education, schools of art, adult
education centres, community centres, literary institutes and youth clubs.
There are about 30 short-term residential colleges in Great Britain maintained
or aided by local education authorities, providing courses varying in length
between a weekend and a fortnight. Many of the courses are practical, but
there are widespread opportunities for academic study.
The Village Colleges pioneered in Cambridgeshire and variously adapted in
Cumberland, Monmouthshire, Leicestershire, Peterborough and Somerset
are a local education authority development mainly in rural areas. The
colleges are secondary schools planned also as cultural community centres,
providing educational, social and cultural opportunities for adults in the areas
served. Community centres in general have a more social character, and,
though aided by the local education authorities, are usually managed by
voluntary community associations many of which are affiliated to the National
Federation of Community Associations.
Seven residential colleges (six in England and Wales, one in Scotland)
provide courses of one or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The
colleges vary in character, although they all aim at providing a liberal educa¬
tion and do not apply academic entry tests.
A number of voluntary bodies provide adult education as part of their
services. The Women’s Institutes and Townswomen’s Guilds, for example,
generally offer courses in social studies, arts, drama and handicrafts. These
too are aided by local education authorities.
In general, courses at the highest levels in liberal studies are provided by
the extra-mural departments of the universities, many of which have full-time
staff appointed for this purpose and can call on the services of other members
of the university staff; and by the Workers’ Educational Association, which
also employs organising tutors and works closely with the university extra¬
mural departments. In 1968 over 200,000 students in Britain attended such
courses. Similar work is also promoted in some of the centres maintained by
local education authorities.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides in London a centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many organisations in England and
Wales which are interested in this subject. It is mainly financed by contri¬
butions from local education authorities and assisted by a grant from the
Department of Education and Science. The Scottish Institute of Adult
Education is the corresponding body in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland the extra-mural department of the Queen’s University
of Belfast organises and staffs adult education classes which are supple¬
mented by classes organised by various non-official bodies. The Workers’
Educational Association is responsible for classes at other than university
level and receives grants from the Ministry of Education.

TEACHERS AND
TEACHING
Teaching Aids
and Educational
Techniques
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing
bodies or managers. In 1968 there were about 370,600 full-time and 52,000
part-time (equivalent to 24,400 full-time) teachers in publicly maintained
primary and secondary schools in Britain, an average of one teacher to 22-5
pupils. The increase in teachers is more than keeping pace with the rise in
the school population so that there continues to be improvement in the
ratio of teachers to pupils. The rise in school population has created a need
for more and more teachers; although greater numbers are entering the
colleges of education (see p. 160), more university graduates are turning to
teaching, and many married women, formerly teachers, are returning to the
profession, yet more are needed if the Government’s aim of eliminating
oversize classes is to be achieved. In 1968 there were about 54,000 full-time
teachers in grant-aided establishments of further education in Britain, and,
because of the special conditions, many more part-time teachers. Most teachers
in technical colleges have had some industrial and professional experience.
There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland,
and in Northern Ireland.
Radio broadcasts to schools and colleges of further education are well
established. In 1968-69 the School Broadcasting Department of the BBC sent
out about 70 different radio series, some of which were repeated within each
week to make it easier for the schools to arrange their listening times. These
programmes were used by about 31,000 schools in Britain. Television reached
some 21,000 schools and the British Broadcasting Corporation and the
Independent Television Authority between them provided some 51 pro¬
grammes a week, most of which were repeated.
Radio provides a great variety of educational programmes for adults, both
vocational and non-vocational; most of them are grouped in the ‘Study
Session’ hourly programmes on five nights a week. Television programmes
for similar audiences have grown fast; they are mostly shown on Saturday
and Sunday mornings and in the evening during the week. There have also
been a number of experimental projects sponsored between the BBC, some of
the independent television companies, universities, local education authorities
and a voluntary body, the National Extension College. (For the proposed
Open University see p. 158).
There has been a rapid development in the use of programmed learning and
a National Centre for Programmed Learning has been established in the
Department of Education at the University of Birmingham. Language labora¬
tories (using tape recorders in individual booths) are being used at all levels of
the educational system. Most universities in Britain use closed circuit
television in one or more of their departments; it is also used increasingly in
medical schools, colleges of education, technical colleges and schools; and a
system being established in central London that will link some 1,300 educa¬
tional establishments is thought likely to be the world’s biggest closed-
circuit network.
Schools and colleges co-ordinate different methods of audio-visual
presentation, including radio, television, films, colour slides, wall charts,
maps, models and tape recordings. For example, the BBC’s ‘Radiovision’
programmes for schools use coloured film strips synchronised with sound
programmes. The National Council for Educational Technology advises all
bodies connected with education and with training in industry and in the
Services on the availability and use of audio-visual aids and other media.

HIGHER
EDUCATION
Universities
BRITAIN I970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The system of higher education includes universities, colleges of education
and advanced courses at various colleges in the further education system.
(Advanced courses are dealt with on p. 155 and higher education in Northern
Ireland on p. 161). The expansion of higher education has been accelerated by
the report of the Committee on Higher Education under Lord Robbins’s
chairmanship (published in 1963, see Bibliography, p. 475), which suggested
that by 1973-74 there should be 390,000 places in higher education in Great
Britain, of which 218,000 should be in university institutions. All sectors of
higher education are ahead of their schedules for the attainment of this target
and the Government now expects that there will be 220,000 to 225,000 places
in the universities by October 1969.
There are 44 universities in Britain, compared with 17 in 1945. Although the
Government is responsible for providing about 80 per cent of universities’
income it does not control their work or teaching nor does it have direct
dealings with the universities. The grants are distributed, and the Secretary
of State is advised on university matters, by the University Grants Committee,
whose members are drawn from the academic and business worlds. Univer¬
sities as such are not represented on it.
The English universities are: Aston1 (Birmingham), Bath1, Birmingham,
Bradford1, Bristol, Brunei1 (London), Cambridge, City1 (London), Durham,
East Anglia1, Essex1, Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury1, Lancaster1,
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough1, Manchester, Newcastle
upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford1, Sheffield, Southampton,
Surrey1, Sussex1, Warwick1 and York1. The federated University of Wales
includes four university colleges, the Welsh National School of Medicine,
the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology and St. David’s
College, Lampeter. The Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee1,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt1 (Edinburgh), St. Andrews, Stirling1,
and Strathclyde1 (Glasgow). In Northern Ireland there is Queen’s University,
Belfast, and the New University of Ulster1 in Coleraine, which opened in
1968 (see p. 161).
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
There are five other institutions where the work is of university standard:
University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, whose
students read for degrees of the University of Manchester; the two post¬
graduate business schools which are supported jointly by industry and the
Government—the Manchester Business School and the London Graduate
School of Business Studies, associated with the London School of Economics
and the Imperial College of Science and Technology; Cranfield College of
Aeronautics for mainly postgraduate work; and the Royal College of Art.
The Government has established the Open University, which received its
charter in 1969, to provide degree and other courses, using a combination of
television and correspondence courses together with a network of viewing and
listening centres. No formal academic qualifications are required to register
for these courses, but the standards of its degrees (to be awarded on a system
of credits for each course completed) will be the same as those of other
universities. The university is financed by fees and a grant direct from the

Department of Education and Science. Student enrolments will begin in the
autumn of 1970 and courses (based on the calendar year) in January 1971.
In spite of the large sums of public money spent on universities they have
remained autonomous institutions, due largely to the existence of the
University Grants Committee. The Committee acts as a link between the
Government from which it receives a block grant and the universities to
which it allocates this grant. In this way the Government contributes over
70 per cent towards the current income of universities and about 90 per cent
towards their capital programmes for building work, purchasing sites and
properties, professional fees and furniture and equipment. Further sums are
raised by the universities themselves.
In Great Britain the recurrent grants for the academic year 1969-70 are
provisionally estimated at some £159 million, over three times the amount for
1959-60. Capital grants paid out during 1969-70 are expected to be about
£61 million, approaching three times the 1959-60 figure. In 1945 the total
public expenditure, capital and current, on universities was ^4 million.
Mainly because of this large increase, the Comptroller and Auditor General
(see p. 361) has access to the books and records of the University Grants
Committee and the universities to check that the funds entrusted to the
universities are efficiently administered. He cannot question policy decisions
or decisions reached on academic grounds.
Courses in arts and science are offered by most universities. At nearly all
universities courses are available in one or more applied sciences. Imperial
College, London, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Tech¬
nology, the University of Strathclyde and some of the newer universities
concentrate on technology although they may also offer a number of courses
in social studies, modern languages and other non-technological subjects.
About 43-5 per cent of full-time university students in Great Britain are
taking arts or social studies courses and 42-5 per cent science and technology;
more than 10-3 per cent are studying medicine, dentistry and health, and the
remainder agriculture, forestry, veterinary science, architecture and town and
country planning.
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though
in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science five or six years are required.
The first degree of Bachelor (Master for Arts, in the older Scottish univer¬
sities) is awarded on the completion of such a course, depending on satisfactory
examination results. Further study or research is required at the modern
universities for the degree of Master and by all universities for that of Doctor.
Actual degree titles vary according to the practice of each university. Diplomas
and certificates are awarded after shorter courses in some subjects. A uniform
standard of degree throughout the country is ensured by having external
examiners on all examining boards. In the last decade there has been a
tendency for degree courses to become more broadly based in subject matter,
particularly in the new universities.
University teaching combines lectures, practical classes (in scientific
subjects) and small group teaching in either seminars or tutorials, the last
being a traditional feature of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all
universities there are postgraduate students engaged in research.
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no
religious test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with
men, but at Cambridge their numbers may be limited by ordinance. The
l6o BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
general proportion of men to women students is nearly three to one; at
Oxford it is nearly five to one, and at Cambridge eight to one. A third of all
full-time university students in Britain are living in colleges and halls of
residence, slightly under a half are in lodgings, and the remainder live at home.
Despite recent expansion programmes, applications for places at universities
for arts studies still exceed the number available. Prospective candidates for
nearly all the universities apply for places through the Universities Central
Council on Admissions. The only students to apply directly are Scottish
candidates for the universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee.
At the beginning of the academic year 1968-69 there were over 212,000
full-time university students in Britain. About 38,000 were postgraduate.
There were also in 1968-69 some 20,000 part-time students, more than
75 per cent of whom were working for university-level qualifications. A
further 22,500 registered for London University’s external degree, the main
external degree available in Britain.
Staff In 1968-69 there were about 30,000 full-time university teachers in Great
Britain; about 10 per cent of them were professors. The ratio of staff to
students was about one to eight, one of the most favourable in the world.
Colleges of Teachers in maintained schools must hold qualifications approved by the
Education education departments. In England and Wales the majority qualify by
undertaking a three-year course of studies at a college of education. There are
also opportunities for college students to obtain a degree (Bachelor of Education
(BEd)) as well as a professional qualification by means of a four-year course.
There are special shortened courses for well-qualified older students.
University graduates and certain specialist teachers are qualified by their
degree or specialist qualification although many do an additional one-year
course at a university or college of education. In Scotland all teachers in
secondary schools must be graduates (or have equivalent qualifications) and
must have taken a course of teacher training but primary school teachers may
qualify by taking a three-year course at a college of education. The General
Teaching Council has almost complete powers over the profession excluding
salary matters but including the function of maintaining a register of qualified
teachers.
In England and Wales there are 161 colleges of education 16 of which are
for day students only, 5 departments of education in technical colleges, 28
university departments of education, 4 colleges for training teachers for
technical institutions and 13 art teacher training centres. In 1968-69 there
were about 105,000 students in colleges and departments of education
outside universities (including over 7,000 in day colleges), about 5,700 in
university departments of education, and nearly 2,200 in colleges of education
(technical) and art teacher training centres. The total of 113,000 students
is three and a half times that for 1958-59. In Scotland there are 10 colleges of
education; the number of students in training in 1968 was 11,120 with a
proposed increase to over 14,000 in 1970-71. Thus the Robbins report target
of 122,000 teacher training places in Great Britain by 1973-74 has been nearly
achieved already. More day colleges are being opened, some training is
organised on a part-time basis and there are more refresher courses, and more
nursery classes for children of potential teachers.
The education departments, universities, local education authorities and
other bodies provide a variety of short in-service training courses for
practising teachers.

In 1967-68 over 203,000 students in Great Britain were taking advanced
courses other than in universities and colleges of education in a wide variety
of subjects including architecture, art and design (see p. 219), catering,
engineering, natural sciences and business studies. An increasing proportion
of the students were taking courses leading to the awards of the Council for
National Academic Awards. The Council has power to award degrees and
other academic qualifications, comparable in standard with those granted by
universities, to students who successfully complete approved courses of
study in establishments which do not have the power to award their own
degrees. In 1968-69 there were 203 courses being followed by about 15,660
students in 48 colleges. These courses were mainly in science and technology
but included the arts, social studies, business studies and law, and some
subjects in which there are few or no courses offered in universities. The
Council’s powers extend over the whole of Great Britain.
The Government is concentrating higher education provision outside
universities and colleges of education within 30 major national institutions
being renamed ‘polytechnics’ and formed from some 60 existing colleges.
They will have, ultimately, at least 2,000 full-time students each and will be
comprehensive institutions providing all types of courses (full-time, sandwich
and part-time) at all levels of higher education. By September 1969 eight
polytechnics had been designated.
Management studies are provided by universities and technical colleges,
by individual companies and by trade and industrial federations. (For the two
postgraduate business schools, see p. 158.) Certain independent colleges
specialise in management training. Several universities have introduced
management studies into the curriculum and courses for the postgraduate
Diploma in Management Studies are run by certain technical colleges. In
Scotland courses leading to the Certificate of Business Administration are
provided for students in junior supervisory positions.
Awards to enable students to undertake higher education are made under one
of the most generous grant systems in the world. It is national policy that no
boy or girl should be prevented by lack of means from taking an advanced
course at a university or elsewhere. As a result, over 90 per cent of students in
higher education in Great Britain are aided from private or public funds.
A UNESCO survey indicates that university students in Britain come from a
wider social background than those in any other western European country.
In England, Wales and Scotland most adequately qualified British students
can obtain awards from public funds in order to attend full-time at a university,
college of education or major further education establishment. In England and
Wales local education authorities provide awards. In Scotland students’
allowances for advanced courses are granted by the Scottish Education
Department. The amount of these awards depends upon the income of the
student and his parents. Studentships for advanced postgraduate study are
offered annually by the Department of Education and Science, the Research
Councils and the Scottish Education Department.
Two institutions provide university education in Northern Ireland—Queen’s
University of Belfast and the New University of Ulster, Coleraine, which
will incorporate Magee University College, Londonderry. The New
University, which was opened in October 1968, consists of four schools
(biological studies, social and economic studies, physical sciences, and
humanities) and an education centre with the status of a school. Technological
162 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
studies are to be concentrated at Queen’s University, Belfast. The report of
the committee on higher education published in 1965 (the Lockwood Report,
see Bibliography, p. 474), estimated that the number of full-time university
places required in Northern Ireland by 1980 would be between 12,000 and
13,000. About 7,000 will be in Queen’s University and the remainder in the
New University. In 1968-69 there were 6,114 students at Queen’s University,
392 at the New University, and 345 at Magee University College. Between
1958 and 1968 nearly ^16-1 million was spent on university building projects
and further expansion over the next 10 years is planned. Recurrent expenditure
in 1968-69 was estimated at nearly £3-4 million. Government grants are
made by the Ministry of Education which usually first seeks the advice of
the University Grants Committee.
Teacher training takes place in the university departments of education
and six training colleges, with a total of 2,652 students in 1968-69. In Belfast
there are three general colleges of education which provide three-year
certificate courses and four-year degree courses (awarded by Queen’s
University). In addition, they provide one-year courses for university
graduates and others, including serving teachers. The other three colleges
of education provide more specialised teacher training courses. University
and further education scholarships are awarded by local authorities and
postgraduate awards and teacher training scholarships by the Ministry of
Education, the conditions of award being the same as those for Great Britain.
EDUCATIONAL Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
RESEARCH educational services is supported financially by the educational departments,
local education authorities, philanthropic organisations, universities and
teachers’ associations. The Social Science Research Council is an additional
channel for government support.
The greater proportion of educational research is done in the universities,
particularly within departments or institutes of education and departments
concerned with sociology, psychology, statistics and problems of physical and
mental handicap. Outside universities, the major research institute is the
National Foundation for Educational Research, an autonomous body which
derives its income mainly from corporate members, including local education
authorities, teachers’ organisations and universities and from an annual grant
from the Department of Education and Science. There are also the Scottish
Council for Research in Education and the Northern Ireland Council for
Educational Research. The Schools Council sponsors a number of projects in
England and Wales.
There is no single central organisation for the co-ordination of educational
research, but the central departments, by their allocation of funds for projects,
exercise some influence on the direction of research effort. In 1968-69 the
Department of Education and Science had a total commitment of about £2
million spread over 135 projects, and current expenditure exceeded £490,000,
the Scottish Education Department’s grant to the Scottish Council and other
research bodies totalled about £60,000.
Among philanthropic organisations that provide generously for research are
the Nuffield Foundation and Ford Foundation, the Gulbenkian Trust, the
Leverhulme Trust, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie United King¬
dom Trust, the Wolfson Foundation and the Foundation for Management
Education.

There are many opportunities for overseas students to study in Britain and
for British students to study abroad and British teachers are encouraged to
serve overseas for a period.
Overseas Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
Students universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In
in Britain the academic year 1967-68 there were 69,831 overseas students in Britain,
of whom about 15,886 were at universities, another 14,726 at technical
colleges and the remainder learning English or training as teachers, doctors
and nurses, for the law, banking and accountancy, or in industry. About 60
per cent of all overseas students were from the Commonwealth.
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to students and research workers from
other countries. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan,
the Governments of certain Commonwealth countries have made awards
available at their own institutions of higher education to men and women from
other Commonwealth countries. At the beginning of the academic year
1968-69, 637 scholarships and fellowships (including medical awards) were
held in Britain. In addition the Commonwealth Bursary Scheme achieved
a total of 558 teachers and others training in Britain. Examples of smaller
government schemes are the Athlone Fellowship Scheme, under which
about 40 fellowships a year are awarded to Canadian engineering graduates
for up to two years’ further study, training and research in institutions or
industries in Britain, and the Indian Centres of Advanced Study Scheme in
which, as part of a plan for establishing links between British and Indian
universities, academic staff from 12 Indian universities spend a period with
British universities.
About 500 British Council1 scholarships, tenable usually for one year in
Britain, are offered annually to graduates of overseas universities. Twenty-four
Marshall Scholarships for two years’ study at any university in Britain are
offered annually by the British Government to graduates from the United
States of America and over 60 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to
Commonwealth and United States graduates for two years of study at the
University of Oxford. From 1970 a further two Rhodes scholarships will be
awarded, to graduates from the Federal Republic of Germany. Other
universities and colleges themselves offer many scholarships for which
graduate students of any nationality are eligible.2
1 The purpose of the British Council (founded in 1934) is defined in its Royal Charter as
the promotion of a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the English language
abroad and the development of closer cultural relations between Britain and other
countries. The Council is governed by an executive committee of 30 members,
broadly representative of many elements of the life of Britain and including nine
members nominated by ministers. It is financed almost entirely from public funds.
The activities of the Council, which has staff in 75 overseas countries, are concerned
with: English language teaching and other educational work including science;
fostering personal contacts between British and overseas people, especially in the
educational, professional and scientific fields; running, or helping to maintain, libraries
of British books and periodicals overseas; and presenting overseas the best in the arts
in Britain. Its work in Britain is concerned mainly with professional visitors and with
the welfare of overseas students.
2 The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes every two years a handbook.
United Kingdom Postgraduate Awards (see Bibliography, p. 474), listing postgraduate
awards tenable at universities in Britain (and a short list of awards at overseas
universities for which British students are eligible). The Association promotes
co-operation between Commonwealth universities. It provides publication and
information services, and also makes available secretariats for various bodies affecting
its member institutions, such as the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission and the
Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission.

Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are avail¬
able under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Colombo Plan, the Special
Commonwealth African Assistance Plan and British technical assistance
programmes for many other countries. Large numbers of awards for study or
training in Britain are also made under the United Nations Programmes of
Technical Assistance and by the United Nations specialised agencies such as
UNESCO, FAO and WHO.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth.
The fourth Commonwealth Education Conference was held in Lagos in
1968.
The national representatives in London (Office of the High Commissioner or
Embassy) of a number of countries accept certain special responsibilities for
their students in Britain. The British Council acts as an agent for the overseas
departments of State in matters affecting the welfare of overseas students,
and provides certain services, such as meeting on arrival, introduction
courses, an accommodation bureau and student centres in London and other
university cities. The Council also organises a varied programme of lectures,
discussions and social and other activities and arranges introductions of
students to people who wish to invite them to their homes. In the vacations
there are courses in many parts of the country which offer opportunities for
getting to know more about British life in town and country. In term time
there are visits to various places of interest, and theatre and concert parties are
arranged.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas
students are the East and West Friendship Council, Rotary, Round Table,
the Victoria League, the Royal Over-Seas League, the Royal Commonwealth
Society, the National Union of Students, the English-Speaking Union and
Churches of all denominations. The United Kingdom Council for Overseas
Student Affairs, established in July 1968, is an independent central body
serving overseas students and organisations and individuals concerned in
overseas students affairs; it provides both a forum for the exchange of ideas
and machinery for consultation with government and other authorities. The
London Conference on Overseas Students, for which the British Council
provides the secretariat, co-ordinates work of voluntary organisations for
overseas students in the metropolis. In many London boroughs and in other
large cities there are committees which help students to make contact with
local residents and organisations. Similar conferences have come into being
in other large cities in Britain. These organisations also help by entertaining
overseas students and many of them have established hostels with the financial
help of the Overseas Students Welfare Expansion Programme which is
administered by the British Council. By the beginning of 1969 grants had
been approved for 98 projects, providing places for about 4,000 students.
Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, a number of
scholarships are made available annually to United Kingdom students by the
Governments of other Commonwealth countries for study in their universities,
colleges and other institutions of higher learning. In 1968-69, 62 scholarships
were held by United Kingdom students in eight Commonwealth countries. In
addition the Study and Serve Scheme enables British students to undertake
a year’s postgraduate study at universities in the developing countries on
condition that they also work for a period in appropriate employment in the
country concerned.

For many years the United States/United Kingdom Educational Commis¬
sion (still sometimes called the Fulbright Commission) has offered travel
grants for postgraduate study in the United States. Notable among more
recently established scholarships are the Kennedy scholarships, to enable
British students to study at three American universities, and the Churchill
travel scholarships, for men and women in all walks of life. British students
are also offered scholarships at institutions of higher education in 22 European
and 10 non-European countries outside the Commonwealth.
About 1,250 teachers were recruited in Britain during 1968 for posts in
schools, colleges of education, technical colleges and universities in developing
countries, including 1,000 for posts in the developing countries of the
Commonwealth; almost all of them are supported by public funds. Steps
taken by the Government to help school teachers to serve for a period overseas
have included the establishment of a National Council for the Supply and
Training of Teachers Overseas and the introduction of special measures to
safeguard their interests both while abroad and on their return home.
Recruitment is carried out by the Ministry of Overseas Development, the
British Council and the voluntary teacher recruiting agencies, such as the
Catholic Overseas Appointments and the Overseas Appointments Bureaux.
There are about 1,000 British university teachers serving overseas, most of
them recruited through the Inter-University Council for Higher Education
Overseas in collaboration, in some cases, with the Association of Common¬
wealth Universities and the British Council. Government encouragement also
includes support for a number of schemes of assistance for overseas univer¬
sities which are administered by the Inter-University Council, including the
scheme for Special Commonwealth Awards, which are made to leading scholars
from British universities who are willing to work for a minimum of two years
in important posts in the universities of developing Commonwealth countries.
Outside the schemes, an increasing number of graduate and qualified
volunteers, also cadet volunteers (school leavers), 1,787 in 1968-69, are going
overseas for one or two years, a large number to teach. Many of them go with
the support of voluntary bodies (co-ordinated under the British Volunteer
Programme) which receive financial assistance from the Government.
Interchange schemes, under wrhich teachers in Britain exchange posts for
a year with teachers overseas, include one with the United States and another
with Commonwealth countries whereby each year over 100 British teachers
exchange posts with teachers from Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Official
exchange schemes also operate between Britain and several European countries
both for teachers and for temporary assistants’ posts for language specialists.
Britain provides, on request, assistance to the developing countries in several
other ways, including the loan of educational experts for technical and
consultant services and specialist missions, through various educational
organisations and the Ministry of Overseas Development. For example, the
Centre for Educational Television Overseas (see p. 440) helps to advance the
education of adults and children in developing countries by means of television,
and the Oversea Visual Aids Centre in London gives advice to teachers and
others from overseas countries on all aspects of audio-visual aids1. Financial
assistance is also given for building and equipping educational institutions.
1 The Government proposes to combine these two organisations and the Centre for
Curriculum Renewal and Educational Development Overseas into one new
organisation, which will begin work on 1st April 1970.

YOUTH SERVICES
The object of youth services in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time
activities of young people in the 14 to 20 age group (these age limits are under
review), and to offer them opportunities—complementary to those of home,
formal education and work—for discovering and developing their personal
resources, so that they may be better equipped to be responsible members of
the community. Membership of youth organisations is voluntary and the
facilities are sufficiently varied to appeal to every type of boy and girl.
A number of youth organisations have spontaneously developed over the last
century, mainly by voluntary effort. These organisations now work in
partnership with local education authorities and the central government in the
Youth Service. There is no attempt to impose uniformity or to create any
national youth organisation. The status of Youth Service as an essential part
of the educational system of Great Britain was confirmed by the Education
Act 1944 and the Education (Scotland) Act 1945; in Northern Ireland, youth
welfare work is promoted under the Education Act (Northern Ireland) 1947,
and the Youth Welfare, Physical Training and Recreation Act (Northern
Ireland) 1962.
The education departments provide grants in aid of the administrative and
training work of some national voluntary youth organisations, towards the
expense of training full-time youth leaders and towards the cost of premises
and equipment of youth clubs provided by voluntary bodies.
Local education authorities co-operate with voluntary organisations in their
areas: most give some financial help and lend premises and equipment; most
also employ youth organisers to help in the promotion and encouragement
of youth work. Where voluntary services are considered inadequate, local
authorities themselves organise youth centres and clubs. Almost all local
authorities have appointed youth committees on which official and voluntary
bodies are represented.
In addition to grants received from the State and local authorities, voluntary
organisations may receive help for special projects from charitable trusts.
Most of the funds of the voluntary organisations are raised by their own efforts.
Ministers are advised on the finance and development of the Youth Service
by the Youth Service Development Council for England and Wales, the
Standing Consultative Council on Youth and Community Service for Scotland
and the Youth and Sports Council for Northern Ireland. Annual grants to
the value of about £370,000 are made towards the headquarters expenses of
the national voluntary youth organisations and there are special grants for
voluntary projects. The Department of Education and Science authorised a
£4-5 million building programme for England and Wales for the period
1969-70, compared with £3 -8 million for 1968-69. There is a national training
college for youth leaders at Leicester, where there is also an information
centre; there are nearly 1,700 trained youth leaders. Local authorities’
contributions to the youth service in England and Wales amounted to some
£11-9 million in 1968-69. In Scotland annual expenditure on the youth
services is estimated at about £400,000.
The Voluntary The voluntary organisations vary greatly in character since nearly all of them
Organisations were formed to serve specific groups of young people; some of them provide
educational and religious activities as well as social and recreational pursuits
for their members, and all of them seek to inculcate high ideals of personal
conduct and service to the community.

Twenty-seven national voluntary youth organisations, all with memberships
of at least 10,000, are constituent members of the Standing Conference of
National Voluntary Youth Organisations, a consultative body which takes
action only in the name of its member bodies and with their consent. A further
30 bodies are associate or observer members, for example, the Church of
England Youth Council, which represents about 400,000 young people who
are members of clubs sponsored by the Church of England. The corresponding
body in Scotland is the Scottish Standing Conference of Voluntary Youth
Organisations, in Northern Ireland the Standing Conference of Youth Organi¬
sations, and in Wales the Standing Conference for Wales of Voluntary
Youth Organisations. These major organisations have a total United Kingdom
membership of about 3 million young people under 21.
Among the youth organisations with a mainly religious origin and purpose
are the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) and Young Women’s
Christian Association (YWCA), with about 52,000 and 18,000 members under
21 respectively; the Boys’ Brigade (148,000), the Church Lads’ Brigade
(11,500), the Girls’ Brigade (99,000), the Girls’ Friendly Society (23,000),
the Methodist Association of Youth Clubs (121,000), the Salvation Army
Youth Organisations (95,000), the Catholic Young Men’s Society of Great
Britain (15,000), the Catholic Youth Service Council (39,000), the Young
Christian Workers (18,000), and the Association for Jewish Youth (25,000).
The Scouts Association and Girl Guides Association have world-wide
affiliations; they are undenominational and non-political, and were founded
by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 to develop character and good
citizenship in boys and girls. Their total membership in Britain under 21
is about 460,000 scouts and 694,000 guides.
The National Association of Boys’ Clubs, with about 2,000 affiliated clubs
and 169,000 members, and the National Association of Youth Clubs, with
over 3,000 affiliated clubs and 288,000 members, are concerned mainly with
the 14 to 20 age group. Each affiliated club has its own rules, but all aim at
giving young people opportunities to develop into mature members of
society. Representatives from clubs form local committees and these send
representatives to the national members’ councils.
A notable trend in recent years has been the growth in voluntary service by
young people to those in need in the community, such as the elderly and the
sick, the mentally ill and the handicapped. Through organisations such as
International Voluntary Service, Community Service Volunteers, Task Force,
Toe H and others, thousands of young people are doing valuable voluntary
work, both within and outside Britain. The Government has set up the
Young Volunteer Force Foundation which controls a team of 30 young people
available on request to assist local authorities, hospitals and other organisations
in encouraging and organising voluntary service.
The pre-Service organisations for boys (the Combined Cadet Force,
Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps) combine social, educational and
physical development with training for possible entry into the armed forces;
their combined membership is about 120,000. The Combined Cadet Force
(CCF) contingents are based on schools in which education is continued to
the age of 17 or beyond. Training normally begins at 14 and the boys can
choose whether they will join the Royal Navy, Army or Royal Air Force
sections. The Army Cadet Force and the Air Training Corps are for boys in
schools that do not have CCF contingents or for those who have left school.
The Sea Cadet Corps, although not a pre-Service organisation, helps boys
who wish to make their career at sea; its membership is about 20,000. The
i68
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Girls’ Venture Corps, with about 7,000 members, has an Air Wing offering
aviation courses.
The National Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs in England and Wales
has about 40,000 members between 10 and 25 years old, the Scottish Associa¬
tion of Young Farmers’ Clubs has about 7,500 and Northern Ireland Young
Farmer Clubs about 4,000 members: in addition to encouraging interest in
agriculture and appreciation of country life, the clubs provide training in the
arts of citizenship and develop ability to serve the community.
The Welsh League of Youth (Urdd Gobaith Cymru) has a membership of
about 44,500; its aim is the ‘development of Christian citizenship among the
youth of Wales’.
The Youth Hostels Associations in England and Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have a network of hostels for walkers and cyclists, particu¬
larly intended for young people of limited means. They seek to promote
knowledge and love of the countryside, and are closely linked with each other
and with similar organisations in other countries.
Adult organisations with youth sections include the British Red Cross
Society, St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade and the political parties.
Other King George’s Jubilee Trust was established in 1935 by King George V to
Organisations promote the welfare of the younger generation. Since its inauguration it has
Concerned with disbursed nearly £2 million to the headquarters of the principal voluntary
Youth Work youth organisations and to many local projects, particularly those of an
experimental nature.
In 1968 about 130,300 young people between the ages of 14 and 20 took
part in the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, which is a scheme operated by local
authorities, schools, youth organisations, industrial firms and other bodies,
and is designed as a challenge to boys and girls to reach certain standards of
achievement in leisure-time activities. There are three separate levels of
Award—Gold, Silver and Bronze—each comprising four sections. Three of
the sections, entitled service, pursuits and interests, and expedition, are
common to boys and girls; the fourth section is physical activity, for boys, and
design for living, for girls. A number of Commonwealth countries, including
Canada, Australia and New Zealand, now operate the scheme.
The Outward Bound Trust maintains in Great Britain five schools for boys
which offer 26-day character-building courses, based on adventure and
overcoming testing experiences. There is a similar school for girls, with
modified courses. About 5,000 boys and 5,000 girls, between the ages of 14
and 19I, take part each year. There are also courses for young men over 20.
The aims of the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the Scottish
Council of Physical Recreation and the National Playing Fields Association
bring them into touch with many youth organisations (see Chapter 19).
In addition to organisations on a nation-wide basis, there are a large number
of town, district or village social clubs run by voluntary groups for general or
particular purposes, for instance, photographic societies, folk dance, table
tennis or jazz clubs.
7 PLANNING AND
HOUSING
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world: it is, therefore,
essential to plan land use for a satisfactory national distribution of employment
and population, to undertake a programme of urban renewal, to build new
towns and to preserve the amenities of the countryside.
From 1909 successive Acts of Parliament recognised the principle of the
planned use of land, but because the pattern of development over much of
the country had already hardened into large unplanned urban concentrations
the powers granted to local planning authorities were inadequate.
The 20 years between the two world wars were decades of rapid social
and industrial change and of developments in industry, engineering, house¬
building, and motor transport; the population was increasing and becoming
more mobile; there was a widespread demand for improved standards of
accommodation and consequently a greater need for systematic planning than
had hitherto been required. At the beginning of the 1930s a major effort was
made to strengthen planning law and to extend the planning powers of central
and local authorities. This resulted in the Town and Country Planning Acts
of 1932 which remained the basis of planning law for 15 years.
Although inter-war planning legislation improved sanitary and environ¬
mental conditions and did something to preserve amenities, its general effect
was unsatisfactory mainly because it failed to deal adequately with the prob¬
lems involved in compensating property owners who stood to lose by the
introduction of positive planning schemes. Local authorities often hesitated to
exercise their powers effectively for fear of being involved in financial
liabilities beyond their means, and as a result there was still much unregulated
urban development spreading over the countryside.
Renewed efforts to tackle these problems were made immediately before
and during the second world war. Between 1937 and 1942 three expert com¬
mittees were appointed to study and report upon the unregulated growth and
spread of industry; the restriction of planning by the financial and administra¬
tive difficulties of compensation and betterment; and the encroachment of
urban development upon the countryside. After the second world war other
committees studied the question of new towns and national parks. Almost all
the principal planning recommendations of these committees have now been
incorporated in Acts of Parliament. Two comprehensive Town and Country
Planning Acts (one for England and Wales and one for Scotland), introduced
in 1947, imposed compulsory planning duties on all local planning authorities
(the larger local authorities) and gave them extensive powers to acquire and
develop land for planning purposes. The Acts also established a centralised
planning structure under which the Minister of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment and the Secretary of State for Scotland (and since 1965 the Secretary of
State for Wales) had the duty of approving all development plans and making
decisions on appeals against development control decisions. Over the past few
years the increase in population, leading to a demand for more and better

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
housing, and the growth in the volume of motor traffic with its effects on the
structure of towns and on the countryside (see p. 175), have overstrained the
planning system.
The Town and Country Planning Act 1968 provides for a new procedure
to reduce administrative delays; to place emphasis on a positive approach to-
provide pleasant surroundings in which people might live and work, rather
than on negative controls; and to enable the public to play a greater part in
the planning process than hitherto. The Act provides for ‘structure’ plans to
be drawn up by local planning authorities (the councils of counties and county
boroughs, the London authorities and, in some cases, joint planning boards)
in England and Wales and submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local
Government or the Secretary of State for Wales for approval. These plans
set out ‘broad policies’ for land use in counties and major towns and relate
these policies to transport patterns. They also indicate ‘action areas’ where
development, redevelopment or improvement is expected to start within a
specified period.
In addition, under the new system, local planning authorities prepare local
plans which they formally adopt, generally without the need for ministerial
approval. These plans contain detailed proposals (including plans for the
action areas) within the framework of the structure plans. All the plans may
be amended periodically. The new procedure is being introduced progress¬
ively where the local planning authorities are suitably staffed and organised
to draw up satisfactory structure plans, for example, in Greater London. It
may be adapted to whatever form the structure of local government might take
in the 1970s (see p. 66). Similar legislation was passed in 1969 for Scotland.
The interests of the public are safeguarded in a number of ways. All
proposals for development must be widely advertised. In the case of large
development schemes of regional importance, such as the siting of an airport,
the Ministers responsible may decide to set up Planning Inquiry Commissions
to study the proposals in depth. Appeals against other major development
proposals are dealt with at ministerial level but, in order to speed up planning
procedures, the responsibility for decisions on small-scale residential develop¬
ment is delegated to inspectors.
In Northern Ireland applications for permission to undertake development
are the responsibility of local planning authorities, with a right of appeal to
the Northern Ireland Ministry of Development. Proposals for changes in the
administration of planning have been published. A Central Development
Office would be responsible for the continuing review of the region’s plan and
for the preparation of area plans under the guidance of steering committees
composed of local authority representatives. Local planning authorities would
be responsible for preparing ‘action plans’, including urban renewal schemes
and other development projects in a defined area.
Advisory machinery for planning on a regional basis has been set up by the
Government (see p. 238). Local planning authorities are advised to consult the
regional economic planning councils before drawing up their development
plans. Studies showing the economic and social resources in several regions
have been made (see Bibliography, p. 480) and certain areas, where land,
communications and facilities are favourable, have been proposed as places
where development should be concentrated.
Provisions relating to the location of industry and offices have been made in
the Town and Country Planning Acts, the Local Employment Acts 1960-66,
New Towns
PLANNING AND HOUSING I7I
the Control of Office and Industrial Development Act 1965, and the Industrial
Development Act 1966. General problems of industrial development are
dealt with jointly by a number of government departments, but the consent
of the local planning authority is, as a rule, required for any new industrial
building, any extension of a building or any change in the use of an existing
building. Financial incentives to encourage the location of industry in particular
areas have been made available by successive governments (see p. 253). There
is special control on office building in south-east England and the Midlands.
The New Towns Act 1946 (now consolidated in Acts passed in 1965 and 1968)
gave the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of
State for Scotland power to make an order designating any area of land
(which may include any existing town or other centre of population) as the
site of a new town; in 1965 the same power was given to the Secretary of State
for Wales. The Minister of Development in Northern Ireland has powers to
designate areas as new towns or for special development under the New
Towns Act (Northern Ireland) 1965. The appropriate minister must consult
the local authorities in the area about the proposal and an opportunity is given
for objections to be made by the public. Once the site has been designated,
the Minister appoints a development corporation (a development commission
in Northern Ireland), consisting of a chairman, a deputy chairman and up to
seven other members, to be responsible for the development of the new town,
including the preparation of a ‘master plan’.
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the
consent of the appropriate minister) to acquire, by agreement or compulsory
purchase, land or property within the designated areas, or, in some cases,
land near to or outside those areas, and they may provide buildings, roads and
services essential for the development of the towns. Ministerial approval of
proposals for development, given after consultation with the local planning
authority, constitutes planning permission.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced from public
funds and is repayable over 60 years out of the income from the property.
The corporations submit annual reports (which include copies of their
audited accounts) to Parliament.
Thirty-one new towns have been, or are being, established in Britain;
twenty-two in England and Wales, five in Scotland and four in Northern
Ireland. Eleven of the new towns in England and Wales (Basildon, Bracknell,
Crawley, Harlow, Hatfield, Kernel Hempstead, Milton Keynes, Northamp¬
ton, Peterborough, Stevenage and Welwyn) are designed to help relieve
housing problems in the Greater London area. Of the others, Aycliffe, Corby,
Cwmbran, Peterlee and Washington are serving the special needs of their
areas; Runcorn and Skelmersdale are to meet the overspill needs of Liverpool
and north Merseyside; Telford and Redditch will take population from
Birmingham; and Warrington will be expanded to take people from Man¬
chester. Newtown in mid-Wales is to be developed to promote economic
growth in the area.
To help further in solving the housing problem in Manchester and Liver¬
pool large-scale development in the Preston-Leyland-Chorley area of
Lancashire is proposed. Studies are also being made of the possibilities of
development in the Dundee and Tayside area and the region of the Severn
river to provide for a rapidly growing population.
The Scottish new towns (Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Irvine
and Livingston) are helping to house people from Glasgow. Irvine and

Livingston are also to be centres for industrial activity in the central belt of
Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, Craigavon is being developed as a new city and is
expected to become an area of major industrial growth. Other new towns,
of which two, Antrim and Ballymena, have been designated, are also to be
developed as centres of economic growth. Londonderry and the surrounding
district has been designated as an area of special development.
Four new towns, Crawley, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead and Welwyn,
have been substantially completed and their development corporations
dissolved. Their assets and liabilities have been handed over to the Commis¬
sion for the New Towns—a government-appointed agency set up in 1959.
The new towns represent a notable achievement in positive land use. They
are generally recognised as one of the most successful post-war experiments,
both socially and industrially, and as a profitable long-term investment. More
than half a million people have moved into the new towns during the past
20 years; young people form a higher proportion of their populations than in
the country as a whole. An extensive building and civil engineering programme
has provided houses, flats, factories, schools, shops, churches, health centres
and libraries as well as public buildings including the town hall and law
courts. Roads, water supplies, sewerage, gas and electricity, police, fire and
bus stations, postal, telegraph and telephone facilities have also been provided;
most of the towns are well equipped with parks and playing fields of various
kinds. All towns have become concerned with the increasingly high level of car
ownership of their inhabitants and are making more adequate provision for
parking and the segregation of pedestrians from motorists.
A number of the more developed towns are becoming regional centres and,
as the populations grow large enough to give the necessary support, offices,
hotels and department stores, as well as full entertainment and recreational
facilities such as skating rinks, dance halls, bowling alleys, swimming
pools, sports stadia, golf courses and youth centres are gradually being
provided. The proposed expansion of such large existing towns as Peter¬
borough represents a further development in the evolution of new towns
policy which has the advantage, among others, that many of these facilities
are already available.
Under the New Towns Act 1946 Parliament approved a fund of £50 million
to provide for advances to the development corporations for work on the new
towns. This fund was increased by subsequent Acts and now stands at £1,100
million; a total of some £640 million had been advanced to the corporations
by March 1969.
The Town Development Act 1952 makes provision for the relief of congestion
in large industrial towns in England and Wales (such as London and
Birmingham) by encouraging the transfer of population from these areas to
country areas suitable for expansion where employment is provided. Schemes
have been approved for providing some 150,000 dwellings in this way, of
which about a half have been completed or are under construction. Some of
the expanding towns, for example, Aylesbury, Basingstoke, Swindon and
Thetford, are already well established; further large-scale development is to
take place at Swindon. In other places, like Cramlington and Killingworth,
the expansion is based on relatively undeveloped areas. The Housing and
Town Development (Scotland) Act 1957 makes similar provision for Scotland.
Schemes have been approved for some 30,000 dwellings; about a quarter of
these have been completed.

The renewal and re-shaping of existing towns and cities is being undertaken
to meet the growth in population and the impact of more traffic. Glasgow,
for example, has started a programme of rebuilding 30 areas, housing nearly
a third of its population and accommodating much of the industry and
commerce of the city. The Buchanan report (see p. 334) which assessed the
conflicting demands of traffic and environmental standards has influenced
many authorities’ redevelopment plans. The Government believes that the
greater integration of land use and transport planning is of basic importance.
A centre for environmental studies financed by the Government and the
Ford Foundation (see p. 162) is sponsoring research into the problems of
urban planning.
Responsibility for the preservation of the historic, scenic and architectural
beauties of Great Britain rests mainly with the Minister of Housing and Local
Government, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of State for
Wales, and the local planning authorities. Lists of buildings of special
architectural or historic interest are being compiled (covering 114,860 so far).
Close supervision is maintained over development proposals that might affect
these buildings so that their character is not destroyed and emphasis is placed
on finding appropriate new uses for them. The respective Ministers (on the
recommendation of the appropriate Historic Buildings Council) are
responsible for administering the grants available for the repair and main¬
tenance of buildings of outstanding historic or architectural interest. Grants
totalling over £7! million have been made under the Historic Buildings and
Ancient Monuments Act 1953 towards the cost of urgently needed repairs to
over 1,500 historic buildings in England, Scotland and Wales. Under the Civic
Amenities Act 1967 local authorities have powers to protect areas of special
architectural or historic interest in towns. Special studies have been made
in Bath, Chester, Chichester and York to consider the particular difficulties
of preserving features of historic interest in ancient towns, in the face of com¬
mercial development and of the increase in motor traffic. The Minister of
Public Building and Works and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and
Wales are responsible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces and
(under the Ancient Monuments Acts) for the protection of ancient monu¬
ments of which over 750 of the more important are in their care. They are
visited by some 10 million people annually.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
special character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, the policy has
been adopted of establishing ‘green belts’ around all or part of certain urban
areas. Green belts are areas which it is intended should be left permanently
open and where, in consequence, there is a presumption against most new
development.
Local planning authorities have power to protect trees and woodlands by
means of tree preservation orders (some 8,200 of which are in force throughout
Great Britain) and to ensure that trees are protected or replaced on sites
undergoing development. Increasing use is being made of the planting of
semi-mature trees for landscaping purposes. The authorities have powers to
prevent mineral workings becoming permanent eyesores by attaching suitable
conditions to planning permissions, to regulate the display of advertisements
in the interests of amenity and safety and to make it an offence to leave litter,

including bulky rubbish such as old cars, on open land. They may, for health
reasons, declare ‘smoke control areas’, in which the emission of smoke from
chimneys constitutes an offence. River authorities (see p. 297) are responsible
for the prevention of pollution of rivers.
Voluntary organisations have been particularly active in ensuring that
development takes full account of considerations of amenity. The National
Trust for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which was founded in 1895
and now has some 160,000 members, is among the biggest land-owners in the
United Kingdom. It owns and protects from harmful development 400,000
acres of land and nearly 200 historic buildings for the benefit of the public—
often acquired through gifts (sometimes by arrangement with the Treasury in
lieu of death duties, see p. 364). With government support it is at present
engaged on a £2 million campaign, Enterprise Neptune, to preserve 900 miles
of coastline. The National Trust for Scotland is an independent body founded
in 1935. It has about 31,000 members and has under its care some 70
properties, covering in all about 70,000 acres.
The Civic Trust, financed through covenants from leading industrial
firms, was founded in 1957 to encourage high quality in architecture and
planning and to stimulate public interest in the protection of beauty in town
and country. It has, for example, produced plans for the redevelopment of
town centres and for a recreational area in the Lee Valley. The Trust makes
use of local initiative; it has separate sections in the north-east and north-west of
England and in Wales and Scotland and advises some 600 local civic societies.
Other amenity societies dependent upon the support of their members
include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, the Association
for the Preservation of Rural Scotland and the Council for the Preservation of
Rural Wales; the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation
Society; the Ramblers’ Association; the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings; the Georgian Group; the Victorian Society; the Pilgrim Trust;
and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust.
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 provided that
selected areas of beautiful and relatively wild country in England and Wales
should become national parks, where the characteristic landscape would be
safeguarded and facilities for open-air recreation provided or improved.
A National Parks Commission, now replaced by the Countryside Commis¬
sion (see p. 175), was set up by the Act and given responsibility for selecting
national parks and ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’ and making proposals
for the creation of long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks
have been established: Northumberland, the Lake District, the Yorkshire
Dales, the North York Moors and the Peak District in the north of England;
Snowdonia, the Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons in Wales;
Exmoor and Dartmoor in the south-west of England. They cover a total area
of some 5,260 square miles, or 9 per cent of the total area of England and
Wales. They have various forms of administration, based on representation
of the local planning authorities of the areas in which they are situated, as well
as members appointed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government
or by the Secretary of State for Wales. By 1969, 25 areas of outstanding natural
beauty had been designated covering some 4,300 square miles.
The land in these parks and designated areas generally remains in private
ownership, but agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be
made by the local authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the
natural beauty of the landscape by high standards of development control, and

by positive measures, for which government grants are available, such as tree
planting and preservation, and the removal of eyesores. In national parks,
public enjoyment is promoted, for example, by the provision of car parks and
camping and caravan areas and the setting up of information centres. All
national parks and some other designated areas have warden services. Nearly
1,300 miles of long-distance footpaths and bridleways had been approved by
1969. Large stretches of these paths are already public rights of way; the first
long-distance footpath to be completed, the Pennine Way, stretches for some
250 miles. Further routes are being established.
Under the Amenity Lands Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 the Ulster Country¬
side Committee advises on the establishment of national parks and the
designation of areas of outstanding natural beauty. Seven areas have been
designated.
Although there are no national parks as such in Scotland, five large areas
are subject to a special planning control under ministerial supervision. The
areas are Loch Lomond—Trossachs; Glen Affric—Glen Cannich—Strath
Farrar; Ben Nevis—Glen Coe—Black Mount; the Cairngorms; and Loch
Torridon—Loch Maree—-Little Loch Broom.
Under the Countryside Acts 1967 (for Scotland) and 1968 (for England and
Wales) Countryside Commissions have been set up to replace and extend the
work of the National Parks Commission because of the need for additional
facilities for leisure-time activities for a rising and increasingly mobile
population. The Commissions (with an advisory committee for Wales)
encourage the provision and development of opportunities for open-air
recreation in the countryside to relieve pressure on the national parks.
Measures envisaged include the creation by local authorities and others of
country parks within easy reach of towns; the establishment of camping sites
and picnic areas; and the increased use of reservoirs and canals for bathing,
sailing and other activities. The Commissions are also responsible for
encouraging and promoting measures to conserve and enhance the natural
beauty and amenity of the countryside and may undertake research projects
and experimental schemes, working in consultation with local authorities and
such bodies as the Nature Conservancy and the Sports Councils (see p. 449).
Grants are available from the Government for certain approved schemes and
the Commissions have powers to make grants or loans to people working for
the same purposes.
The Forestry Commission (see p. 323) has formed, and opened to the public,
seven Forest Parks in some of the finest country in Britain: Argyll, Glen Trool,
Glen More, and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the Forest
of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and Wales;
Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park on the borders of England
and Scotland. The total area of the seven parks approaches half a million acres.
Camping and other recreational facilities are provided in all the parks.
The historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a Forest Park, is also
open to the public.
Northern Ireland has three forest parks, Tollymore Park, Gortin Glen
Forest and Castlewellan.
Responsibility for nature conservation in Great Britain is exercised by the
Nature Conservancy on behalf of the Natural Environment Research Council
(see p. 202), of which the Conservancy is a component body. The Conservancy

derives its powers from its royal charter and the National Parks and Access to
the Countryside Act 1949, as amended by the Science and Technology Act
1965. In Northern Ireland nature reserves are designated on the advice of the
Nature Reserves Committee under the Amenity Lands Act (Northern
Ireland) 1965.
In the reserves wild plants and animals and the environment in which they
live are protected, and facilities for the enjoyment and understanding of
nature are provided. There are 127 national nature reserves in Great Britain,
covering some 262,500 acres. The largest (covering more than 64,000 acres) is
in the Cairngorms. Nineteen local nature reserves are managed by local
authorities in consultation with the Conservancy.
Thirteen forest nature reserves have also been set up; of these a number
have been created by agreement between the Forestry Commission and the
Nature Conservancy and are managed by the Commission.
There are also some 2,200 sites of special scientific interest scheduled by the
Conservancy and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Development in Britain.
The Council for Nature (established in 1958) is an independent voluntary
organisation of some 450 natural history and conservation societies concerned
with averting threats to wild life in Britain. It receives grants from the
Department of Education and Science and other bodies.
HOUSING
There are some 18-5 million dwellings in Britain: nearly 16-5 million in
England and Wales, 1-7 million in Scotland and more than 400,000 in
Northern Ireland. Nearly half the dwellings are owned by their occupiers,
about a third by public authorities (in Scotland the figure is almost one in
two), and most of the remainder (mainly older houses) are rented from private
landlords. Although the numbers of households and dwellings in Britain are
roughly equal they are unevenly distributed and there is a heavy demand for
housing in the areas of economic prosperity, like London and Birmingham.
Between 1945 and March 1969 over 6-6 million new houses and flats were
built; one family in three now lives in a post-war dwelling. Most of the new
dwellings in Britain are houses (usually of two storeys) with gardens; the
remainder are flats or maisonettes, mostly in blocks of from 2 to 20 storeys,
although a few blocks may be higher. High blocks are generally built in
central urban areas where they replace old, overcrowded dwellings.
Accommodation in a house designed for a family of four or five people
includes one or two living rooms, a kitchen, a bathroom and a water closet and
two or three bedrooms. A typical 3-bedroom house built by a local authority
in England and Wales in 1968 had a superficial area of about 960 square feet
and cost an average of £3,030. There are three people in the average British
household. Comparative European statistics show that the degree of over¬
crowding in Britain is lower than in most other countries.
Some 425,800 dwellings were completed in Britain in 1968—an all-time
record. The standard of new housing has improved significantly in recent
years, particularly in the floor space provided and heating systems installed
(see p. 178).
In view of the demand for home ownership, the Government believes that
about half the new dwellings built annually should be for owner-occupation
and has launched a scheme to help people with low incomes to buy their own

houses (see p. 178). The first priority of the Land Commission, established in
1967, is to make land more readily available at reasonable prices for private
enterprise housebuilding.
At the same time housing subsidies from the Government enable the 1,500
or so local housing authorities1 to provide some 200,000 new dwellings a year,
primarily for letting at relatively low rents to large families or those with
small incomes. In recent years about one-quarter of the dwellings built by
local authorities have been of the single bedroom type, suitable for old people.
A survey of existing housing in 1967 showed that there were some 4-5 million
old dwellings in England and Wales which were structurally sound but needed
repair or the installation of amenities such as bathrooms. Under two Housing
Acts 1969 (one for England and Wales, and one for Scotland) the Govern¬
ment offers greater financial incentives for the rehabilitation of older houses
and their environment (see p. 180). Programmes of slum clearance have been
speeded up in recent years particularly in the large conurbations (see p. 180).
In 1967 it was estimated that some i-8 million dwellings needed to be
demolished in England and Wales.
Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in
England, by the Secretaries of State in Scotland and Wales and the Minister
of Development in Northern Ireland.
Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that the provision of housing
in their areas is adequate. In England and Wales and Northern Ireland the
local housing authorities are the councils of county boroughs, boroughs,
urban districts and rural districts, the Greater London Council, the London
borough councils and the Common Council of the City of London. In
Scotland all town and county councils are housing authorities. The actual
building of dwellings is undertaken by the local authorities (or by building
firms under contract to them) and by private builders, usually for sale to
owner-occupiers.
Research into building techniques and into new methods of house construction
as well as into the needs of families, is carried out by the Research and
Development Groups of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and
of the Scottish Development Department, the Building Research Station, the
architects’ departments of major local authorities and the research groups in
big constructional firms. All government building research and development
is co-ordinated by the Directorate-General of Research and Development at
the Ministry of Public Building and Works. Advice on ways of increasing
productivity in housebuilding is given by the National Building Agency,
economic development committees set up for the civil engineering and
building industries, and by a committee of the Ministry of Public Building
and Works, which is concerned with small builders who undertake the
maintenance and improvement of existing houses where, for example, pre¬
fabricated plumbing and bathroom units can be used.
Control of building standards is generally exercised through regulations made
by the central departments, which also give guidance on design and layout to
local authorities in circulars and bulletins.
1 Including most new town authorities, the Scottish Special Housing Association, a
statutory body established in 1937 to erect houses for letting to supplement building
by local authorities (it now owns about 68,000 houses and builds at the rate of some
3,000 houses a year), and the Northern Ireland Housing Trust set up in 1945 for a
similar purpose which has built about a quarter of Northern Ireland’s post-war houses.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Central Housing Advisory Committee, a statutory body, issues reports
on housing standards. For example, the Parker Morris report (see Biblio¬
graphy, p. 475) suggested standards that should be achieved in new dwellings*
some relating to space and heating have been made mandatory for local
authority housing schemes, and now nearly 90 per cent of all new dwellings
have central heating. For building in the private sector the National House-
Builders’ Registration Council sets standards and enforces them by inspection
and certification. Some 90 per cent of all houses built in 1968 for owner-
occupation were guaranteed in this way. Many building societies and local
authorities make a condition that they will lend money on mortgage (see below)
only for dwellings built by house-builders registered with this Council or
built under professional supervision.
About 40 per cent of dwellings in the public sector are built by industrialised
methods, which offer the advantages of rapid construction on the site with the
use of fewer skilled workers and greater independence of weather conditions
compared with traditional methods. A number of local authorities work in
consortia to make the best use of industrialised systems (with standardised
components) in their house-building programmes.
Loans to enable people to buy their houses by a system of instalment purchase
are available from various sources, including building societies, insurance
companies, industrial and provident societies and local authorities. The local
authorities are expected to concentrate their efforts primarily to helping people
with special housing needs who are unable to obtain loans from other sources.
Building societies, of which there are some 550, are the most important of
these agencies. They do not build houses themselves but provide long-term
loans on the security of property bought for owner-occupation. They usually
advance 80 to 90 per cent of the value of the houses. Loans are repayable over
periods of up to 25 or even 30 years, by equal monthly instalments to cover
capital and interest. The societies advanced more than £1,500 million in 1968;
the average price of houses mortgaged was £4,700. In response to the demand
for owner-occupation a scheme to help people with low incomes to buy their
dwellings on mortgage was introduced under the Housing Subsidies Act 1967.
Under the scheme borrowers have the option of either claiming income tax
relief on interest payments on their loan (a system which helps people who'
pay a high rate of tax more than those who pay little or none), or receive
through the lending agency a government subsidy, whichever they consider
to be of the most financial benefit to them. The subsidy reduces the rate of
interest they pay by up to 2 per cent, subject to a minimum remaining interest
charge which in most cases is 4 per cent. The Minister has power to adjust,
by order, the percentage rate of subsidy following changes in interest rates or
taxation. A person taking part in the scheme whose circumstances change
may revert to tax relief on 31st March 1973 or after, provided he has held
his mortgage for at least five years.
The option scheme has been extended to include a provision by which
mortgage loans of up to 100 per cent of the valuation of a house (not exceeding-
£5,000) may be made to those participating in the scheme.
The Housing Act 1961 authorised Exchequer loans to approved non-profit-
making housing associations for the building of houses to let at unsubsidised
rents. This provision was increased and extended by the Housing Act 1964
under which the Housing Corporation was set up to stimulate the formation of
housing societies. Building societies advance to a housing society two-thirds
PLANNING AND HOUSING

of the cost of each approved housing scheme, the Corporation providing
the remaining third. The housing societies build dwellings either for
co-ownership by a group of occupants, which gives them most of the advan¬
tages of house ownership at a lower cost, or to let at unsubsidised rents.
The capital cost of houses built by or for local authorities is met by raising
loans; current expenditure, including loan repayment and interest on loans,
is met from rents supplemented by subsidies from the Exchequer and, in
some cases, from the rates (see p. 72). Local authorities may raise loans for
housing on the open market or by borrowing from the Public Works Loan
Board (see p. 73). In Northern Ireland local authorities, the Housing Trust
and housing associations may borrow from the Government Loans Fund.
Housing subsidies, at varying rates and for different purposes, have been
provided in Britain since 1919, when they were first introduced to enable
local authorities to build houses for letting at moderate rents. However, the
value of normal flat-rate subsidies has been eroded by rising building costs
and interest rates. A new kind of subsidy was introduced in the Housing
Subsidies Act 1967 which provides a basic subsidy equal to the difference
between the interest charge (at current borrowing rates) on a loan raised to
cover the approved capital cost of a dwelling and the charge if the loan had
borne interest at 4 per cent a year. For example, the basic subsidy payable on
a house costing £3,800, assuming a borrowing rate of 7 per cent, would be
about £103 a year for 60 years. Supplementary subsidies are paid for high
building; to councils with insufficient resources to provide urgently needed
houses; for houses required in connection with a major transfer of industry;
for expensive sites; for precautions against subsidence; for building in certain
materials; and for overspill. Similar subsidies are paid in Scotland. In Northern
Ireland annual subsidies are paid to local authorities, the Northern Ireland
Housing Trust, new town development commissions and housing associations
and ‘lump-sum’ subsidies are paid to private people who build dwellings for
letting or owner-occupation.
In selecting tenants for council dwellings local authorities must give prefer¬
ence to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory conditions. Rents are
generally low in comparison with current building costs. Over two-fifths of
the housing authorities in England and Wales operate rent-rebate schemes,
under which tenants with low incomes or with large families are able to claim
a reduction in the standard rent. In Scotland nearly half the councils operate
rebate schemes, although rents generally are lower than in England and
Wales. The Government is encouraging the expansion of such schemes so
that housing subsidies are used to help people who need them most.
A declining proportion of the available housing in Britain (about one-sixth)
is rented from individual landlords and property companies.
Rent control was originally introduced in 1915 as a temporary war-time
measure and successive Acts have varied its scope. Under the Rent Act 1957
there was a large measure of decontrol but the Rent Act 1965 re-introduced
control over most privately rented unfurnished dwellings—those of annual
rateable value up to £400 in London and £200 elsewhere. Most rent legisla¬
tion has been consolidated in the Rent Act 1968. Tenants have a wide degree
of security of tenure and a fair rent may be fixed on application by landlord
or tenant. Fair rents are determined by rent officers or, if the landlord or
tenant objects to the rent determined by the rent officer, by a rent assessment
committee on the assumption that, for similar dwellings, demand does not
l8o BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
greatly exceed supply. Once determined, the rent is not normally reviewed
for at least three years. For furnished premises under the rateable value limits
a tenant may go to a rent tribunal for determination of a reasonable rent and
may be given security of tenure for up to six months with a possibility of
further periods if the tribunal so decides. Eviction without a court order from
furnished or unfurnished premises of any rateable value and harassment of
occupiers are criminal offences with severe penalties.
Measures of control and de-control also apply in Northern Ireland. In 1951
and 1956 legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases in the rent
of certain controlled houses. The 1956 Act also released from control houses with
a net annual value of over ^50 (with certain safeguards) and houses with a net
annual value of over £26 of which the landlord was in actual possession when
the Act came into force, or of which he subsequently obtained possession.
Improvement Private owners in Great Britain can obtain grants from local authorities for the
of Houses improvement of houses or conversion of large houses into smaller units or
other buildings for housing. The grants are made to householders to install
basic amenities such as baths and to make other improvements to their
houses. The grants amount to 50 per cent of the approved cost of the work,
the normal upper limits of the grants being £200 and £1,000 {£1,200 in
Scotland) and the maximum grant for the conversion of a house of three or
more storeys into flats, £1,200 for each flat. Grants amounting to £2,500 per
flat obtained are available to local authorities and housing associations to buy
houses for improvement and conversion.
To enable local authorities to tackle, systematically, areas of out-worn
housing in private ownership, the Housing Acts 1969 give them powers to
declare ‘general improvement areas’ in which they can actively encourage
householders to improve their dwellings with the aid of grants. In addition,
the local authorities can spend up to £100 per house on improving the
general environment with the help of a 50 per cent government grant.
Grants are also provided in Northern Ireland with, in addition, provision
for accommodation for farmers, agricultural workers and approved workers.
Slum Clearance More than 2-25 million people have been rehoused since the mid-1950s
as a result of slum clearance programmes. It is expected that within the
next ten years the great majority of the housing authorities in Great Britain
will have succeeded in getting rid of all their present slums. In certain
areas, however, particularly the older industrial towns, including Birmingham,
Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester, four of the biggest cities in the country,
clearance may take longer. Local authorities with major slum and over¬
crowding problems are being given priority to clear their slums and to under¬
take major programmes of urban renewal. Their housebuilding programmes
have increased sharply in recent years and in many cases the designation of
new towns nearby has further eased their housing problems (see p. 171).
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists, or
can be provided by them, for people displaced from slum clearance areas.
Where an unfit house is demolished by order of the local authority and the
owner retains his land, he normally receives no compensation. If the local
authorities acquire an unfit property in order to demolish it themselves and to
rebuild on the land, the normal basis of compensation amounts to the market
value of the house as it stands or the value of the site after clearance, whichever
is the less, but for owner occupiers compensation is at market value.
8 THE CHURCHES
Every person living in Britain has the right of religious freedom and may
manifest his faith in teaching, worship and observance without interference
from the community or the State. Churches and religious societies of all kinds
may own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs in speech and
in writing.
Freedom of conscience in religious matters was achieved gradually from the
seventeenth century onwards; the laws discriminating against minority
religious groups were gradually administered less rigorously and then finally
repealed. Heresy ceased to be a civil offence with the passing of the
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677, and the Toleration Act of 1688 granted
freedom of worship to protestant dissenters. In 1828 the repeal of the Test
and Corporation Acts freed nonconformists from political disabilities and
made it possible for them to be appointed to public offices; Roman Catholics
gained political emancipation under the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829; the
Jewish Relief Act 1858 enabled Jews to become members of Parliament; while
religious tests that had been imposed on prospective students and members
of the academic staff of the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham
were successively abolished by Acts of 1854, 1856 and 1871. Nowadays, there
is no religious or denominational bar to the holding of public office, except in
the case of the Lord Chancellor, where there is some doubt whether existing
statutory provisions would permit this office to be held by a Roman Catholic.
In the services administered by the State, such as the armed forces, the
national hospitals and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of
England or the Church of Scotland provide the principal ministrations and
are paid a salary by the State for this part of their work. Priests of the Roman
Catholic Church and ministers of other denominations may also be appointed
or specially called in as required. Voluntary schools (see p. 148) provided by
churches of any religious denomination may be wholly or partly maintained
from public funds.
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number
of adherents to the various churches in the United Kingdom, since no enquiries
are made about religious beliefs in population censuses or other official
returns, and each church adopts its own criteria in counting its members.
The membership figures given in this chapter are therefore approximate.
The Church of The Church of England is the established church, and claims to be the ancient
England catholic church of the land. At the Reformation in the sixteenth century, it
repudiated the supremacy of the Pope, but retained the historic episcopate,
and the creeds and sacraments upon which its doctrines are based; therefore
it claims to be both ‘catholic’ and ‘reformed’. Its form of worship is embodied
in the Book of Common Prayer, which was first compiled in 1549.
The Church is uniquely related to the Crown in that the Sovereign, who
must be a member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the Faith’
(a statutory title as protector of the Church) and promises on his or her
accession to uphold it. The coronation of the Sovereign is performed by the
Archbishop of Canterbury; prayers for the Sovereign and other members
of the royal family are said in all the statutory services of the Church; Church
182 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of England archbishops, bishops and deans are appointed by the Sovereign
on the advice of the Prime Minister1; and all clergymen take the oath of
allegiance to the Crown.
The Church is also linked with the State through the House of Lords, in
which the archbishops of Canterbury and York and 24 senior diocesan bishops
have seats (see p. 31). This makes it possible for the views of the Church
leaders to be expressed freely on any moral issue raised in connection with the
corporate conduct of the State as well as on specifically ecclesiastical issues—
a matter of particular significance in view of the fact that the clergy of the
Church of England (together with those of the Church of Scotland, the
Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church) are legally disqualified
from sitting in the House of Commons.
The Church must obtain Parliament’s consent2 to change its form of
worship, as laid down in the authorised Book of Common Prayer; canons
(Church rules) cannot be made or amended without the consent of the Queen;
and the Measures of the Church Assembly (as distinct from its regulations)
also require parliamentary approval and the Royal Assent.
Church The Church of England is organised by geographical areas into two provinces
Organisation and and 43 dioceses. The Province of Canterbury contains 29 dioceses and that
Government of York 14. Each diocese is subdivided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which
there are about 14,500. The Archbishop of Canterbury is Primate of All
England and bishop of his own diocese of Canterbury; the Archbishop of York
is styled Primate of England and is bishop of his own diocese of York.
The baptised membership of the Church is about 27^ million, that is two-
thirds of the population born and resident in the two provinces but only about
35 per cent of this number is confirmed.
Spiritual authority in the Church rests with the bishops. The authoritative
bodies in matters of doctrine, belief and practice are the Convocations of
Canterbury and York, each presided over by its archbishop, and consisting
of an upper house of bishops, and a lower house of representatives of each
cathedral chapter, archdeacons and elected clergy. The Convocations may
meet three times a year.
The legislative and central administrative body of the Church is the
National Assembly of the Church of England, which is commonly called the
Church Assembly. It was set up in 1919 at the request of the two Convocations,
and was given power to legislate by measure by the Church of England
Assembly (Powers) Act 1919. It can discuss any matter connected with the
Church of England, but may not make any doctrinal statements, nor infringe
upon the rights of the Convocations. It consists of three Houses: Bishops,
Clergy and Laity. The first two Houses are composed of the members of the
Convocations; the House of Laity consists of men and women elected every
five years by the lay members of diocesan conferences, and the constitution
allows for ten co-opted members.3
The Church Assembly usually meets three times a year. Measures, after
passing through various stages in the Assembly, are presented to an ecclesias¬
tical committee of both Houses of Parliament, consisting of 30 members, of
1 The Church Assembly has appointed a commission to consider what constitutional
modifications are desirable and practicable in the present relationship between Church
and State.
2 Consent has been obtained for the experimental use of alternative forms, if and when
authorised by the Church.
3 A measure setting up a General Synod, which will take over the authority of the
Convocations of Canterbury and York and bring the laity into closer contact with
the clergy in all church matters, has been passed by Parliament.

whom 15 are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and 15 by the Speaker of the
House of Commons. This committee lays the measures, together with a report
upon them, before both Houses. If both Houses so resolve, the measure is
sent to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, after which it has the same force and
effect as an Act of Parliament. Parliament, though it may reject a measure, has
no power to amend it.
The Church Assembly is the centre of an administrative system consisting
of boards and councils dealing with various aspects of the Church’s work, such
as education, recruitment and training for the ministry, and Church work at
home and overseas. The Church Assembly, through the Schools Council of its
Board of Education, is responsible for some 7,100 Church of England schools
of all types, for about half of which the Church bears a fifth of the cost of
improvements, alterations and repairs.
Parochial church councils were set up in 1921 to associate the laity with
the government of the Church in the parish. The members of these councils
are appointed by the parochial electors, that is, people who are baptised, are
not members of any other church, are 17 years of age and over, and have
applied for membership of the electoral roll of the parish where they usually
live or worship. The estimated number on the parish electoral rolls is some
2-| million.
The Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts. Their jurisdiction
today consists largely of faculty cases, with very occasional cases of discipline
against clergy, either for moral or ecclesiastical offences. A faculty is necessary
for any specific alteration or addition to the fabric or ornaments of a church or
to a churchyard.
There are 25 Church colleges of education in England and two in Wales, all
of which are run by independent governing bodies. With substantial grants
from the Department of Education and Science a major programme of
expansion, including the opening of two new colleges, has been taking place;
this has raised the total number of students in the colleges to nearly 17,000.
The cost to the Church, mainly from funds provided by the Church Assembly,
has been about ^3 million.
The Church Assembly has also completed a programme of modernising and
improving theological colleges (of which there are 25) and establishments for
the training of women in the pastoral work of the Church, and has provided
grants for the greater part of the cost.1
Each parish is responsible for its own finances, and also contributes an annual
apportioned quota to diocesan funds, and each diocese similarly contributes
to the Church Assembly. In the diocese, the financial authority is the diocesan
board of finance, which administers the money contributed by the parishes,
and acts as trustee on behalf of the parochial church councils, which have only
limited powers of holding property. The Central Board of Finance administers
the Church Assembly Fund, supported by diocesan contributions, and devoted
to the maintenance of central services, including capital expenditure on
training colleges and theological colleges and the grants for training candidates
for ordination.
Although the State pays for or contributes towards services provided by the
Church (see p. 181), it makes no direct financial contribution to the expenses
of the Church as such.
1 A radical reorganisation of Church of England theological colleges, the effect of
which would be to amalgamate the 25 existing colleges to provide a maximum of 14,
has been recommended in the report of a working party set up by the Archbishops of
Canterbury and York.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The endowment income of the Church (from its assets amounting to over
£400 million in land and investments) is mainly administered by the Church
Commissioners, the body largely responsible for the payment of clergy
stipends and the provision of finance for pensions. The total net income
(more than £21 million in 1968) has greatly increased during the past ten
years; in broad terms, this has meant a rise in the stipends of the poorer
clergy and that the Commissioners have been able to embark on schemes of
assistance for providing better parsonage houses, for Church buildings in
new areas of population, and for better pensions for clergy and their widows.
The present basic pension for a clergyman is £600 a year and £300 for a
clergy widow. Retired Church dignitaries receive larger pensions.
The Anglican The Anglican Communion comprises 19 autonomous provinces in the United
Communion Kingdom and overseas and two regional councils overseas with a tota
membership of over 40 million. _ ,
In the British Isles, in addition to the established Church of England, there
are unestablished Anglican Churches in Ireland, Scotland and Wales: the
Church of Ireland has 14 dioceses; the Episcopal Church in Scotland,
7 dioceses and some 98,000 members; and the Church in Wales, 6 dioceses
and some 165,500 Easter communicants.
The Lambeth Conference for unofficial consultation between all Anglican
bishops meets every ten years; the latest meeting was in July-August 1968.
The conference is presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury; it
has no executive authority, but enjoys great moral prestige, and its
findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other communions, and on the
attitude of the Anglican Churches to political and social questions are widely
studied. . . , . c
The Executive Officer of the Anglican Communion is the secretary of the
Anglican Advisory Council on Missionary Strategy, and exercises general
supervision on behalf of the consultative body of the Lambeth Conference (of
which he is also the secretary) over all matters affecting the welfare of the
Anglican Communion which call for attention between the meetings of the
conference.
The Church of
Scotland
The Church of Scotland, established by law, has a presbyterian form of
government. It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church which
is established and yet is free’. Its position, defined in the Treaty of Union 1707,
was further safeguarded by the Church of Scotland Act 1921, under which
it has complete internal self-government within the terms of the schedule to
the Act, ‘Articles Declaratory of the Faith of the Church of Scotland .
Whereas in episcopacy church government is a hierarchy of persons, in
Presbyterianism there is a hierarchy of courts. All ministers are °f equal status,
and each of the 2,126 congregations is governed locally by the Kirk Session,
consisting of the minister and elected elders (of whom there are about 48,942);
above this is the Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and
finally the General Assembly, which meets annually and consists of elected
ministers and elders presided over by an elected Moderator who serves for one
year. The Sovereign, when not present in person, is represented at the General
Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The Church of Scotland has
complete freedom in all spiritual matters and the right to appoint its own
officers and to decide all matters of doctrine and discipline. Its decisions are
not subject to parliamentary debate, modification or appeal to the civil courts.
Women may now be admitted to its ministry.
THE CHURCHES
185
The training for the ministry, which lasts at least six years, has given the
Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The membership of the Church of Scotland
is estimated at about 1,200,000.

The Unestablished
Presbyterian
Churches
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is now commonly used to describe those churches
in England which were more generally known in the past as ‘nonconformist’
churches; and protestant churches in Scotland (except the established Church
of Scotland), Wales and Northern Ireland. The main Free Churches are the
Methodist, Baptist and Congregational Churches, and the unestablished
presbyterian churches throughout Britain. In addition, there are a number of
other protestant denominations in the United Kingdom as well as such
religious associations as the Society of Friends and the Salvation Army, which
have certain links writh the main Free Churches.
The word ‘nonconformist’ signifies dissent from certain of the formularies
and practices of the established church. In general, the Free Churches base
their reason for existence on their distinctive convictions regarding organisa¬
tion and worship.
The largest of the Free Churches, the Methodist Church, which originated
in the eighteenth century following the evangelical revival by John Wesley,
took its present form in 1932, with the union of the majority of separate
Methodist Churches. It has some 667,000 adult full members. The supreme
authority is the annual conference and the system of government is in many
ways presbyterian, the leaders’ meeting corresponding to the kirk sessions,
with circuit meetings and district synods resembling presbytery and synod.
One of the characteristics of Methodism is its strong emphasis on lay leader¬
ship. There are some 22,400 trained lay preachers sharing the work of about
4,200 ministers and preaching in many local churches.
Methodist Churches which did not join the union in 1932 include: the
Independent Methodists (over 6,900), in which ministerial service is on a
purely voluntary basis and women (many of whom are ministers) have full
equality with men; and the Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 5,200
members) which, while retaining the essential Methodist doctrine, gives
autonomy to each of its 155 individual churches.
The Congregationalists are the oldest community of dissenters in Britain. In
1831 most of their churches were formed into the Congregational Union
(which in 1966 was reconstituted as the Congregational Church in England
and Wales). Local churches have formed county and national unions, whose
secretariat and assemblies have much influence, but no compulsive authority
over them, since great importance is attached to the autonomy of local church
meetings. Adult membership is about 187,000.
The Baptists are for the most part grouped in associations of churches and the
majority of these belong to the Baptist Union formed in 1813. Baptists differ
from nearly all other churches in that they practise the baptism of believers
only; they do not baptise infants. The Baptist Churches have about 280,000
members.
The Presbyterian Church in Ireland has a membership in Northern Ireland
of about 390,000. The Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of
Wales, which arose from the revivalist movement led by Howell Harris in
1735, numbers some 117,000. The Presbyterian Church of England has nearly
66,000 members; its highest court is its general assembly; women are admitted
to the eldership and ministry.
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other presbyterian churches in Britain include: the Free Church of
Scotland; the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church
of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed
Presbyterian Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian
Church of Ireland.
Among other protestant denominations in the United Kingdom are: the
Unitarian and Free Christian Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also
in the United States of America as Disciples of Christ), which have been an
organised community in Britain since early in the nineteenth century, the
British Province of the Moravian Church, which is an international missionary
church; the Free Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which
was formed in 1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; the Society of
Friends; and the Salvation Army.
The Society of Friends (Quakers) came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox. A distinctive feature
is the way of worship: outward sacraments are not observed and there is no
separate ministry. The Society places great emphasis on work for peace, and
their influence in many parts of the world, especially in social reform and in
the relief of suffering, is very wide in relation to their numbers. There are 440
Quaker Meetings in Britain and nearly 21,000 members; and the Society has
nine schools (the pupils and staff of which are not exclusively Quaker).
The Salvation Army, founded in 1865 (as the Christian Mission), is a
religious movement, composed of men and women who seek the spiritual and
social betterment of their fellows, primarily by preaching the gospel to those
hitherto untouched by religious effort. The movement, which is quasi¬
military in structure, has branches all over the world. Internationally it
provides a greater variety and volume of social service than any other single
voluntary society.
The Christian Scientists, who are in no way connected with any other
church, have about 330 branch churches and societies in Britain.
ioe The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became
Catholic Church temporarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the
Scottish hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was
restored in 1878, while the Irish hierarchy never became completely extinct.
The normal government of the Roman Catholic Church, namely by territorial
archbishops and bishops, is once again the rule in the whole of the United
Kingdom. ,
The central territorial unit of the Roman Catholic hierarchical organisation
is the province or archdiocese under the metropolitan, who is always an
archbishop. A province normally comprises several dioceses, each under a
bishop aided by a chapter of canons and others, and by priests in charge of
the parishes into which the diocese is subdivided. In England and Wales
there are five provinces and archdioceses (Westminster, Liverpool, Birming¬
ham, Cardiff and Southwark), 14 dioceses, and nearly 2,300 parishes (the
chairman of the Bishops’ Conference in England and Wales is the Archbishop
of Westminster); in Scotland there are two provinces and archdioceses (St.
Andrews and Edinburgh, and Glasgow), six dioceses, and about 400 parishes;
in Northern Ireland there are six dioceses (several of which have territory
partly in the Irish Republic and partly in Northern Ireland since there is one
hierarchy for the whole of Ireland) and about 170 parishes. In the whole of the
United Kingdom there are some 6 million adherents (including children) to
the Roman Catholic faith.

Denominations
THE CHURCHES

The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education
of its children in their own faith, and requires that the children of marriages
between its own members and members of any other denomination should be
brought up as Roman Catholics. Many schools for Roman Catholic children
in the United Kingdom are staffed by members of the religious orders for men
and women, who also undertake other social work such as nursing, child care,
and the conduct of homes for old people.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
present Anglo-Jewish community dates from 1656, the earliest arrivals being
the Sephardi (from Spain and Portugal). At the end of the seventeenth
century an Ashkenazi community (from Germany and East Europe) was
established, which increased rapidly and spread to the principal provincial
cities. As a result of the virtual destruction of whole Jewish communities on
the Continent during the second world war, the Anglo-Jewish community of
some 450,000 became the largest group of Jews in Europe.
The Anglo-Jewish community is divided into two schools of thought, each
of which has its own form of worship and its own services: the Orthodox (the
original groups) and the Reform. The Reform Movement, which does not
insist on the permanently binding character of Jewish law and therefore
attaches less religious importance to some of the traditional rituals and
practices of the Jewish faith, began in 1840. It was followed in 1901 by the
establishment of the Liberal Jewish Movement which made the breach with
the traditional section wider by laying emphasis on the re-interpreta¬
tion of traditional Judaism in the light of modern thought and custom. Of
the Jews in Great Britain who belong to any kind of synagogue, about 90 per
cent are Orthodox. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest group (Ashkenazi)
within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the Sephardi group.
Synagogues in Britain number more than 390. There has been an increase
in the number of Jewish denominational schools, which are now attended by
about one in seven Jewish children; other Jewish children attend the ordinary
State or independent schools and receive extra-curricular instruction in the
Jewish faith.
Many immigrants to Britain from overseas Commonwealth countries and
foreign countries have established centres for worship for their own com¬
munities in the United Kingdom, and especially in London. The Christian
communities include the Greek, Russian, Polish and Serb Orthodox, with
some Estonian and Latvian Orthodox, and also the Armenian Church. There
are also churches belonging to the Lutheran Churches of Denmark, Finland,
Germany, Norway and Sweden, and centres where Estonian, Latvian and
Polish Lutherans worship according to their creed. In addition, the French,
Dutch, Swiss, Hungarian and Polish Reformed Churches are represented in
Britain, the first three having their own places of worship. There are also a
number of other religious sects of British or foreign origin; figures of
membership in Britain of most of them are not available.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Muslims and the Buddhists.
The Muslims are the more widely represented, their number in Britain being
estimated at several hundred thousands of whom over 130,000 are in London
where the London Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre, the Shiah
Islamic Assembly Centre and the East London Mosque are situated. The

Shah Jehan Mosque is at Woking, Surrey, and there are mosques or Islamic

larger cities in Britain.
There are several thousand adherents of Buddhism in Britain. The Buddhist
Society has its headquarters in London, with a Shrine Room, there are also
Shrine Rooms in the three Viharas in London, one of which is run by Thai
monks and supported by the Thai Government. In Scotland there is a Shrine
Room at the Tibetan Centre.
The British Council of Churches, composed of official representatives from
almost all the churches of the British Isles, with consultant observers from the
Roman Catholic Church, and presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
facilitates common action between the churches and seeks to further the cause
of Christian unity. Proposals for union between the Anglican and Methodist
Churches, which have gained a large measure of support, have not yet been
finally accepted. Most, though not all, of the Free Churches in England and
Wales are members of the Free Church Federal Council, the aims of which
are to promote unity and joint action between the Free Churches, and to
provide a channel through which the Free Churches can communicate and
negotiate with central and local government authorities as a united body.
The Anglican, Presbyterian and Free Churches in the British Isles also
participate in the World Council of Churches, which was constituted at
Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1948. The council links together 226 churches in
over 70 countries for co-operation in action and the study of common problems.
The Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding between
members of the two religions and deals with problems in the social field.

THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
The Government is the main source of funds for scientific research and
development as a whole though private industry contributes a larger pro¬
portion of funds for civil research and development. Considerable sums are
also provided by public corporations, independent trusts and foundations,
and learned societies. The Government also keeps under review facilities for
training scientists and ensures that adequate research is directed to matters
of national interest.

Expenditure
According to Statistics of Science and Technology 1968 (see Bibliography,
p. 478) total expenditure on research and development has risen from
£771-4 million in 1964-65 to £882-9 million in 1966-67. This represents
2-7 per cent of the gross national product at factor cost. The percentage of
the total carried out by the Government (including the research councils) has
continued to decline, falling to 22 per cent compared with 24-9 per cent two
years previously. The proportion of the total carried out in the universities
and establishments of further education has remained about the same, over
the two years, at just over 7 per cent. The proportion of the total finance for
research and development provided by the Government has declined from
54-6 per cent in 1964-65 to 50-2 per cent in 1966-67. This is due to the
relative drop in the proportion accounted for by defence. The expenditure
of the research councils amounted to £72-6 million in 1967-68, and is
expected to rise to £87 million by 1969-70, though the rate of increase is now
declining.

Science and
Technology
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Central Advisory Council for Science and Technology was established in
January 1967, under the chairmanship of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the
Government, to advise the Government on the most effective national strategy
for the use and development of the country’s scientific and technological
resources. The Council includes representatives of the Council for Scientific
Policy (see below), the Advisory Council on Technology (see p. 191), and the
Royal Society (see p. 193), and a number of independent members.
Under the Science and Technology Act 1965 central responsibility for
basic and applied civil science rests with the Secretary of State for Education
and Science, who, advised by a Council for Scientific Policy in relation to
the natural sciences as a whole, is responsible for directing and financing the
research councils (see below). Responsibility for technology rests with the
Minister of Technology, who is advised by an Advisory Council on Techno¬
logy. Other government departments are responsible for research and
development related to their executive responsibilities.
The Department
of Education
and Science
The Council
for Scientific
Policy
The Department of Education and Science (see also p. 49) is responsible,
among other things, for the universities and basic and applied civil science
throughout Great Britain. The Department’s relations with the universities
are conducted through the University Grants Committee (see p. 159); and its
responsibilities for basic and applied civil science are discharged mainly
through the five research councils: the Science Research Council (see p. 195)’
the Medical Research Council (see p. 197), the Agricultural Research Council
(see p. 198), the Natural Environment Research Council (see p. 202), and the
Social Science Research Council (see p. 203). Others may be established under
the terms of the Science and Technology Act. The Department also has, in
consultation with other departments, general governmental responsibility for
Britain’s scientific space research programme, which is co-ordinated by the
Science Research Council. The Department is responsible for some aspects of
international scientific relations (see p. 205), and for promoting more efficient
handling and use of scientific and technical information. For the latter purpose
it has set up the Office for Scientific and Technical Information (see p. 204).
In the exercise of his responsibilities for the formulation and execution of
government scientific policy (but excluding, at present, the social sciences)
the Secretary of State for Education and Science is advised by the Council
for Scientific Policy (CSP), which replaced the former Advisory Council on
Scientific Policy. The Council, which was set up in January 1965, consists of
a chairman and 13 independent members. There are, in addition, assessors
from the research councils and from the University Grants Committee.
Among the issues with which the Council is concerned is the balance of
scientific effort in those areas for which the Secretary of State is responsible.
The Ministry The Ministry of Technology (see also p. 56), which came formally into being
of Technology in 1964, took over responsibility for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority (AEA) (see p. 200) and the National Research Development
Corporation (see p. 205). Go the dissolution of the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research (DSIR) in 1965 many of its functions and resources
were transferred to the Ministry, and in February 1967 the Ministry incorpor¬
ated the functions and responsibilities of the former Ministry of Aviation with
the exception of those civil aviation responsibilities which were transferred to
the Board of Trade (see p. 56).
The Ministry, among other things, has responsibility for engineering
standards and weights and measures and for the British Standards Institution

(see p. 251). It has direct control of a number of research stations and estab¬
lishments (see p. 196); it also aids with grants about 40 autonomous industrial
research associations (see p. 196).
The Minister of Technology is chairman of the Advisory Council on Tech¬
nology, set up to advise on the application of advanced technology in British
industry. There is a deputy chairman and ten other members, representing
scientific, economic, trade union and industrial interests.
An Advisory Committee on Highly Qualified Manpower was set up in 1969
to replace the former Committee on Manpower Resources for Science and
Technology. It advises the Government, through the Secretary of State for
Education and Science, on the problems of highly qualified manpower as a
whole. Its members include representatives of academic and industrial life.
Three new advisory boards to replace steering committees were created in
1969 in consultation with the Royal Society (see p. 193) and the Confederation
of British Industry (see p. 244) to advise the Minister of Technology on
matters relating exclusively to three research establishments. Advisory
committees were also set up to advise on certain research programmes.
A number of other government departments remain responsible for certain
branches of research.
The Ministry of Transport is concerned with research and development
relating to inland transport and ports. Research into road construction,
traffic flow and safety is carried out mainly at the Ministry’s Road Research
Laboratory at Crowthorne, Berkshire. There are also collaborative arrange¬
ments for research in inland transport with the Ministry of Technology.
Economic and operational research studies are carried out in the Ministry
of Transport’s headquarters and are commissioned from consultants and
universities. The Ministry of Technology is responsible for sponsoring
research and development in aviation.
Research on radio aids for marine navigation is undertaken by the Ministry
of Defence, which is also responsible for inter-Service electronic valve
research at the Services Electronics Research Laboratory. Research on marine
nuclear propulsion is undertaken by the AEA.
The Ministry of Power is responsible for research into safety and health of
mineworkers. The coal, electricity and gas industries are required to settle
their general programmes of research in consultation with the Minister, who
is assisted by an Advisory Council on Research and Development. Similar
provisions apply to the British Steel Corporation’s general programme of
research and technological development.
The Ministry of Defence finances the Meteorological Office, which is respon¬
sible for research in meteorology and geophysics, mainly for civil purposes.
The headquarters of the Office and most of its research sections are at
Bracknell, Berkshire. The Ministry also makes grants for fundamental
meteorological research carried out under the auspices of the Royal Society or
in university departments.
The Ministry of Public Building and Works has a Directorate General of
Research and Development (see p. 299) and is responsible for the Building
Research Station, Garston, Watford, Hertfordshire, which is concerned with
the techniques of building design and construction, and the organisation,
productivity and economics of building work.

The Ministry of Housing and Local Government sponsors certain geo¬
graphical, geological, economic and sociological research relating to the use and
development of land in England and Wales. Similar arrangements are made in
Scotland by the Scottish Home and Health Department, and in Northern
Ireland by the Ministry of Development. A Centre for Environmental Studies
has been set up as an independent educational trust for research into the
problems of urban planning and dealing with the effects of a fast-growing
mobile population.
The Post Office undertakes research and development on many aspects of the
science and engineering of communications, both in its own laboratories and
in close association with industry, the universities and government depart¬
ments. The main research station is at Dollis Hill, London, and there are
laboratories at Backwell, near Bristol, at Castleton, near Cardiff, and also at
Martlesham, near Ipswich, where a new research station is being built.
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (founded in 1759), together with its
400-acre estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, Sussex, is administered by
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and has the largest collection
of living plants in the world. Its research departments are: the herbarium,
concerned primarily with the classification and accurate determination of
plants; and the Jodrell Laboratory, for the study of plant anatomy and plant
physiology, cytology and genetics. There are two museums concerned
mainly with the economic exploitation of plants. The library, attached to the
herbarium, was founded in 1853; it consists of more than 100,000 botanical
books, about 140,000 reprints and separately issued items and a collection of
over 160,000 drawings and paintings of plants. The Royal Botanic Garden,
Edinburgh, founded about 1660, has, since April 1969, been administered
by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.
A Select Committee of the House of Commons on Science and Technology
was set up in December 1966. It is one of two specialist committees established
experimentally to give back-bench Members the opportunity to investigate
the policies and administration of the Government and to participate in the
formation of policy. The Members of the Committee (not more than 15 in
number) are nominated by the House. The Committee has power to call
witnesses and generally takes evidence in public.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee, founded in 1939, provides for a
regular exchange of information between members of Parliament and scientists.
Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party in both Houses,
and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-making scientific and
technological organisations in Britain as may be affiliated under its constitution.
Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies have retained their traditional function of facilitating the spread of
scientific knowledge. At present there are over 200 of them in Britain with
approximately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical
institutions and professional associations, many of which are playing a
distinguished part in promoting their own branches of science or are interested
in the education and professional well-being of their members.
The Council of Engineering Institutions, established in 1965, promotes
the co-ordination of the engineering profession. The Council of Science
and Technology Institutes—a federal body with five member institutes
Royal Society
Royal Society

PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 193
representing biologists, chemists, mathematicians, metallurgists and
physicists—was formed in 1969.
The most eminent of the learned societies concerned with science in its
broadest aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests and
activities) are the Royal Society, Royal Society of Arts, Royal Institution and
British Association.
The Royal Society, or more fully, the Royal Society of London for the
Improvement of Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique
place in the country’s scientific affairs and corresponds to national academies
of sciences in other countries. Election to it is regarded by scientists as a high
honour. The Queen is Patron. There are today three main categories of
Fellowship: Royal Fellows, comprising the Queen Mother and three Royal
Dukes; Foreign Members, of whom there are about 70, and the main body of
Fellows numbering about 700. Election to the Fellowship, which is for life,
was for many years restricted to 25 persons a year and the foreign membership
to four a year but in 1965 the former was increased to 32 with the intention of
awarding some of the new places to applied scientists in both the physical and
biological sciences. The Society is governed by a council of 21 members.
Its activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication of
research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings',
the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. Among its research appointments are the
Foulerton, Wolfson and Sir Henry Dale Research Professorships and nine
other research professorships supported by parliamentary grant-in-aid. The
highest medal awarded is the Copley Medal, for which scientists from all
countries are eligible; there are also three Royal Medals, and the Rumford,
Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester, Hughes, Leverhulme and Mullard Medals.
There are five lectureships: the Croonian (biology); the Bakerian (physical
sciences); the Ferrier (nervous system); the Wilkins (history of science); and
the Leeuwenhoek (microbiology). The Society has set up committees, some
of them jointly with other bodies, to promote improvements in education in
science and to emphasise the importance of applied sciences, especially
engineering.
Although an independent private corporation, the Society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which makes grants for certain of
its activities. The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appoint¬
ments to government research councils and Fellows serve on most govern¬
mental advisory councils and committees concerned with research.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. It represents
the United Kingdom in the international unions comprising the International
Council of Scientific Unions and appoints national committees for each of
them. It also plays a leading part in international scientific programmes such
as the International Biological Programme (1965-70), and promotes exchange
visits of scientists with many academies throughout the world. Its European
Programme to further relations between scientists of Western Europe receives
financial support from the Government and other sources.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific,
artistic, technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in i754> one
of the Society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress and appli¬
cation to useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils this

purpose chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The Society
regularly holds lectures, and publishes a monthly Journal, thus providing
effective media for the exposition and assessment by leading authorities of
developments which have a public as well as a specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’.
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today,
the Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are given
on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge. Its library
of some 60,000 books includes many early scientific works and manuscripts.
British The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
Association to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as well as
by eminent scientists. In addition the Association plans special lectures,
exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publica¬
tion of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study
groups and liaison with the Press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The Association has area committees and three lectureships for
young scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences—to
encourage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The
British Association has an organised relationship with over 150 scientific
bodies and learned societies. It has also made an important contribution to the
development of science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles
to the discovery and application of scientific knowledge.
THE UNIVER¬
SITIES AND
INSTITUTIONS
OF UNIVERSITY
STATUS
In 1967-68 the total estimated university expenditure on research was about
^51-7 million. The largest government contribution was through the
University Grants Committee (UGC) (see p. 158).
Scientific research in the universities is also supported through the research
councils. This support takes two forms. First, about half the postgraduate
students in science and technology in the universities receive maintenance
awards from the research councils, through postgraduate scholarships,
studentships or fellowships. These awards are in some cases for periods of up
to three years for training in research work and in others for shorter periods
for advanced studies. The cost of these awards is currently about £7-2 million
a year. Second, grants are given to the universities by the research councils
for specific projects, particularly in new or developing fields of research. In
recent years the research councils, in addition to making grants of this kind,
have made funds available for expensive items of university equipment
required for specific programmes of research. The research councils’ support
for research in the universities, excluding expenditure by the Medical Research
Council and the Agricultural Research Council on their own research units
within the universities (which remain under the control of, and are wholly
financed by, the councils) amounted in 1968-69 to over million.
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the

independent foundations. The contributions from sources other than the
University Grants Committee amount to nearly a third of the total university
expenditure on research.
In addition to the universities, colleges of advanced technology in England
and Wales, which are acquiring the status and title of universities, and central
institutions in Scotland are playing an increasing part in scientific and techno¬
logical research and development. These colleges and institutions are financed
by the education departments but are now making a growing demand on the
support for research provided by the research councils.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale
close relationships are fostered between the universities, industries and the
Government in numerous joint projects. The Ministry of Technology’s
industrial liaison officers (see p. 204) are based on universities or technical
colleges. Six Industrial Units have been opened (five at universities and one at
the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield) under a Ministry of Technology scheme.
They offer consultancy and research and development resources and are
expected to become self-supporting within a few years.
According to Statistics of Science and Technology there were in Great Britain
in 1966 about 327,400 persons holding qualifications in engineering,
technology and science (179,900 with qualifications in engineering and
technology, and 147,400 in science). The 1965 manpower survey showed
that, of the persons holding qualifications in engineering and technology,
5-6 per cent were employed in education, 47-3 per cent in manufacturing
industry, and 14-4 per cent in government and research associations;
comparable percentages for persons holding qualifications in science were
36-5, 26-2 and 10-2.
The Science Research Council (SRC), which came into formal existence on
1 st April 1965 and consists of a chairman and 15 other members, covers all
branches of fundamental science other than those for which the other research
councils are responsible. It also supports research in engineering and techno¬
logy in the universities. Provision is made for it to carry out research and
development through its own establishments; to encourage and support similar
research by any other person or body; to provide and operate equipment for
common use by universities, technical colleges and similar institutions; to
make grants for postgraduate studies; and to disseminate knowledge of science
and technology. Its establishments include the Royal Greenwich Observatory,
Herstmonceux, the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, the Radio and Space
Research Station, the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory, the Daresbury
Nuclear Physics Laboratory, the Atlas Computer Laboratory, and the
Astrophysics Research Unit at the Culham Laboratory. The SRC also
co-ordinates the British scientific space research programme (see p. 201) and
provides the United Kingdom contribution to the European Organisation
for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the European Space Research Organisation
(ESRO) (see also p. 201).
The greater part of industrial research in Britain is undertaken in government
establishments and in the research organisations of the larger firms. Research
organisations in industry vary widely between the largest firms employing
thousands of qualified staff and some employing very few; though the
emphasis is on commercial development, some fundamental research is done.
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other main agencies are universities and technical colleges, industrial
research associations, independent institutes for sponsored research and
consultant laboratories.
Ministry of
Technology’s
Research
Resources
Research
Associations
The net total expenditure for 1968-69 on the Ministry of Technology’s
establishments was about £55 million, made up of about £10 million for the
ten industrial research establishments and £45 million for the eight aviation
establishments. Most of the latter was on supporting and monitoring contracts
with industry for developing defence projects. Of the Ministry’s total
expenditure on research and development (excluding the AEA) less than
one-fifth is spent in Ministry establishments. Its non-industrial staff number
about 22,000, including about 2,860 qualified scientists and engineers
employed on research and development. These resources are estimated to
represent the largest block of research and development facilities and man¬
power available to any government outside the United States and the Soviet
Union.
The activities of the civil research stations include aeronautics and water
pollution. Besides research and development for industry these establishments
are engaged on the application of techniques and discoveries to design,
production, quality control, distribution, marketing and sales. In addition,
there are the industrial research associations grant-aided by the Ministry
of Technology.
The scheme by which the Government gives financial help to groups of firms
with similar interests to form organisations known as research associations, to
carry out industrial research co-operatively, was started in 1917 and is now
operated by the Ministry of Technology. There are now 43 such associations,
with a combined income of £14 million (compared with ^5-1 million in 1955),
of which a little more than a quarter was contributed by the Government.
Suitably specialised associations are now available for about 60 per cent of
British industry, varying in size from the Production Engineering Research
Association with an annual income of ^1 - 8 million, of which about one-third
is provided by government grant, to the British Brush Manufacturers
Research Association with an income of only ^1,900. The largest are those
dealing with ships, production engineering, coal utilisation, electrical
manufacturing, cotton and man-made fibres, welding and wool. (Particulars
of these and other associations are given in Chapter 11, Industry.) The
amounts of the government grants are related to the contributions made by
the industries concerned.
The research associations are autonomous bodies governed by their own
councils, the members of which are mostly representatives of industry,
although the Ministry of Technology is also represented. The councils are
advised in preparing research programmes, for which they have complete
responsibility, by research committees representative of their industrial
members, often with the addition of university or government scientists. The
Ministry of Technology appoints two Visitors for each association; normally
one is a scientist and the other an industrialist—both of some eminence.
Nearly all research associations admit to membership manufacturers in
Commonwealth countries and many also admit those in foreign countries.
The associations make the results of their work known to member firms by a
variety of methods, among which are bulletins, technical reports, lectures,
films, training classes, exhibitions and mobile demonstration units. A Con¬
ference of Industrial Research Associations was set up in 1969.

Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations (see Chapter 11), in particular those con¬
cerned with fuel and power, steel and transport. They also give support to
organisations concerned with research on matters of interest to them.
According to Statistics of Science and Technology 1968, total expenditure on
research and development by the different industrial sectors in 1966-67
(excluding establishments of less than 100 employees) was as follows (in
£ million): aerospace 159-3; electronics no; chemicals and allied industries
73-7; electrical engineering 37-5; mechanical and marine engineering and
shipbuilding 6o-i; metal manufacture 19; fabricated metal manufacture
9- 3; motor vehicles, locomotives, etc., 46-8; scientific instruments 14-1;
textiles, leather, etc., 14-3; food, drink and tobacco 17-2; petroleum products
10- 4.
These figures include funds from government sources. Firms in science-
based industries such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electrical and electronic
equipment, oil refining, steel, vehicles and scientific instruments commit
large private funds to research and development in the course of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
In these institutes research for private firms is carried out confidentially, the
results remaining the property of the sponsor.
A Medical Research Committee was appointed in 1913 to administer the
research funds provided under the National Health Insurance Act 1911. In
1920 the Committee was superseded by the Medical Research Council
(MRC), established under Royal Charter and supported by a grant-in-aid
provided by Parliament, now through the Secretary of State for Education and
Science. The MRC was granted a new charter in 1966.
In addition to financing the MRC, the Government gives substantial
support to medical research through block grants to universities distributed
through the University Grants Committee; and to clinical research through
the National Health Service. Certain government-financed research for defence
purposes, for example, at the Microbiological Establishment at Porton,
Wiltshire, has civil applications related to medical science.
Important contributions to the support of research in particular subjects
are made by industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, and by private
charities or voluntary organisations, such as the Nuffield Foundation and the
British Empire Cancer Campaign.
The Medical Research Council is responsible to the Secretary of State for
Education and Science and consists of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, and
from 10 to 14 other members. Not less than three-quarters must be scientific¬
ally qualified, representative of the different branches of medical knowledge
and actively engaged in research. All members are appointed by the Secretary
of State, the scientific members after consultation with the President of the
Royal Society and the existing Council; and the Chairman and Deputy
Chairman after consultation with the Council.
The MRC’s chief function is to promote research into all aspects of health
and disease. In planning and carrying out its research programme the Council
is assisted by bodies specially appointed to advise on particular subjects.
Three of the more important of these are the Clinical Research Board, set up
[q8 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in consultation with the health departments to assist the development of
clinical research; the Tropical Medicine Research Board, appointed in
consultation with the Ministry of Overseas Development, to advise on the
promotion and co-ordination of research in this field; and the Biological
Research Board, which advises on the promotion of research in the non-
clinical field. In addition, the MRC is advised by committees concerned
with particular aspects of its work. The MRC’s arrangements for the
support of research fall under four main headings: (1) investigations by
members of its scientific staff, mostly working in its own establishments;
(2) short-term grants to workers in universities and elsewhere; (3) long-term
grants in support of specific research programmes in university medical
departments (‘research groups’); and (4) fellowships and scholarships tenable
both at home and abroad. The programme includes fundamental studies
of the structure and natural processes of the body; clinical and laboratory
studies of disease; the development and evaluation of special methods of
treatment and also of prophylaxis and diagnosis; and the study of social and
occupational factors affecting health and the efficiency of body and mind.
The National Institute for Medical Research, at Mill Hill and Hampstead,
London, is the MRC’s main research establishment; in addition, there are
over 70 smaller establishments, known as research units, which are attached
in most cases to universities and hospitals in the United Kingdom. By 1970
it is hoped that the first phase of the Clinical Research Centre being built at
Northwick Park in north-west London as an integral part of the new district
hospital for the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board will be
ready. The Centre will be the clinical counterpart of the National Institute
for Medical Research.
The MRC also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support
from the Ministry of Overseas Development, maintains laboratories in The
Gambia and units in Uganda and Jamaica.
AGRICULTURAL Agricultural research is carried out by the Agricultural Research Council, the
RESEARCH government agricultural departments and by private industry.

The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), established in 193L consists of not
less than 15 and not more than 18 members, including the Chief Veterinary
Officer and certain appointments made by the Ministers of the agricultural
departments. In addition to distinguished scientists, the membership includes
people with practical farming experience. The ARC is under the general
oversight of the Secretary of State for Education and Science.
The ARC is responsible for 14 independent state-aided agricultural
research institutes and also has nine institutes under its direct control and
12 units which it has established under distinguished scientists associated w ith
universities. Also there are eight independent institutes in Scotland financed
by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland with advice
from the ARC on their scientific programmes, staffing and equipment.
The ARC makes special research grants to support promising new lines of
work in university departments. It awards a limited number of postgiaduate
training awards for those wishing to undertake a career in veterinary research.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food carries out applied and basic
research in its own veterinary laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey, and at
Lasswade, Midlothian, and also at its plant pathology laboratory at Harpenden,
Hertfordshire; while at its infestation control laboratory at Tolworth, Surrey
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS

ENERGY
(with a field station at Worplesdon), it co-ordinates work on the control of
insect pests of stored food and conducts research on the control of harmful
mammals and birds. The Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge has
been appointed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the third
international laboratory for biological standards. In Scotland research work
at East Craigs, Edinburgh, by the Agricultural Scientific Services of the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is mainly concerned with the
problems of healthy seed potato production, seed pathology, cultivation,
taxonomy and vertebrate pest control. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of
Agriculture is responsible for the promotion of agricultural research and
have research divisions dealing with a variety of aspects.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains four laboratories
for marine, shell-fish and salmon and freshwater fisheries research, and four
marine research vessels. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for
Scotland maintains a marine research laboratory and six research ships at
Aberdeen, and a freshwater fisheries research laboratory at Pitlochry.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food
Standards, Science and Safety Division of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food is responsible for formulating the Ministry’s general policy
on the acquisition and dissemination of scientific and technical information
about food and the food handling and processing industry; for furnishing
scientific advice to the other divisions of the Ministry; and for sponsoring or
carrying out experimental work. The division has its own experimental
laboratories in London and Norwich. The Food Research Advisory Com¬
mittee advises on food problems requiring investigation or research.
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to
silvicultural and allied problems (see p. 324). By means of grants, it also aids
forest research work undertaken by various universities and other institutions,
including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford.
The Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), set up under the Atomic Energy
Authority Act 1954, is responsible for research and development in nuclear
energy. It is answerable to the Minister of Technology, who is responsible
under the Atomic Energy Acts 1946 to 1949 for promoting and controlling
the development of nuclear energy and ensuring that the proper degrees of
importance are attached to its various applications. The AEA has a large
programme of research into, and development of, the peaceful applications of
nuclear energy. As an essential part of the British Government’s nuclear
power programme, the AEA has developed new types of nuclear power
stations for the generation of electric power on a commercial scale and for this
purpose it builds and operates experimental and prototype nuclear reactors.
Construction of the nuclear power stations themselves is carried out by
industry to the order of the electricity authorities, which supervise their
operation. Two new consortia, with AEA participation, to design and
construct nuclear power stations were formed in 1968 and 1969. Under the
Science and Technology Act 1965 the functions of the AEA have been
extended so that the Minister may, after consultation, require it to undertake
research and development outside nuclear energy. Non-nuclear work is
absorbing a rising proportion of the AEA’s research resources and includes
research into desalination, hydrostatic extrusion, satellite design, biological
centrifuges, tribology, non-destructive testing, ceramics, atmospheric
pollution and carbon fibres.

The Secretary of State for Defence became responsible for the development
and production of nuclear weapons for the Services in 1966; in practice,
however, the AEA produces the explosive nuclear material and assemblies for
nuclear weapons under contract and carries out weapons research.
The Department of Education and Science and the AEA collaborate with
a number of other government departments and with the Radiological
Protection Service on various aspects of health and safety in relation to atomic
energy. Expert advice on radiation hazards is provided by the Medical and
Agricultural Research Councils and by the Radioactive Substances Advisory
Committee, appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science.
The Ministry of Technology and the AEA are jointly responsible for
co-operation with other countries in nuclear energy, partly through the
medium of bilateral agreements with a large number of individual countries
and partly through British membership of bodies such as the International
Atomic Energy Agency and the European Nuclear Energy Agency.
The Atomic Energy Authority, the members of which are appointed by the
Minister of Technology, consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and up to
14 other members, some of whom may be part-time.^
The AEA like other statutory public corporations, is free from day-to-day
government control (subject to the power given to the responsible minister
to issue directions to the AEA in matters of overriding national importance),
but differs from them in that most of its revenue is derived from money
voted by Parliament. Some of the commercial activities of the AEA are
financed through a trading fund with an initial capital of about £37 million.
The organisation has a London office, responsible for central financial an
administrative matters and for procuring raw materials. Its Radiochemical
Centre at Amersham produces and markets radioisotopes, about one-ha 01
export. The rest of its establishments are divided into four groups.
The Research Group’s principal laboratory is the Atomic Energy Research
Establishment (AERE), at Harwell. AERE undertakes research in support
of the AEA’s reactor programme and has a growing programme of applied
nuclear and non-nuclear research and a supporting programme of under-
lying research. Research is mainly on materials, their properties and the
effects on them of radiation. Facilities include materials testing reactors and
particle accelerators. The education and training department provides courses
on reactor technology, isotope techniques, radiological protection and other
subiects. Many of the courses are open to overseas students.
A second laboratory, at Culham, carries out research into plasma physics
and controlled thermo-nuclear fusion.
The Weapons Group, centred on Aldermaston, conducts research on and
development of nuclear weapons and other research work with civil, as well as
defence, applications. It has outstations at Foulness and Orfordness.
There are two groups with headquarters at Risley, in north-western
England. The Reactor Group works on the design, development and applica¬
tion of nuclear power reactors. It has developed the Advanced Gas-Cooled
Reactor (AGR), a prototype which has been operating successfully at
Windscale since February 1963. This system has been chosen for the first
stations of Britain’s second nuclear power programme (see p. 290).
The Reactor Group establishment at Winfrith in Dorset, a principal cen re
for reactor systems research, operates the Steam Generating Heavy ater
Reactor (SGHWR) and is also the location of the Dragon project, a 20 MW
(thermal) reactor financed jointly by the member countries of the European
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
201
Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD). The Group also operates research laboratories
at Risley, Culcheth, Springfields and Windscale.
The Reactor Group also includes the Dounreay experimental reactor
establishment in the north of Scotland, which houses a materials-testing
reactor and an experimental fast-breeder reactor (DFR). Successful operation
of the DFR has led to the design of a fast-breeder reactor power station (PER)
of 250 MW (E) under construction at Dounreay. The Production Group
provides complete fuel services for the United Kingdom nuclear power
programme. It also sells these services to reactor operators overseas and
almost all its activities are now conducted on a commercial basis. The Group
consists of the fuel element factory at Springfields (Lancashire), the diffusion
plant for the enrichment of uranium at Capenhurst (Cheshire), the plutonium
factory at Windscale (Cumberland), and the nuclear power stations at Calder
Hall (Cumberland) and Chapelcross (Dumfriesshire). Plans exist to set up a
plant for the manufacture of enriched uranium by the gas centrifuge process
under a tripartite agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany and the
Netherlands.
High Energy

SPACE
ACTIVITIES
The provision of expensive facilities for research in high energy physics is the
function of the Science Research Council (see p. 195). The SRC establish¬
ments concerned are the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory, Chilton, with
a 7,000 million electron volt (MeV) proton synchrotron (particle accelerator),
completed in 1963 and the Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory, Cheshire,
with a 4,000 MeV electron accelerator, completed in 1966.
Government responsibility for space activities is divided between the Secretary
of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for Defence, the
Minister of Technology and the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications.
Total expenditure on civil space activities in 1968-69 is estimated at about
£23-8 million; of this, ^8-2 million represents expenditure on Britain’s
national programme and ^15-6 million contributions to international bodies
such as the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), the European
Space Vehicle Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and Intelsat.
The first two of these were set up to give European countries the opportunity
of participating more fully in space research and technology. ELDO was
established to develop large satellite launchers; the British Blue Streak is
being used as the launching vehicle for ELDO’s Europa rockets. ESRO was
founded to provide facilities for scientific experiments in space; it has a
programme of launchings of sounding rockets and satellites of various sizes.
Under two inter-related international agreements reached in 1964, in
Washington, Britain, together with the US and other countries in Europe and
elsewhere, is taking part in International Telecommunications Satellite
Consortium (Intelsat). The Government announced in April 1968 that it
would cease to contribute to ELDO after 1971 but would be prepared to
accept a growth rate of up to 6 per cent a year for ESRO.
The execution of the civil scientific space research programme is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education and Science, through
the Science Research Council.
Scientific space experiments are arranged by scientists in the universities
and in government research establishments, under the general supervision of
the Space Research Management Unit of the Science Research Council. The
Royal Society represents Britain in non-governmental international scientific

groups such as the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the Inter¬
national Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).
In addition, Britain is co-operating with the United States in a programme
which includes the launching of the Ariel series of satellites and the incorpora¬
tion of British experiments in US satellites. The third such artificial earth
satellite, Ariel 3, launched in May 1967, and the upper atmosphere Skylark
rockets used in the British national and the ESRO programmes were designed
and produced in Britain, as will be UK-4 due to be launched in 1971.
The Ministry of Technology is responsible for conducting research into,
and for developing and producing, launchers, space vehicles and their
ancillary equipment. As an example, it is responsible at the Royal Aircraft
Establishment for the development of the Skylark rockets and is also carrying
out a programme for the development of an all-British satellite launcher
vehicle, Black Arrow, developed from the successful Black Knight research
rocket, on which some £3 million a year is being spent.
The Post Office is responsible for the use of satellites for civil communica¬
tions purposes and undertakes research work in connection with communica¬
tions systems using satellites. The Post Office ground station at Goonhill}
in Cornwall is one of the most successful in the world, and British firms are
building such stations overseas.
The satellite prediction centre at the Radio and Space Research Station,
Slough, also the home of one of the three World Data Centres for space
research, co-ordinates optical tracking activities in Britain. Optical observation
of satellites is carried out regularly by many individual observers in Britain
and by the Royal Edinburgh Observatory’s outstation (see below); radio
tracking is undertaken at the Radio and Space Research Station and by radio
telescopes at Jodrell Bank and the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern.
Large optical telescopes were first constructed in Britain by Herschel and
Rosse in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The latest addition to the
equipment at Herstmonceux is the 98-inch Isaac Newton telescope, the largest
in Western Europe, completed in 1967' Grants by the SRC to the Radcliffe
Trustees have enabled British optical astronomers to have continued access to
the 74-inch telescope at the Radcliffe Observatory in South Africa for
observations in the southern skies. In April 1967 the SRC assumed responsi¬
bility for supporting and managing this telescope. The Royal Edinburgh
Observatory has been re-equipped with modern instrumentation for use m
stellar spectroscopy and photometry. The British and Australian Governments
are building jointly a 130-inch optical telescope in New South Wales.
Radio astronomy, developed since 1931, is carried out mainly at Cambridge
University, at the Jodrell Bank Experimental Station of Manchester University
in Cheshire, and at the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern. Britain
occupies a pre-eminent position in this branch of research.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) was established oy
Royal Charter in June 1965 under the Science and Technology Act 1965 to
encourage, plan and conduct research in those sciences, both physical and
biological, that relate to man’s natural environment. The work of the NERC
falls into five main groups: the solid earth, its physical properties and mineral 1
resources (geology, geophysics and geochemistry); the inland waters and theii
living resources (hydrology, freshwater biology, ecology and fisheries); the
terrestrial communities, their resources and amenities (terrestrial ecology,
forestry and conservation); the seas and oceans, their behaviour and their

living and mineral resources (oceanography, marine biology and ecology, and
fisheries); and the atmosphere (some aspects of meteorology). The NERC
administers the British Antarctic Survey, the Institute of Geological Sciences,
the Institute of Hydrology, the National Institute of Oceanography, the
Institute of Coastal Oceanography and Tides, the Nature Conservancy, and
the Research Vessel Unit. It is also responsible for supporting the Marine
Biological Association, the Scottish Marine Biological Association, the
Freshwater Biological Association, the Fisheries Helminthology Unit and the
Marine Invertebrate Biology Unit.
Many of the activities of the NERC are related to university research in the
environmental sciences, which it supports by postgraduate training awards,
research grants and fellowships.
Further responsibilities of the NERC include the support of long-term
forestry research in consultation with the Forestry Commission; financial and
policy control of research in seismology and geomagnetism carried out by the
Meteorological Office; and the co-ordination of research in meteorology
generally with that carried out by the Meteorological Office.
The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) was set up in December 1965,
with the same status as the other research councils. It provides grants for
research projects at universities and other institutions, and makes training
awards to postgraduate students. The SSRC’s fields of interest include
economics; political science; psychology; social anthropology; social and
economic statistics; sociology and social administration; education; manage¬
ment; and various aspects of a wide range of other disciplines.
Several government departments have funds allocated for social research
related to their responsibilities, including the Home Office, which has a large
research unit which carries out a wide variety of sociological studies. The
Social Survey conducts sample survey enquiries at the request of government
departments and from time to time also carries out studies in collaboration
with universities and other independent research organisations.
Zoological research is among the activities of the world-famous Zoological
Gardens, extending over 34 acres in Regent’s Park, London, which were
opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1828. A natural zoo of 500
acres was opened in 1931 Whipsnade, in Bedfordshire, by the Society.
Among other well-known zoos are those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester and
Dudley, and a small, private one at Chessington, Surrey.
The British Museum (Natural History) is the principal centre in the
Commonwealth for the general study of natural history; it has extensive
collections of extant and fossil animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and
meteorites. The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and
applied science in all countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held
a leading place in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics,
and in the development of industrial machinery and processes. The geology of
Britain is probably known in more exact detail than that of any other country
in the world, and the Geological Survey has an outstanding collection of
exhibits in its Geological Museum. These three museums are in South
Kensington, London.
Other important collections are those of the Museum of Science and
Industry, in Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at
Oxford.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume of
information has grown. The traditional method of scientific publication, in
which results are written up into papers and published in journals, is still the
main means of communication among scientists. The leading learned societies
have for long been important agencies for communicating scientific
information.
A Libraries and Information Systems Branch has been set up in the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science to concentrate the Department’s responsi¬
bilities in relation to libraries. The new Branch includes the Office for
Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), set up in 1965 to promote more
efficient handling and co-ordination of scientific and technical information.
The National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL) at
Boston Spa, Yorkshire, also within the Department, aims to collect for loan
purposes all literature which is likely to be of interest to the practising
scientist and technologist, covering all branches of science and technology
(including agriculture and medicine) and, since 1967, the periodical literature
of the social sciences. Besides collecting all available translations of Russian
scientific literature the library is responsible for arranging the translation of
some Russian periodicals, books and articles. Details are published monthl)
in the NLL Translations Bulletin. The Library acts as a centre for MEDLARS,
the Computer Board Medical Information Service, produced by the US
National Library of Medicine. (A description of general library services
which also cater for scientific needs is given on p. 220.)
Aslib, a specialised library service, undertakes research into the operation
of information services, gives assistance in setting up and running them,
provides membership services, and holds a Commonwealth Index of Transla¬
tion covering scientific subjects. _ . .
The National Reference Library of Science and Invention, administered
by the British Museum, is at present divided between two separately housed
divisions. The Holborn Division, formerly the Patent Office Library, is one
of the great scientific libraries of the world. The Bayswater Division has
substantial collections, especially in the life sciences.
An Advisory Committee for Scientific and Technical Information was set
up in October 1965 to advise the Secretary of State for Education and Science
particularly in relation to the work of OSTI and the co-ordination of this
work with other government departments and independent organisations.
The Ministry of Technology and the AEA devote considerable sums to
advisory information services. The former has nine regional offices and
sponsors over 70 industrial liaison centres, based on universities or technical
colleges, which make contacts with local industries to promote greater use
of existing scientific and technical knowledge. A Production Engineering
Advisory Service equipped with mobile demonstration units brings knowledge
of new techniques directly to the workshop floor. The grant-aided industrial
research associations circulate research reports and provide information
services to members. Besides information services provided by its various
groups, which include the Ceramics Centre and the Non-destructive Testing
Centre at Harwell, the AEA has an information centre at its London head¬
quarters, and a network of regional advisers on the use of radioisotopes.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux
(see p. 206) provide abstracts and an information service in various branches
of agricultural science. The ARC publishes an Index of Agricultural Research

in Progress, and gives an account of current developments in its annual reports.
The advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research results
directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals; but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.
The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC), an independent
body for which the Minister of Technology has statutory responsibility, was
set up under the Development of Inventions Act 1948 to secure the develop¬
ment and exploitation of inventions in the public interest. The NRDC
can also assist research work where this is likely to lead to an invention.
Under the Development of Inventions Act 1967, up to £25 million could be
advanced to the Corporation from public funds without time limit. This was
increased to £50 million under the Industrial Expansion Act 1968.
Projects so far sponsored include hovercraft, computers, advanced types of
electric motor, towed flexible barges (Dracones), diesel engines, insecticides,
fuel cells and antibiotics. NRDC is increasingly funding speculative projects
on a joint venture basis with industrial firms. NRDC support for hovercraft
development has been given mainly through a wholly owned subsidiary,
Hovercraft Development Ltd., which holds and manages the hovercraft
patents. Another subsidiary, Tracked Hovercraft Ltd., was formed in 1967 to
develop an air-cushioned tracked vehicle. NRDC is a minority shareholder
in the British Hovercraft Corporation Ltd., a company formed in 1966 to
design and build hovercraft.
Most government departments concerned with science and technology make
special arrangements for dealing with international scientific relations but the
DES, through its International Scientific Relations Division, has a number
of inter-departmental responsibilities including the recruitment and scientific
support of Britain’s scientific counsellors overseas, who are seconded to the
Diplomatic Service. In areas of non-governmental collaboration, the primary
representative of the United Kingdom is the Royal Society.
The Government is concerned with inter-governmental organisations.
These include: specialised agencies of the United Nations, for example, the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO),
the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organisa¬
tion (FAO); nuclear energy, for example, the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), the European Nuclear Energy Agency (ENEA) and the
European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN); space research, for
example, ESRO; and the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC). There are agreements between the United Kingdom AEA and other
atomic energy authorities, including that of the Soviet Union (and there are
permanent representatives of the United States Atomic Energy Commission
in London and of the United Kingdom AEA in Washington). Also, there are
inter-governmental agreements with Euratom, and bilateral agreements with
other countries. Britain is also represented on the three scientific committees
of the OECD.
The Commonwealth Scientific Committee (CSC) consisting of the heads of
the national research organisations of Commonwealth countries, formed in
1958 from the previous Standing Committee set up in 1946, meets biennially.
Operating under the CSC is an executive sub-committee, membership of

which consists of officials responsible for scientific matters in the Common¬
wealth Missions in London, and representatives from British Government
departments, the research councils and the Royal Society. There are various
specialist committees. The secretariat for the Committee and its executive
sub-committee is provided by the Commonwealth Scientific Liaison Offices.
A British Commonwealth Scientific Conference held in 1946 recommended
the continuance and extension of the scientific collaboration of the war years
by the creation of the Commonwealth Scientific Liaison Offices, a group at
present consisting of the Scientific Liaison Offices in London of Australia,
Canada and New Zealand together with the International Scientific Relations
Division of the Department of Education and Science.
The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, financed by contributions from
all Commonwealth countries, comprise three Institutes and 11 Bureaux, all
of which except one Institute are in Britain and each of which is concerne
with a particular branch of agricultural science. They act as clearing houses
for the interchange of information of value to research workers m agncu tural
science throughout the Commonwealth and increasingly throughout the
world. Seventeen Abstract Journals, one Primary Journal and an Index are
published periodically and have a combined annual circulation of about 29,000
copies. The Institutes and Bureaux also issue monographs on their own
particular subjects and deal with enquiries received from research workers m
all parts of the Commonwealth.
The Ministry of Overseas Development’s (ODM) promotion of scientific
research in the interests of developing countries covers specialist advice from
Britain, advisory visits, conferences for exchange of information, training
scientists from overseas in universities and research institutions in Britain,
recruiting scientific staff from Britain, and providing support for existing
research services overseas, for example, in East Africa and the Caribbean
Some equipment is also given to encourage scientific training and applied
research. It administers and supports the work of, for example, the A
Locust Research Centre in London, internationally recognised as a world
centre for locust research since 1931. The Ministry is also responsible for the
Tropical Products Institute in London which aims at improving the economic
viability of the less-developed tropical countries, especially those within
the Commonwealth, by research into new uses for tropical plant and animal
products. The ODM provides about £3 million a year for research for
benefit of developing countries.
The principal aims of the British Council (see p. 163) in the sciences (including
agriculture, medicine and technology) are to foster co-operation between
British scientists and scientists of other countries, to promote among overseas
specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and ijs scientific
achievements, and, in the developing countries, to assist in curriculum refer
at school level and in the training of teachers of science and mathematics.
Much emphasis is placed on the interchange of scientists between Britain
and other countries. Overseas tours and advisory visits by British specialists
are arranged and scientists recruited for overseas posts. In the other direction
the Council invites senior specialists to Britain for visits and discussions with
British experts, and makes awards to postgraduate students; it also admimsters
the programmes of a large number of senior specialists and students who
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
207
travel to Britain under the auspices of the UN specialised agencies, or under
various bilateral technical assistance schemes, or as private individuals. The
Council is also responsible for administering travel grants awarded under the
Foreign and Commonwealth University Interchange Schemes.
Information on Britain’s scientific achievements is provided either through
the Council’s overseas libraries or direct from the London headquarters
which includes specialist departments (and libraries) for medicine and science.
Material published or compiled by these London departments includes
British Medical Bulletin, British Medical Book List, British Medical Index,
part of Scientific Research in British Universities and Colleges (see Bibliography,
p. 478), and publications listing facilities for education and training in Britain.
THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
This section describes the assistance and encouragement given to the arts
by the Government, local authorities, voluntary societies and other organisa¬
tions. Although valuable support comes from private sources, including
trusts and commercial concerns, the Government and local authorities are
taking an increasingly active part. In 1964, for the first time, a minister was
appointed to take special responsibility for the arts. The Government
considers that its role is not ‘to dictate taste or restrict the liberty of even the
most unorthodox and experimental of artists’ but to support the arts so that
a high level of artistic achievement can be sustained and the best in the arts
made more widely available (A Policy for the Arts, see Bibliography, p. 478).
The main educational functions concerning the arts are carried out in
England and Wales through the Department of Education and Science, in
Scotland through the Scottish Education Department and in Northern
Ireland by the Ministry of Education. In partnership with local education
authorities and voluntary bodies, they are concerned with schools, colleges
of further education and community centres. The Department of Education
and Science is also concerned with public libraries in England and Wales
and is responsible for the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Scottish
Education Department is responsible for the Royal Scottish Museum.
The Government aids the preservation of Britain’s cultural heritage by
means of grants which largely finance most of the national museums and
galleries; through the Ministry of Public Building and Works, which looks
after ancient monuments, and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government,
which is responsible for historic buildings; and by giving financial help to
independent bodies concerned with preservation, such as the National Trust
(see p. 174).
General help for the arts is given through government grants for music,
drama, literature, painting and sculpture; these are channelled for the greater
part through the Arts Councils of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which
contribute to the aspects of the arts not provided for by other agencies. Other
state-aided organisations include the British Film Institute and the Council
of Industrial Design.
Estimated government expenditure on the arts in Great Britain in 1969-70
is £17-i million. Direct allocations included £8-2 million for the Arts
Council of Great Britain (.£450,000 more than in 1968-69) and about £7
million for the running costs of national museums and galleries. In addition
over £2 million was allocated for the preservation of historic buildings and
ancient monuments.
2o8 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established in 1946 under a Royal
Charter. (A new charter was granted in 1967.) Its members are appointed by
the Secretary of State for Education and Science, in consultation with the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. Its main objects are to develop
and improve the knowledge, understanding and practice of the arts, to increase
the accessibility of the arts to the public, and to advise and co-operate with
government departments, local authorities and other organisations.
The Arts Council of Northern Ireland, which has similar aims, receives
a grant from the Northern Ireland Government. In 1969-70 this amounted
to £184,800.
The British Council (see footnote, p. 163) takes an active part in displaying
overseas the best in British drama, ballet, music and the visual arts.
Local Support Local authorities do valuable work in encouraging the arts. Under the Local
Government Act 1948 they may levy up to a sixpenny rate in England and
Wales for expenditure on entertainment in all its forms, including cultural
activities. By amending legislation (the Local Government (Scotland) Act
1966), the same rate applies to Scotland. They may also spend money on
buildings for the arts and provide and maintain museums and art galleries;
the Arts Councils are authorised to give financial help to house the arts. Many
towns support orchestras and theatres. The Greater London Council which,
as the London County Council, built the Royal Festival Hall, has agreed to
contribute equally with the Government towards the cost of the National
Theatre on the south bank of the Thames.
Private Many voluntary bodies are concerned with promoting the arts and include char-
Contributions itable trusts and foundations which give financial support. Industrial patronage
includes continuing support from the independent television companies.
The arts benefit most when the patrons—central and local government,
voluntary bodies, industry, the universities and individuals—combine. The
outstanding example is the Edinburgh Festival Society. Other arts festivals
organised on a similar basis include those held in the City of London,
Aldeburgh, Bath, Belfast, Cheltenham, Harrogate, King’s Lynn, Leeds,
Norwich and York.
Regional co-operation in arts patronage is growing with support from the
Government which encourages the formation of regional arts associations to
ensure that the whole range of the arts is more widely available to people
throughout the area. Such associations have been established in the north,
the north-west, Lincolnshire, the midlands, the south-west, Greater London,
southern England and north Wales. Plans are advanced for regional associa¬
tions covering East Anglia and Yorkshire.
DRAMA Government support for drama is given through the Arts Councils of Great
Britain and of Northern Ireland which grant subsidies to drama companies
which are registered as charities (that is, are non-profit making), provided
that such companies have given evidence of serious aims and of consistently
high standards of practical competence. The Arts Council of Great Britain
operates a scheme to promote new drama: guarantees may be offered to
managements giving the first professional production of selected new plays;
and promising authors may be awarded bursaries. Schemes are also in
operation to train stage designers, producers and those wishing to take up
theatre administration.

The British Council makes the British theatre better known abroad by
organising and sponsoring international tours by leading British theatre
companies and individual actors and producers, and by sending overseas
drama lectures and exhibitions of theatrical design or of books dealing with
the British theatre, and by providing newly published plays through its
overseas libraries.
There are about 200 professional theatres in Britain. The centre of theatrical
activity is in London, where there are some 30 principal theatres in the
‘West End’ and several more in the suburbs, but important developments
are taking place in the regions. In London, with six exceptions (Covent
Garden, Sadler’s Wells Opera at the London Coliseum, the Old Vic, the
Royal Court, the Mermaid and the Aldwych) the theatres are let to some 25
producing managements on a commercial basis for each production.
Among London companies receiving Arts Council grants are the National
Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, the English Stage Company,
which produces contemporary plays mainly at the Royal Court Theatre, and
the Mermaid.
The National Theatre Company was formed in 1963; it will eventually
play in the new National Theatre, to be built on the south bank of the Thames
in London. The capital costs of the theatre will be met by the Exchequer and
the Greater London Council; grants towards the Company’s running costs
are being made by the Arts Council and the Greater London Council.
The Company, whose repertoire consists of classical and modern plays from
all countries, is large enough for simultaneous productions to be undertaken
in London (at the Old Vic Theatre) and in the provinces or overseas.
The Royal Shakespeare Company presents Shakespearean plays at the Royal
Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, and international classical and
modern plays at the Aldwych Theatre, London. It will eventually have a perm¬
anent London home in the proposed City of London arts centre in the Barbican.
The provincial theatres are served by productions touring either before or
after London presentation, by companies specially formed for touring, and
by local repertory companies. An important development is the growth of
the civic theatre. The term is generally taken to include some companies
which have the use of their own theatres (as in Lincoln, Liverpool, Birming¬
ham and Dundee) or rent them from a local authority (as at Bristol, Chester¬
field and Edinburgh) and those like the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, and the
Nottingham Playhouse which were built by the city councils. These com¬
panies are assisted by the Arts Council. Many leading dramatists, producers,
designers, actors and actresses are associated with such companies and
standards are high.
A number of new theatres have been opened both in London and the
provinces in recent years, including, in London, the Mermaid Theatre and
the completely reconstructed Queen’s Theatre. Coventry’s Belgrade Theatre,
opened in 1958, was the first major theatre to be built by a civic authority
since 1939. Other new theatres include the Chichester Festival Theatre (1962),
the Nottingham Playhouse, the Phoenix Theatre, Leicester (1963), the
Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford (1965), the Northcott Theatre, Exeter,
the Octagon Theatre, Bolton (1967), the Forum Theatre, Billingham, and the
Gateway Theatre, Chester (1968). Civic theatres have been built at Croydon,
Eastbourne, Torquay and Weymouth, and smaller theatres at East Grinstead,
Middlesbrough, Richmond (Yorkshire), Whitehaven (Cumberland) and
Worcester.

In Northern Ireland the Ulster Group Theatre in Belfast specialises in
Ulster comedy; and the Belfast Arts Theatre presents some international
drama and lighter theatrical entertainment. Also in Belfast the Lyric Players
Theatre, a non-profit-making organisation, presents Irish and international
drama in a small theatre recently built with Arts Council support. Professional
theatres are eligible for grants in respect of specific productions agreed with
the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
All plays produced in Great Britain are subject to the provisions of the
Theatres Act 1968. This repealed the Theatres Act 1843 which gave the Lord
Chamberlain (the senior officer of the Royal Household) powers to censor
stage plays. There is now no censorship but the new Act makes it a criminal
offence to present or direct an obscene performance of a play in public or in
private (including in theatre clubs), an obscene performance being defined as
one which tends ‘to deprave and corrupt persons who were likely ... to attend
it’. Provision is made in the Act for a defence against a charge of obscenity on
the grounds that the performance was for the public good in the interests of,
for example, drama, opera or literature.
Most managers and artists are members of professional organisations such
as the Theatres’ Advisory Council, the London Theatre Council, the Pro¬
vincial Theatre Council, the Society of West End Managers, the Theatrical
Managers’ Association, the Council of Repertory Theatres, British Actors
Equity (the actors’ trade union) and the League of Dramatists. The trade
union of theatre staffs is the National Association of Theatrical and Kine
Employees.
There are thousands of amateur dramatic societies in Britain with an active
membership of some half a million. They are encouraged by local education
authorities, by other public bodies, and by four special organisations the
British Drama League, the Standing Conference of Drama Associations, the
Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association of Ulster Drama
Festivals. Amateur companies which stage productions in their own theatres
belong to the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain; for instance, the People’s
Theatre in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Questor’s Theatre, Ealing.
Most universities have active amateur drama clubs and societies; an
International Festival of University Theatre, inaugurated by Bristol in 1959,
is held annually.
Training for the theatre is provided mainly in drama schools. Among the
most important are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (which is grant-
aided and provides a two-year course in all branches of stage work), the
Central School of Speech and Drama, the Rose Bruford Training College,
the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, the Webber-Douglas
School, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Arts Educational
Schools, all of which are in or near London; and the Old Vic School in
Bristol. In Scotland there is the College of Dramatic Art, which is an integral
part of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music in Glasgow and is grant-aided
by the Scottish Education Department. An increasing number of universities
offer courses in drama.
The Society for Theatre Research brings together those interested in the
history and technique of the British theatre. The International Theatre
Institute has a British centre in London. The main purpose of the institute is
to foster international goodwill and understanding by interchange of students,
theatrical companies, personnel and theatrical information.

Many schools and youth clubs put on plays and provide some education in
drama. A drama centre for the London education service is provided at
Toynbee Hall in east London; and there are youth theatres in the London
boroughs of Camden and Hillingdon. At Coventry special productions are
arranged for school children and members of the Belgrade Theatre’s staff
teach at local schools. Sheffield’s Theatre Vanguard puts on plays for and by
children and Nottingham has a Youth Theatre Workshop.
A large number of organisations such as the Unicorn Theatre for Children
and Theatre Centre present children’s plays in London and the provinces. The
National Youth Theatre, whose members are all young people, presents
mainly Shakespearean productions in London, the provinces and abroad.
Music in all its forms draws large audiences; and music festivals, orchestral
concerts, choral singing, brass bands, chamber music, opera and ballet are
important features of British cultural life. The increase in musical appreciation
in recent years is shown by the size of audiences for concerts and for broadcast
music. Nearly 99 million gramophone records (of which half were estimated to
be of serious music) were produced during 1968.
The City of Westminster houses the Central Music Library which lends to
other libraries and individuals. Another well-known music collection is the
Henry Watson Music Library at the Manchester Central Library.
The Arts Council of Great Britain makes grants to a number of orchestras,
opera and ballet companies, and music societies. The British Council gives
financial assistance to some of the overseas tours of British orchestras, soloists,
and opera and ballet companies; it sponsors recordings of works by British
composers and maintains 102 libraries of British music (scores and records)
in 67 countries overseas and, at its London headquarters, a reference library
of records, scores and books on music.
The National Music Council, representative of many aspects of British
musical activity, is affiliated to the International Music Council which is
associated with UNESCO.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities of Britain. In London the principal concert halls are the
Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, adjacent to which are
the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room which were opened in 1967
for smaller-scale performances; the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington, where
the annual summer season of Promenade Concerts is given; and the Wigmore
Hall, an important recital centre.
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the
London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic, the New Philharmonia, the
Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle (Manchester), the City of Birming¬
ham Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony, the Scottish National and the
BBC Symphony, Northern and Scottish orchestras. There are also specialised
string and chamber orchestras such as the Northern Sinfonia, the Philomusica
of London, the English Chamber Orchestra and the London Mozart Players.
Many of these receive financial aid from the Arts Council of Great Britain and
local authorities; some of them also receive assistance from commercial
television and other business organisations. In Northern Ireland the Ulster
Orchestra receives financial aid from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC
Choral, the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic

Choir, the London Philharmonic Choir, the New Philharmonia Chorus, the
Bach Choir, the Royal Edinburgh Choral Union and the Belfast Philharmonic
Society. These and many other choral societies are associated with famous
orchestras in major choral works; most of them, together with hundreds of
similar choral and orchestral societies and music clubs, are affiliated to the
National Federation of Music Societies, through which they are supported
with funds provided by the Arts Council. Among societies which specialise
in encouraging the performance of the work of living musicians are the
Society for the Promotion of New Music, the Music Section of the Institute
of Contemporary Arts, and Macnaghten Concerts.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in
existence for over 200 years. The famous Edinburgh International Festival
lasts three weeks; other festivals such as at King’s Lynn, last a week or less.
Among the better known are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales; the
Llangollen International Eisteddfod; the National Gaelic Mod, held at a
different place in Scotland each year; the Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted
to contemporary British music; the Aldeburgh Festival; the Bath Festival,
the Coventry Festival; the Haslemere Festival; the biennial York Festival;
and the Leeds and Norwich Festivals, which include important choral
music, and which are held triennially. An annual international festival of folk
song and dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by the work of County
Music Committees (some of which are voluntary and some sub-committees
of local education authorities), which are aided by the Carnegie United
Kingdom Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music.
The Rural Music Schools Association is concerned with music-making by
amateurs in country districts; it brings together professional musicians,
teachers, administrators and amateurs.
Professional organisations which look after the interests of music and
musicians include the Musicians’ Union, the Incorporated Society of Musi¬
cians, the Composers’ Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London, leased by the Government on behalf of the Royal
Opera House, Covent Garden, Limited, which was formed in 1944 to make
the famous opera house the home of a national opera and ballet, and which
receives a grant from the Arts Council. The Royal Opera House has its own
opera company (The Royal Opera) and two ballet companies (The Royal
Ballet). The opera company numbers about 200 and has a permanent
orchestra. The Royal Ballet has a high international reputation and has made
many overseas tours; its second company tours extensively in Great Britain.
Seasons of opera and operetta are also given by the Sadler’s Wells Company
in London; with two permanent opera companies, Sadler’s Wells plays in
London throughout the year, and for about 30 weeks in other centres.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international
cast is specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies
include the English Opera Group, noted for its performances of chamber
operas by Benjamin Britten and other composers; the New Opera Company,
formed by members of the Cambridge Opera Group to produce new operas
in London; the Handel Opera Society; the Intimate Opera Company, which
performs works for very small casts in any hall available; and the Welsh

Scottish towns. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted with financial
support from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. The Arts Council of
Great Britain presents three small operatic groups (Opera for All) which
specialise in introducing opera to audiences in small towns. There are also a
number of amateur opera societies.
Among other ballet companies are London’s Festival Ballet, the Ballet
Rambert (Britain’s oldest ballet company) and the Western Theatre Ballet
which specialises in contemporary works. The work of the Patricia Mulholland
Irish Ballet Company in Northern Ireland, which is sponsored by the Arts
Council of Northern Ireland, combines traditional music, dancing and mime.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the Royal
Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music in London, and the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music in Glasgow are grant-aided. There are also
the Trinity College of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama,
both in London, the Royal Manchester College of Music and the Birmingham
School of Music.
The London Opera Centre for Advanced Training and Development
provides some rehearsal and other facilities for the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden. Its courses last two or three years. The leading ballet schools
are the Royal Ballet, the Rambert Ballet School and the Royal Academy of
Dancing which, with many private schools, have played an important part in
raising British ballet to its present high standard. Other schools offering
general education combined with drama and/or ballet are run by the Arts
Educational Trust and the Italia Conti School.
Young people are encouraged to take an interest in music, opera and ballet.
There are frequent concerts for children and the National Youth Orchestra of
Great Britain, the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and the London
Schools’ Symphony Orchestra are noted for their high standard of perfor¬
mance. A Youth and Music organisation, affiliated to the international
Jeunesses Musicales, encourages opera, ballet and other performances for
young people.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and
some 128,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the exami¬
nations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, the largest
proportion (over 60 per cent) choosing the piano as their instrument.
The Royal Ballet sponsors a small group, Ballet for All, to give lecture-
demonstrations to the public and to schools.
Although cinema attendance has been steadily declining in Great Britain since
its peak of 1,635 million in 1946 to 237 million in 1968, and the number of
licensed cinemas has declined from 4,709 to 1,631 over the same period,
British films, actors and creative and technical talent are appreciated both at
home and abroad and frequently achieve success at international film events.
Television offers very large potential audiences for films and provides
opportunities of employment for technicians and actors.
London is one of the most important centres for the making of films for
international markets and export earnings are an important part of total
earnings. The Film Production Association of Great Britain is the trade
association to which many feature film producers belong.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back to
1929, when a group of directors began making factual films of a distincthe
and imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial
organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then,
British documentary technicians have continued to produce high quality
factual films which have won numerous international awards. The British
Industrial and Scientific Film Association promotes the use of films in
industry, science and commerce. The Federation of Specialised Film Associa¬
tions, the trade association of documentary, short, industrial, advertising and
cartoon film makers, has about 100 members.
Films from abroad made in languages other than English often draw large
audiences in London and other large cities.
Although over half of British main feature production is supported by United
States interests at present, the Rank Organisation and Associated British
Picture Corporation maintain a substantial interest in production, distribution
and exhibition. Most British film producers are independent but make films
in association with these major interests. There are numerous companies,
many of them small, which produce short films.
There is no state-owned film production unit in Britain, but the National
Film Finance Corporation lends money for feature film production. Its
members are appointed by the Board of Trade and its funds are limited by
statute to £8 million. In recent years the Corporation was financially concerned
with about half the main feature films made in British studios, but this
proportion has now fallen in view of the American support a\ ailable.
There is also a levy on cinema admissions to provide a film production fund.
The money so raised is paid out as a percentage of a film’s takings, so that the
more successful a film is at the box-office, the more it receives from the fund.
Started by the industry in 195° on a voluntary basis, the scheme became
statutory under the Cinematograph Films Act 1957.
The Government sponsors a wide range of films to inform audiences
overseas about British life and achievements, including documentary films,
television programmes and newsreels; they are produced thiough the Central
Office of Information (COI), which commissions their production by private
companies. These, together with films acquired from private industry and
public bodies, are distributed throughout the world, in English and many
foreign languages, by British Information Services. The British Council also
distributes overseas a wide range of specialised films mainly on the arts,
education, medicine, science and technology.
Films are also sponsored by the Government, some for specialised
audiences, on such subjects as science, agriculture, health and industiy,
as well as films for the general public on, for example, road safety and health
education.
A large number of films are sponsored by industrial concerns and other
organisations, such as the British Travel Association and the British Produc¬
tivity Council. The best of these and industrial films from other countries are
available through the COFs Central Film Library and other agencies.
The Films of Scotland Committee promotes the production of Scottish
films covering the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
To help British films to meet the keen American competition, legislation
passed in 1927 introduced the quota system (continued by subsequent
legislation), under which a certain proportion of British films must be shown

in British cinemas each year. The proportion is fixed by the Board of Trade
annually after consultation with the Cinematograph Films Council, any
change being effected by statutory instrument approved by both Houses of
Parliament. For main feature films it has stood at 30 per cent since 1950.
The State takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but before it can
be shown a film must be licensed by the local licensing authority. There are
about 700 of these (usually the local authorities or, in some areas, magistrates).
In considering the suitability of films the authorities normally rely on the
judgment of an independent body, the British Board of Film Censors, to
which are submitted all films (other than newsreels) intended for public
showing.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative of
the cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in the
films offered to the public. The Board, which does not use any written code
of censorship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate to a
film; very rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the Board are placed
in one of three categories: ‘U’ (suitable for universal showing); ‘A’ (more
suitable for adults than children who are admitted only if accompanied by an
adult); and ‘X’ (suitable only for adults; children are not admitted).
Film reviews appear regularly in the press and on sound and television
programmes and many organisations are interested in different aspects of the
film. There are numerous private film societies.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film
Institute, founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant.
The Institute encourages the making and showing of good films. It also
administers the National Film Theatre in London and the National Film
Archive, runs an annual summer school, and maintains a film library from
which films may be hired, a library of books on the film and an information
service. It makes grants to the Federation of Film Societies, the British
Universities Film Council and the Society for Education in Film and
Television.
The National Film Archive contains over 17,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and about
650,000 photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the art of the
film and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre, on the south bank of the Thames, in London,
shows films of outstanding historical, artistic or technical interest; it holds
a unique position as a cinema offering regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the films shown.
The British Film Institute promotes the development of regional film theatres
on the lines of the National Film Theatre and is empowered to make grants
towards their recurrent and capital costs. Grants towards similar projects in
Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
T he Society of Film and Television Arts, formed in 1958 by the amalgamation
of the British Film Academy and the Guild of Television Producers and
Directors, has as its aim to improve the standard of film and television
production and to stimulate public appreciation of the arts.
The National Film Theatre organises an annual London Film Festival, which
includes films receiving their first showing as well as films which have been
successful in international competitive festivals. A council on which leading

British film organisations are represented organises a film festival as part of
the Edinburgh International Festival.
The Cinematograph Act 1952 (which came into force in January 1956)
provided for the making of regulations by the Home Secretary to protect the
health and welfare of children attending film shows. Cinemas which give
children’s shows require a special licence from the licensing authority, which
may impose conditions. There are about 75® children s cinema clubs which
provide special programmes on Saturday mornings. An important contribu¬
tion to these programmes is made by the Children’s Film Foundation, which
produces and distributes entertainment films specially designed for children
and publishes at intervals a list of films particularly suitable for children and
for exhibition at children’s matinees. The Foundation is a non-profit-making
body set up by the British film industry in 195^ under the Cinematograph
Films Act 1957, it receives grants from the British Film Fund Agency.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, winning 72 international prizes since 1949 and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at
home has been stimulated by an increasingly lively attitude towards display
on the part of museums and galleries, and by the varied activities of many
institutions, societies, private galleries and the growing number of local art
centres. t .
Painting and sculpture receive state support by grants to national institu¬
tions and, indirectly, through purchase grants made to local art galleries and
museums, to local education authorities for art schools and other means of
promoting education in art, and to the Arts Council which takes an active
part by organising exhibitions and building up its own collections of
contemporary British art. The Government is advised on grants and matters
of museums policy by the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries
and the Royal Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland.
Knowledge of Britain’s fine arts is fostered overseas by the British Council’s
exhibitions and lectures. In 1968-69 fine art exhibitions organised by the
Council were shown in 65 countries and the Council was also responsible for
British participation in eight international exhibitions.
Over 900 museums and art galleries are open to the public in Britain.
There are 20 national museums and art galleries. Those in London probably
contain between them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within
one city. They are the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum,
the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the
Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum, the London Museum
(to be amalgamated with the Guildhall Museum into the Museum of London),
the Wallace Collection, the British Museum (Natural History), the Geological
Museum and the Science Museum (see p. 203).
There are six national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland, the
Royal Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, the
Scottish United Services Museum, and the Scottish National Gallery of
Modern Art. The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at

St. Fagan’s Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed; and in Northern
Ireland there is the national Ulster Museum in Belfast.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (Tower of
London), the Public Record Office (see p. 221) and the Sir John Soane’s
Museum. In Buckingham Palace there is a small gallery for exhibition of
pictures from the extensive royal collections. Most cities and large towns and
many other towns have a museum devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes by a local
learned society or privately by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and
Cambridge are rich in museums, many of them, as in other towns, associated
with the universities—for example, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford,
founded in 1683, the oldest in the country, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in
Cambridge. There are important museums and art galleries in Birmingham,
Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich, Read-
ing, Southampton and York. In Northern Ireland there are notable museums
and galleries in or near Belfast (the Ulster Folk Museum and the Northern
Ireland Arts Council Gallery), in Armagh City and in Londonderry.
In recent years there has been a notable development of *period-house
museums’, for which outstanding private houses have been taken over by
national and municipal authorities, and of folk museums. Many private art
collections housed in historic family mansions, including those in the owner¬
ship of the National Trust (see p. 174), are open to the public.
In the past decade several new or extensively altered museum buildings
have been opened, including those at Coventry, Derby, Doncaster, Durham
(the Gulbenkian Museum at the university), Leicester (Jewry Wall Archaeo¬
logical Museum), Liverpool, Manchester (Whitworth Art Gallery), Scun¬
thorpe and Sunderland. Developments are planned for museums in Belfast,
Bristol, Cardiff, Hull, London and Newcastle. County councils are playing a
greater part in the provision of museums and museum services; there are
schemes in Oxfordshire (jointly with Oxford City Council), County Durham,
Staffordshire, Pembrokeshire, Rutland, Worcestershire and Hampshire. New
projects are also being initiated by local associations for the arts.
A function of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries is to
advise the Government on the relationship between national and provincial
institutions. Close relations are fostered by the eight area museum councils
which cover the whole of Great Britain. They are grant-aided by the
Government and help to improve technical facilities.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas
members, is an independent organisation. The Association serves as a central
body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters relating
to museum administration, and as a training and examining body for
professional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions organised and sent on tour by the Arts Councils, the
Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science
Museum and the Art Exhibitions Bureau are a regular feature of many
museums. The Tate Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal
Academy show loan exhibitions; the Whitechapel Art Gallery, the Camden
Arts Centre and the Institute of Contemporary Arts (at their new premises in
The Mall) also show temporary exhibitions. The Greater London Council
exhibits modern sculpture in one of its parks on the south bank of the Thames
periodically and in the summer of 1968 opened a new exhibition gallery, the

Hayward Gallery, administered by the Arts Council, where major exhibitions
are shown. Commercial exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists
are held throughout the year in the galleries of the art dealers of London
(largely in the Bond Street area).
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy;
the Royal Scottish Academy; the Society of Scottish Artists, the Royal
Society of British Artists; the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours; the
Royal Society of Portrait Painters; the Artists’ International Association; the
Women’s International Art Club; and the London Group (all associations
of professional painters). Some of these societies, notably the Royal Academy
at Burlington House, have their own galleries in London. In Northern Ireland
there are the Royal Ulster Academy of Arts, the Ulster Society of Women
Artists and the Ulster Arts Club. Among regional societies are the Newlyn
Society of Artists, the Midland Group of Artists (Nottingham), the Birming¬
ham Society of Artists and the Penwith Society of Arts, while an increasing
number of amateur art societies throughout Britain hold local exhibitions and
encourage local interest in the fine arts. There are also exhibitions of children’s
art, including the National Exhibition of Children’s Art sponsored annually
by the Sunday Mirror.
All national collections are financed from government funds, both those that
are the direct responsibility of the Department of Education and Science (the
Victoria and Albert and the Science Museums) and of the Scottish Education
Department (the Royal Scottish Museum) and those run by trustee bodies.
Besides meeting the administrative costs, provision is made for annual
purchase grants which totalled £987,35° ^ 1969-7°- The Government also
provides special ad hoc purchase grants and collections may receive works of
art acquired by the Treasury in lieu of estate duty. The buildings are main¬
tained by the Ministry of Public Building and Works. Local museums and art
galleries, which are maintained from rates or endowments, can be helped in
building up their collections through the annual government grant (£102,000
in 1969-70) administered by the Victoria and Albert and Royal Scottish
Museums. Financial help and pictures are also given to museums and galleries
by certain trusts and voluntary bodies, particularly the National Art-
Collections Fund and the Contemporary Art Society.
The Council of Industrial Design (CoID), set up in 1944 by the Government
to promote higher standards of design in British industry, is concerned with
all aspects of industrial design from durable consumer goods to capital goods.
The CoID, with its Scottish Committee, is a grant-aided body sponsored by ^
the Board of Trade; its members include industrialists, retail management,
architects, designers and educationists. At the Design Centre in the Hay-
market, London, a selective but changing display of modern British consumer 1
goods is maintained; exhibits are chosen from Design Index, the CoID’s
illustrated record of more than 10,000 well-designed products. Special
exhibitions on particular themes are also arranged regularly. An annual awards
scheme, Council of Industrial Design Awards, covering capital goods and
engineering equipment as well as consumer products, was introduced in 1967.
The Duke of Edinburgh also presents his annual Prize for Elegant Design.
The Scottish Committee runs the Scottish Design Centre in Glasgow, and
there are three independent regional design centres, each maintaining a
duplicate of the Index, at Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham. I he CoID
organises temporary exhibitions in regional centres and overseas; arranges [
regular conferences and training courses; and undertakes industrial study

tours in Britain. It publishes a monthly magazine, Design, and maintains
extensive reference and photographic libraries.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of
Arts (see p. 193), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is the
representative professional body in Great Britain of designers engaged in
industry and commerce, and the Design and Industries Association (DIA), a
voluntary association of industrial companies, designers, and others interested
in the promotion of good design in industry. The Crafts Council of Great
Britain, the Crafts Centre of Great Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre are
all grant-aided by the Board of Trade. Their aims are to improve craft design
and to promote closer relations between craftsmen and industry.
Formal art education is given in publicly supported art colleges, university
art schools, the Royal Academy Schools and a few private art schools. There
are the colleges, art schools and classes administered by the local education
authorities; and at a senior level there is the Royal College of Art, London,
whose students have usually completed a course at a local education authority
college, and which awards its own degrees. Art is also taught at an advanced
level at the four Scottish Central (Art) Institutions administered by the
Scottish Education Department. University art schools include the Slade
School of Fine Art and Goldsmiths’ College (London), the Ruskin Drawing
School (Oxford), the Reading School of Art, the Department of Fine Art of
the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and the School of Art of University
College, Aberystwyth.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history
of art are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Depart¬
ment of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and
the Warburg Institute, also a part of London University.
In England and Wales three-year full-time courses leading to a Diploma in
Art and Design are available to students who have successfully completed a
foundation course. The Diploma is broadly comparable to a university pass
degree, and is administered by the National Council for Diplomas in Art and
Design (an independent self-governing body set up by the then Minister of
Education in 1961). The Council also administers a scheme of post-diploma
studies in a small number of colleges. In Scotland each of the four schools of
art awards a diploma which is roughly equivalent to the pass degree of a
university.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school, and the Society
for Education through Art, among other activities, encourages the purchase
by schools of original works of art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools
exhibition. Pictures may also be borrowed from an increasing number of
public libraries (see p. 222).
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned with
encouraging the best in new building and preserving the best that has been
inherited from the past.
Several government departments are concerned with architecture and help
to promote good design. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government,
the Scottish Development Department, and the Northern Ireland Ministry of
Development are responsible for approving the layout and design of local
authority housing schemes, and set standards for local authority housing. The
Ministry of Housing and Local Government is responsible for the work of
the National Building Agency (see p. 298) which carries out development and
220

research concerning new building techniques. The Ministry of Public Building
and Works is also responsible for the design, building and maintenance
work of all government departments; it also has a research and development
group which co-ordinates similar groups throughout the government service.
The Architects and Building Branches at the Department of Education
and Science and the Scottish Education Department carry out research for
school building programmes. The Department of Health and Social Security
is implementing a very large building programme and the Regional Hospital
Boards, through their architectural departments, are responsible for the
design and construction of a large number of hospitals and ancillary buildings.
Government departments are assisted in an advisory capacity by the Royal
Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland, which also
advise planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of public
amenity or artistic importance, including new building developments.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions
exist to further the interests of architecture, and the Civic Trust (see p. 174)
seeks to promote high standards in architecture and civic planning and to
encourage a wider interest in the appearance of towns and the countryside.
The Minister of Public Building and Works and the Secretaries of State
for Scotland and Wales have responsibilities for the preservation of ancient
monuments and certain historic buildings and the Minister of Housing and
Local Government (together with the Secretaries of State) is responsible for
administering the grants available for the repair and maintenance of buildings
of outstanding historic or architectural interest; in Northern Ireland these
responsibilities are vested in the Ministry of Finance.
In Britain it is illegal for a person to practise under the title of ‘architect’
unless registered with the Architects’ Registration Council of the United
Kingdom. Most students train at a full-time school of architecture; there are
28 schools recognised for exemption from the Intermediate and Final
examinations of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and five
recognised for the intermediate examination only. In addition to these schools,
which may also have part-time courses, there are six schools of art and
technical colleges which have full-time courses leading to the external
examinations of the RIBA.
The Royal Institute of British Architects, the leading professional
architectural institution in Britain, has a membership of nearly 23,000 with
some 6,000 students. Allied to it are 51 architectural societies covering the
whole of the United Kingdom and countries overseas. The RIBA has one of
the largest and most important architectural libraries in the world. It is
concerned with a wide range of activities covering professional practice,
science, technology, statistics, architectural competitions, professional and
public relations; arranges lectures and discussions on a variety of subjects,
presents exhibitions; and, through its Board of Education, controls the
training and examination of architects. The Royal Gold Medal for Archi¬
tecture is awarded annually by the Queen on the recommendation of the
RIBA. Among other associations are the Incorporated Association of Archi¬
tects and Surveyors, the Institute of Registered Architects and the Faculty of
Architects and Surveyors. Societies include the Architectural Association,
the Architecture Club, and several which cover particular aspects of archi¬
tecture, such as the Modular Society.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges
and universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country,
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
221
private libraries and a large number of private literary societies. Book reviews
are featured in the press and on radio and television and there are numerous
periodicals concerned in whole or in part with literature.
Government help is given through the Arts Council of Great Britain
which supports literature in a number of ways, including grants for writers,
a fund to aid literary projects, and subsidies to festivals of literature and poetry.
Similar provision is made, through the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, for
bursaries, poetry readings, and aid for publications.
Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given in the form of literary
prizes, a number of which are awarded annually, for instance, the Queen’s
Gold Medal for Poetry, the James Tait Black Memorial prizes for biography
and literature, the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial prize for young writers of
promise, the Hawthornden prize for imaginative writing, the Winston
Spencer Churchill Literary Award for an outstanding work in the history
of the English-speaking peoples, the Library Association Carnegie Medal
for an outstanding book for children, the Kate Greenaway Medal for the best
children’s book illustration and the Somerset Maugham award for young
writers.
Libraries The British Museum Library in London (over 7 million volumes) is the largest
in Britain. The National Library of Scotland (over 2 million volumes) is in
Edinburgh, and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (nearly 2 million volumes).
Together with the Bodleian Library of Oxford University (over 3 J million
volumes) and the Cambridge University Library (4 million volumes) these
comprise the ‘copyright’ libraries of the country and are entitled to receive
a copy of each new book published in Britain: the British Museum Library
must receive a copy, the other libraries may claim one.
In addition to the British Museum Library the principal national library
institutions in England are the National Central Library (see p. 223), the
National Lending Library for Science and Technology (see p. 204), the
British National Bibliography, the Science Museum Library and the National
Reference Library of Science and Invention. The establishment of a National
Libraries Authority to co-ordinate their services and operations (except
for the Science Museum Library) was recommended in 1969 by the Dainton
Committee, which had been appointed to ensure their development in the most
effective way (see Bibliography, p. 478).
The Victoria and Albert and the British Museum (Natural History) in
South Kensington also have large libraries and many government departments
have old-established libraries of considerable size and importance, for example,
those of the Board of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
and the Ministry of Defence. The Public Record Office contains the records
of the superior courts of law and of most government departments, as well
as such famous historical documents as Domesday Book. The National
Register of Archives (maintained by the Historical Manuscripts Commission)
contains particulars of local and private records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the John Rylands
Library, Manchester, the Signet Library, Edinburgh, and the London
Library, there are the rich resources of the learned societies and institutions
(for scientific societies and institutions, see p. 192). Examples are the libraries
of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Royal Commonwealth
Society, the Commonwealth Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the
Royal Institute of British Architects (see p. 220), the Royal College of
Physicians, the British Drama League (see p. 210), the Royal College of

The great expansion in education in recent years has increased the strain on
library resources at all levels of education. The ancient university libraries of
Oxford and Cambridge are not matched by any of the more recent founda¬
tions, although the combined library resources of the colleges and institutions
of the University of London total over 4 million volumes and the university
libraries of Edinburgh, St. Andrews, Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool,
Manchester and Leeds each have over half a million volumes. However,
many universities have succeeded in building up large and important research
collections in special subjects; for example, the Barnes Medical Library at
Birmingham and the Brotherton Library of English Literature at Leeds. The
new universities, including the new technological universities, are also rapidly
building collections.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, often receive co-operation from the public library service,
including loans of books. School children are regularly introduced to the
public library system, which they can use in addition to the school library.
Britain is served by a complete network of public libraries, administered by
485 public library authorities (county councils, county borough councils,
London borough councils, municipal borough councils and urban district
councils). The authorities in Great Britain, which provide more than 11,500
service points, have a total stock of over 100 million books. (These figures
do not include the libraries in the publicly maintained schools.) Nearly
one-third of the total population are members of public libraries.
Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 the Secretary of State
for Education and Science is charged with the supervision of the public
library service in England and Wales, acting on the advice of the two Library
Advisory Councils, one for England, the other for Wales. Under the Act,
public library authorities are designated and have a duty to provide an
efficient and free lending and reference library service for books and periodi¬
cals. Outlying areas may be served by mobile libraries, of which 530 are in
service, and facilities exist for people who are unable to visit a library.
In addition to lending books, about a quarter of the library authorities now
lend gramophone records of various kinds and a growing number are adding
loan collections to works of art, either originals or reproductions. Nearly all
library authorities provide children’s departments and reference sections and
art, music, commercial and technical departments meet the growing and more
specific demands in these fields.
Most library authorities possess a significant collection of books and
documents on the history of their localities. Qualified and specialist staff are
available for consultation in all but the smallest service points.
The public library is often a local cultural centre. Film shows, lectures,
adult education classes, book-week exhibitions, drama groups, gramophone
recitals and children’s story hours are among the many activities. An increasing
number of libraries provide special facilities for these extension activities.
The Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 gave statutory recognition to
the voluntary system of library co-operation in England and Wales which
had grown up since the first quarter of this century. The ten regional library
bureaux in England and Wales (consisting mainly of public libraries in each
Library
Associations

area) aim to be largely self-sufficient in the interlending of current British
books by means of a national system of subject specialisation. They organise
co-operation through their own member libraries and through the National
Central Library, which is responsible for interlending at national and inter¬
national level and has a bookstock of its own of nearly 450,000 volumes built
up by purchase, gift and the operation of the British National Book Centre
exchange scheme with foreign libraries. The combined resources of libraries
available to the National Central Library, which includes university, industrial
and other non-public libraries, amount to over 100 million books and many
thousand sets of periodicals.
There is a growing number of schemes for the exchange of specialist books
and periodicals as well as information. These are organised by associations of
industrial and commercial libraries which combine their resources, normally
through the local public or technical college library.
The Scottish Central Library carries out functions similar to those of the
regional bureaux and the National Central Library. Both Central Libraries
are financed in part by Exchequer grants. In Northern Ireland access to the
stocks of all co-operating libraries is available on application to the Belfast
public libraries, Queen’s University Library and the county libraries.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association, which was
granted a Royal Charter in 1898 to unite all people engaged or interested in
library work; to promote the better administration of libraries and, inter alia,
to hold examinations in librarianship and to issue certificates of efficiency.
The Association in 1969 had a membership of over 16,500 of whom nearly
1,500 were from overseas countries. It maintains a Register of Chartered
Librarians, publishes books and pamphlets, a Yearbook and an official journal,
The Library Association Record. The Association and its branches, groups and
sections hold regular conferences. There are also associations of libraries of
which Aslib (the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux,
see p. 204) and the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries
(SCONUL) are of major importance.
New books constitute the large majority of all books published in Britain. In
1968 British publishers issued 31,420 separate titles, of which 22,642 were
new books and the rest reprints or new editions. In recent years there has been
a great increase in the number of paperbacked books of all kinds.
The above figures include only a small selection of government publications
by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, which is the largest publishing organisa¬
tion in Britain. The great majority of books, however, are produced by about
300 of the principal commercial publishers. These include the university
presses, notably the Oxford University Press (including the Clarendon Press)
and the Cambridge University Press.
Using the copies deposited under copyright law in the British Museum, the
British National Bibliography is published weekly, with three, six, nine and
twelve monthly cumulations, listing in a classified order, with indexes, all new
books and new editions, excluding reprints, of books published in Britain.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the
Booksellers’ Association; the Book Development Council promotes British
books overseas. The Society of Authors is a professional association of writers.
The National Book League has a membership covering all who are interested
in books: authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and readers. It
encourages an interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain and overseas.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Knowledge of British books and periodicals overseas is greatly assisted
by the British Council through the lending and reference libraries (over 180)
which it runs or supplies, and through the many touring book and periodicals
exhibitions. (For sales and exports of books in 1968, see p. 279.)
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and
the Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of
Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies, generally known as the
British Academy, is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives a
grant from the Treasury.
A number of societies sponsor poetry readings and recitals; the Poetry
Society, the Apollo Society and the Barrow Poets are among the best known.
Poetry also plays an important part in various annual festivals, including the
National Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales—the Stratford-upon-
Avon Festival of Poetry, the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, and the
biennial poetry festival organised by the Poetry Book Society in London.
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. There are a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book
Society and the Poetry Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new
books to their members.
lO THE NATIONAL
ECONOMY
BACKGROUND
Britain ranks about 75th s^ze arnong the countries of the world, with
about 0-18 per cent of the world’s land area. In population, approaching
2 per cent of the world’s inhabitants, it ranks tenth. In density of population
it is fourth: of the major countries, only Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands
are more crowded; and there are nine times as many people to the square
mile in the United Kingdom as in the United States. In terms of national
income per head it ranks appreciably below the United States and also below
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland, and slightly
below France and the Federal Republic of Germany. In world trade, it
ranks third, accounting for nearly one-tenth of the total. It takes about a fifth
of the world’s exports of primary products, and provides about one-eighth of
the world’s exports of manufactured goods.
Britain, from its own soil, provides only about half of the food it needs,
and apart from coal, low-grade iron ore and natural gas—it has few natural
resources; thus it is the world’s largest importer of such products as wheat,
meat, butter, fodder grains, citrus fruits, tea, tobacco, wool, and hard timber.
In return, it is one of the world’s largest exporters of aircraft, motor vehicles,
electrical equipment, chemicals, textiles and most types of machinery. No
other major country has such a small proportion of the working population
engaged in agriculture (about 3 per cent).
The United Kingdom is also the central banker of the sterling area, an
area with a quarter of the world’s population. Many countries outside the
sterling area use sterling in their international transactions, and it is the
currency in which about one-third of the world’s trade is conducted.
^ Earlier During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
Development manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able
ot the Economy to support a rapidly increasing population at a rising standard of living.
During the period from 1870 to 1890 British industrial expansion had a
clear lead over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914 growing
industrial competition from Europe and North America began to make
itself felt, but its effects on Britain’s staple export industries, particularly
cotton textiles and coal, were offset by the general rise in world trade, by
the continued demand for British textiles from India and other eastern
countries, and by the continued high level of overseas investment.
During the 1920s and 1930s, Britain’s older industries met increasing
competition, for example, coal and iron and steel from other European
countries and textiles from some eastern countries where labour was cheaper.
At the same time Britain failed at first to gain a compensating share of world
trade in the newer types of engineering products. Some countries sought
deliberately to protect nascent and even established industries by tariffs and
(later) quotas and exchange restrictions. The result was heavy unemployment
in Britain’s older industries, the rate of which averaged 14 per cent in the
years 1921-39, reaching a peak of 22 per cent in 1932, when the slump in

world trade was at its worst. In some districts relying mainly on the most
heavily affected industries, the rate was much higher. Income from invisible
earnings (for example, on overseas investments, shipping and insurance)
and relatively cheap imports, particularly food, however, cushioned the
effects of the fall in the volume in exports.
After 1932 levels of production and employment improved, stimulated by
an increase in home investment which was aided by the policy of cheap money,
by some revival in world trade and, after 1935, by the armament programme.
The decade saw a strong expansion in the vehicles, electrical, chemicals and
aircraft industries, while the construction of 3 million houses brought about
a large growth in the building and ancillary industries. By 1937 average real
income per head was about 14 per cent higher than in 1929.
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic
capital by about £3,000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and
arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements. Some £1,000 million
worth of overseas investments were sold, nearly half in North America, and
new external debts of £3,000 million were accumulated. By 1944 exports had
fallen to less than one-third of their 1938 volume as a result of the war effort.
The Post-war Economic conditions in the immediate post-war period led to many of the
Period war-time restrictions remaining in force. Holdings of gold and foreign
exchange had been greatly depleted to pay for the essential war-time supplies
from overseas, and the export trade had to be rebuilt. Thus, rationing and
other war-time controls could only be relaxed gradually with the expansion
of production and the progress of recovery, this process being largely
completed by about mid-1954. The abolition of quantitative restrictions on
imports, other than from the dollar area, was largely completed by 1955.
Exchange controls on transactions between the sterling area and the rest of
the world were also progressively lifted, and in 1958 convertibility of sterling
on current account for all non-residents was introduced.
The period since 1945 has been one of rising living standards and of
high levels of industrial production and employment. This has been
accompanied, however, by persistent economic problems, especially inflation
and a tendency for the growth of imports to outstrip the expansion in exports
and foreign exchange earnings generally, particularly in periods of rapid
economic growth. This has meant that the average current surplus on visible
and invisible trade together has not been sufficient to finance Britain s over¬
seas expenditure and private investment and uphold its position as banker to
the overseas sterling area. Successive governments have sought to deal with
recurring balance of payments deficits mainly through deflationary policies in
the hope that the resulting margin of spare capacity would lead to an increase
in exports and a fall in imports. Domestic demand was curtailed mainly
through increases in taxation and restrictions on credit while a high bank
rate was needed to maintain overseas confidence in sterling. However, these
policies tended to result in undesirable fluctuations in economic activity and
made it impossible to realise the full growth potential of the economy.
Devaluation A further serious deterioration in the balance of payments in 1967 and loss
of Sterling of overseas confidence in sterling was brought about largely by a decline in
exports as a result of slackening economic activity in certain major overseas
markets, by the increased costs of imports, particularly oil, on account of the
Middle East hostilities in June 1967 and by a series of dock strikes in the
autumn. To meet the situation the Government decided to undertake a

devaluation of sterling from $2.80 to $2.40 = j^i. The primary aim is to secure
a substantial balance of payments surplus by improving the competitive
position of British exports and by giving industry an incentive to find home
substitutes for the relatively more expensive imports. A number of fiscal
and monetary measures were taken at the time of and following the devaluation
to restrain the growth of consumer demand and to reallocate resources in
favour of exports. A far-reaching review of public expenditure was also under¬
taken (see p. 234).
During 1969 the Government has continued its economic policies in
support of devaluation so as to put the balance of payments on a secure and
healthy basis, but the needed shifts in the use of resources have proved
somewhat slower to achieve than expected.
THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ECONOMY
The following sections sketch briefly the salient features of Britain’s national
economy in recent years. The source of Tables 11 to 14 is Preliminary
Estimates of National Income and Balance of Payments 1963 to 1968 (Cmnd.
3983), and Economic Trends, April 1969.
In 1968 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the
value of total goods and services produced at home and net income from
abroad) is estimated to have totalled £36,358 million. In real terms, that is,
after allowing for price changes, the increase over the ten-year period to
1968 has amounted to just under one-third.
The working population had been rising slowly up to 1966, but has since
fallen slightly. Over the ten years to the middle of 1968, there was an increase
of nearly 1 million (or some 4^ per cent) to about 25 J million, of whom two-
thirds are males. The expansion of the national income over the same period
has, therefore, been mainly the result of higher productivity. Unemployment
has remained very low, on average less than 2 per cent of the employee
population being out of work, but has been somewhat higher since 1966.
It has tended to remain above the national average in Northern Ireland,
Scotland, Wales and the north and certain other parts of England (where
special measures are encouraging additional employment), but in London,
the south-east and the Midlands, where the number of unfilled vacancies
is large in relation to the registered unemployed, there has been strong com¬
petition among employers for labour. While some industries, notably coal¬
mining, the railways, cotton textiles and agriculture, have undergone a
marked reduction in their labour force—of the order of 500,000 in the last
five years to June 1968—the needs of the expanding sectors of the economy
have not always been fully met.

consumption, that is, public expenditure on goods and services, investment
and exports, and the diagram above shows changes in national expenditure
between 1958 and 1968 (at 1963 prices).
Manufacturing industry contributes about one-third of the total output
of goods and services, and together with mining and quarrying, construction
and public utilities (gas, electricity and water) makes up just under half of
the total; agriculture, forestry and fisheries account for just over 3 per cent;
and transport and communications, together with the distributive trades, for
20 per cent. The remainder, just over one-quarter of total output, includes
public administration, education, health and finance and other services. Over
the past ten years there has been a marked decline in the proportion con¬
tributed by agriculture (though agricultural output is still rising).
It will be seen from the diagram above that the share attributable to fixed
capital formation rose appreciably between 1958 and 1968, in part reflecting
the rapid growth of public investment, while public authorities consumption
which declined between 1953 and 1959 as a result of reductions in defence
expenditure—has also risen over the five years to 1968 although much less
rapidly. Over the whole period 1958 to 1968 there has been an expansion of
the gross national product in real terms of 35 per cent. This rate of increase
has been exceeded in the case of capital formation (80 per cent) and exports
(46 per cent), while consumer expenditure (32 per cent) and public authorities’
current expenditure (28 per cent) have grown more slowly.
Gross fixed investment has risen markedly during and since the 1950s. In
1951 fixed investment in the United Kingdom was about 15 per cent of the
gross national product; it has been maintained at a high level in recent years,
reaching over 20 per cent in 1968. Fixed investment in manufacturing, which
accounts for 20 per cent of all fixed investment, in 1968 amounted to £1,526
million at current prices; compared with 1967 it showed a rise of 4 per cent,
although it was practically constant in real terms. Investment has, however,
been especially high in the public sector on account of the investment pro¬
grammes of the transport, communications, electricity transmission and
generation, and gas industries, although in 1968 investment in gas, electricity
and water fell by 18 per cent at constant prices. Investment in housing has
also expanded substantially; in 1968 it was well over two-thirds higher at
current prices than in 1963. In some years, such as 1951, i960 and 1964,

the level of economic activity has been influenced by a high level of investment
in stocks and in work in progress.
Investment by the public sector was about 40 per cent of total fixed
investment in each of the last ten years and has risen rapidly in the past three
years to about one-half in 1968. The public corporations accounted for
between 45 and 50 per cent of public sector investment over most of this
period, but in 1968 for only some 43 per cent, while the share of the central
Government has declined from about 15 to about 10 per cent. The share
of the local authorities has risen from about 38 per cent in the early part
of the period to an average of over 40 per cent over the past five years (45
per cent in 1968). Public investment in 1968 amounted to ,£3,819 million, an
increase of £180 million over 1967. Table 12 shows the division of gross fixed
investment in 1958 and 1968 by industry and the diagram above shows the

Authorities
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
An assessment of the value of the stock of fixed capital in the United
Kingdom at the end of 1967, made by the Central Statistical Office, gives a
total of £113,000 million at 1958 replacement cost. This is about 36 per cent
higher than in 1958, on the same basis of calculation. About 30 per cent of
the total was attributable to dwellings and 22 per cent to assets in manufac¬
turing (excluding textiles) and construction.
The growth of investment has been accompanied by a substantial growth
in savings by the economy as a whole, amounting to £7,556 million in 1968
(after allowing for stock appreciation) compared with £3,947 million in 1958.
Personal saving after showing a marked increase up to 1966, declined in
the two following years, amounting in 1968 to £1,882 million, about £200
million below the 1966 level. As a proportion of personal disposable income
it stood at 6-9 per cent in 1968. Personal saving takes a variety of forms.
There has been increased investment by the personal sector in new dwellings
and fixed assets, largely through building societies, although life assurance
premiums and contributions to superannuation funds are the largest forms of
personal saving; they have grown almost without interruption for many years.
National savings have failed to maintain the strong rate of growth in evidence
up to 1964; they rose by only £80 million in 1968 to a total of £8,543 million.
The largest contribution to savings comes from companies. Up to 1959,
these provided about half the total, but the proportion has since fallen,
amounting to about a third in 1968. Public corporations, as part of the policy
of financing a larger share of their investment needs from their own resources,
have raised their savings total considerably in recent years and the 1968
level accounted for about a tenth of total savings.

Current expenditure, that is, excluding public investment and other capital
expenditure but including interest paid on debt, by the central Government
(including the national insurance funds) and the local authorities rose by
58 per cent at current prices over the period 1963 to 1968 and in the latter
year amounted to about 45 per cent of the gross national product. The main
causes of this increase have been the continuing growth of the social services,
especially education. Defence expenditure, which has been growing rather
more slowly in recent years, accounted for 14! per cent of the total current
expenditure of the public authorities in 1968 (compared with a peak of 27 per
cent in 1953). It is now only slightly larger than expenditure on national
insurance benefits.
Several appreciable increases in taxation rates, imposed partly to reduce
the volume of demand on resources, have raised sharply the inflow of revenue.

Thus the yield from taxes on income in 1968 went up by £563 million,
or 11 per cent; and taxes on expenditure brought in an additional ^859
million following an increase of ^298 million in 1967. Revenue from the
taxes on income in 1968 accounted for 40 per cent of central Government
receipts, and taxes on expenditure for 38 per cent. National insurance,
national health and other contributions accounted for 15 per cent and the
remainder was from rent, dividends and interest and trading income.
Revenue from rates imposed by local authorities rose by 54 per cent from
1963 to 1968. Rates accounted in 1968 for 36 per cent and grants from the
central Government for 43 per cent of current receipts of local authorities.

Income from employment in 1968 totalled £25,046 million and accounted for
70 per cent of total personal income (against 60 per cent in 1938). The diagram
on p. 232 shows the composition of personal income and expenditure in 1968.
Of a total of 27-7 million incomes in 1966, there were only about 58,000
incomes of more than £5,000 a year after tax. About a quarter (6-6 million) of
incomes after tax were in the £250-£499 range and 5-6 million were in the
next range of £500~£749- The number of incomes after tax of £1,000 a year
and above rose from i-i million in 1955 to 8-2 million in 1966. Over 75 per
cent of the yield from income tax and surtax came from persons with annual
incomes in this latter category, although the total incomes before tax of this
group accounted for just over a half of total income.
The ownership of property and personal assets tends to be more concen¬
trated than income after tax. Estimates made by the Board of Inland Revenue
indicate that in 1967 some 13 J million individuals (a quarter of the total
population) had a net personal wealth of up to £5,000, which accounted
for some 30 per cent of total net wealth in Britain amounting to £83,600
million. Just over 50,000 individuals had a net personal wealth of over
£100,000.

PERSONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE, 1968
(In £ million at current prices)
While consumer expenditure rose by 76 per cent at current prices between
1958 and 1968 to reach a total of £27,045 million, in real terms (that is, after
discounting the effect of price changes) the increase was only about 32 per
cent. The proportion devoted to food has been falling slightly each year
and now accounts for 21 per cent of consumer expenditure at current prices
(1958, 26 per cent); outlay on tobacco and alcoholic drinks is about 12 per cent.
In real terms expenditure on tobacco fell slightly between 1963 and 1968, but
substantial increases in taxes over the same period caused total outlay to rise by
23 per cent at current prices. At current prices housing absorbs 12 per cent of
total expenditure, and fuel and light about 5 per cent. Spending on motor
cars and motor cycles rose in 1968 by i2| per cent. There has also been a
substantial growth in spending on household electrical equipment (except
in 1966), fuel and light, and clothing. Outlays on running costs of vehicles
rose from £344 million in 1958 to £1,348 million in 1968. In general the
pattern of consumer spending reflects the social changes and other develop¬
ments outlined in Chapter 1. The diagram below shows the change in con¬

Measures to
Strengthen the
Balance of
Payments
ECONOMIC POLICY AND PLANNING
The Government’s economic policy is to secure steady economic growth
with a high level of employment based upon a favourable balance of payments
and thereby to ensure a continuing improvement in output and living
standards. In order to achieve the substantial balance of payments surplus,
which it is hoped the devaluation of sterling of November 1967 will help to
bring about, a switch in resources has to be made from home consumption
to exports, import saving and investment. The Government has taken action,
therefore, to restrain home demand in the public and private sectors by
means of tax increases and a reduction in the rate of growth of public ex¬
penditure. Along with this, an effective prices and incomes policy is seen to be
essential in preventing the erosion by rising industrial costs of the competitive
advantage gained by devaluation. At the same time by encouraging structural
changes in industry, by the more efficient use of manpower, by improved
industrial relations, and by its regional development policies the Govern¬
ment is seeking to make more efficient use of the nation’s resources.
The intentions of the British Government for the domestic economy were
set out in the Letter of Intent sent to the IMF in June 1969 when a new
stand-by facility was requested (see p. 395). It observes that in the financial
year ending March 197° the objective is to obtain a balance of payments
surplus of at least ^300 million on the current and long-term capital account.
In the same period it also aims to restrict domestic credit expansion (the
borrowing of the public and private sectors, including net repurchases of
public sector debt from the private sector, excluding the banks) to not more
than £400 million compared with some £1,225 million in 1968-69. Objec¬
tives for public expenditure and prices and incomes policy are as described
below.
To further strengthen the balance of payments, the Government is encourag¬
ing industry through the Economic Development Committees and other means
to bring about savings in imports, which in the past decade have increased
in volume by over 4 per cent per annum. Likewise, services for exporters (see
PP- 39°~2) have been expanded to assist exports which have been rising at
some 3 per cent per annum in volume over the same period, although at a
greater rate since 1965- Measures are being taken where possible to increase
earnings from invisible exports (services).
All aspects of the Government’s overseas expenditure are included in its
annual survey of public expenditure (see below). The most important
items are overseas military expenditure which rose from £181 million to
£292 million between 1958 and 1968 and economic grant assistance to
less-developed dependent territories which rose from £51 million to £88
million; in addition, there are government loans to overseas countries and
multilateral assistance in the form of contributions to international agencies.
Britain also has to make repayments of capital and pay interest in respect
of post-war loans from the United States and Canada, totalling about £85
million a year.
There are exchange control restrictions on the movement of capital from the
United Kingdom to non-sterling countries and a voluntary programme to
restrict investment in certain developed countries in the sterling area is also
in operation (see p. 396). Britain’s private direct overseas investment over

the past few years, a large part of which is to the less-developed countries,
has averaged over £300 million a year. Although this is partly offset by private
investment from overseas, mainly from the United States, in most years the
net flow has been outward.
Surveys of public expenditure (see p. 360) have been made annually since 1961
and forward planning has been undertaken with the object of relating public
expenditure programmes and their demand on national resources to the
expected development of the economy. Following the devaluation of sterling in
November 1967 reductions in the rate of increase in public expenditure were
announced in January 1968. These reductions, which were confirmed in the
1969 review, involved the setting of a target for the increase of public expendi¬
ture (excluding the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries and
debt interest) of 1 per cent in 1969-70 and 2 per cent in 1970-71 at constant
prices, plus a further margin in the latter years of up to 1 per cent for con¬
tingencies. Table 15 shows the estimates of public expenditure in 1969-70
and 1970-71 compared with 1968-69, as announced in February 1969.

235
In line with attempts to restrain home demand by means of the policies
on government expenditure and taxation, restrictions are being maintained
on bank credits. Since the 1950s this has taken the form of official requests
to the London clearing banks and other financial institutions to restrain their
lending and the use of special deposits (see p. 370). Most recently in November
1968 the clearing banks were asked to reduce by mid-March 1969 the level
of their advances to the private and overseas sector, except for exports and
shipbuilding, to 98 per cent of the level prevailing at the time of devaluation.
The Government has taken other steps to reduce the volume of credit
available to private borrowers. From July 1969 personal loans, except for the
purchase or improvement of land or buildings and in certain other special cases,
subject to transitional arrangement, ceased to qualify for tax relief. Hire-
purchase regulations have been tightened (see p. 406), and in November 1968
a system of prior deposits on imports (see p. 387) was introduced with the
intent partly of reducing some of the excess liquidity in the banking system.
Government action to improve industrial efficiency and to increase produc¬
tivity has taken several forms. Among the most important is the work of the
Economic Development Committees in examining the obstacles to economic
growth in a wide range of industries and services; the Ministry of Technology
in fostering the introduction and development of advanced techniques; the
National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) in its detailed investigations
into the efficiency of public and private industry; and the Department of
Employment and Productivity in promoting through its Manpower and
Productivity Service the more efficient use of manpower and productive
resources. The Government also uses the purchasing power of the public
sector to assist industry in improving its efficiency and the Industrial Re¬
organisation Corporation promotes desirable amalgamations and reorgani¬
sations in industry. Taxation policy is being used to strengthen manufacturing
industry relative to services and other non-manufacturing activities by the
use of investment grants and a selective employment tax (see p. 365). This has
been accompanied by special financial assistance to industry in development
areas where resources are under-employed and by incentives to improve
labour mobility including legislation providing for redundancy payments and
improved re-training facilities. Efforts are being made to eliminate restrictive
practices in both sides of industry and legislation against monopolies and
mergers has been strengthened.
As in many other countries where full employment has prevailed over the past
decade and the demands on resources have been strong, Britain has had to deal
with continuing inflationary pressures. The almost uninterrupted upward
trend in prices has resulted principally from the tendency for money incomes
to rise faster than the volume of production, thus raising costs throughout the
economy.
Since 1958 the average annual rate of increase in domestic incomes has
been about 6 per cent, while the increase in the gross domestic product per
head of the labour force has been only between 2 and 2| per cent. Retail prices
rose on average by 3 per cent a year between mid-January 1958 and mid-
January 1969; while over roughly the same period average weekly earnings
of manual workers went up by about 5! per cent a year. Company profits
are subject to large cyclical swings, but in general they have increased more
slowly than employment incomes.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government recognises that a generally stable price level combined with
sustained economic growth can be achieved only within the framework of an
incomes policy designed to keep the rise in money incomes broadly in line
with the long-term rate of growth in national production.
The present Government’s productivity, prices and incomes policy has
been developed since 1964 in consultation with representatives of management
and workers beginning with the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity,
Prices and Incomes signed in December 1964, which formulated the lines
of action to be taken by the Government and by management and unions.
In April 1965 the National Board for Prices and Incomes was set up to
investigate prices and incomes questions referred to it by the Government.
It sits in private using evidence provided both by the parties involved and
by independent enquiries. It is required to produce its report within three
months but extensions of time may be granted by the Government. Up
to end-August 1969 the NBPI had published over 120 reports on references
made to it. It also publishes an annual report on its work during the year.
It is obliged by law to have regard to considerations contained in successive
White Papers on prices and incomes policy, the most recent of which was
published in 1968 (Cmnd. 3590).
In the autumn of 1965, the Confederation of British Industry and the Trade
Union Congress agreed to co-operate with the Government to establish
a voluntary ‘early warning’ system for prices and incomes, the purpose
of which was to give the Government adequate opportunity of considering
proposals to increase wages or prices and whether to refer them to the NBPI.
This system remains in operation on a voluntary basis. Under the system
significant proposals for price increases are notified to the appropriate govern¬
ment department, while significant pay claims and proposed settlements in
the private sector are notified to the Department of Employment and Produc¬
tivity or the TUC. A decision whether to refer a case to the NBPI is required to
be taken within 28 days.
Although conceived as essentially long-term, the policy has had to operate
in difficult economic circumstances and has been modified from time to time.
The consistent objective of prices policy has been to maintain stable and,
wherever possible, bring about lower prices and criteria have been given
for both increases and reductions.
Incomes policy, however, has undergone several changes. The policy intro¬
duced in April 1965 with the agreement of management and unions (set out
in the White Paper Prices and Incomes Policy, Cmnd. 2639) included a 3-3^
per cent norm—which was related to the average annual increase in money
incomes per head consistent with stability in the general level of prices.
Above average increases could be justified under four criteria: in cases of
manpower shortage; where pay was seriously out of line with that for similar
work elsewhere; where pay was too low to maintain a reasonable standard of
living; and where there was a direct contribution to increased productivity.
But pressure of demand was high at the time and there was an acute
shortage of labour. The 3! per cent norm was considerably exceeded, and in
July 1966, among measures designed to meet the balance of payments
problems, the Government imposed a six-month standstill on pay and price
increases in the second half of 1966, followed by a further six months of
severe restraint, when new pay settlements were allowed only in exceptional
cases. From mid-1967 there was no automatic entitlement to a pay increase,

and increases were permitted only when they satisfied the criteria mentioned
above.
After the devaluation of sterling in November 1967, pay increases became
subject to a ceiling of 3^ per cent a year, although increases paid as part of a
productivity bargain were exempted where the increase in productivity was
sufficient to justify a larger increase.
The Government acquired statutory powers in the Prices and Incomes Act
1966 although these powers were not often used. Under Part 2 of the Act a
standstill could be imposed on a proposed pay or price increase for a period
of up to three months while it is being considered by the NBPI. Further
powers under the Prices and Incomes Acts 1967 and 1968 enabled the
Government to extend the standstill for a further three months and eight
months, respectively, after a report of the NBPI if that report was adverse.
The 1968 Act also included reserve powers to enforce dividend restraint, to
moderate and phase increases in house rents, and to require price reductions
in cases where these were recommended by the NBPI. The powers under the
1967 and 1968 Acts expire at the end of 1969. The Government intend,
however, that Part 2 of the 1966 Act should continue in force in 1970.
A framework for longer-term economic planning and consultation between
government and both sides of industry has been worked out in recent
years. The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) is responsible for pre¬
paring assessments of the possible development of resources in future years
and for planning the balanced development of the regions. Its work forms the
basis for consultation with industry about major issues of economic policy and
in the implementation of decisions. The DEA works with representatives of
management and unions directly and through the National Economic
Development Council (NEDC), the Economic Development Committees
(EDCs) and with the regional planning bodies dealing with the special
problems of Scotland, Wales and the English regions.
The NEDC, which was set up in 1962, brings together representatives of
government, management and the trade unions, and provides a forum for the
discussion of future policy and planning of the economy. It meets regularly
under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. Other members are the
ministers of the main economic departments, representatives of management
and trade unions and the nationalised industries, independent members, the
chairman of the NBPI and the Director General of the National Economic
Development Office (NEDO). The NEDC is supported by the NEDO,
which provides the secretariat for the NEDC and the EDCs. It is independent
of the Government, but publicly financed. The NEDO publishes a series of
booklets based on work by the EDCs aimed at improving particular aspects
of efficiency in specific industries and annually provides a general review of
productivity, prices and incomes.
The NEDC has set up 21 Economic Development Committees. With one
exception—the EDC for the Movement of Exports—each committee is
concerned with an individual industry and under an independent chairman
is composed of members from management, the trade unions, NEDO, the
DEA, the government department responsible for that industry, and up to
three independent members. The EDCs study and promote the application
of measures to improve efficiency and competitive power in each industry.

They also assist in planning by advising on the implications for their industries
of proposals contained in national planning documents.
The DEA published in February 1969 a planning document, The Task
Ahead: Economic Assessment to 1972, which has been the subject of discussion
in the NEDC. It contains the Government’s view of the likely development of
the economy over the four years to 1972. It is intended to provide a basis for
the continuing process of consultation between the Government and both
sides of industry about major issues of economic policy. The planning
document, unlike the National Plan which was published in 1965, is not a
fixed plan with a single target; instead a ‘wedge’ approach has been adopted
showing a widening range of possible outturns up to 1972 from the current
trends in the economy. Within the limits of the country’s resources and taking
full account of the Government’s economic strategy and the requirements of
the balance of payments, it discusses a range of possible growth rates from an
average of a little below 3 per cent a year to an average of around 4 per cent a
year and takes a basic case of 3^ per cent for detailed discussion. It is hoped
that action based on the results of further studies and consultation with
industry will enable a higher rate of growth to be achieved.
The aim of regional economic planning is to secure a full and balanced
development of the country’s resources and to help achieve a faster and
steadier expansion in national output.
A system of regional economic planning councils and boards established in
Great Britain in 1965 provides the basic machinery for regional economic
planning. The regional economic planning councils consist of about 25 to 30
part-time members appointed for their wide knowledge and experience of
their regions. The councils are advisory bodies with no executive powers;
their main tasks are to study and advise on the needs and potentialities of their j
regions, and to advise the central Government on aspects of national policy |
which have a bearing on regional development. The regional economic :
planning boards consist of senior civil servants representing the main govern- I
ment departments concerned with aspects of regional planning in their
respective areas. Their functions are to co-ordinate the regional economic
planning work of the government departments and to co-operate with the
economic planning councils in developing long-term strategies for the regions.
For purposes of regional planning England has been divided into eight
regions—Northern, Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands, East Anglia,
South-east, South-west, West Midlands, and North-west; Scotland has ^
its own economic planning council and board, and there is a Welsh Council
(supported by an economic planning board) concerned with both economic |
and social affairs in Wales.
All the regional economic planning councils in England have published
major reports on their regions; a development plan for Scotland up to 197°
was published by the Government in 1966 and one for Wales in 1967-
The present stage is one of formulating medium- and longer-term strategies,
with sub-regional studies of areas with particular problems. The strategies take
into account all the factors including the distribution of population, industry
and employment within the region.
The Northern Ireland Government has set up an economic council, comprising
representatives of both sides of industry and other interests, to examine
means of furthering Northern Ireland’s economic development. As Northern
Ireland government departments have responsibilities for planning in
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
239
Summary
Northern Ireland, it was not necessary to set up a special planning board.
An economic report on Northern Ireland was published in 1965 containing
targets up to 1970.
Viewed as a whole the British economy has made considerable progress over
the past decade. Its rate of growth, if not so fast as that of some other industrial
countries, has been higher than in any earlier period over the past 50 years.
At the same time relatively full employment has been maintained and con¬
sumption and living standards have improved steadily. Moreover, moderni¬
sation of productive industry and the distributive system have progressed
despite persistent balance of payments difficulties, accentuated by the role
sterling plays as a world reserve and trading currency, and a high level of
overseas commitments in the form of development aid and defence.
11 INDUSTRY
The Structure
of Industry
Manufacturing
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom v/as the first country in the world to become highly
industrialised, and today fourteen people work in mining, manufacturing and
building for every one engaged in agriculture. It is the world’s third largest
exporter of manufactured goods, and the range of its industrial manufactures
reflects its position as one of the most important workshops of the world.
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms, and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary from
the many small workshops to vast organisations such as the National Coal
Board, a public corporation with about 360,000 employees; Imperial Chemical
Industries Ltd., a limited liability company which, with its subsidiaries,
employs 140,000 persons in the United Kingdom; and the Co-operative
Wholesale Society Ltd., with about 50,000 employees.
Most manufacturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Exceptions include
fissile materials and radioactive isotopes made by the Atomic Energy
Authority, locomotives and rolling-stock built in the workshops of British
Railways, and military equipment and supplies made in establishments of the
defence services. Staff of the Stationery Office do some printing and book¬
binding. Certain factories giving employment to the severely disabled are
operated by Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company financed on
the Vote of the Department of Employment and Productivity, which appoints
the directors (see p. 414). The Government holds about 49 per cent of the
equity of a major oil company, British Petroleum Limited, and has a
controlling interest in a few other companies.
Surveys of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more
than ten persons are made periodically by the Department of Employment and
Productivity; the results of the most recent show that in 1961 nearly a third of
all employees in such establishments are in those employing from 100 to 499
persons, while slightly over a third are in those employing 1,000 or more. A
high proportion of the biggest establishments are in the heavy industries; the
average size of establishments in industries making consumer goods is smaller
than in manufacturing industries as a whole. Comparisons with results
obtained in earlier years suggest a slow but significant trend towards increased
average size of establishments.
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of manu¬
facturing enterprises, as a single enterprise may own several establishments,
not all of them necessarily engaged in the same or similar activities. The most
recent analysis of manufacturing enterprises by size (employment) relates to
the Report on the Census of Production for 1958. An enterprise, as defined in
the Census, normally consists of either a single firm or a holding company
together with its subsidiaries. Just over half of all employment in British
manufacturing industries in 1958 was accounted for by about 950 large
private enterprises employing 1,000 or more people, the largest 70 or so
accounting roughly for a quarter. A further indication of company size is the

value of capital employed (net assets). For a few of the very largest including
the Imperial Chemical Industries group, the figure exceeds £1,350 million;
about 50 companies registered in Britain have over £100 million net assets.
In some industries a small number of big companies and their subsidiaries
are responsible for most of the total production. Examples are oil refining,
non-ferrous metal smelting, the manufacture of motor vehicles and com¬
ponents, aircraft and aero-engines, heavy electrical equipment, bicycles,
tobacco, cement, and basic chemicals. Shares in these companies are usually
distributed among a great number of holders and it is rare for a few large
holders to have a controlling interest. For example, five of the largest public
companies each have more than 100,000 shareholders. With intensified
competition in the economy and in many branches of industry the growing
dependence of profitable operation on concentration and an increasing scale
of production, the trend towards mergers and regroupings has gathered
momentum throughout the 1960s. Larger units of control have been established
in almost all the leading industries, for example, motor vehicles, aircraft
frames and aero-engines, electrical engineering, machine tools, brewing,
textiles, and newspaper and magazine publishing.
A new departure was the setting up of the Industrial Reorganisation
Corporation by the Government in 1966 with resources of up to £150 million.
Its function is to participate in schemes for concentration, rationalisation and
modernisation of industry, in particular the merging and regrouping of firms
into larger units to meet the changing situation in the markets for many of the
most important products, and it has been instrumental in furthering large
mergers in motor vehicle manufacturing, the heavy electrical, computer and
a wide range of other industries. The Industrial Expansion Act 1968 extends
the Government’s powers to give financial support to industrial projects
calculated to improve efficiency; to create, expand or sustain production
capacity; to promote or support technological improvements.
An account of some of the principal manufacturing industries is given on
pp. 255-80.
In building and civil engineering, large-scale work is usually carried out by
private contractors, although the Ministry of Public Building and Works is
the largest single employer of building labour while some 45 per cent of the
industry’s output is for public authorities. Building firms may be divided into
those undertaking general building and civil engineering work and those
concerned with highly specialised work, many of which operate outside as
well as inside the building industry. Building is an industry of small firms;
more than three-quarters of the firms employ fewer than 20 employees. For
a fuller account of the building and civil engineering industries, see p. 297.
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining.
The coalmining industry of Great Britain (see p. 282) is operated as a single
co-ordinated enterprise under National Coal Board direction (see p. 282).
Nearly all other mining and quarrying (sand, gravel, chalk, limestone, salt,
tin, slate, oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private enterprises, usually
owned and operated by limited liability companies; about 62,500 workers
are employed, excluding coalmining.
Legislation exists for scrutinising and, if desirable, for the investigation by an
independent administrative body of monopoly situations and for the judicial
examination of restrictive trading agreements.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 and 1968 govern the registration
and judicial examination of restrictive agreements. They require the entry in
242
Role of Public
Enterprise
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a public register of the particulars of a wide range of restrictive agreements
(including those relating to common prices, approved lists of dealers and the
limitation of production) which affect the supply or processing of goods for
the United Kingdom market. Proposed agreements of national importance
which promote efficiency or provide for new productive capacity, can be
exempted from this requirement for a specified period by the Board of Trade.
The Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agreements is responsible for keeping
the register and for bringing the agreements before the Restrictive Practices
Court set up under the 1956 Act. The Court, which includes laymen but is
presided over by one of Her Majesty’s judges, is, in effect, responsible for
deciding whether or not an agreement is in the public interest. If the parties
to an agreement fail to satisfy the Court that any restriction in their agreement
produces one or more of seven beneficial effects set out in the Act, and that
the restriction is not unreasonable, having regard to the balance between the
benefit it confers and any public detriment likely to result from its operation,
that restriction must be found contrary to the public interest. Agreements are
void in respect of restrictions so found. The Court can make orders preventing
the parties from operating their agreement, or from making new arrangements
having the same effect. Agreements relating exclusively to exports are not
subject to this procedure but have to be notified to the Board of Trade.
Under the 1956 Act collective enforcement of resale price maintenance was
prohibited, but individual suppliers remained free to enforce resale prices in
the courts. The Resale Prices Act 1964 made minimum resale price mainten¬
ance unlawful, except in respect of classes of registered goods for which
temporary exemption has been sought under the provisions of the Act.
Where resale price maintenance is prohibited, it is also unlawful to notify to
dealers prices stated or calculated to be understood as the minimum price
which may be charged on the resale of goods in the United Kingdom, or to
seek to maintain such prices by withholding supplies. Suppliers may continue
to practise resale price maintenance on registered goods, pending a decision
by the Restrictive Practices Court as to whether a case for exemption has
been made out against the criteria in the Act. Periodically, the Registrar of
Restrictive Trading Agreements issues lists of classes of goods in respect of
which the Court has refused to make an Order exempting them from the
terms of the Act. Only one class of goods (books and maps) has so far gained
exemption under an order from the court; nearly 500 classes have been
refused exemption.
Monopolies and kindred arrangements (other than those within the scope
of the Restrictive Practices Court) may, in circumstances indicated in the
Monopolies and Mergers Acts 1948 and 1965, be referred by the Board of
Trade to the Monopolies Commission for investigation and report. The
Board of Trade, in co-operation with the production departments (see p. 249)
concerned, take appropriate action on reports but no Order can be made
without parliamentary approval. The 1965 Act strengthened and extended
the legislation on monopolies. It reorganised and enlarged the Monopolies
Commission; provided for the investigation, at the reference of the Board of
Trade, of services and of proposed or recently completed mergers; made
special provision for newspaper mergers; and improved and extended the
Government’s powers for taking action on the basis of the Monopolies
Commission reports including new powers to prohibit mergers and break up
undesirable monopolies and mergers.
Direct State participation in productive and commercial activities is effected
mainly through special statutory bodies set up to deal with a particular
INDUSTRY
243
activity. Such bodies, though not part of a government department, are under
a considerable but varying degree of public control (see below). The most
important of these statutory bodies are the public corporations which operate
major industries and services in the public interest. Altogether 10 per cent
of the labour force works for these bodies. Their managing boards and staffs
are chosen for their experience and competence in a particular field; they are
not civil servants, and, although accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring
departments who are responsible for the management of the corporations.
Certain of the corporations are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer
grants to help them carry out duties with which they have been charged.
The following corporations are now operating or controlling large-scale
industries or services: United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 200);
British Overseas Airways Corporation, British European Airways, British
Airports Authority (see pp. 348-50); Bank of England see (p. 369); British
Broadcasting Corporation, Independent Television Authority (see p.433);
National Coal Board (see p. 282); Electricity Council, Central Electricity
Generating Board, Area Electricity Boards, North of Scotland Hydro-
Electric Board, South of Scotland Electricity Board, Northern Ireland Joint
Electricity Authority, Electricity Board for Northern Ireland (see p. 287);
Gas Council, Area Gas Boards (see p. 292); British Steel Corporation (see p.
257); British Railways Board, British Transport Docks Board, British Water¬
ways Board, National Freight Corporation, National Bus Company and
Scottish Transport Group (see p. 334), London Transport Board, Transport
Holding Company (see p. 334), Northern Ireland Transport Holding
Company (see p. 346), and Post Office Corporation (see p. 353).
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working
of the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members of
each board, and, secondly, he has power to give general directions as to
how the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day manage¬
ment. It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister
any information, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In
practice, as the responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy
decisions are reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion
for him to issue a formal directive.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual
statutory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so
that receipts at least balance outgoings taking one year with another. The
responsible minister is usually empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to
say what shall be done with any surplus revenues which may accrue. As
regards finance of capital expenditure, the present system is that such finance
as cannot be met from internal sources is mainly provided, in the form of
interest-earning loans, by the minister from the Exchequer, bank advances
being used only for normal requirements of short-term capital.
It is usual for the minister responsible for each nationalised industry to be
required by statute to take steps to see that the interests of the industry’s
customers are protected. This is generally done by the establishment of
representative consumers’ councils to consider complaints and suggestions
made to them, and to advise the board or the minister on the changes they
think desirable.
244
Industrial
Association
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Financial targets have been agreed by the Government with the different
industries (or are under discussion) ranging from 12-4 per cent gross return
on capital employed to ‘breaking even’ after interest and depreciation have
been allowed for. In addition the industries are expected to apply a test
discount rate for new investment of 8 per cent.
Government policy towards the nationalised industries is subject to the
approval of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are
afforded by debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts,
and by answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible
only if concerned with policy rather than details of administration. A House
of Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries, which
examines the reports and accounts of the nationalised industries and reports
to Parliament, has been in operation since 1957.
From the middle of the nineteenth century, private industrial undertakings
have increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different
purposes. Some of the more important of these are classified as: (1) the
provision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison with the
Government, and representation of their members’ point of view; (2) the
regulation of trading practices, sometimes including the regulation of prices
(see p. 242); (3) negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions of
work. Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover, with
varying completeness, most of British industry, but there are wide sectors of
industry where there are no collective agreements to regulate trading practices.
Employers’ organisations which deal with labour matters usually consist of
firms engaged in the same type of operation or manufacturing process. Trade
associations mainly concerned with representations to the Government,
provision of common services or the regulation of trading practices are built
up round a product or an allied group of products. In an industrial sector
concerned wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may
undertake all the required functions.
There are about 80 national federations and probably altogether about
1,500 employers’ organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or
branches of the national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages
and conditions of work. The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned
with providing common services is not known precisely, but according to a
survey carried out between 1953 and 1956 by Political and Economic Planning
(an independent research organisation) some 1,300 were in existence, varying
greatly in importance, structure and activities.
The central body representing British industry nationally is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI). It is recognised by the Government as a
channel for consultation between government departments and representatives
of private employers as a whole. For its members it acts as an advisory and
consultative body providing them with information and statistics, ascertaining
their collective views and representing them nationally to the Government
and the public and also internationally, for example in the Council of European
Industrial Federations. CBI representatives sit on a number of government
advisory committees, on other statutory bodies and on voluntary bodies
concerned with matters affecting industry.
The CBI membership consists of some 13,000 companies and over 200
trade associations and employers’ federations. Nationalised industries have
joined as industrial associates. The CBI has a regional organisation in the
United Kingdom and is widely represented abroad.
INDUSTRY
245
In matters of common concern the CBI often acts jointly with the chambers
of commerce. These are open to all kinds of producers and traders and exist
to promote the interests of local industry and commerce. The Association of
British Chambers of Commerce, founded in i860, is the central organisation
to which 95 local chambers of commerce (together with 18 British Chambers of
Commerce operating abroad) are affiliated. In Scotland there is an additional
central organisation, the Council of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, and in
Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry
to which local chambers are affiliated.
vocation The following is a summary of the geographical distribution of British industry
today, grouped by the areas covered by the regional economic planning
machinery (see p. 238).
Greater London and London, lying at the head of ocean navigation on the Thames estuary, is
he South-east Britain’s capital and main communication centre, probably still the world’s
legion most important financial centre, and one of the world’s three largest cities
(with Tokyo and New York) and three largest ports (with New York and
Rotterdam). It is the main centre in Britain of printing, cinema film produc¬
tion, and the manufacture of clothing, food and drink, furniture, materials for
the arts, precision instruments and many other specialised products. Small
firms predominate in many of these industries and the average size of manu¬
facturing firms (particularly in the central area) is well below the national
average. London is also, especially its outer ring, important for light engineer¬
ing, chemicals and consumer goods and has some heavy engineering plants
and a number of leading research establishments.
Towards the periphery of Greater London (population 7,880,760) and in
the new urban development outside it, industry, particularly the electronics
and a variety of consumer goods industries, has expanded greatly; some
of the largest aircraft plants are in these areas, for example at Weybridge
and Hatfield, as well as factories, at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable, of two
of the four main motor vehicle manufacturers. There are other major motor
vehicle manufacturing plants at Cowley, Oxford (109,000), some 50 miles
north-west of London. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries there
are large oil refineries as well as some smaller shipyards, engineering works
and major concentrations of the paper and pulp and cement industries.
A great part of the Channel coast eastwards from Poole (population 97,500)
and Bournemouth (150,000) consists of built-up areas, which from Brighton
(162,000) eastwards are partly dormitories for people working in London.
Holiday resorts fringe the coast. Portsmouth (219,000) is a naval port with
some shipbuilding and general manufactures. Southampton (210,000) is
Britain’s largest port for ocean-going liners; its industries include ship
repairing, oil refining, cable-making, electronics and synthetic rubber. Dover,
Folkestone and Newhaven are packet ports.
South-west England Devon and Cornwall have a considerable tourist trade. Bristol (429,000) is a
leading port and commercial centre with aircraft, aero-engines, tobacco, food
processing, paper, printing and other industries and important non-ferrous
metals and basic chemicals plants at Avonmouth. Gloucester (88,000), origin¬
ally an inland port and commercial town, Cheltenham (75,500), originally a
resort town, and the area between and adjacent to them produce a variety of
manufactures, including machinery, instruments and accessories, and cloth.
Swindon (98,000), besides railway workshops, has important engineering

works. Bath (86,000), originally a resort town and centre of an agricultural
district, has become noted for engineering and other manufacturing.
Besides being one of the most productive agricultural regions, the eastern
counties possess some sizeable towns. Cambridge (100,000) is a leading centre
of research-based industry; Ipswich (122,000) and Peterborough (66,000) are
noted for diesel engines and engineering generally; and Norwich (121,000)
for footwear and food manufacture. Food canning and freezing, based mainly
on locally grown produce, have developed rapidly. The fishing ports of
Great Yarmouth (52,000) and Lowestoft (49,000) have fish processing plants,
and are also becoming important bases for companies engaged in natural gas
exploitation in the North Sea.
The West Midlands conurbation, which stretches from Birmingham
(i, 102,000) to Wolverhampton (267,000) and includes parts of Staffordshire,
Worcestershire and Warwickshire, has an unusually wide variety of industry,
including the manufacture of metals, electrical and engineering products of all *
kinds and also jewellery, rubber products, chemicals and domestic metalware.
The largest concentrations of motor vehicle manufacture (including com¬
ponents and accessories) in Britain are in Birmingham and Coventry (334,000).
The smaller conurbation of North Staffordshire, centred on Stoke-on-Trent
(276,000), is devoted chiefly to the manufacture of pottery and china and to
coalmining, although other industries are growing in importance, while
Stafford (52,500) has heavy electrical and other engineering works.
Other industrial centres are Rugby (56,500), electrical engineering;
Worcester (70,000), machinery; Burton-on-Trent (50,000), brewing and
rubber; and Kidderminster (45,500), carpets.
The thriving industrial cities and towns of the East Midlands include Leicester
(283,000) noted for hosiery and knitwear, boots and shoes and machinery for
making these products; Derby (217,000) for general engineering, aero-engines
and man-made fibres; Nottingham (310,000) for hosiery, cycles and a variety
of other engineering products, lace, pharmaceutical products and tobacco;
Northampton (122,000) footwear and engineering; Chesterfield (70,000)
engineering. Corby (45>000), R new town in Northamptonshire, has a steel
industry. Part of Britain’s richest and most highly mechanised coalfield lies
under the north-east of the area. Some of the towns on the coalfield, such as
Mansfield (55,500), have important manufacturing industries, particularly
textiles.
Manchester (616,500) is the commercial hub of the cotton and man-made
fibre textile industries, a very important financial and commercial centre and
a major port. It is also one of the chief centres for electrical and heavy
engineering and the production of machine tools, petro-chemicals, dyestuffs,
and pharmaceutical goods, while it has a wide range of other manufactures.
In the traditional cotton-manufacturing towns man-made fibres are also
processed alone or blended with cotton; the largest of these are Bolton
(156,500), Oldham (110,000), Rochdale (87,000), Stockport (141,000), Burnley
(78,000), Blackburn (101,000), Preston (106,000) and Bury (64,500). In the
majority of these towns engineering industries, notably the manufacture of
printing, paper making, textile and electrical machinery and heavy commercial
vehicles (especially in the Chorley-Leyland area), have been expanding while
the cotton industry has been declining. The Lancashire coalfield also lies
in the Manchester-Wigan area.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of overseas
trade, links Manchester with Merseyside. It passes through Warrington
INDUSTRY
Yorkshire and

(74,000) with its metal industries (such as wire-drawing), Widnes (54,500) and
Runcorn (30,500) with their chemicals, and Ellesmere Port (53,000) with its
oil refinery installations, before reaching the Mersey estuary. St. Helens
(103,000), to the north of the canal, is famous for glass manufacture.
Liverpool (705,000) is the second port of Britain, a great commercial and
insurance centre and, after London, the greatest centre for processing imported
foodstuffs and raw materials, noted especially for flour milling, soap manu¬
facture, sugar refining and rubber products. Among its older industries is
ship repairing; shipbuilding is a major industry across the river at Birkenhead
(143,500). Many new industries, including electrical engineering, manufacture
of heavy industrial equipment and, more recently, of motor vehicles, have been
established around Liverpool. Salt, extracted in Cheshire, is used by chemical
works on Merseyside.
Barrow (64,500), in the north-west of Lancashire, is well-known for ship¬
building and marine engineering. Blackpool (151,500) on the coast is Britain’s
most popular holiday resort.
About three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s worsted and woollen indus¬
tries are found in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Bradford (297,000) is the
commercial centre of the wool trade and important for worsted; Wakefield
(60,000) produces both worsted and woollens; Morley (43,500) and Leeds
(508,000) have specialised in cheaper cloths, and Batley (41,000), Dewsbury
(53,0°o) and Spenborough (38,000) in heavy cloth, but their production is
becoming more diversified. Huddersfield (130,000) has a reputation for fine
woollens and worsteds and Halifax (95,000) for carpets. In most of the larger
centres of the wool industry a variety of engineering products are manu¬
factured. Leeds, the commercial capital of the area, has a large ready-made
clothing industry and important engineering plants. Farther south is the
heavy engineering centre of Sheffield (534,000), famous for its high quality
steels, cutlery and tools. The area’s extensive coalfields provide nearly a
quarter of Britain’s coal; Doncaster (86,000), also with tractor and nylon
manufacturing, and Barnsley (76,000) are the largest towns on the coalfield.
York (110,500) is noted for chocolates and confectionery manufacture and
has important railway workshops, and Hull (296,000), one of the world’s
largest fishing ports and with many manufacturing industries, including
engineering, vegetable oil processing, paints and sawmilling, is the most
important industrial town in the East Riding of Yorkshire.
On the south (Lincolnshire) side of the Humber lie Scunthorpe (71,000),
another important steel-making centre, and the major fishing port of Grimsby
(95>000) which has a food processing industry and also growing chemicals and
textiles industries close by at Immingham.
The greater part of this region (Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland,
Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire) is an area of mountains, lakes and
moors and is relatively thinly populated. Most of its population is concen¬
trated in the coastal strip from the coalfields north of the Tyne to the Tees.
Within this area the main centres are Tyneside, including Newcastle upon
Tyne (251,500), Gateshead (101,000), Tynemouth (72,500), South Shields
(108,000), Wallsend (48,000) and Jarrow (29,000); and Teesside (392,500) and
Hartlepool (98,000). Other large towns are Sunderland (219,000), Darlington
(85,000) and, in the west, Carlisle (71,000).
The whole region is more dependent than other parts of England on
traditional heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manufacture,
shipbuilding and repairing and chemicals (the complex of chemical plants on
1

both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in Europe), which
together employ nearly a third of the male workers. This proportion has been
falling steadily as the result of the region’s efforts, with government help, to
attract new types of enterprise. It is one of the most important areas for the
manufacture of electrical plant, and the many other industries include mining
machinery, rolling mill plant, earth-moving equipment, machine tools, ropes,
paint, glass, clothing and scientific instruments. An aluminium smelter is
under construction on the Northumberland coast. Atomic energy is important
in Cumberland, with two nuclear power stations and other installations.
Nearly two-thirds of the population of Wales and Monmouthshire live in the
two counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. In this area are the coal
mines which, though long worked and operating at increasing depths, still
produce nearly all Britain’s anthracite and much of its steam and other
specialised coals, and employ more workers than any branch of manufacturing
industry. Rhondda (98,000) and Merthyr Tydfil (57,000) are the largest
centres in the coalmining area. The steel industry, with some of the most
modern plants in Europe, supplies almost all Britain’s output of tin plate and
much of its sheet steel. In the past 35 years many new industries have been
established, often on government industrial estates; they include plastics,
synthetic fibres, clothing, electronics, motor vehicle components and light
engineering.
The main urban centres are also the three major ports Cardiff (289,000),
Newport (113,000) and Swansea (171,000). Milford Haven (13,000), a magni¬
ficent deep-water harbour recently developed, has two major oil refineries.
In North Wales a number of light industries, notably man-made fibres, are
located in the seaside resorts and some other towns, particularly Wrexham
(37,000), and there is a large steelworks in Flintshire.
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population (5-2 million) is concentrated in
the central Lowlands between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The
principal cities in this area are Glasgow (960,500) and Edinburgh (468,000).
Clydeside, which includes Glasgow, is Britain’s largest shipbuilding and
marine engineering centre; it also has a great variety of general engineering
enterprises and other industries. The steel industry, sited mainly in north
Lanarkshire, produces a wide range of products. The widely dispersed
electronics equipment industry is represented by a growing number of firms
in such centres as Glasgow, north Lanarkshire, Dundee and central Fife, as
well as in Edinburgh, where this and other modern industries are expanding
alongside the long-established engineering, printing and brewing industries.
Motor car manufacture has been established in Renfrewshire and in West
Lothian there has been a major expansion of commercial vehicle building.
Outside the central Lowland belt there is considerable industrial concen¬
tration in and around Dundee (182,000) and Aberdeen (182,000) and a number
of towns outside these areas have attracted light industries in recent years.
Dundee’s traditional manufacture, jute, has been supplemented by office
machinery, clocks and watches, refrigerators and electronic products. In
north-east Scotland is the largest concentration of whisky distilleries.
Most of northern Scotland is mountainous and much of southern Scotland
is hilly and rugged. These regions are sparsely populated, but the Scottish
Highlands possess significant resources of hydro-electric power (see p. 289).
There are high-quality tweed and knitwear industries both in the valley towns
of the southern uplands and in the Highlands and Islands. Small engineering
and electronics industries have recently been established in towns in the

southern uplands. Small-scale manufacturing has also been introduced in the
Highlands, and larger enterprises include the experimental atomic reactor
establishment at Dounreay and the aluminium smelter being built at
Invergordon.
Although the area of Northern Ireland is relatively small and it lacks minerals,
there is substantial and growing industrialisation, particularly in and around
Belfast, the capital city (397,500). Britain’s largest single shipyard is in
Belfast; other long-established activities include the manufacture of textile
machinery and other engineering products; ropes, twine, tobacco and clothing.
Northern Ireland has also long been an important centre for textiles—it is
particularly well known for linen. The textile industry is now extensively
diversified; Northern Ireland is one of the most important areas in Europe for
man-made fibre production and provides about one-fifth of Britain’s output.
There has also been extensive development in vehicle components, oil-well
equipment, electronic instruments, telephone switchgear, toys, shoes, carpets
and synthetic rubber.
The Government can influence industrial activity in a number of ways 
through fiscal and monetary policy, through the level of public expenditure,
through the placing of government contracts, through the policies of publicly
owned enterprises, by physical controls, by inducements, by exhortation and
by the provision of services, information and advice. Apart from labour
legislation (see Chapter 16) and certain export and import controls over a
small range of products (see Chapter 15), there are few physical controls over
industry the main ones are the use of the legislation concerning monopolies
and restrictive practices already described (see p. 241) and the operation of
powers to control new industrial and office building and changes in land use
(see p. 253).
There is a close association between industry and the Government through
such channels as the National Economic Development Council, the main
forum for consultation on economic affairs between the Government,
management and the trade unions, and Economic Development Committees
(EDCs), which cover particular sectors of industry and are under the aegis of
industry. Within the Government, the Department of Economic Affairs
(DEA) has general responsibility for the Government’s economic strategy in
the application of resources including the co-ordinating of industrial and
regional policies. Policies for productivity, prices and incomes and manpower
are the concern of the Department of Employment and Productivity. The
department through which the Government’s day-to-day relations with trade
and industry are chiefly conducted is the Board of Trade (which has regional
offices in certain principal industrial centres). Other departments concerned
with particular subjects of concern to industry generally are the Treasury,
which is responsible for fiscal and monetary policy; and the Department of
Education and Science, which is responsible for the promotion of education
and for civil science, operating in the main through the research councils.
The Ministry of Technology is responsible for the application of advanced
technology in industry generally; it has nine regional offices linking 70
industrial liaison centres and maintains a number of research establishments
offering a range of services to industry (see p. 204).
For particular industries a system has grown up whereby a particular
government department acts as the main point of contact, the ‘production’ or
‘sponsor department’, for each major industry. The Ministry of Technology
is the sponsor department for the mechanical and electrical engineering
2^0 BRITAIN I970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
industries and for those manufacturing electronic equipment, computers,
machine tools, telecommunications equipment, shipping, aircraft and aero¬
engines. The Board of Trade is the sponsor department for the chemicals,
non-ferrous metals and most of the consumer goods industries. Others
include the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Ministry of Public
Building and Works and the Department of Health and Social Security.
There are separate departments of the Northern Ireland Government for
matters within the competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament. The
Ministry of Commerce deals with industry, especially the encouragement of
industrial development.
Statistical The Central Statistical Office, which is attached to the Cabinet Office,
Services is the central body for government statistics. Although departments them¬
selves compile statistics relating to their responsibilities (for example, business
statistics at the Board of Trade’s Business Statistics Office), and may publish
them in their own standard publications, the comprehensive statistical
publications are prepared by the Central Statistical Office, which acts as
co-ordinator. (For the principal regular series of statistics published, see
Bibliography p. 479.)
Production and Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction,

Production 1 rends double the pre_war ievel. The course of production and employment from
1962 to 1968 is shown in Table 16.
Among manufacturing industries output rose fastest between 1958 and 1968
in the chemical and allied industries (82 per cent), in engineering and elec¬
trical goods (57 per cent), and in paper, printing and publishing (52 per cent);
in the gas, electricity and water group there was an advance of 64 per cent and
in construction of 49 per cent.
The size of the labour force has scarcely changed in the last five years and
the increases in production have been due mainly to a variety of factors
influencing productivity, including advances in products, machinery, pro¬
cesses and methods of work; the rate of fixed capital formation, more
intensive competition and sales promotion; and improved management.
Although gross fixed capital formation at home has, as a whole, been well
maintained since 1966, the proportion devoted to manufacturing has tended
to fall. Nevertheless, the total in 1968 amounted to 4-3 per cent of the gross
domestic product and was estimated to be 39 per cent greater than in 1959-
Part of this rising investment is linked with the introduction of new tech¬
niques and equipment and in particular of machines and instruments which

lessen the demand for human skill and supervision though they may require
more skill from fewer people. This process of automation is giving rise to far-
reaching changes in the pattern of industry and in the internal organisation
and labour requirements of business enterprises and has already been respon¬
sible for consequential increases in production and efficiency which, in the
long run, are likely to be very large. Much investment, however, still consists
of replacements, additions and improvements of a more traditional kind.
Both the long-term and the short-term growth of productivity thus depend
most directly on the decisions of individual undertakings. But though the
promotion of productivity is regarded as primarily a matter for industry,
government departments and educational and research establishments also
have an important contribution to make. Government budgeting and financial
policies also have a strong influence on the extent and direction of demand,
and government purchasing policies take account of national industrial
objectives. Leading industrialists act as advisers to the DEA to help overcome
specific obstacles to efficiency and industrial expansion.
Within industry employers’ organisations often provide technical assistance,
conduct market surveys, and support schemes of vocational education and
training, and many trade unions organise special training schemes and courses
to promote understanding of modern management techniques. Changes in
working methods to facilitate higher output feature in a number of produc¬
tivity agreements negotiated between management and workers. Private
consultants specialising in management and work study are available to advise
firms on measures to increase their productive efficiency, there are also many
specialist institutions, both public and private, concerned with various aspects
of productivity. The British Productivity Council (BPC) was established by
both sides of industry to stimulate interest in methods of raising productivity.
It is an independent body on which are represented the Confederation of
British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the Association of British
Chambers of Commerce, and the nationalised industries; its work is financed
by contributions from these bodies and by a government grant-in-aid. Most
of the BPC’s work is done through more than 130 local productivity com¬
mittees and associations throughout the country, but it is also responsible for
special countrywide campaigns. The local organisations arrange meetings,
inter-factory visits, courses, conferences, films shows and exhibitions.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making
body incorporated by Royal Charter. It prepares and promulgates standards
252 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in respect of, inter alia, quality, performance, dimensions, testing methods and
codes of practice. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manufacturers,
buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies the specification
of requirements. The BSI is governed by a council consisting of representa¬
tives of the main organisations of employers and workers, professional
institutions and the larger government departments.
The DEA is responsible for co-ordinating government policies in industrial
policy. EDCs (see p. 249) are particularly concerned with removing obstacles
to efficiency; the DEA is represented on the EDCs by its industrial advisers
seconded to the department from industry. The Board of Trade administers
the government grants to the BPC and the Council of Industrial Design. The
Ministry of Technology is charged with extending the introduction of auto¬
matic control systems and advanced techniques into industry, sponsors the
BSI, the British Calibration Service1 and the National Computing Centre,
supports the National Data Processing Service, and provides technical
advisory services. It is also concerned directly with research into such factors
as productivity measurement techniques, group technology, production
engineering and fatigue among operators. The Manpower and Productivity
Service of the Department of Employment and Productivity advises firms
on productivity, particularly aspects connected with manpower utilisation
and industrial relations. A number of other departments have responsibilities
which bear on productivity.
Management In Britain, as elsewhere, management is recognised as a subject requiring
special skills and knowledge. This is reflected both in a change in the general
educational qualifications of recruits and in the spread of systematic education
and training for management.
The British Institute of Management (BIM) is the central national manage¬
ment body, independent, non-political and non-profit-making. Its purpose is
to study and promote scientific management, including management education
and training, throughout industry, commerce, and public administration. The
BIM receives an annual government grant of about £100,000 to help it expand
services to industry. The Industrial Society works to promote better use of
human resources; it advises members and conducts conferences and courses.
Management studies and education for management are expanding rapidly
in Britain and have become a recognised feature of higher education (see
p. 161). There are graduate business schools in London and Manchester.
Training courses for higher management are held at several universities and
colleges, including the Administrative Staff College, Henley-on-Thames,
and Ashridge College of Management, Berkhamsted. The larger firms,
especially those with wide responsibilities, often provide general management
courses for senior executives, and systems of informal training within an
organisation are numerous. There are also bodies concerned with specialised
branches of management, for example, the Institute of Personnel Manage¬
ment, the Institution of Works Managers, the Institute of Office Management
and the Institute of Marketing.
The growing number of professional personnel working as management
consultants—now over 3,000—and the use of the services of independent
management selection firms in the appointment of senior staff are further
indications of interest in the science of management in Britain. A government

253
scheme for helping smaller firms (25 to 500 employees) to pay for the services
of consultants was operated in the Bristol and Glasgow areas for several
months in 1968-69. The Government is considering whether a similar scheme
should be extended nationally.
Encouragement
of Expansion
in Selected
Industries
Under the Industrial Development Act 1966 cash grants were introduced in
place of certain tax allowances for capital expenditure on plant or machinery
used in the manufacturing, extractive and construction industries. The grant
scheme, which is administered by the Board of Trade, also covers capital
expenditure on computers, ships, hovercraft and mining works. The standard
rate of grant is 20 per cent. In order to maintain a greater incentive to invest¬
ment in development areas (see below) the rate of grant is 40 per cent for
plant or machinery for use in development areas. Over 40 per cent of the total
amount paid is at the development areas rate. A separate system of grants
and loans to encourage hotel development has been operating since 1968.
Government
Help for
Industry in
Development
Areas
Some parts of Britain have long been less prosperous than others. Their rate of
economic expansion has been below average and their level of unemployment
above average as a result of the decline of some traditional industries or the
lack of job opportunities. For many years unemployment has remained a
persistent problem in Scotland, Wales and the north-east and some other
parts of England. This regional imbalance has been aggravated by the tendency
for new industries to concentrate in the Midlands and the south-east where, as
a result, the demand for labour is high and there are increasing problems of
congestion. An important aim of the Government’s regional policy is to
achieve a better distribution of industrial development between the different
parts of the country. The Government has in recent years taken important
measures aimed at securing balanced economic development.
Government aid to areas of high unemployment began in the 1930s and
has been developed in various ways since the end of the second world war.
Since August 1966 large parts of Britain have been designated as ‘development
areas’ where industrial development is to be encouraged. They cover northern
England, Merseyside and nearly the whole of Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and
north Devon and contain a fifth of Britain’s working population. The Board
of Trade provides businessmen with detailed information on industrial
location within the development areas and offers a wide variety of inducements
to new or expanding businesses in these areas, the first priority being given
to smaller ‘special development areas’.
Besides the capital investment grants there is a wide range of financial and
other inducements available under the Local Employment Acts 1960-66 to
encourage industry to expand in the development areas. The Board of Trade
may build factories for leasing at favourable rents or sale on deferred terms;
make building grants of 25 per cent (and 35 per cent in special cases) of the
cost of an industrialist’s own factory; make grants towards initial costs
incurred on starting a project in a development area (for example, removal of
plant machinery and stock); and make loans for the general purposes of an
undertaking (for example, working capital, plant and machinery, etc.).
Factory building and estate management are undertaken on the Board of
Trade’s behalf by the English, Scottish and Welsh Industrial Estates Corpor¬
ations ; premises administered by the three Corporations total over 60 million
square feet and give employment to over 250,000 people.
Assistance from other government departments includes 85 per cent capital
grants to local authorities for clearing derelict or neglected sites and for
254
Northern Ireland
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
improving basic services; and help from the DEP with the cost of training
additional labour in development areas and of transferring workers in
connection with establishing new enterprises.
Employers in the manufacturing industry in development areas are entitled
not only to refund of selective employment tax (see p. 365) but also to a
premium of 7s. 6d. a week for every full-time male adult employee. In addition
they receive regional employment premiums of 30s. a week. (Lower rates for
women, part-timers, boys and girls apply to both premiums.)
A committee set up in 1967 to investigate the needs of ‘Intermediate
Areas’—those areas with special economic problems but situated outside
the development areas—published its report in 1969. The Government has
announced that legislation is to be enacted to give certain such areas special
assistance, similar to that available under the Local Employment Acts,
including grants amounting to 25 per cent of factory building costs, additional
provisions for industrial training and help in a clearance programme of
derelict land.
Since 1948 control of new industrial building has been exercised through
the use of a system of Industrial Development Certificates. Any application
under the normal town and country planning machinery for planning
permission for industrial development involving more than 5,000 square feet
of floor space (or 3,000 square feet in the Midlands and south-east) must be
accompanied by a certificate from the Board of Trade certifying that the
development in question can be carried out consistently with the proper
distribution of industry. In considering applications the Board of Trade is
required to have particular regard to the need for providing appropriate
employment in the development areas. In practice this obligation has led the
Board of Trade normally to refuse certificates for projects outside the
development areas unless satisfied that the project could not reasonably be
undertaken in a development area or in Northern Ireland. Subject to this
priority, the control is also used to encourage dispersal of industry to new or
expanded towns taking population from the more congested areas. Under the
Control of Office and Industrial Development Act 1965 the Board of Trade
also controls office developments of over 10,000 square feet in most of the
Midlands, and in the south-east other than Greater London where the limit
is 3,000 square feet.
Nearly per cent of workers employed in manufacturing industries in
1966 were in plants opened since 1945 by firms whose manufacturing base
was in some other region. A further 3 J per cent were in those opened by firms
whose base was in some other part of the region. The development areas (and
Northern Ireland) have made net gains of employment in the last two decades
by the movement of manufacturing industries.
Under its own legislation Northern Ireland provides for the payment of
investment grants at 40 per cent of the cost both of new plant and machinery
and of new buildings for the manufacturing, construction and extractive
industries in Northern Ireland. There is also provision for assisting firms by
means of loans to carry out major schemes of re-equipment, to move to
another area in particular need of industrial development or to undertake a
rehousing of their business in association with a major scheme of modernisa¬
tion and reorganisation. Help under the investment grants legislation is
largely made without regard to how much employment is created as a result.
As an alternative means of assistance the Northern Ireland Government
continues to use its comprehensive and flexible powers authorised under the
Industries Development Acts for projects which offer a reasonable amount of
Councils to

employment. In such cases capital assistance of 45 per cent would normally
be available instead of the 40 per cent referred to above. For those projects
which offer exceptionally attractive returns in employment or location within
Northern Ireland, the assistance offered could include tenancy of a govern¬
ment-built factory at a very low rent, grants towards operating costs in the
initial stages, and grants towards costs of removing existing machinery and
installing it in a factory in Northern Ireland. The regional employment
premium and selective employment premium apply also to Northern Ireland.
Since 1945 over 250 new firms have been established in Northern Ireland
with government assistance, giving employment to some 70,000 people.
The Ministry of Commerce is the Northern Ireland government department
concerned with the administration of industrial development policies. The
Northern Ireland Economic Council was set up in 1965 to assist in furthering
economic growth. The chairman is the Minister of Commerce, and the
membership includes representatives of industry, commerce and the trade
unions.
Certain regions and areas in England have industrial development associa¬
tions concerned with promoting local industry. These are sponsored mainly
by local authorities, trade associations and individual firms.
Several voluntary associations are concerned with Welsh industry. The
Development Corporation for Wales, founded in 1959, is the most prominent.
In Scotland, the Highlands and Islands Development Board, set up by
statute in 1965, works to stimulate the economic and social development of
the seven ‘crofting’ counties (see p. 314). It provides grants and loans to
industrial, commercial and other enterprises; it may also acquire land,
provide management and other advisory services and set up and carry on
businesses. The Scottish Council (Development and Industry), a voluntary
association, promotes the general economic development of Scotland.
Encouragement is given to the development of rural industries. Much of this
work is done under the aegis of the Development Commission1 with finance
from the Development Fund, notably advice and guidance to small businesses
in rural areas and country towns and loans for assistance to tourism in the
rural parts of development areas. In England and Wales this service is
provided by the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas acting in con¬
sultation with the Rural Community Councils through their Small Industries
Committees in the counties; by the Small Industries Council for Rural Areas
of Scotland; and in Northern Ireland by the Rural Industries Development
Committee of the Northern Ireland Council of Social Services. Another
service provided by the Commission is the financing of small factories to
stimulate rural industries and to combat rural depopulation.
Under the Finance Act 1968 hotels in certain rural parts of the develop¬
ment areas qualify for a refund of selective employment tax (see p. 365).
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
Britain’s manufacturing industries supply a wide range of products, many of
which are of major importance in world trade. Output has increased by over
two-fifths since 1958, and in 1968 was 5-2 per cent higher than the previous

the Development and Road Improvement Funds Acts 1909 and 1910. At the present
time the Fund may be used to help and expand the rural economy (including accom¬
modation of tourists) and also to promote the development and improvement of
fisheries.

year; output per head showed an advance of 6-6 per cent in 1968, bringing the
rise since i960 to 26 per cent. In 1968 this sector spent £1,526 million on
fixed capital equipment, 70 per cent of which was spent on plant and
machinery. The number of employees in manufacturing industry (including
the unemployed and those absent from work through sickness and other
causes, but excluding employers and the self-employed) was 8-6 million in
June 1968, 38 per cent of the total number of employees.
The employment and production figures listed in Table 17 give an indica¬
tion of the relative importance of broad sectors of manufacturing industry.
Expansion has been particularly rapid in those industries utilising advanced
technologies such as electronics, the newer branches of mechanical engineer¬
ing, most branches of the chemical industry and man-made fibres. The
diagram on page 251 shows the changes in production between 1958 and 1968
in the major groups of industry.
In the subsequent sections, statistics of employees refer to numbers at
June 1968, and export statistics are taken mainly from the Overseas Trade
Accounts of the United Kingdom.

INDUSTRY
Iron and Steel
257
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards and British inventors were responsible for the
discovery of the processes which led to the great expansion of steelmaking in
the second half of the nineteenth century. Today Britain is the world’s fifth
largest steel producing nation. Output of crude steel in 1968 totalled 25-9
million ingot tons, 8-2 per cent more than in 1967. Capacity utilisation in 1968
averaged 82 per cent, compared with 77 per cent in 1967. Total capacity at the
end of 1968 was almost 31-5 million tons. Pig iron production in 1968
amounted to 16-4 million tons.
Net deliveries of finished steel amounted to 20-7 million tons in 1968. The
4-5 million tons of iron and steel products which were exported had a value
of ^266 million; the United States (£58-7 million), Sweden (£13-8 million)
and Spain (£13 million) were the main overseas buyers.
The main producing districts are: South Wales (25 per cent of total crude
steel output); the north-east of England (16 per cent); Sheffield and district
(13 per cent); Scotland (12 per cent); Lincolnshire (12 per cent); and
Lancashire and Flintshire (10 per cent). South Wales concentrates mainly on
the manufacture of flat products, especially sheet steel and tinplate; the
output of the north-east coast and Scotland is predominantly of heavy steel
products (plates, sections and rails), but a wide strip mill for sheet production
is now in operation in Scotland. Production of special alloy steels is centred
on Sheffield.
During the period 1955-67 over £1,750 million was spent on major
development schemes. Capital expenditure reached a peak in 1961 of over
£230 million, due mainly to the strip mill expansion programme, falling back
to about £90 million in 1968. The emphasis is increasingly on improving
efficiency rather than raising total capacity. Britain has some of the most
modern plant in Europe, and by 1968 steel production by the converter
processes had increased from 8 per cent of output in i960 to nearly 30 per
cent; steel from electric furnaces had increased from 7 per cent to 16 per cent;
and the share of the older open hearth process had fallen from 84 per cent to
55 per cent.
Output per blast furnace has risen markedly in recent years, due both to an
increase in average size and to improvements in efficiency, such as improved
preparation of raw materials, the injection of fuel and oxygen, and the use of
higher blast temperatures. Industry-wide scientific and technological research
is carried out by the Inter-Group Laboratories of the British Steel Corpora¬
tion. Total annual expenditure by the industry is about £10 million.
Outstanding development projects completed in the last few years include
wide strip mills at new integrated works at Newport (Monmouthshire) and
at an existing works in Scotland; a new plant at Stoke-on-Trent, which is
based entirely on continuous casting for supplies of semi-finished steel; an
advanced unit for the mass production of alloy and special carbon steels at
Sheffield; the world’s largest electric melting shop and a steelworks in which
a linked three-computer system controls production planning throughout,
both at Rotherham.
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public
supervision since 1932. The Iron and Steel Act 1967 brought into public
ownership 13 major steel companies together producing well over 90 per cent
of Britain’s crude steel and employing some 70 per cent of the manpower in
the industry. Their shares and securities were vested in July 1967 in the
British Steel Corporation. The Corporation’s specific duties include pro¬
moting the efficient and economic supply of iron and steel products, exports,

and research and development; it is statutorily responsible for the finances of
the nationalised industry. The Corporation’s second Report on Organisation,
published in March 1969, recommended the dissolution of the companies
taken into public ownership and the replacement of the four regional groups
set up in 1967 with a number of smaller divisions corresponding to products.
The remaining private sector includes some 200 companies accounting for
about one-third of the value of the industry’s sales.
Output of iron castings totalled 3-56 million tons in 1968, 0-5 million tons
less than the record level of 1965. The main users of iron castings are the
general engineering industry, accounting for nearly one-third of the total
tonnage sold and about one-half of the industry’s turnover, the motor vehicle
industry, the manufacturers of pressure pipes and fittings, the building and
associated industries and the steel industry. There are about 1,000 firms in
the iron founding industry with some 109,000 employees. Exports are
included in the total of steel exports in the previous section.
The non-ferrous metals industry is the largest in Europe and as a consumer
of aluminium, copper and lead Britain is second only to the United States
among western countries. Output in 1968 included: aluminium, 38,000 tons
of virgin metal and 185,000 tons of secondary metal; refined copper, 49,000
tons of virgin copper and 146,000 tons of secondary metal; lead, 141,000 tons
of secondary metal refined from scrap and 91,000 tons of virgin lead refined
from imported lead bullion; zinc, 141,000 tons of slab metal; and tin, 28,000
tons. Mining in Britain is confined to the small-scale working of tin, although
detailed investigation is taking place into the possibilities of a considerable
expansion in this field.
In 1968 exports of non-ferrous base metals were valued at £271-7 million.
The main products exported, including semi-finished products, were copper
and copper alloys (£89-9 million), nickel and its alloys (£44-6 million),
aluminium and its alloys (£21-1 million) and tin and its alloys (£16-4 million).
The United States (£50-9 million), the Federal Republic of Germany (£45-7
million), and Italy (£17 million) were the largest purchasing countries.
Indirect exports are also substantial.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the Midlands; other centres
include South Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth, where one of the
world’s largest zinc smelters (capacity 120,000 tons a year) came into
operation in May 1968. Firms are engaged in smelting, casting and fabrication
by rolling, extrusion and drawing and the techniques of powder metallurgy
and pressure diecasting are also employed. Two major aluminium smelters
(combined annual capacity 200,000 tons) are being built with government
loans at Invergorden (Scotland) and Anglesey (Wales). Together with a third,
being built at Lynemouth (Northumberland), they will provide over half the
domestic requirements by 1974.
Britain is also a major producer of the newer specialised metals including
uranium, zirconium and beryllium for the nuclear energy industry; niobium
for aircraft production; and selenium, silicon, germanium and tantalum for
electronic apparatus. Scientific and technological research for the industry as a
whole is conducted by the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association.
Mechanical engineering comprises a wide range of industries, including all
types of machinery, machine tools, engineers’ small tools, mechanical handling
equipment, construction equipment, industrial plant, ordnance and small

arms, watches and clocks, and scientific instruments. Vehicle engines are
included in the section on vehicles (p. 265). The number of employees is
1 -3 million and the volume of production from these industries rose by 53 per
cent between 1958 and 1968. The aggregate value of the main products
of all sections other than tractors, small arms, scientific instruments and
watches and clocks was ,£2,376 million in 1968. Exports of non-electric
machinery were valued at ;£ 1,269 million in 1968, 22 per cent more than
in 1967.
There are over 300 firms, employing 35,000 people, in the agricultural
machinery industry, including three large firms with more than 1,000 workers.
In 1968 deliveries, excluding tractors, were valued at £76 million and exports
were worth ^27-2 million; the main overseas markets were the Republic of
Ireland, France, the United States, and South Africa.
The number of self-propelled combine harvesters, forage harvesters, pick¬
up balers and grain driers in use has increased in Britain in recent years.
Deliveries in 1968 included 3,700 combine harvesters, 7,000 milking machines,
13,600 pick-up balers and 1,500 grain and grass driers.
The bulk of British tractor output and exports consists of agricultural tractors.
Some 179,000 agricultural and industrial wheeled tractors were delivered in
1968, 136,000 (73 per cent) for export. In addition, 32,100 small market garden
tractors were delivered. Exports of new agricultural and track-laying tractors
were valued at ,£97-4 million in 1968. Agricultural tractor production is
dominated by two large organisations. Tractors are exhibited at the annual
Royal Smithfield Show and Agricultural Machinery Exhibition in London;
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world (see p. 309).
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry. The industry’s
output today ranges from watchmakers’ lathes weighing a few pounds to
machines weighing hundreds of tons, and to electronically controlled machine
tools giving accuracies of one-ten-thousandth part of an inch. Over 2,200
numerically controlled machine tools have been installed in Britain. The
Government, through the Ministry of Technology, is assisting the industry in
various ways, including pre-production purchase schemes, numerical control
advisory services and the placing of research and development contracts.
Deliveries of machine tools were valued at ,£153 million in 1968, compared
with ,£156 million in 1967. Exports in 1968 had a value of £59 million,
21 per cent up on 1967, and of the orders on hand at the end of December 1968
(£106 million), 46 per cent were for export. The United States (£10-8 million),
the Soviet Union (j£6-6 million), Australia (j£6-i million) and South Africa
(j£3-6 million) were the main overseas markets in 1968. Seven major groups
account for almost two-thirds of the industry’s output although the high
degree of specialisation makes it possible for the small firm to flourish. The
industry is centred mainly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire, and to
a lesser extent near London and Glasgow. There are 59,000 persons
employed.
The Machine Tool Trades Association of Great Britain is the representative
body of most manufacturers and importers, and is responsible for the
International Machine Tool Exhibitions held in Britain every four years, the
next being due in 1972. The industry is served by its own research body,
the Machine Tool Industry Research Association, and its customers by the
Production Engineering Research Association.

Britain manufactures a wide range of industrial engines. Deliveries of engines
(including parts) had a value of ^164 million in 1968 and exports (including
marine engines) were worth ^37-4 million; in addition, parts exported were
valued at £25-6 million. The total brake horse-power of the 330,000 internal
combustion engines delivered was 12-1 million, ranging in size from under
3 b.h.p. to over 4,000 b.h.p. Production is concentrated among the large firms
in the industry, and a total of 37,000 people are employed.
One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries, the textile
machinery industry’s range of output embraces all stages in textile manufac¬
turing processes. Deliveries in 1968 were valued at ^127-3 million and
exports (including products of some associated industries) at ^101-3 million.
Principal markets were the Soviet Union (^17-9 million), the United States
(£9 million), Pakistan (£8-5 million) and the Federal Republic of Germany
(£7 million).
The industry, which has 46,000 employees, comprises many firms and is
situated mainly in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Dundee,
Leicester and Nottingham. It makes a wide range of machines and accessories
for the manufacture and processing of yarns and fabrics from all types of
natural and man-made fibres.
Almost every industry makes use of mechanical handling equipment; the
products of the industry range from individual units and accessories to
complete operating systems. The value of deliveries in 1968 was ^167-5
million, the main products being cranes and bridge transporters, lifts,
escalators, conveyors, elevators and hoists. In addition, British firms produced
18,200 powered industrial trucks, including 13,400 fork-lift trucks. Exports
of mechanical handling equipment (including industrial and works trucks) in
1968 were valued at ^46-5 million. There are many small firms in the industry;
in all, 59,000 people are employed.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is
produced. These include crawler tractors, motor graders, scrapers, trenchers,
dozer equipment, dumpers, excavators and loading shovels, and crushing,
pulverising and screening plant. The labour force numbers 39,600.
The value of deliveries from the industry was ^205-6 million in 1968; by
far the most important single item was earth-moving machinery including
crawler tractors (with a value of £167 million). Deliveries of contractors’
plant for export in 1968 totalled ^97-6 million; France, Australia, Spain
and Sweden are important markets.
The office machinery industry has been expanding rapidly. In 1968 the value
of deliveries of office machinery was £82-7 million including £42-8 million
for export. Deliveries in 1968 included 93,000 standard typewriters and 278,000
portable typewriters. The value of deliveries of accounting and similar
machinery was £45-8 million, of which ^26-3 million was for export, and of
other office machinery £26-g million, of which £14-6 million was for export.
Exports of all office machinery (including electronic computers and data pro¬
cessing equipment) were valued at £go million. The most important overseas
purchasers were the Federal Republic of Germany (^n million), the United
States (£10-4 million), France (£9-6 million) and Australia (£4-8 million).
British subsidiaries or associates of United States firms are prominent in the
office machinery industry. There are 52,000 persons employed.

The manufacture of engineers’ small tools and gauges is an expanding
industry; deliveries increased in value from ^55 million in 1959 to ^101
million in 1968; the main products were hard metal-tipped tools (^13 million),
other metal cutting tools (^43-2 million), jigs and fixtures (^17-2 million) and
press tools, moulds, etc. (£20-3 million). Export deliveries in 1968 totalled
£18 million. The industry has a labour force of 68,000 persons.
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial plant and
steelwork, and 174,000 are employed in this branch. Of particular importance
are steam-raising boilers, lime and cement kilns, gas and coke oven plant,
sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, chemical and mineral oil
refining plant, nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment plant, and
steelwork for bridges, buildings, etc. The industry has several large-scale
enterprises. In 1968 the aggregate value of deliveries (including rolling mills)
totalled £507 million.
British companies delivered water tube boilers to the value of £89-8 million
in 1968; shell boilers and other boilerhouse plant accounted for a further
£47-8 million. Water tube boilers of advanced design and of large steam¬
raising capacity are produced for power stations, whereas shell boilers are
used for steam-raising and heating in factories and buildings. Exports of
vapour generating boilers in 1968 amounted to £12-5 million.
The steelworks plant industry provides, in association with firms producing
rolling mills, almost all Britain’s requirements as well as plant for export.
The value of deliveries in 1968 was £26-5 million; rolling mills and ancillary
equipment accounted for a further ^14-4 million. This industry consists
of a small number of firms, most of which are business associates or members
of a consortium. Spain, Yugoslavia, Finland and South Africa are a few of the
countries in which British firms are undertaking major steelworks plant
projects.
The manufacture of specialised equipment for the chemical and oil refining
industries has expanded rapidly in recent years. Deliveries of chemical plant
were valued at £118 million in 1968 compared with £128 million in 1967.
Britain ranks second to the United States as a supplier of equipment for the
petroleum industry. The range of chemical plant produced includes distilla¬
tion columns, heat exchangers, high-vacuum drying equipment, and plant
for the manufacture of chemicals from all feedstocks including petroleum.
Two major consortia, consisting of leading firms in the heavy electrical
engineering, civil engineering, boiler, instrument, and associated industries,
were formed in 1968 to build nuclear power stations for the United Kingdom
electricity authorities (see p. 289). These replaced the three groups formed
in 1959. The Atomic Energy Authority grants them non-exclusive manu¬
facturing licences and is working in close collaboration with them in research
and development.
In addition to the mechanical engineering firms described in preceding
sections, there are about 2,000 enterprises whose principal product is a type
of machinery not so far mentioned. The main products include: mining
machinery, printing and book-binding machinery, refrigeration appliances,
space heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment, pumps and pump¬
ing machinery, industrial valves and cocks, compressors, scales and weighing
machinery, portable power tools, food preparing machinery and many other

types of equipment. The total value of deliveries in 1968 was some £862
million. There are 354,000 workers employed in these industries.
This industry makes a wide range of equipment and appliances, extending
from domestic and commercial refrigerators of varying sizes to industrial
refrigeration equipment for cold stores, manufacture of chemicals and other
products, ice-making plant and refrigeration plant for ships. Total deliveries
of refrigerating machinery had a value of ^64 million in 1968; 878,000
domestic refrigerators wrere for the home market and 207,000 were exported.
The value of deliveries of space heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
equipment has been rising and in 1968 reached ^84-8 million. Exports were
valued at ^8-6 million.
Industrial valves controlling the movement of liquids and gases are a vital
component in many industrial processes, particularly in the chemicals, oil and
electric power industries. The value of deliveries of pumps and valves in 1968
was £161-8 million and that of air and gas compressors and exhausters £46-1
million. Exports of pumps and centrifuges totalled £58-4 million and exports
of industrial valves £29-6 million.
The value of deliveries of other major products in 1968 was: mining
machinery, £62-4. million; food and drink machinery, £52-9 million; pack¬
aging machinery, £32-4 million; and other machinery, £343 million.
Important export products in 1968 included: food and drink processing
machinery, £19-6 million; cigarette-making machinery, £13 million; paper¬
making machinery, £19-5 million; and printing and bookbinding machinery,
£25-2 million.
The industry manufactures photographic, scientific, surgical and industrial
instruments; it has a labour force of 139,000 persons. A rapidly expanding
sector is that making industrial process measuring and control instruments—
an essential element of automation in industry—deliveries of which amounted
to £75 million in 1968, compared with £41-3 million in i960. The value of
deliveries of other broad categories was: optical instruments, £10-2 million;
electric, electronic, and nucleonic instruments, £27-9 million; and nautical and
aeronautical instruments, £27 million. The total deliveries for 1968
amounted to £187 million.
Export deliveries of scientific instruments have been rising markedly,
amounting to £58 million in 1968, compared with £27-9 million in i960. The
Scientific Instrument Research Association conducts research on behalf of the
industry.
Deliveries of photographic equipment in 1968 totalled £12$ million, including
£55-2 million for export. The main products in 1968 were: film (other than
cinematograph film), £42-i million; sensitised paper and cloth, £23-9 million;
and cinematograph film, ^17-1 million. Deliveries of photographic cameras
were valued at £3-3 million.
The present industry is largely a post-war development. It employs 14,000
people, the great majority skilled craftsmen, and many of its factories are
located on new industrial estates in the older industrial areas, particularly in
Scotland. Output in 1968 included clocks (£7-9 million), watches (£5-3
million) and time switches {£8-9 million); export sales were valued at
£4-4 million.

Behind the firms manufacturing the major products outlined in this section
are nearly 4,000 enterprises, employing 247,000 people, whose main functions
are to supply parts and components, to conduct research and development
work, and to undertake general sub-contracting and repair work. (Some enter¬
prises are included because the mixed character of their work makes it
impossible to classify them under any single industry.) They include several
large undertakings with more than 5,000 employees. Ball and roller bearings,
and chains, are important products; exports of the former were valued at
£15-4 million in 1968, and exports of chains at £67 million.
The electrical engineering industry, with a labour force of 910,000, is engaged
in the manufacture and installation of a wide variety of electrical equipment,
including all types of generating, transmission and distribution equipment;
motors; telecommunications apparatus; domestic appliances; and specialised
laboratory and electronic equipment. Annual output rose in volume by
three-fifths between 1958 and 1968, and the total value of production in 1968
was estimated at over £2,500 million.
Exports of electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances in 1968 were
valued at £410 million, 19 per cent more than in 1967. Products are ex¬
ported to all parts of the world; in 1968 South Africa (£43-i million), the
United States (£31-6 million), Australia (£277 million), the Federal
Republic of Germany (£23-1 million) and Canada (£17-9 million) were the
main markets.
The industry’s leading representative organisation is the British Electrical
and Allied Manufacturers’ Association; scientific and technological research
on behalf of the industry as a whole is carried out by the Electrical Research
Association.

British scientists and engineers have been responsible for many of the basic
advances in the generation and transmission of electric power. The experi¬
ments of Michael Faraday pointed the way to the production of electricity
as a source of cheap and abundant power. Sir Charles Parsons produced and
patented the first turbo-dynamo, the forerunner of the giant turbo-generating
sets of today.
In 1968 deliveries of electrical machinery were valued at £456 million,
comprising ^173 million worth of rotating electrical machinery (motors,
generators and rotary converters), £61-5 million worth of transformers for
lighting, heating and power, £187 million worth of switchgear and control
gear and £33-8 million worth of other electrical machinery.
Exports of generators, motors, converters, transformers and rectifiers
amounted to £59-6 million in 1968, the main purchasers being Australia
(j£6-8 million) and the United States (£5-6 million). Switchgear, starting and
control gear exports were valued at £57-2.
About 600 firms manufacture electrical machinery, but recent mergers have
led to the creation of the largest electrical engineering group in Europe and
the trend is towards larger units of control. The total labour force numbers
213,000. Manufacture takes place in many areas, including Manchester,
Rugby, Tyneside, Stafford and Larne (Northern Ireland).
Production of electronic equipment is one of the most rapidly expanding of
British industries. United Kingdom scientists and inventors have made many
basic contributions to electronics—the thermionic valve, the development of
radar, the first public transmission television service, and the ‘printed circuit’,

which has led to far-reaching changes in methods of production in the radio
industry. The industry employs 350,000 people.
Total deliveries of electronic equipment (excluding telephone apparatus)
were valued in 1968 at £423-8 million, including £153 million for export.
(Indirect exports incorporated in ships, aircraft and machinery are consider¬
able.) Computers are the most important product of the capital equipment
sector, which accounts for 26 per cent of total output. Britain has the largest
indigenous computer industry outside the United States and has supplied
over 1,500 installations in Britain. The merger in 1968 of the two major
British computer concerns created a single group, responsible for almost
all domestic output. Deliveries, which have more than doubled in the last
three years, were valued at £110 million in 1968 and exports at £43-6
million.
Deliveries of radar and navigational aids were valued at £97 million in 1968,
over six times the i960 level, and over one-third of total output was exported.
Three-quarters of the world’s radar-fitted merchant ships use British equip¬
ment, as do most of the world’s civil airports outside the American continent.
All-weather landing systems and inertial (automatic) navigation systems are
amongst recent developments. Other important items of capital equipment
include electronic control equipment (£53 million), radio communications
equipment (£44 million) and electronic measuring and testing equipment
(£43 million).
The consumer goods sector of the industry manufactures radio and television
sets and radiograms. The industry is dominated by several large firms.
Output of television sets in 1968 rose to 1-96 million (including 140,000 colour
television sets); the total sales value of £93-6 million was almost all in the
home market. Production of radios and radiograms numbered 1-74 million in
1968 and total sales were worth £21-6 million.
The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric power,
for telegraph and telephone networks and for many other purposes; its
products include submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of
materials. It is supplying the high voltage cable to carry the expanding output
of electric power in Britain (see p. 288). The value of deliveries in 1968 was
a record £274 million. Exports of electric cables, wires, etc., were worth
£42-6 million; the main purchasers were South Africa and the United States.
The industry has a labour force of 58,000 persons and includes three firms
with over 5,000 employees.
Britain is one of the largest exporters of telegraph and telephone equipment.
Shipments overseas had a value of £34-3 million in 1968. Research and
development work is done by firms in the industry in co-operation with the
Post Office. The industry employs 91,000 persons, and three firms are
responsible for almost all output.
Deliveries of other electrical goods in 1968 included domestic electrical
appliances, £182-3 million; electrical equipment for motor vehicles, cycles
and aircraft, £106-1 million; batteries and accumulators, £64-5 million;
electric lamps, £34-9 million; and other electrical goods, £117-8 million. In
terms of volume, deliveries included: 1-5 million electric blankets, i-8 million
vacuum cleaners, 0-9 million domestic washing machines and 2-3 million
electric irons. In 1968 exports of domestic electrical equipment were valued at

fe’3 million, including washing machines and parts (£9-9 million), refrigera-
tors (£6 million) and vacuum cleaners (£3-6 million); the main markets were
the United States (^2-9 million), Australia and Canada. Exports of batteries
and accumulators in 1968 were valued at ^15'7 million. The industry has a
labour force of 206,200.
The industries which manufacture vehicles and aircraft provide a significant
contribution to exports; exports of transport equipment in 1968 had a value of
£910 million, accounting for almost 15 per cent of total exports. The labour
force numbers 1,001,000 and includes: 473,000 in motor vehicle manufacture,
240,000 in aircraft construction and repairing, 192,000 in shipbuilding and
marine engineering, 65,000 in the manufacture of locomotives and railway
wagons and carriages, 25,000 in cycle and motor cycle manufacturing, and
4,500 in the making of perambulators and hand trucks.
In both size and value the largest section of the vehicle industry comprises the
manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles.
The industry was at one time located mainly in the Midlands and London
areas, but during the past decade manufacturing and assembly plants have
been established on Merseyside, in Wales and in Scotland.
Car and commercial vehicle output is dominated by the four largest firms
(British Leyland Motor Corporation, Ford, Rootes and Vauxhall), which
account for over 95 per cent of complete vehicle production; the balance is
in the hands of smaller, specialist producers of heavy commercial vehicles,
omnibuses, coaches, limousines and sports cars. The principal trade associa¬
tion is the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which
holds a motor show annually in London and a Commercial Motor Exhibition
every two years. The Motor Industry Research Association carries out
collective research on vehicles and components.
Car output in 1968 totalled 1-82 million units, compared with 1-56 million
units in 1967* Exports in 1968 amounted to 677,000 cars with a record value
of ^280 million, one-third higher than in 1967. The United States (^58-8
million) was again the largest single purchaser, followed by Canada (£21-5
million), Belgium and Australia. About one-fifth of all exports went to BETA
member countries and one-fifth to the EEC.
Production of commercial vehicles, including chassis, increased from 146,000
in 1946 to 409,000 in 1968. Exports in 1968 of new commercial vehicles
numbered 142,000 with a record total value of ^122-5 million. Australia
(£i5‘i million), South Africa (^14-8 million) and EFTA countries (^16-2
million) were the main markets for commercial vehicles. Since 1961 Britain
has been one of the world’s largest exporters of commercial vehicles. The
prototype of a gas-turbine powered commercial vehicle was demonstrated
in 1968.
Exports of parts and accessories for cars and commercial vehicles in 1968 had
a value of ^181 million; engines and parts for motor vehicles were valued at
a further £61-2 million. Caravan and trailer exports totalled £10-5 million.
Deliveries of bicycles have declined in recent years, but in 1968 amounted to
1-5 million, slightly more than the previous year. About 80 per cent of British
manufacturing capacity is in the hands of a single group of companies, and
output is concentrated in the Nottingham area. About 931,000 cycles worth
^8-9 million were sent overseas in 1968; the United States (^2-7 million) was
266

much the largest single market. A small-wheel bicycle, developed in Britain,
is the first major technical change in the bicycle for 60 years.
Deliveries of all types of motor cycle amounted to 96,200 in 1968. The total
included 10,800 mopeds and 12,200 three-wheeled vehicles. Manufacture is
dominated by one large group. Exports of motor cycles and parts totalled
^19-1 million in 1968, with the United States by far the biggest market.
The British Railways Board has its own workshops which supply British
Railways and certain other users in Britain; private firms build locomotives,
carriages and wagons for British Railways, for industrial users and for export.
Deliveries in 1968 included 75 electric locomotives, all of which were for
export, 188 diesel and diesel-electric locomotives, 635 coaching vehicles and
2,900 wagons. The total value of exports of railway vehicles and parts in 1968
was £12-2 million; Kenya (^1-9 million), South Africa and Pakistan were the
largest purchasers.
Almost all the aircraft produced by the British industry today are based on
civil and military applications of the gas-turbine aero-engine, first developed
by Sir Frank Whittle. The most notable turbo-prop aircraft in current
production and operation are the Hawker Siddeley 7^5, of which 200 have
been sold or are on order, and the Handley Page Herald. A second generation
of jet airliners, the medium-haul Trident, the longer-haul Vickers VC 10,
the BAG One-Eleven, the world’s first jet transport designed to operate
economically on short-haul routes, have been in service for over five years.
Other civil aircraft in production include the HS125 executive jet, the Beagle
range of light aircraft, using piston and turbo-prop engines, the Handley
Page Jetstream executive airliner seating up to 18 passengers, the Sky van
and the Islander, an economical feeder-line aircraft. The Concorde, the world’s
first supersonic airliner, developed jointly by Britain and France, made its
maiden flight in February 1969.
The industry produces a wide range of military aircraft, including the
Jaguar, in collaboration with France, and the Harrier vertical take-off strike
aircraft. It is also engaged on work on rockets, earth satellites and other aero¬
space requirements, including the Blue Streak and Black Arrow satellite
launchers.
Hovercraft, a new type of transport vehicle invented in Britain, are being
increasingly used throughout the world. More than 130 have been built in
Britain up to 1969 and a number of types, including a 160-ton version, the
SRN 4, are in production or under development.
In 1968 exports of the aerospace industry totalled £282 million, 54 per cent
up on 1967. Exports of new aircraft and parts in 1968 (excluding electrical
equipment) had a value of ,£135-1 million, compared with £97-6 million in
1967. Leading buyers included the United States (£25-5 million) and the
Federal Republic of Germany (^9-8 million). In addition, exports of instru¬
ments were worth ,£3-9 million, and tyres £i-2 million.
The construction of aircraft is dominated by two large airframe manufac¬
turers and one helicopter concern, though there are a few important smaller
companies outside these groups. Besides extensive research work by the
industry, research on a substantial scale on problems of aircraft and their
engines is carried out by the Government, chiefly at the Royal Aircraft
Establishment and the National Gas Turbine Establishment, both at Farn-
borough, and the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Bedford. The British

aero-space industry has over 50 collaboration agreements with overseas
governments and companies.
Aero-engines and parts provided some £966 million in export earnings from
1946 to 1968. In 1968 exports of new and used engines and parts totalled
^146-8 million (two-thirds more than in 1967); major customers were the
United States (£74 million), France (^18-9 million) and the Federal Republic
of Germany (^6-i million). Twelve different British jet engines power over
30 types of aircraft currently in production overseas. Famous engines in
production include the economical Dart turbo-prop, the Spey turbo-jet and
the revolutionary Pegasus lift-thrust engine for vertical take-off and landing
(VTOL) aircraft. Advanced technology turbofan engines, currently under
development, have secured large overseas orders as power plants for air¬
buses. The power plant for the Concorde is a further development of the
Olympus.
One company is responsible for almost all aero-engine production.
The building of large ocean-going vessels is concentrated in four main areas:
the river Clyde in Scotland, the north-east and north-west coasts of England
and Belfast in Northern Ireland. Numerous yards around the coast build
smaller vessels such as fishing vessels, yachts and harbour craft.
Co-operative research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is under¬
taken by the British Ship Research Association with its headquarters and a
research station on the river Tyne.
A gradual fall in tonnage launched from the 1955 peak of 1 - 5 million tons was
halted in 1964, and launchings in 1968 totalled 0-9 million gross tons, 400,000
tons below the 1967 level. British launchings were the fourth largest in the
world in 1968 accounting for 5-3 per cent of the world total, compared with
8-2 per cent in 1967. Eighteen oil tankers, totalling 80,800 gross tons, vrere
launched in 1968. Launchings also included 25 bulk carriers totalling 552,000
gross tons and 11 cargo ships between 8,000 and 10,000 gross tons. At the
end of 1968 orders on hand for merchant vessels of 100 gross tons and over
were 233 (180 in 1967) totalling 3-6 million gross tons with a value of ^401
million, 57 per cent higher than in 1967. Of these vessels, 66 (1-2 million
gross tons) were for export.
Modernisation in British shipyards over the last few years has involved the
replanning of yards, the erection of large prefabrication shops for welding
massive sections under cover, the installation of heavy-lift travelling cranes,
and much other reconstruction. A new building dock, nearing completion at
Belfast, will be capable of accommodating the largest vessels required in the
future.
Large-scale mergers on Tyneside and Clydeside, and plans for re-grouping
in other areas, have resulted from proposals of the Shipbuilding Industry
Board, established in 1965.
There are many specialist ship-repairing establishments and most of the
larger shipbuilding firms also carry out repair work; about one-quarter of
ship-repairing activity is concentrated on the north-east coast of England.
Repair yards and dry docks are situated in all the large ports.
Many of the larger shipbuilding yards maintain or have closely associated
engine building works, constructing various types of marine slow-speed diesel
engines, usually under licence. One firm designs large low-speed diesel engines

and there are two independent builders of these engines. Steam turbines of
the highest powers are also built.
The group of industries manufacturing metal products not already described
consists of a large number of companies with a total labour force of 559,000
in 1968; the main groups were bolts, nuts and screws (44,000 persons), wire
and wire manufactures (42,000), cans and metal boxes (34,000), jewellery,
plate, and refining of precious metals (27,000), tools and implements (22,000),
cutlery (12,600), and other metal industries (377,000). The total value of
exports in 1968 was about £176 million.
The production of cutlery and flatware is centred mainly in the city of
Sheffield and the industry’s reputation has been built up on the skill of its
craftsmen. Mass-production methods are, however, extensively used except
in the case of some of the highest quality wares, although firms remain mainly
small. The value of sales of cutlery and flatware in 1968 was £15-1 million,
including export sales of £4 million.
This industry, located mainly in the Midlands, Lancashire, Yorkshire, South
Wales and London, produces a wide range of domestic utensils, such as
saucepans, buckets and dustbins, mainly from aluminium and wrought steel.
The value of sales in 1968 was ^23-9 million, of which £2-9 million were sales
for export.
The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest British industries, covering
the manufacture of such tools as files, saws, hammers, axes and spades;
Sheffield, Birmingham and other Midland towns are the most important
centres. The value of sales of implements and tools, other than machine tools
and portable power tools, was £41-7 million in 1968, of which £13 million
worth were exported; the totals included sales of hand tools, at home and for
export, valued at £24-6 million and ^12-8 million respectively.
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious
metals is an industry in which British craftsmen are heirs to a long tradition.
Most of the firms in the industry are small. The law requires that gold and
silver plate shall not be sold until it has been hall-marked at one of the Assay
Offices situated in London, Birmingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh. The
Birmingham office, located in the main centre of the jewellery industry, is by
far the most important. The total value of sales of jewellery, goldsmiths’ and
silversmiths’ wares and electro-plated nickel silver wares in 1968 was £29-6
million, of which £5-2 million was for export.
The chemicals industry, with a labour force of 460,000, comprises the manu¬
facture of: chemicals, dyestuffs, fertilisers and pesticides (223,000 employees),
pharmaceutical and toilet preparations (77,000 employees), explosives and
fireworks (26,000 employees), paint and printing ink (46,000 employees), oils,
fats, soap and detergents (35,000 employees), synthetic resins and plastics
(39,000 employees), polishes, gelatine and adhesives (15,000 employees). The
industry is capital intensive; the fixed capital expenditure of the industry,
excluding mineral oil refining, amounted to over ^1,188 million during the five
years 1962-67 and totalled £233 million in 1968. The value of exports in 1968
was £S99 million, or 9-7 per cent of total British exports. Production in the
general chemicals industries rose by 86 per cent between 1958 and 1968.

Over half the output of the inorganic chemicals industry consists of a limited
number of relatively simple chemicals, such as sulphuric acid, caustic soda,
chlorine and ammonia, produced in very large quantities and serving as basic
materials for industry. Sulphuric acid has the largest production of any
chemical and 3 -3 million tons were produced in 1968. The remaining output of
this sector consists of a very wide range of chemicals of varying complexity.
Substantial quantities of inorganic chemicals are used in the manufacture
of such products as fertilisers, detergents, paint, glass and metals. About
one-sixth of output is estimated to be exported directly.
Production of organic chemicals (which include coal-tar chemicals) rose
by 196 per cent between 1958 and 1968. To an increasing extent petroleum is
the raw material used and it is estimated that in 1968 petroleum-based
chemicals accounted for 78 per cent of the total output of organic chemicals;
deliveries of feedstock for the petroleum chemical plants totalled 5-3 million
tons in 1968 compared with i-i million tons in 1959. The most important
products (by weight) in 1968 were ethylene (691,000 tons) and propylene
(411,000 tons). The main outlets for organic chemicals are plastics materials,
solvents, synthetic rubber, man-made fibres and detergents. Consumption of
dyestuffs is geared to demand by the textile industry; about 31,000 tons of
synthetic dyestuffs were produced in 1968.
Exports of chemical elements and compounds amounted to £151-4 million
in 1968. Exports go to a large number of countries including, in 1968, the
Netherlands (£20-9 million), the United States (£8 million), Australia (£7-7
million), France (^7-7 million), Sweden, and the Federal Republic of Germany.
The first plastic, Parkesine (later called Celluloid), was produced and patented
in Britain in 1865 by Alexander Parkes; other British discoveries include
polyethylene. Plastics manufacture is one of the fastest growing sections of the
economy. Output of synthetic resins has increased by 217 per cent since 1958
and total production in 1968 was 1,243,000 tons (an increase of 14 per cent over
1967), of which 873,000 tons consisted of thermoplastic resins.
Expansion in recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of
which the most important are polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—
notably for foodstuffs), polyvinyl chloride (known as PYC and used for a
wide range of industrial purposes and consumer goods) and polystyrene
(a cheap non-inflammable material used for toys, light mouldings and many
consumer goods). One of the newer thermoplastic materials is polypropylene,
a versatile material which can be fabricated as mouldings, films and fibres.
A new family of plastic materials is now in commercial production in Britain.
Reinforced with carbon fibres, the materials are up to three times the strength
but only half the weight of steel. Rapid expansion of capacity for all the main
types of plastics materials is planned. Exports in 1968 amounted to 433,000
tons, valued at ^110-4 million. The main purchasers were Australia (£11-4
million), South Africa (£8-5 million), Sweden (£7-4 million) and the United
States (£7 million).
The first general purpose synthetic rubber to be manufactured on a com¬
mercial scale in the United Kingdom was marketed in 1958. High styrene
rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use where oil
resistance is required, are in large-scale production, and neoprene rubber is
manufactured in Northern Ireland. Production in 1968 amounted to 233,000
tons, most of which came from the styrene-butadiene plant at Hythe, near
Southampton. Exports of synthetic rubber and latex totalled 69,000 tons.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The development of artificial fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
the British scientists Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert. Two firms
predominate in the production of fertilisers and there are a number of firms
marketing compound fertilisers from the principal constituents—nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium. To encourage use, sales on the home market are
assisted by government subsidies paid to the farmer (see p. 312). Output of
nitrogenous fertilisers (in terms of nitrogen content) has been increasing and
in 1967-68 totalled 842,000 tons, while 435,000 tons (in terms of phosphate
content) of phosphatic fertilisers were produced; production of compound
fertilisers amounted to 2-9 million tons in 1967-68. The use of ammonium
nitrate (35 per cent nitrogen), ammonium phosphate, and, to a limited extent,
urea (mostly 45 per cent nitrogen) is resulting in more concentrated fertilisers.
The value of exports of manufactured fertilisers, mainly nitrogenous, was
£7-2 million in 1968.
Manufacturers’ sales of paint and varnish during 1968 amounted to over
98 million gallons (including 15 million gallons of emulsion paint) valued at
£144 million. Britain is one of the largest exporters of paints in the world;
exports of pigments, paints, varnishes and related materials in 1968 amounted
to £39 million. The industry’s indirect contribution to exports in the form of
surface coatings for finished goods is also considerable.
In recent years many improved techniques have been introduced, in
particular, new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments; quick-drying paints
and paints needing only one application have been developed.
The whole range of drugs is produced in the United Kingdom, including
antibiotics, sulphonamides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products,
anaesthetics, vaccines, sera and naturally occurring drugs. Research expendi¬
ture totalled £15 million in 1968.
Notable British contributions to the development of new products include:
the discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming and its evaluation by Sir
Howard Florey and E. B. Chain; the evaluation of sulphapyridine (M & B 693)
by Sir Lionel Whitby; the discovery of griseofulvin; and, more recently,
the isolation of the penicillin nucleus and the development of several
semi-synthetic penicillins and the cephalosporin antibiotics. Several of the
larger pharmaceutical companies in Britain are subsidiaries of overseas
firms.
In 1968 exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products and goods rose
by 23 per cent to the record level of ^96-1 million, of which -£25-3 million
worth were antibiotics. The largest purchasers were the Republic of Ireland
(j£5'3 million), Australia (^4-9 million), France (£4 million) and the United
States (£4 million).
Notable discoveries by the British crop protection industry include the
insecticidal activity of BHC (benzene hexachloride), the first selective weed¬
killer, MCPA, and more recently Gramoxone, a non-residual general
herbicide based on paraquat. Sales of pesticides and allied products were
valued at £33 million in 1968, 18 per cent higher than in 1967; herbicides
(£22 million) were the largest single category. Exports of insecticides,
fungicides and weedkillers in 1968 totalled j£i8*6 million, 21 per cent more
than in 1967.

Sales of toilet preparations were valued at £123 million in 1968, including
export sales of £17-4 million; home market sales of hair preparations totalled
about ^31 million. Petroleum is the source of the principal raw materials
used in the manufacture of organic surface-active agents in detergents; the
other main constituent, polyphosphates, is derived from inorganic sources.
Sales of synthetic detergents amounted to 414,000 tons in 1968, including
70,000 tons for export. Deliveries of soap totalled some 311,000 tons; two
companies supply about 90 per cent of home sales. Sales of polishes in 1968
were valued at ^18-7 million, including floor and furniture polishes worth
j£8-7 million. Exports of perfumery and toilet preparations, soap and asso¬
ciated products were valued at ^52-1 million.
The textile industries in 1968 had a labour force of 690,000 persons, half of
whom are women; 43,000 employees are engaged in the production of man¬
made fibres, 86,000 in the spinning and doubling of cotton, flax and man-made
fibres, 76,000 in the weaving of cotton, linen and man-made fibres, 110,624
in the woollen and worsted trades, 129,000 in hosiery and knitted goods,
61,000 in textile finishing and 44,800 in carpets. The total value of textile
exports in 1968 at £300 million wras one-fifth more than in 1967. Production
of textiles rose by 13 per cent in 1968 and was 29 per cent higher than in 1958.
Considerable vertical integration is taking place connected with the
increasing use of man-made fibres. Four multi-fibre, multi-process groups,
founded under the leadership of man-made fibres manufacturers, control the
bulk of Britain’s spinning and warp knitting activities.
Anew statutory body, the Textile Council for the Man-made Fibres, Cotton
and Silk Industries, was established in 1967 superseding the Cotton Board.
It is financed by a levy on the industry.
Scientific and technical research for the industry is carried out principally
by the Cotton, Silk and Man-made Fibres Research Association.
Cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods industry and cotton piece-goods
its largest export during the nineteenth century. Increasing low-cost competi¬
tion has cut progressively into British markets and a global limit has been
placed on imports of cotton goods from most countries during 1966-70.
Output in 1968 consisted of: 376 million lb. of single cotton yarn, 149
million lb. of spun man-made fibre and mixture single yarn, 225 million lb. of
doubled yarn, 60 million lb. of textured yarn, 733 million linear yards of
woven cotton cloth, and 556 million linear yards of man-made fibre and
mixture cloth. In 1968 exports of cotton yarn and woven fabrics (excluding
man-made fibres) were worth ^37-8 million, including woven fabrics valued
at £27 million, for which the Irish Republic and South Africa were the most
important markets.
Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the county
being mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning.
Manchester is the commercial centre and Liverpool is the chief port of entry
for raw cotton. Under legislation to assist the reorganisation of the industry,
Exchequer funds have paid for two-thirds of the cost of removing surplus
capacity, and also provided grants of about one-quarter towards the cost of
approved re-equipment and modernisation schemes.
The wool textile industry, one of the largest in the world, is the most ancient of
Britain’s staple industries and has been important since medieval times. There
are two main branches—woollen and worsted. The small or medium-sized

business predominates, with only a few large firms. While the West Riding of
Yorkshire is by far the most important producing area, Scotland and the West
of England remain famous as specialised producers of high-quality woollen
cloth. In recent years an increasing amount of man-made fibre has been
blended with wool.
In 1968 output included 213 million lb. of wool and hair tops and 325
million lb. of woollen yarn. Deliveries of worsted yarn amounted to 217
million lb. and of woven fabrics to 295 million square yards. In addition,
large quantities of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain. Consumption
of raw wool in 1968 was 391 million lb., compared with 509 million lb. in 1959.
Exports in 1968 included wool yarns (£20 million), woollen fabrics (^40-5
million) and wool worsted fabrics (^23 million). The main buyers of woollen
fabrics were the United States (£5-3 million), Canada and Japan. Raw wool
(cleaned or scoured in Britain) and other animal hair and tops exported had
a value of £49 million. Research is carried on mainly by the Wool Industries
Research Association.
Much of the early development of viscose rayon and acetate took place in
Britain. Production is spread throughout the country with Northern Ireland
of growing importance. Large firms predominate in the industry. There has
been a rapid expansion of output in recent years, the 1963 record total of
1,187 million lb. being 24 per cent higher than in 1967 and 42 per cent more
than in 1964. Output consisted of 656 million lb. of staple fibre and 533 million
lb. of filament yarn in 1968. Of the staple fibre, 66 million lb., and of the
continuous filament, 75 million lb., were of fully synthetic materials.
Two main types of man-made fibres are manufactured: those made from
cellulose (such as rayon) and those produced by fully synthetic processes from
chemical substances (such as nylon). Viscose rayon is still the most widely
used of all man-made fibres and output in 1968 totalled 479 million lb. The
world’s largest rayon staple factory is at Greenfield (North Wales), with an
annual output of over 200 million lb., while other large rayon plants are at
Grimsby, Preston and Wolverhampton. Almost all the rayon produced in
Britain is made by a single company and its subsidiaries.
Production of nylon, the first fully synthetic fibre, in the form of nylon 66,
started in Britain in 1941; another type of nylon (nylon 6) has been manu¬
factured since 1963. Total productive capacity for nylon has increased from
160 million lb. a year in 1964, to almost 250 million lb. at the end of 1968.
Terylene, a polyester fibre, was invented in Britain during the second
world war. It is resistant to fading and is particularly suited to blending with
wool. Annual manufacturing capacity totals about 115 million lb. A group
of fibres of growing importance are the acrylic fibres: Courtelle (a British
discovery) and Acrilan are examples. Synthetic elastomerics or spandex
fibres, which are man-made textile fibres having inherent properties of stretch
and recovery, are now produced commercially.
Exports of man-made fibre yarns had a value of j£5o-6 million in 1968,
and woven fabrics ^19-6 million. Switzerland, the Federal Republic of
Germany and the Republic of Ireland were the most important purchasers
of yarns.
The hosiery and knitwear industry is predominantly one of small-scale
enterprises. The industry is widely distributed, with Scotland and the east
Midlands as the two most important centres. Sales of knitted goods were
valued at £388 million in 1968 including £139 million worth of outerwear

and million worth of socks and stockings. Exports of knitted clothing
and accessories were valued at £26-8 million in 1968; the largest buyers were
the United States, Canada and Switzerland. Exports of knitted fabrics
amounted to ^11-4 million. The British Hosiery and Knitwear Export Group
co-ordinates the export activities of the industry and organises overseas
missions. The Hosiery and Allied Trades Research Association, with
laboratories at Nottingham, undertakes collective research.
The linen industry is concentrated in Northern Ireland (the greatest linen¬
manufacturing region in the world), with most of the remainder in Scotland.
Broadly speaking, the Northern Ireland industry concentrates on yarns
and the lighter types of fabrics, while in Scotland production is largely of
coarse linens and canvas, although household types are also produced.
Northern Ireland manufacturers produced 38 million linear yards of cloth
in 1968, while weavers in Great Britain delivered 23 million square yards,
including 14 million square yards of sailcloth and canvas. Exports in 1968
included £7-8 million worth of linen fabrics and ^3-3 million worth of flax
yarns and linen thread.
Jute is manufactured on a large scale in the Dundee area—the centre of the
world’s oldest jute industry—and 15,000 people are employed in all. Jute is
used in the manufacture of carpets, cordage, ropes and woven into fabrics for
a wide range of uses in the packaging, carpet, upholstery, building and motor
car industries. Research is being undertaken into new uses, for example,
plastics reinforcement. In 1968, 109,000 tons of raw jute were used, and
exports of jute fabric and yarn totalled £3 million.
Sales of finished lace goods amounted to £17 million in 1968. The most
important lace product is from the warp knitting machines, with sales valued
at £10 million. Exports were worth ^4-5 million in 1968.
In addition to the products mentioned above, British textile firms manufacture
a wide range of other goods, including many special yarns and fabrics, net,
household textiles such as blankets, tablecloths and curtains, and floor
coverings other than carpets. Sales of narrow fabrics (including elastic
machinery belting and ribbon) totalled £50 million in 1968, including export
sales of j£6-8 million. Sales of floor coverings of linoleum, vinyl and other
synthetic materials were valued at £35-7 million in 1968; just under one-sixth
were for export. The cordage industry is the largest in Europe. Exports of
ropes, cordage, nets and netting in 1968 were valued at £4 million.
In 1968 total sales of all types of carpets and rugs amounted to 136-2 million
square yards, valued at £195-7 million. Exports in 1968 had a value of £21-7
million; Australia (£4-1 million) was the largest single market.
There are over 130 enterprises engaged in the manufacture of carpets,
including several large firms. In addition to the manufacture of woven carpets
such as Axminster and Wilton, almost one-half of total sales by quantity in
1968 were of tufted carpets, a form of carpeting in which the pile, usually
containing a high proportion of artificial fibres, is inserted into a pre-woven
backing. Axminster-type carpets account for about 35 per cent of the value of
exports. The principal manufacturing centres include Kidderminster (in
Worcestershire), Halifax and Dewsbury (in the West Riding of Yorkshire),
Glasgow and Kilmarnock (in Scotland) and several towns in Northern
Ireland. About a third of the carpets produced (by quantity) are made

predominantly of wool and a growing proportion of traditional woven carpets
contain some man-made fibre.
There are 543,000 employees in the clothing, leather and footwear industries.
Some 389,000 are in the clothing industry, 98,000 in the footwear trade and
56,000 in leather, leather goods and fur manufacture. The aggregate value of
their exports in 1968 was ^138 million.
The British clothing industry is the largest in Europe and total deliveries
of made-up clothing have increased by 35 per cent since 1958. Exports in 1968,
excluding knitted goods, were valued at £55-9 million; the United States
(^57 million) was the main purchaser. Substantial quantities of clothing are
also sent by parcel post.
Although there are some large firms employing mass-production methods
on an increasing scale, the typical firm is small. The principal manufacturing
centres are London, Leeds and Manchester, but several firms are also situated
on industrial trading estates throughout the country. Fashion is important in
the production of haute couture models and throughout the ready-to-wear
industry. The Clothing Export Council, representing over 200 companies,
organises promotions for various sectors of the industry.
Leather tanning is one of Britain’s oldest industries. In 1968, some 12,000 tons
of sole and other heavy leather and about 435 million square feet of upper,
lining and other light leathers were produced. Britain is one of the world’s
leading exporters with exports in 1968 valued at £28-2 million. The United
States is the largest single market (j£6-i million in 1968), followed by Canada
(£4-1 million) and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Tanneries are situated in most parts of Britain, but there are important
concentrations in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, the north Midlands and
the London area. Many different types of leather are produced, ranging from
the heavy types for industrial uses, such as machinery belting, to high quality
leather for footwear, leather goods, gloves and clothing. The British Leather
Manufacturers’ Research Association is the foremost of its type in the
world.
The British footwear industry is the third largest in the world. In 1968
manufacturers’ sales of footwear totalled 201 million pairs. Exports of all
types had a value of ^26-1 million; the United States (£7-3 million), the
Soviet Union and Canada were the largest markets.
Factories are located throughout Britain. Some areas concentrate on
production of particular types; for example, the Rossendale Valley region
of Lancashire on slippers, and Leicester and Norwich on women’s and girls’
shoes. The Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association enjoys a world-wide
reputation in all matters connected with shoemaking.
The food, drink and tobacco industries employ 869,000 persons in the
production of a great variety of goods. The value of their combined exports
in 1968 was ^370 million. Exports of alcoholic and other beverages accounted
for £197 million; sugar, sugar preparations and honey for £25 million;
cereal and cereal preparations for £40 million; fruit and vegetables for
^15-8 million; and coffee, cocoa, tea and spices for 3^17-7 million.
Many of the industry’s leading firms have been involved in mergers, or
have announced merger plans.

The household consumption of bread, which has been falling, averaged about
2 lb. 6 oz. per head per week in 1968. The trend is heavily towards concen¬
trating production in large mechanical bakeries; well over two-thirds of the
bread is made in these bakeries, which specialise in sliced and wrapped loaves;
four groups have a dominant position. In the smaller bakeries production of
cake and other flour confectionery is usually allied to bread production. There
are 164,000 employees in the bread and flour confectionery industry; a further
43,000 are employed in grain-milling.
There are 53,000 employees producing biscuits, and annual output has been
over 550>00° tons in recent years. Weekly consumption of cakes and biscuits
per head in Britain was 11-9 oz. in 1968. British biscuits have gained a world¬
wide reputation, and, despite the problem of import restrictions in several
overseas markets, exports in 1968 were valued at ^11-9 million.
The chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, which has 95,000 employees,
is composed of a small number of very large manufacturers and many medium¬
sized and small firms. The main ingredients used by the industry are sugar,
cocoa beans, glucose, milk, nuts and fats. Production of chocolate and
sugar confectionery was 668,000 tons in 1968. Consumption of chocolate
and sugar confectionery in the United Kingdom is far higher than in any
other country, being equivalent to 7-7 oz. per head per week.
The value of exports in 1968 of cocoa preparations (including chocolate)
was £i4‘9 million and of sugar confectionery, ^16-1 million. The Republic
of Ireland and Canada were the main markets for cocoa preparations. About
30 per cent of total world exports of chocolate and sugar confectionery come
from Britain, the world’s largest exporter of these products.
Among the fruit and vegetable products manufactured are jam, marmalade,
sauces and vinegar. The labour force numbers 71,000. Output of jams and
marmalade, which fell from 329,000 tons in 1949 to about 215,000 tons in
1956, has since remained little changed, totalling 199,000 tons in 1968. Straw¬
berry, raspberry, apricot and blackcurrant jams are the most popular. Exports
of jams and marmalade in 1968 were valued at ^2-3 million.
In 1968, 713,000 tons of canned vegetables were produced. The British
I\avy was using canned foods in 1813, but rapid development in the industry
did not take place until after 1935. Beans in tomato sauce (270,000 tons) and
processed and fresh peas (244,000 tons) are the vegetables most in demand
as canned products. In addition, output in 1968 included 100,000 tons of
canned and bottled fruit, and 273,000 tons of canned soup. Strawberries and
rhubarb are the most important fruits used for canning, followed by prunes
and apples. Sales of prepared fruit pie fillings are increasing.
Sales of frozen foods are rising in Britain, and nearly 119,000 tons of
vegetables and 700 tons of fruit were preserved by this method in 1968; peas
accounted for 55 per cent of all home-produced quick-frozen vegetables. Sales
of dehydrated products, including accelerated freeze dried foods, are also
increasing.
The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and
preserving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the
preparation of extracts and pastes. The labour force numbers 94,000. Output
of canned meat and meat products in 1968 rose to 128,000 tons, and the
quantity of bacon and ham cured increased to 216,000 tons. There has been a
rapid expansion of quick-frozen fish output, and some 14,000 tons wrere

produced in 1968; small quantities (5,900 tons in 1968) are also canned.
Exports of fish and fish preparations had a value of million in 1968 and
those of meat and meat products were worth -£7-7 million.
The industries producing beer, spirits, wines, cider and soft drinks have a
labour force of 157,000. Exports were valued at £196-9 million in 1968.
Exports of whisky (almost all of it Scotch whisky) reached the record level of
59-2 million proof gallons with a value of £176-6 million in 1968; over half
went to the United States (£93 million or 33-3 million proof gallons). Scotch
whisky was first distilled in the fifteenth century. It is blended from 20 or
more different types, some from malted barley and some from other grains.
Whisky requires several years to mature, and the 114 million proof gallons
of Scotch whisky produced in the 1968 distilling year will not be on sale for
some years. Stocks of whisky amount to more than 610 million proof gallons,
representing 10 years’ consumption. About four-fifths of annual sales are to
overseas buyers.
Production of gin in Britain has risen steadily since the early 1950s. The main
distillers are in London and one company accounts for a large proportion of
total output. Although the larger manufacturers also own distilleries abroad,
exports had a value of £9 million in 1968.
There are 97,000 employees in the brewing and malting industry. Recent
mergers have led to the creation of a few major brewery groups, marketing
their products throughout the country. In 1968 32 million bulk barrels of
beer were produced, the highest for some years, and consumers’ expenditure
on beer amounted to £957 million. Exports in 1968 of malt beer were 340,000
bulk barrels, worth £3-2 million. Firms are experimenting with new methods,
including continuous brewing processes, and automated batch production
plants are well established.
The main raw materials used in brewing are malt, hops and some sugar.
Malt is made almost entirely from home-grown barley. Some brewers make all
or part of their own malt, others purchase it from independent maltsters who
also supply distillers, vinegar brewers, and malt extract manufacturers. British
malt is used by brewers throughout the world, and exports in 1968 amounted
to 75,000 tons, worth £3-6 million.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade although
sales are liable to be affected by the weather. Output in 1968 included 60
million gallons of concentrated liquid, and 253 million gallons of unconcen¬
trated drinks. Though there has been some amalgamation in recent years,
there are still several hundred firms supplying regional markets. There are two
very large firms among about 20 producing widely advertised brands which
are marketed on a national scale. There is also some degree of specialisation by
firms in the production of various types, such as carbonated drinks, cola-based
drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters and ‘mixers’, and comminuted
drinks (in which the whole fruit is used).
The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and other
tobacco goods sold in Britain. In 1968 consumers’ expenditure on these
goods amounted to £1,585 million (of which about three-quarters was tax
revenue) and, in addition, exports worth £30 million (of which cigarettes
accounted for 88 per cent) were shipped to a large number of overseas
markets; Kuwait, Hong Kong and Southern Yemen were the most important.
The main centres of production are in and around Bristol, Liverpool, London,

Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Glasgow and Belfast. The two biggest
manufacturing groups account for over 90 per cent of total output. The
industry has 39,000 employees.
The tobacco industry used 308 million lb. of unmanufactured tobacco
in 1968 (8 per cent more than in 1967), all of which was imported. In 1968
the main sources were the United States, Canada and India. Total consump¬
tion of tobacco in Britain in 1968 amounted to 253-4 million lb., including
220-2 million lb. consumed in cigarettes, 28-6 million lb. in pipe and hand
rolling tobacco and 4-1 million lb. in cigars. In 1968, 121,800 million
cigarettes were consumed, 2,700 million more than in the previous year;
71 per cent of the total were tipped compared with 16 per cent in i960.
This group comprises the manufacture of bricks, fireclay, refractory goods,
pottery, glass, cement, abrasives, asbestos and other building materials. The
industries have a combined labour force of 347,400, which includes 66,000
in the bricks, fireclay and refractory goods trades, 77,000 in the glass industry
and 61,500 in the pottery industry.
Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking, one of Britain’s oldest industries, was introduced by
the Romans, and manufacturing methods vary from traditional hand fabri¬
cation to highly mechanised systems. In 1968 about 7,464 million building
bricks were produced in Great Britain, 45 per cent of which were of the
Fletton type, made mainly in the Bedford and Peterborough areas. Refractory
goods (firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks and chrome-magnesite bricks)
are manufactured mainly for home use. Exports of refractory construction
materials in 1968 were worth ^7-2 million.
The pottery industry is a long-established and complex industry, largely
located in the Stoke-on-Trent area of Staffordshire. Much of its raw material
is indigenous, such as china clay, ball clay and china stone from Devon and
Cornwall. It supplies nearly all home needs for domestic and industrial
pottery.
The largest section of the industry, about half, makes domestic pottery,
sub-divided into china, earthenware, stoneware, jet and Rockingham; the
other main divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical ware, and
such specialised industrial products as acid-proof stoneware, porous ceramics
and laboratory procelain are also manufactured. Among famous makes of
British pottery are Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton,
Minton, Coalport and Royal Crown Derby. Total sales of domestic pottery
were ^48-5 million in 1968 including export sales of £20-6 million, the highest
ever; the United States and Canada are important markets.
There has been considerable re-equipment; gas or electrically fired kilns
have replaced almost all the coal-fired kilns, and new decorating techniques
and automatic and semi-automatic machinery have been introduced.
Britain’s glass industry is the third largest in the world. The section of the
industry devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in their various
forms is organised for quantity production, much of it in the form of the
‘float’ glass process, which was developed in Britain and has been licensed
to glass makers throughout the world. Its use for internal decoration and as
a finish for internal and external walls has greatly increased in recent years.

Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor industry. Other
products include glass bricks, tubular glass (produced on a large scale),
mirrors, lamp and bulb glass, scientific and medical glassware, glass fibres,
and all types of glass containers (often made by fully automatic machinery).
A traditional product is hand-made lead crystal glassware of very high quality.
Direct exports of glass and glassware reached the record value of ^30-6
million in 1968. Those of glass were worth ^18-2 million, the most important
markets being the United States, South Africa, Australia and the Republic of
Ireland. The figures included ^4-7 million of float glass.
Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research
Association, and much research work is also carried out by the Department
of Glass Technology of Sheffield University.
The cement industry of the United Kingdom is chiefly concerned with the
manufacture of Portland cement. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented
in 1824, this material and the methods of its production have been the subject
of continuous technical improvement and intensive research. The capacity
of the industry, which has 19,000 employees, has expanded substantially.
The Dartford-Gravesend district of Kent is an important producing area.
Annual output totalled 17-6 million tons in 1968.
The paper, printing and publishing industries have 629,000 employees,
including 94,000 in the manufacture of paper and board, 62,000 in the pro¬
duction of cardboard boxes and packing cases, 144,000 in the publishing of
newspapers and periodicals, and 256,500 in other types of printing and
publishing.
The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until
1678, but records show that some paper was produced as far back as 1492.
The British paper and board industry is the largest in Europe. Total
production in 1968 of all types of paper and board amounted to 4-6 million
tons. Of this, newsprint accounted for 724,000 tons, board for 3-7 million
tons and other paper for the remainder. Exports of paper, board and
manufactured paper items were valued at ^66-3 million in 1968. The main
purchasers were the Republic of Ireland, Australia and South Africa.
Wood pulp is the main raw material, but large and increasing quantities
of waste paper are also used. A £20 million integrated pulp and paper mill,
the first in Britain, was opened at Fort William, in the Scottish Highlands,
in 1966. Two-thirds of the timber it uses is home-grown.
There are a few very large groups in the industry and many medium-sized
and small firms. The large groups hold considerable interests abroad, includ¬
ing pulp and paper producing mills in the United States, Canada and other
parts of the Commonwealth and Europe. Sales of household paper products,
including facial tissues, have risen sharply. Sales of cardboard boxes and
cartons were valued at 18-8 million in 1968, while those of fibre board pack¬
ing cases totalled £113-7 million. Sales of manufactured stationery totalled
£102-7 in 1968. Wallpaper manufacturing is dominated by one firm;
a recent development has been the introduction of plastic and plastic-coated
wall coverings. Research is undertaken by the Research Association for the
Paper and Board, Printing and Packaging Industries.
The printing industry produces an immense range of goods, from national
newspapers and periodicals to books, catalogues and greetings cards. The

industry includes many very small enterprises. Mergers in recent years have
led to the formation of large groups in the newspaper, magazine and book
publishing sections. Four large firms each employ more than 7,500 persons.
General printing, publishing, engraving and bookbinding remains essentially
an industry of small firms.
Publishers’ turnover in 1968 is estimated at £133 million, of which export
sales accounted for a record total of -£60 million, forming a higher proportion
of output than in any other country. Consumers’ expenditure on books, news¬
papers and magazines totalled almost £400 million in 1968. Book titles
published in 1968 totalled nearly 32,500, over 23,500 of them new ones.
Popularity of paper-backed books has increased rapidly in recent years.
According to the overseas trade returns, exports of printed matter, manu¬
scripts and typescripts were valued at £68-6 million in 1968, including books
(£35-5 million), and newspapers and periodicals (£11-5 million), but these
figures do not include parcel post shipments, which are possibly as large again
as the recorded totals. The United States and Australia are the most important
overseas markets. The Book Development Council was formed in 1965 to
promote the supply and use of British books overseas. Firms have introduced
the latest developments in high-speed printing equipment, including elec¬
tronic engraving machines and advanced processes of photographic repro¬
duction, and several newspapers are now set by computer.
Other manufacturing industries include the timber and furniture group, with
305,000 employees, rubber manufacture, with 129,000 employees, and a group
of miscellaneous manufactures which embrace some 209,000 employees,
including 96,000 employed in plastics moulding and fabricating.
Britain’s rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the world, dating
from 1819. Macintosh invented waterproof garments, and Dunlop in 1888
devised the pneumatic tyre. Tyres and tubes represent more than half the
output of the industry but firms also make a variety of other rubber manu¬
factures, the most important being rubber footwear, conveyor belting, cables,
hose, latex foam products, and other vehicle components and accessories.
The British industry is one of the largest in the world. In 1968 its consump¬
tion of rubber totalled 425,000 tons, comprising 183,000 tons of natural
rubber, 214,000 tons of synthetic rubber and 28,600 tons of reclaimed rubber;
the proportion of synthetic rubber used is increasing. In 1968, 128,000 tons
of rubber were used in the production of tyres and tyre products. Tyre
manufacturers include several subsidiaries of United States and other overseas
companies. Tyres and tubes exported were valued at ^33-4 million; this
figure excludes large indirect exports on vehicles. Direct exports of all rubber
manufactures (including tyres) in 1968 were worth £61-2 million, with
Sweden, Australia, Denmark and the United States as the main markets. In
addition, the industry exported about £4-3 million worth of rubber footwrear
and £i-y million of rubber gloves and other miscellaneous products.
London is the largest centre for furniture manufacturing, but High Wycombe,
in Buckinghamshire, is important for domestic furniture.
Deliveries of domestic furniture rose by 35 per cent in volume between 1958
and 1968, and in the latter year their value was j£i8i million. Exports of all
furniture were worth £iJ-8 million in 1968. There are numerous enterprises
manufacturing furniture in Britain (including domestic, upholstered, office,
school and other furniture) with a total labour force of 98,000. The bedding
K
280 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
industry employs 19,000 people; sales of new bedding in 1968 were valued at
^36-7 million. Many firms are small but in recent years there has been a
tendency towards concentration.
Scientific research and technical information services are provided by the
Furniture Development Council and the Furniture Industry Research
Association. The Council is concerned with the management problems of the
industry and produces an annual statistical and economic review.
The brush industry is located throughout Britain, and embraces highly
mechanised establishments as well as small craft unions. The value of sales in
1968 was ^21-7 million, of which ^3-1 million was for export.
The timber industry employs 108,000 people. Britain is mainly dependent
on imported supplies of timber (valued at ^231 million in 1968) but sawmill
output of home-grown timber together with the output of home-grown
pitwood totalled about 55 million cubic feet in 1968. Other products include
plywood and chipboard.
Toys, Games The number of people engaged in manufacturing toys and sports equipment
and Sports in Britain is 39,000. Sales of toys in 1968 were worth £66-8 million and exports
Equipment had a value of ^22-9 million. The United States and the Federal Republic of
Germany were the main overseas markets. Current trends are towards
increased production of small-scale precision models of vehicles and toys
linked to television characters.
The value of manufacturers’ sales of games was £5-8 million and that of
sports equipment £20-4 million, of which £g-6 million was for export.
FUEL AND POWER
The main primary sources of energy currently used in Britain are coal,
petroleum and, to a lesser extent, nuclear energy, natural gas and water power;
secondary sources produced from these are electricity, town gas and coke.
Coal, mined within the country, still represents slightly more than half
primary energy consumption, although the amount of coal used and its share
of the total energy market has been falling. Oil, on the other hand, virtually
all imported, has expanded rapidly, its share of total energy consumption
having risen from one-fifth in 1958 to over one-quarter in 1961, and to over
two-fifths in 1968. With nuclear power and North Sea natural gas making
an increasing impact over the coming years, Britain is moving over from two
fuels to four. A programme for nuclear power stations has been in progress for
nearly 15 years and nuclear power now provides a significant and increasing
share of electricity supplies although it still represents under 5 per cent

of total energy requirements. The share of natural gas, until recently only
imported in liquefied form, is even smaller, but it is expanding more rapidly
from supplies from the North Sea discoveries. Water-power resources
are very small and cannot be developed much further. Trends in primary
energy consumption are shown in Table 18 and in the diagram below.
The fuel and power industries, with the exception of petroleum, are under
public ownership. General responsibility for the effective and co-ordinated
development of fuel and power resources lies with the Minister of Power.
Research is undertaken by the fuel and fuel-using industries. The Minister
of Power also has an Advisory Council on Research and Development.
The fuel and power industries in Britain employ in total about 770,000
people, or 3^ per cent of the working population; their capital investment in
1969-70 will be in the region of ^850 million, about one-sixth of total invest¬
ment; their annual turnover is about £2,850 million; and the value of their
net output is about 5 per cent of the national product. The nationalised
industry boards’ investment is financed through internal resources and

borrowing from the Government (long term), the clearing banks (short term),
and, in the case of gas and electricity, from overseas (long term) sources.
The responsible ministers—the Minister of Power in England and Wales
and for Scottish electricity the Secretary of State for Scotland—are required
by statute to set up consultative councils for each of the nationalised fuel
industries to protect the interests of consumers. National Industrial and
Domestic Coal Consumers’ Councils were set up in 1947 and Area Electricity
and Gas Consultative Councils (supported by district committees) were set up
in 1948 and 1949 respectively. Each consists of a chairman and from 20 to 30
unpaid members appointed from nominations put forward by interested
bodies, mainly local authorities.
COAIj Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coal¬
mining industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years
longer than in any other country. British coal exports dominated the world
market until about 1910. By 1913—the peak production year—the industry
was producing 287 million tons of coal, exporting 94 million tons and
employing over a million workers.
In 1947 the coal mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal
Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board as
a statutory corporation to manage the industry.
The National The National Coal Board (NCB) consists of a chairman and between eight
Coal Board and eleven members appointed by the Minister of Power. The NCB has an
almost complete monopoly to extract coal in Great Britain, and is also
empowered to license private operators to work small pits and open-cast sites.
It has no monopoly in distribution, and retail sales remain largely in private
hands, but it has, however, some retail depots and makes bulk sales to large
industrial consumers.
The NCB is responsible for the day-to-day running and the commercial
management of the industry, but is answerable to the minister (and through
him, to Parliament) for its efficiency. The minister has power to issue
directives on matters affecting the public interest, and to authorise borrowings
to finance capital investment.
The 317 collieries in operation at the end of March 1969 were grouped into
17 areas, each controlled by a director who is responsible to the national
board. A typical area produces nearly 10 million tons of coal a year, employs
up to 20,000 men and has a turnover of about ^55 million.
Pattern and
Trends in
Supply and
Demand
Coal consumption in Britain increased by an average annual rate of nearly
4 million tons between 1947 and 1956; sales fell sharply, however, between
1956 and 1959 and large stocks of coal accumulated at pit heads. Growing
competition from oil, increasing efficiency in the use of coal and reduced
requirements of the gas, steel, railway transport, and other industries contri¬
buted to the fall in demand. Undistributed stocks at the end of 1968 were
28-1 million tons. The fall in consumption is shown in Table 17.
Over two-fifths of total output is consumed by the electricity authorities
and over one-quarter by domestic and industrial users together. Coke ovens
and the gas industry are other large users. Consumption by the electricity
industry has increased by 33 per cent since 1961 to 73 million tons in 1968,
whereas the requirements of all the other main classes of consumer have
declined. In the case of domestic users this fall has been slightly offset by
increased purchases of solid smokeless fuels.

Coal exports have declined for somewhat similar reasons and now average
about 3 million tons a year. The peak post-war figure was 19 million tons in
1949. The principal markets are in Western Europe and the Republic of
Ireland.
The fact that the British industry was developed so early has meant that many
of the best seams of coal are now worked out. There are, however, abundant
reserves of coal with which production can be maintained well into the next
century; there is also scope for opening new collieries should these be
required.
The main coal-bearing areas are: (1) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and
Nottinghamshire field, which produces about 48 per cent of the total output,
(2) the Durham and Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and
(4) the Scottish field. Other important coal-bearing areas are those of
Lancashire and the west Midlands (Staffordshire and Warwickshire).

b Estimate.
According to forecasts by the Ministry of Power, the fall in coal consump¬
tion shown in Table 18 is likely to continue, but the Government is taking
measures to support consumption with the aim of holding the demand for
coal at around 120 million tons by 1975. The NCB plans to improve the
competitive position of coal by restricting production to the most efficient
pits (27 of which each produced over a million tons of coal in 1968-69) and
the most efficient faces. Most faces are highly mechanised and are worked
increasingly on a multi-shift basis. Productivity has risen by nearly one-half
since 1961. In 1968 output per manshift at NCB mines rose to nearly 2-1 tons,
with 51,000 fewer workers. At mechanised faces output averages 7-5 tons per
shift as compared with 4-1 tons at non-mechanised faces, the average for all
faces being 6-5 tons. Among measures contributing to higher productivity
are new techniques for obtaining information about the reserves before they
are worked, intensive training of management and men to obtain the maximum
utilisation of equipment on highly mechanised faces, the increasing use of
powered supports, the use of higher horse-power machines and improvements
in the mechanised handling of coal below ground and on the surface.

The NCB raises capital, including working capital, by borrowing from the
Exchequer. At present there is a statutory limit of £900 million on such
borrowing. Within its limit the Board may, with the permission of the
Minister of Power, borrow temporarily (by way of overdraft or otherwise).
The greater proportion of investment, however, is financed from internal
resources.
Capital expenditure by the industry totalled ^462 million from 1947 to
1955 and about £79° million in the nine years 1956 to end-March 1964. At
the end of the 1964-65 financial year the total capital debt to the Exchequer
amounted to about £960 million. In 1965 legislation was enacted to effect a
capital reconstruction involving the writing off of ^415 million of the existing
debt. As a result, the total debt to the Exchequer at the end of March 1969
amounted to £698 million.
Under the nationalisation statute, the NCB has been required to break even
on its current account (taking one year with another) after meeting all proper
charges including provision for reserves. It has made surpluses in some years
and deficits in others. In certain areas, such as Scotland, Lancashire and Wales,
deficits have been persistent, and profits from the areas of high productivity,
for instance, the Midlands, have been inadequate to cover the losses sustained.
By March 1966 the accumulated deficit on the current account had reached
£115-6 million; this was included in the £415 million written off. Interest
payments and depreciation provisions have been reduced as a result. In the
year ending March 1969 the NCB made an operating profit of £28-6 million,
and after payment of interest there was a deficit of £8-9 million.
To assist the redeployment of manpower and the elimination of uneconomic
colliery capacity, the Coal Industry Acts 1965 and 1967 authorise the Ministry
of Power to make grants equal to two-thirds of relevant expenditure up to a
maximum aggregate amount of ^45 million over the four years to 1971.
The NCB has two research organisations: a Coal Research Establishment,
at Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, providing facilities for
fundamental research; and a Mining Research and Development Establish¬
ment, near Bretby, Derbyshire, for the investigation of underground problems,
developing new machines and testing equipment. In 1959 the Board set up a
department concerned primarily with the further development of new
processes for making smokeless fuels.
Research associations receiving grants from the NCB and the Ministry of
Technology include the British Coal Utilisation Research Association, the
British Coke Research Association and the Coal Tar Research Association.
Much of the work of other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research
Establishment (SMRE), is closely related to the Board’s problems; the
SMRE carries out research on explosions and fires, pneumoconiosis, engineer¬
ing and metallurgy.
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young,
a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish
shale deposits, yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858 and ceased
production in 1962.
Sources of crude oil within Britain meet only 1 ton in every 1,000 of total
United Kingdom requirements, the remainder being imported from overseas.
Annual production of crude oil from indigenous oilfields now totals about

80,000 tons. Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the establish¬
ment of several small oilfields, notably in Nottinghamshire (Egmanton and
Bothamsell), in Leicestershire (Plungar), in Lincolnshire (Gainsborough)
and in Dorset (Kimmeridge). A substantial field of natural gas was also located
in 1966 in north Yorkshire, near Scarborough.
Seismic prospecting in the North Sea has been going on since 1962. Under
the Continental Shelf Act 1964, the Minister of Power, by a system of licensing
for exploration and production, controls those activities in the areas over the
shelf appertaining to the United Kingdom. Britain’s share of the North Sea
shelf amounts to about 100,000 square miles. Licences covering about 41,000
square miles were issued in 1964 and 1965 (one being in the Irish Sea).
Drilling, which started in 1964, has proved the existence of four major fields
of natural gas capable of commercial production, two of which (West Sole
and Leman Bank) are delivering to the Gas Council. In 1968 production from
these two fields averaged just under 200 million cubic feet per day.
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the
Middle East, Far East, Africa and Caribbean areas.
Today these companies produce more than one-third of all oil entering into
international trade, with a tanker fleet (partly owned by them and partly on
charter) amounting to nearly a quarter of the world’s tanker tonnage. (United
Kingdom registered tanker tonnage is about 12 per cent of the world’s total.)
In 1968 the United Kingdom imported 81-7 million tons of crude oil valued
at ^627 million, the largest single item among imported products.
Libya (26-4 per cent) replaced Kuwait as the largest supplier. Other major
suppliers were Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption in 1968 totalled
82-8 million tons, having almost doubled since i960. Fuel oil consumption
in 1968 constituted 30-6 per cent of the total. Demand for gas and diesel oils
(excluding those used in road vehicles) rose by a further 1 million tons to
9 million tons in 1968. Sales of motor spirit have expanded by an annual
average of 6-7 per cent since i960 and totalled 12-8 million tons in 1968.
The most important uses of gas and diesel oils in 1968 were for non¬
industrial central heating, agricultural tractors and the railways. Electricity
generation accounted for about 21 per cent of total fuel oil consumption,
excluding that used in oil refineries; the steel industry accounted for 15 per
cent; and non-industrial central heating for a further 12-5 per cent. Of the
remainder, the largest users were the cement, paper-making, general chemical,
glass, engineering, brickmaking and textile industries.
Before 1939 three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum
products was refined overseas, as it was considered more economical to
refine at the source of production. Since the second world war the industry
has favoured the siting of refineries in the consuming areas.
At the end of 1968 rated refinery capacity in Britain amounted to 97-4 million
tons a year. Of the 22 refineries in operation, seven have a capacity of under
0-5 million tons. The eight largest are situated at Fawley, near Southampton
(16-5 million tons); Stanlow, in Cheshire (10-5 million tons); Isle of Grain
(10 million tons) and Shellhaven (10 million tons), both on the Thames
Estuary; Teesport, Yorkshire (6 million tons); two at Milford Haven in
Pembrokeshire (6-3 million tons and 5-9 million tons); and at Llandarcy near

Swansea (8 million tons). Other important refineries are located at Belfast,
Grangemouth, Billingham (Teesside), Killingholme, Heysham (Lancs) and
Coryton (Essex). A project on Humberside is nearing completion, thus
bringing the number of important refining areas to seven. Britain’s total
capacity in mid-1969 stood at nearly 100 million tons a year.
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) has
risen steadily; from 4 million tons in 1948 to 25^ million tons in 1954,
40 million tons in i960 and the peak total of 76 million tons in 1968. There is a
substantial external trade in refined products which tends to follow trading
and seasonal requirements and the commercial arrangements of the major oil
companies. Exports from Britain, mainly in the form of heavier products
to European countries, were valued at £149 million in 1968; imports of
refined products (including liquefied gases) amounted to £275 million.
Three main crude oil pipelines are in operation in Britain between harbours
capable of berthing very large tankers and refineries: in west Scotland, from
Finnart to Grangemouth: in South Wales, from Angle Bay, Milford Haven,
to Llandarcy; and in north-west England, from Tranmere to Heysham.
Pipelines carry refined products from refineries to major marketing areas; for
example, from Stanlow to the Manchester area, from Fawley to Staines and
Heathrow Airport, and from the Isle of Grain to Walton-on-Thames and
Heathrow Airport. A 245-mile pipeline, opened in 1969, feeds refined products
to north London and the Midlands from refineries and installations on the
Thames and Mersey; a similar line is planned from Milford Haven to the
Midlands and Manchester. Pipelines carrying petrochemical feedstocks run
from Stanlow to Carrington, near Manchester, from Fawley to Severnside,
near Bristol, and from Teesside to Fleetwood and Runcorn. The Pipelines
Act 1962 is designed to secure the orderly development of privately owned
industrial pipelines.
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(the British Petroleum Company), Thornton, in Cheshire, and Woodstock,
in Kent (Shell), and Abingdon, in Berkshire (Esso). The first of these covers
the full range of petroleum research and development, from geology and
production to product utilisation and petroleum chemicals. In general, the
remainder are concerned with the evolution of new and improved fuels and
lubricants and the development of new uses for petroleum products and of
new products based on petroleum, especially chemicals.
A public supply of electricity was first provided in Britain in 1881, at
Godaiming, Surrey. From its earliest days a measure of public control has
been a feature of the industry. In 1919 the Electricity Commissioners were
created as a supervisory body and to promote reorganisation on a national
scale through voluntary agreement. In 1926 the Central Electricity Board
was set up to construct and operate a national grid inter-connecting individual
power stations, thus co-ordinating generation and transmission. In 1943 the
North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB) was established as a
public corporation to develop the water-power resources of the Highlands.
In 1948 all municipal and private undertakings (other than those in Northern
Ireland) were acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the
British Electricity Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of

Scotland where they became the responsibility of the NSHEB. Two subse¬
quent Acts (1954 and 1957) effected a measure of decentralisation and gave the
industry its present structure. Electricity supply employs about 230,000
people, including 5,700 in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales, electricity is generated and transmitted by the Central
Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and distributed by 12 separate Area
Electricity Boards; co-ordination is effected by the Electricity Council. In
Scotland, two boards—the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB)—both generate and distribute electricity. In Northern Ireland,
the Belfast Corporation and the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland
generate and distribute electricity, and the Londonderry Corporation
distributes only.
The Electricity Council is the central body of the supply industry with a
general responsibility for promoting electricity supply and for advising the
Minister of Power; it is also responsible for a number of common services,
principally capital financing, research and industrial relations. The Council
consists of a chairman, two deputy chairmen, the chairman and two designated
members of the CEGB, the chairmen of the 12 Area Electricity Boards and
not more than three other members. The CEGB controls the operation and
maintenance of power stations and the main transmission system (the national
grid) and supplies electricity in bulk to the 12 Area Boards. The CEGB
consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and between six and eight members.
Each of the 12 Area Electricity Boards acquires bulk supplies of electricity
from the CEGB and is responsible for distribution networks and sales of
electricity to its area consumers.
Area Consultative Councils were set up under the Electricity Act 1947 in
the area of each Board to represent the interests of consumers; their chairmen
are ex officio members of their respective Area Boards. The Minister of Power
appoints the chairmen, deputy chairmen and members of the Electricity
Council, the CEGB, the Area Boards and the Consultative Councils; approves
each Board’s capital development programmes and the industry’s research
programme; and approves, in consultation with the Treasury, the industry’s
borrowing requirements. The Electricity Act 1957 requires each Board, and
not merely the industry as a whole, to pay its way taking one year with
another.
The boundary separating the areas covered by the two Scottish Boards runs
roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth of
Tay. Members of both Boards and of the respective consumer consultative
councils are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland; each Board
comprises a chairman and between four and eight members, one of whom is the
chairman of the other Board. The Secretary of State’s responsibilities in
relation to the Boards are similar to those of the Minister of Powrer.
In Northern Ireland electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast and
at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh. Those in Belfast are operated by the city
corporation and the remainder by the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland.
Generation is co-ordinated by the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity
Authority, set up by statute in 1967. The output of the stations has, since
1948, been purchased in bulk and re-sold to distributors—the Belfast
Corporation for Belfast and district, the Londonderry Corporation for the
City of Londonderry, and the Electricity Board for the rest of Northern
Ireland.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
As Britain has abundant supplies of coal, together with good rail and water
transport for moving it, most of its electricity is produced by coal-fired steam
generating stations. Hydro-electric development on any scale is comparatively
recent, water-power resources being relatively small and in remote areas.
Since 1965* nuclear energy has become increasingly important.
The output capacity of the generating stations of the electricity boards in
Great Britain at the end of 1968 totalled 50,060 megawatts (MW), an increase
of one-third since 1963.
In the years 1963 to 1968 an annual average of over 2,700 MW of
generating capacity was installed, including 3,800 MW in 1967 and 4,000 MW
in 1968. About 13,270 MW of capacity will come into operation in England
and Wales in the period 1969-72 inclusive. The SSEB’s plans provide for
its total capacity of 3,837 MW at the end of 1968 to be increased to c,6oo MW
by 1970.
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where, of the total installed
generating capacity of 1,020 MW, 480 MW is in oil-fired and the remainder in
coal-fired thermal stations) amounted to 3,077 million kilowatt-hours in 1968.
Generation by the public supply in Great Britain exceeded 200,000 million
kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 1968; conventional steam power stations provided
86 per cent of the total and hydro-electric and nuclear stations about 2 per
cent and 12 per cent respectively. The high rate of expansion of output,
which has been a feature of the industry since its earliest years, has not been
maintained during the past four years, although the total of electricity
generated in 1968 was still nearly 60 per cent higher than in 1961.
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively
small under 20,000 million kWh in 1968. The major sources outside the
fuel industries themselves are the chemical, iron and steel and paper industries
and the nuclear power plants of the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA).
An analysis of electricity generation in Great Britain is given in Table 20.

Oil-fired stations of 2,000 MW are under construction at Fawley, on
Southampton Water, and at Pembroke, South Wales. A dual-fired station of
the same size, to burn either coal or oil, is being built at Kingsnorth, Kent.
They are mainly situated on river estuaries and thus able to be fed con¬
veniently from oil refineries.
The electricity authorities are the largest consumers of primary fuel in
Britain, and although most of their electricity generation is based on coal, oil

consumption rose from a negligible quantity in 1955 to 7-3 million tons in
1967; consumption in 1968 was 5-7 million tons. Average thermal efficiency
(that is, the ratio of the electrical energy output to the heat energy input of the
fuel consumed) of conventional steam stations in England and Wales rose from
20'75 Per cent in I947to 27'99 Per cent in 1968 as new plant was brought into
use. The 20 most efficient stations, containing much of the newest plant, had
an average efficiency of 33-04 per cent in 1968.
Striking advances have been made in the design of steam-generating plant.
A cross-compound generating unit with an output capacity of 550 MW came
into operation in 1963 at Thorpe Marsh, near Doncaster. Forty-seven single¬
shaft units of 500 MW are being installed in 13 stations. The first came
into operation at the Ferrybridge ‘C’ station, Yorks, in 1966. Others were
completed during 1967 and 1968 at West Burton (near Retford, Notts), Egg-
borough (Selby, Yorks), Ratcliffe-on-Soar and Cottam (Notts) and Aber-
thaw ‘B’ (Glam). In 1968 Ferrybridge ‘C’ became the first of the 2,000 MW
stations to supply electricity from all four of its generating sets. Station
capacities are also increasing. By 1971, ten stations, each with capacities of
2,000 MW, with four 500 MW single-shaft generating units, will be in service.
Three larger generating units, of 660 MW, will be installed at Drax (Yorks),
which may have a final capacity of nearly 4,000 MW. (For locations see map,
inside back cover.) In Scotland, a 1,200 MW station at Cockenzie was com¬
missioned in 1968 and one of 2,400 MW (four generating units of 600 MW)
is under construction at Longannet.
Large gas turbine units of 55 MW and 70 MW, based on aerojet engines,
have been introduced since 1965 for peak load operation. The CEGB and
SSEB have installed 919 MW of such units. Smaller gas turbines have been
introduced at new stations to safeguard the auxiliary supplies to the large new
steam units, and also to provide capacity for peak operation. Auxiliary units
of this kind in service at the end of 1968 totalled 662 MW, and by 1972 will
exceed 1,100 MW.
Hydro-electric generation is confined to Scotland and Wales, and most of the
water-power so utilised is drawn from high-level reservoirs with their own
natural catchment areas. The setting up of the NSHEB in 1943 marked the
beginning of an era of intensive water-power development in the Highlands.
In 1968-69, 2,248 million units were sent out by the NSHEB from water¬
power, compared with 322 million in 1949. At the end of March 1969 there
were 50 main hydro-electric conventional stations in operation in the north
of Scotland with a total installed capacity of 1,047 MW and the largest—the
Loch Sloy station—has a capacity of 130 MW. The Cruachan pumped
storage section of the Awe scheme, with an installed capacity of 400 MW
from four reversible-pump-turbines, came into full operation at the end of
1967. In February 1969 plans were approved for a 300 MW pumped-storage
project at Foyers, Loch Ness. It will have two 150 MW reversible-pump-
turbines and is planned for completion in 1974. In addition, there are stations
generating electricity by water-power in the south of Scotland (122 MW)
and in Wales (472 MW). The latter includes the 360 MW pumped-storage
station at Ffestiniog, which was completed in 1963. (In pumped-storage
schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to pump water to
higher levels from which it descends at peak periods to operate turbo¬
generators.)
Some 12 per cent of Britain’s public supply generation was in nuclear power
stations in 1968 and the proportion is expected to rise to about 25 per cent by
290
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the mid-1970s. Britain has so far produced more electricity by this means
than the rest of the world put together.
The AEA itself has five main stations which produce electricity for the
national grid: Calder Hall, in Cumberland (198 MW electrical output);
Chapelcross, Dumfriesshire (191 MW); the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor
(AGR) at Windscale, Cumberland (34 MW); the experimental fast breeder
station at Dounreay, Caithness (14 MW); and the Steam Generating Heavy
Water Moderated Reactor (SGHWR) at Winfrith, Dorset (100 MW).
Others are owned and operated by the electricity authorities. Under the
first commercial programme, originally announced in 1955 but since twice
modified, eight stations with a total installed capacity of over 3,600 MW were
in operation in 1968: Berkeley, in Gloucestershire (276 MW output
capacity), and Bradwell, in Essex (300 MW), were both commissioned in
1962; Hunterston ‘A’, in Scotland (300 MW), in 1964; and in the following
year Hinkley Point ‘A’, in Somerset, Trawsfyndd, in Wales (both 500 MW),
and Dungeness ‘A’, in Kent (550 MW); Sizewell, in Suffolk (580 MW),
was commissioned in 1966; and Oldbury, in Gloucestershire (600 MW) in
1968. A ninth station, Wylfa, in Anglesey (1,180 MW), is due to be com¬
missioned in 1970. These stations, like Calder Hall and Chapelcross, are all
magnox stations—graphite-moderated, carbon-dioxide cooled, using natural
uranium metal fuel elements canned in magnesium.
Under a second programme announced in 1964 and extended in 1965, a
further 8,000 MW of nuclear capacity is planned by about 1975. The first
station in this programme, Dungeness ‘B’, due to begin operating in 1972, is
based on the AGR at Windscale, which uses slightly enriched uranium
dioxide fuel canned in stainless steel, a logical development of the magnox
system. When in full operation with a net electrical output of 1,200 MW, it
will be the most powerful in the world. Three further stations, Hinkley
Point ‘B’, Hunterston ‘B’ and Hartlepool are under construction, and will
come into service in 1972, 1973 and 1974 respectively. They will be the first
in Britain to produce electricity more cheaply on base load than the best
contemporary coal stations.
A large prototype fast reactor (PER) of 250 MW capacity is being built
at Dounreay where in October 1962 the experimental fast reactor became the
first of such type to produce electricity for public use and to operate at a high
power level. It is due for completion in 1971.
Transmission
and
Distribution
Main electricity transmission lines—the national grid—supply most of the
country. By 31st March 1968 those of the CEGB totalled 17,879 circuit miles,
of which 4,747 miles were 400,000 volt, 2,208 miles 275,000 volt, 10,383 miles
132,000 volt and the remainder were 66,000 volt and below. In Scotland there
were some 4,400 circuit miles of main transmission lines at the end of March
1968, of which 1,350 circuit miles operated at 275,000 volts and the remainder
at 132,000 volts. Energy movements on the grid in England and Wales are
controlled through the seven operational areas, set up for that purpose and
distinct from the regions in which the generating side of the industry is
organised; each area has a separate control, and the operations are
co-ordinated by a National Control in London. The grid in Scotland is
operated from the control centres at Pitlochry (NSHEB) and at Kirkintilloch
(SSEB).
To reduce the number of new transmission lines needed to meet the
country’s increasing power demands, most of the new ‘supergrid’ of main
transmission lines now operating at 275,000 volts are, since 1965, being

uprated to operate at 400,000 volts. The development of the grid system has
made the British system the largest integrated power network in the world.
Twin cross-Channel cables laid between Dungeness and Boulogne, capable
of transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current), have been
in operation since 1961; by this means advantage is taken of the differences
between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads.
A direct current transmission link to reinforce supplies in the London area
is being installed; due for completion in 1970, the scheme—the first of its
kind in the world—will have a capacity of 640 MW.
In England and Wales the Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers
electricity acquired mainly from the CEGB, supplemented from other
sources, such as industrial plants and the nuclear power stations of the AEA.
There are over 17-8 million consumers. Industrial concerns are the biggest
users of electricity. The principal domestic uses of electricity are for lighting,
cooking and for space and water heating, but the demand for numerous other
domestic purposes is rising steadily.
The NSHEB has about 455,000 consumers, many in remote areas. The
SSEB supplies about 1-5 million consumers.
About 9 per cent of the annual gross fixed capital formation of the United
Kingdom in 1968 was attributable to the electricity supply industry. The
industry’s plans for new capital investment are based on a growth in demand
estimated at an annual average rate of some 5 -8 per cent up to 1974—75.
Capital expenditure of the electricity supply industry has been expanding
very rapidly: from £249 million in 1956 it rose to £364 million in 1961 and
about £570 million in 1968-69, although a temporary downturn is expected
over the next few years. More than two-fifths of the industry’s capital require¬
ments have been financed from internal resources. The statutory limit to
borrowings by the industry in Great Britain is Is,200 million. The Gas and
Electricity Act 1968 empowered the industry to borrow (long term) from
overseas sources.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Minister of Power, is
responsible for drawing up a general programme of research, comprising:
direct research carried out by the Electricity Boards themselves, supported
by co-operative research with selected industrial research associations and by
research contracts placed with universities and other organisations. The
Council itself is empowered to conduct research. It is advised by the Elec¬
tricity Supply Research Council. Collaboration on research between the
supply industry and the plant manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power
Engineering Research Steering Committee set up in 1966.
The main research establishments of the industry are run by the CEGB and
comprise the Central Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead,
Surrey, the Berkeley Laboratories in Gloucestershire, concerned with
nuclear problems, and the Engineering Laboratories at Marchwood, on
Southampton Water. In 1965 the Electricity Council established a research
centre at Capenhurst, Cheshire, at which intensive research is being under¬
taken on distribution problems (to supplement the work undertaken at the
Central Electricity Research Laboratories) and on appliances and methods of
electricity utilisation.
Both Scottish electricity boards carry out research and experimental work
either on their own or in co-operation with other electricity authorities. The
NSHEB undertakes a wide range of research and development work, both

independently and in conjunction with the universities and manufacturers.
The SSEB has recently extended its own research activities and, with the
NSHEB, is associated with those of the Electricity Council and CEGB.
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London,
was first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light
and Coke Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London.
In the early years of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting,
provided by a growing number of company and municipal undertakings.
The gas industry in its present form developed in the main during the
period between the two world wars when increasing competition from
electricity had to be met, and by 1939 the industry had become mainly a
supplier of heating rather than lighting.
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain, in which about
123,000 persons are at present employed, under public ownership and control
on 1st May 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269 belonged to
local authorities, were vested in 12 Area Gas Boards. The central body is
the Gas Council, appointed by the Minister of Power. It is both a co¬
ordinating council and, since the enactment of the Gas Act 1965, a trading
body. It consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman, the 12 chair¬
men of the area boards and up to five other members. Its general duties are to
advise the Minister on questions affecting the industry and promote the
efficient performance of their duties by the area boards. It also has specific
duties relating to finance, labour relations and research.
The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and opera¬
tional responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies
of the other publicly owned corporations, are responsible for the local
manufacture of gas and its distribution to consumers. Each of the Area Gas
Boards, appointed by the Minister of Power, consists of a full-time chairman
and deputy chairman, in some cases one or more full-time members, and
usually five or six part-time members, including the chairman of the Area
Consultative Council. There is no common pattern of organisation; each
board is fully independent and has devised its own subordinate structure.
Each is required to pay its way, taking one year with another. The operations
of the area boards have resulted, in the 20 years up to 31st March 1969, in an
aggregate disposable surplus of approximately £80 million before taxation.
In Northern Ireland the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a
number of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
The chief method of gas production in Britain used to be by carbonising coal
but oil-based production is now the main method. More than 40 per cent of
total gas available in 1968 was derived from oil, and 5-4 million tons were
used. The gas industry used only about 11 million tons of coal. Gas made
from coal accounted for less than 13 per cent of all gas available during the
year.
About one-third of the output of gas from coke ovens is sold to gas under¬
takings for general distribution; the remainder is mainly consumed at the
ovens or at steelworks. There are about 13 million consumers, the total having
shown no significant change since 1955. Manufactured gas and gas acquired
from coke ovens and other sources for distribution is about 4,500 million
therms1 annually.

INDUSTRY 293
In 1968 the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was about
3 -4 million therms, most of it for household use.
Three-fifths of all gas sold by gas boards is for household use and the remainder
for industrial and commercial purposes. Total consumption has been rising
steadily since 1961, after a period when growth was almost negligible. For
the last two years consumption has risen by about 10 per cent. Sales reached
a level of over 5,000 million therms in 1968.
About 40 per cent of the domestic load is used for cooking and space heating
and water heating account for the largest part of the remainder. Most homes
in Britain are supplied with gas, except in some rural areas where, owing to
difficulties in storage and transmission, mains gas is not economic, and bottled
gas, derived from petroleum, is widely used.
Gas is used extensively in industries which require the control of temperatures
to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the pottery industry and in
certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products. In 1968-69
sales of gas to industry totalled 976 million therms.
Production of coke at gas works in 1967-68 was 5-8 million tons (a fall of
one-fifth in two years) and at coke ovens 16-3 million tons, reflecting the
increasing use of oil and natural gas. The gas industry and coke ovens jointly
produce about 2 million tons of crude coal tar and about 80 million gallons of
crude benzole a year. These latter by-products yield materials widely employed
in the newer branches of the chemical industry.
Under the Gas Act 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas
Boards was limited to £250 million. In 1954 the industry’s borrowing powers
were increased to ^450 million, in i960 to £525 million, in 1963 to £650
million, in 1965 to ,£1,200 million and in 1968 to an interim limit of ,£1,600
million with provision for a further increase to ,£2,400 million. The Gas and
Electricity Act 1968 empowered the industry to borrow from overseas (long
term) sources.
The industry had been spending about ,£50 million a year on capital
investment in the period 1955 to 1961 but since 1961-62 expenditure has
increased sharply; in 1968-69 it reached ,£225 million and £234 million is
planned for 1969-70. Between vesting day (1st May 1949) and the end of
March 1969 about ,£1,700 million had been invested in fixed assets.
Considerable integration, by the linking of works for the transmission of gas
through gas grids and long-distance mains, has enabled production to be
concentrated in the most efficient units.
To maintain its competitive position, the gas industry has investigated
new and more economic methods of production and new sources of gas
supply. There have been significant developments in the gasification of oil.
The introduction of processes using light distillates in large units producing
gas at high pressure has permitted savings in both capital and running
costs.
Much of the gas industry’s current research and development effort is
concentrated on transforming the industry from one based on town gas
manufactured from coal or oil to one based almost entirely on indigenous
natural gas. The Gas Council has stated that it is switching over entirely to
natural gas within the next ten years.
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A phased programme of converting the 30 million gas appliances in Britain
is in progress. Investigations are being made into projects involving various
methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions. Further
storage facilities for natural gas are under construction at Ambergate,
Derbyshire, and near Coatbridge, Scotland.
Since 1964 deliveries of natural gas from the Sahara have been made in liquid
form to Britain. A pipeline system distributes the gas from a terminal on
Canvey Island to 8 of the 12 Area Gas Boards.
The first productive well in the North Sea was discovered in 1965. Four
major gasfields have now been located as well as a number of smaller struc¬
tures. The Ministry of Power has estimated that production could exceed
3,000 million cubic feet per day by 1975.
The first pipeline to pump natural gas to the shore, at Easington in
Yorkshire, was put on flow early in 1967. The second pipeline, which comes
ashore at Bacton in Norfolk, came on flow in August 1968.
The Gas Council expects gas consumption to increase by some 12 per
cent a year up to 1972 and therefore substantial expansion is required. The
need to provide additional storage capacity, and the strengthening of the
distribution system will also give rise to substantial investment.
The Gas Council has a research committee which advises on research policy
at the four research centres. The engineering research station at Killingworth,
Northumberland, has concentrated on distribution problems. Research is
also carried out on behalf of the Gas Council at a number of universities and
colleges.
Efficiency in the use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, has
been assisted by various bodies representing producers and consumers and
by the technical advisory services of the fuel and power industries.
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National
Coal Board, solid fuel distributors and appliance manufacturers and distri¬
butors. Originally formed in 1932, it informs and advises domestic users
on the best use of solid fuel, including the choice of installation and the
operation of solid fuel appliances.
A non-profit-making company, the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency
Service, was formed in 1954 and sponsored by the fuel and power industries
to promote fuel saving in industry. In addition to consultancy work, it provides
advice and services to all non-domestic fuel users in a variety of forms, from
‘spot’ inspection to full-scale surveys and regular visits on a contract basis.
Sponsoring by the fuel and power industries ceased on 1st April 1969 but the
Government is providing a measure of financial support until April 1972,
when it is hoped that the service will have become fully self-supporting.
WATER SUPPLY
Britain’s water resources are, with progressive development, sufficient for
domestic and industrial requirements. The sources of water are often distant
from the areas where supplies are needed, however, and water undertakings
are therefore mainly concerned with abstraction, storage, treatment and
distribution. Supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as
mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds and river
intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits and
England and
Wales

industry 295
boreholes. Unlike other public services in Great Britain, such as electricity and
gas, water supply remains in the hands of a large number of undertakings.
Ministerial responsibility in England and Wales is shared by the Minister of
Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Wales; in
Scotland it lies with the Secretary of State for Scotland; and in Northern
Ireland with the Minister of Development.
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies
became a general public service, largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick
and his colleagues who demonstrated the dangers arising from inadequate
water supply and sanitation. The Public Health Act 1848 laid the basis for
a long series of statutes dealing with public health. From the middle of the
nineteenth century onwards a number of water undertakings were set up
to provide water to the expanding urban population, and the water supply
system developed rapidly, although in piecemeal fashion and with some
overlapping and waste.
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water
supplies are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this
either by operating water undertakings themselves or by ensuring that other
bodies are providing adequate supplies. Over one-fifth of the water consumed
is supplied by statutory water companies. The householder receives his
domestic water supply at a comparatively small charge, varying in different
areas, which he usually pays by way of a water rate levied, like other rates,
on the value of his house. Industrial users are charged in most cases according
to actual metered consumption.
The Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of
State for Wales have a duty to promote the conservation and proper use of
water supplies in England and Wales and are advised by the Central Advisory
Water Committee on general questions relating to water and organisation of
supplies. Since the passing of the Water Act 1945, over 800 smaller water
authorities in England and Wales have been absorbed by larger authorities or
by the creation of joint boards in order to improve the efficiency of the water
supply industry. There are now some 234 statutory water undertakings of
which about two-fifths are local authorities. A number of private proprietors
without statutory powers also provide small supplies.
The largest undertaking in Britain is the Metropolitan Water Board, which
supplies over 360 million gallons daily to 6£ million people in the London
area. It consists of 39 part-time members who are the elected representatives
of the various local authorities within the Board’s area of operations, together
with one representative each from the Thames and Lee Conservancies.
Public water supplies in England and Wales—reaching over 99 per cent of
the total population—now total some 2,696 million gallons a day, out of a total
estimated abstraction of 5,000 million gallons a day (excluding water used for
cooling in connection with electricity generation). Capital expenditure by
water undertakings, which averaged about ^58 million a year in the period
1961-65, has risen to over ^75 million a year. Interest and running costs
are largely met from annual income.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by
grants under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1965. By
March 1969 schemes costing over ^109 million had been completed or were
in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts.
The Water Resources Acts 1963 (which came into full operation in April
1965) and 1968 created a new administrative structure consisting of 27 river

authorities and a central Water Resources Board to meet the growing domestic,
industrial and farm irrigation needs. The river authorities, the Thames
Conservancy and the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board have a majority of
members appointed by the county and county borough councils in their areas.
The remainder are appointed by ministers mainly for their knowledge of land
drainage, fisheries, the public water supply, and water in use in industry and
in agriculture. The authorities manage the water resources of river basins
and carry out other functions in respect of land drainage, flood control,
administration of fisheries and prevention of pollution. They are responsible
for assessing water resources and requirements, controlling and developing
resources and securing regulation by a system of licensing. Special arrange¬
ments exist for the Greater London area, where the full range of river authority
control is not necessary. The work of the river authorities is co-ordinated by
the Water Resources Board, an expert advisory body which reports to the
Ministry of Housing and Local Government. Its duties include the review of
national water resources and requirements, the encouragement of the transfer
of water between areas according to need, the co-ordination of proposals of
river authorities for capital investment and the initiation of research. Since
April 1969 water conservation has been financed from charges levied by river
authorities on the licensed abstractors and users of water.
The administrative arrangements for water supply and distribution in
Scotland were reorganised by the Water (Scotland) Act 1967 under which
the functions of 200 local water authorities were transferred to 13 regional
water boards in May 1968. The Act also established the Central Scotland
Water Development Board which supplies water in bulk to its seven constituent
regional water boards; it does not supply direct to individual consumers.
All the members of these boards are members of town or county councils.
The water problem in Scotland is broadly similar to that in England and
Wales except that there is not the same need to allocate water between
competing interests and less reliance needs to be placed on underground
sources. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for general
oversight and co-ordination and has a general duty to promote the conservation
of water resources in Scotland; and to require regional water boards to
provide supplies of wholesome water everywhere in their districts, where
this can be done at reasonable cost; at present, they supply about 97 per cent
of the total population. The Scottish Water Advisory Committee advises the
Secretary of State on general questions relating to resources and supplies.
The Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Act 1944, as amended, makes available
to Scottish local authorities grant assistance up to a maximum of ^45 million
towards the cost of water supplies and sewerage schemes in rural areas.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of water for both domestic and
industrial consumption. Distribution is mainly the responsibility of local
authorities, some of which have combined to form joint boards. Some 85 per
cent of the population has a piped supply and nearly 100 million gallons are
supplied daily. Under the Water Supplies and Sewerage Act (Northern
Ireland) 1945 the Ministry of Development may pay grants towards the cost
of water schemes. Since 1945 almost £40 million have been invested, of which
^19-5 million were government grants.

published annually by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office. This publication
contains particulars of the run-off and related rainfall from a large number of
rivers, streams and reservoired areas. The Water Resources Board is respon¬
sible for the collation and publication of hydrological information: the field¬
work of surface water measurement is done by river authorities, water
undertakings and other bodies. Detailed studies of the resources and use of
water in specified areas have been published in the series of hydrological
surveys which cover approximately half of England and Wales. General
information on rainfall, published annually in British Rainfall, is the
responsibility of the Meteorological Office, while advice on ground water is the
responsibility of the Water Resources Board. The Hydraulics Research Station
of the Ministry of Technology at Wallingford and the Water Research
Association’s station at Medmenham carry out research into problems of the
design and calibration of gauging weirs and flumes for the measurement of
surface water, and into other hydraulic problems.
Full-scale feasibility studies are being made of barrages across Morecambe
Bay and the Dee estuary. A preliminary ‘desk study’ has also been carried out
at Solway Firth, and one is in progress for the Wash. Barrage projects involve
dams across or within tidal estuaries to form a lake of fresh water.
Each river authority is responsible for the control of pollution of rivers
and certain tidal waters in its area and its approval must be sought before
polluting effluents are discharged. Control of pollution in the tidal Thames
is exercised by the Port of London Authority. In Scotland nine river purifica¬
tion boards have been set up. The Secretary of State for Scotland is advised
by the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee on questions affecting
the cleanliness of Scottish rivers. In several ports the petroleum companies
co-operate in the prevention of oil pollution from tankers and refineries.
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory at Stevenage investigates
problems connected with the treatment of polluted water, the treatment
and disposal of sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects and
prevention of pollution of surface water and underground water. Research is
carried out with general supervision and advice from the Water Pollution
Research Board.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industry includes firms engaged on the construction,
alteration, repair and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage
and sewerage systems, waterworks, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence
works, electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, open-cast coal
prospecting and mining, and structural work connected with thermal and
hydro-electric power stations and telecommunications. About i-6 million
people are engaged on construction in both the public and private sectors.
They represent about 7 per cent of the total labour force and their net
output provides about 7 per cent of the gross national product.
The construction industry is gradually adopting metric in place of Imperial
weights and measures; the change is due to be completed in 1972. Designers
have used metric terms for new projects since January 1969; contractors will
start working in metric terms on some projects in January 1970.
Constructional work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. Over five-sixths of the work is

done by private firms. Although there are over 80,000 firms in the industry,
more than a fifth of them are one-man businesses. At the other end of the
scale are about 220 firms each with more than 600 employees.
Public authorities as a whole employ about 350,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these are engaged on repair and maintenance work which
local authorities, for example, carry out with their own labour.
Over 40 per cent of operatives are occupied on building maintenance, valued
at over £1,100 million annually. The total labour force includes about 800,000
skilled craftsmen, who have been trained for four or five years under the indus¬
try s apprenticeship schemes. A further 115,000 are employed as apprentices.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake respon¬
sibility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the
smallest projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either
by architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects,
by consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a
client, embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans
and the supervision of the constructional work by the contractor.
The Ministry of Public Building and Works (see p. 55) is responsible for
the construction programmes undertaken directly by the Government
(except for roads and health and education projects), including work for the
armed services, both at home and overseas. It is also responsible for
co-ordinating research and development throughout the government service and
seeks to influence methods and techniques in the building industry as a whole.
The output of the industry has been rising steadily over many years. The
value of work done in 1968 amounted to £4,520 million, of which £640
million represented work carried out by the labour employed directly by
public authorities. Private contractors carried out the remaining £3,880
million (£3>09° miHion on new work and £790 million on repair work).
About 394,000 houses were started in 1968 and some 414,000 were completed,
of which 222,000 were for private owners. Of the £1,255 million of new
housing carried out by private contractors, £622 million, or just under half,
was for private owners and the remainder for public authorities. Increasing
use is being made of industrialised building methods employing prefabricated
components.
The National Building Agency, which was set up by the Government in
1964, is an independent advisory body, managed by a board of directors
appointed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, and financed by a government
grant and the fees which it earns. Its main function is to encourage the
adoption of advanced methods of housebuilding, especially industrialised
building methods, as well as to provide technical advice and services, in
particular to local authorities.
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale
modern industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment
to carry out major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent
figures in the early development of civil engineering included John McAdam,
pioneer in road construction; Thomas Telford, builder of roads, bridges,
canals, docks and railways; George and Robert Stephenson and Isambard
Kingdom Brunei, pioneers of railway building.
INDUSTRY
299
Among important construction projects in hand in the United Kingdom in
1969 were several major conventional power stations and nuclear power
stations (see p. 289), dams and reservoirs, including a £3 -5 million dam on the
River Towy in Wales, hospitals, large-scale housing developments, such as
the Thamesmead (London) project to house 60,000 people, and the new town
being built at Craigavon, Northern Ireland. Projects for road construction,
bridges and tunnels included about 100 miles of motorways under construction
(see p. 338) a ^6 million high-level bridge over the Clyde, and the £20 million
second Mersey Tunnel. The main section of the 14-mile Victoria under¬
ground railway in London was completed early in 1969; a 3|-mile extension
is under construction.
British constructional firms have been as active overseas as in the United
Kingdom. British consulting engineers, in particular, have built up a tradition
of knowledge and integrity which has caused their standards to become
international practice and their services to be in world-wide demand.
A British firm acts as consultant to the World Bank on the Indus Basin
irrigation scheme, the largest in the world, and several firms were involved in
the design of the Mangla Dam, Pakistan, which forms part of it. Other projects
included a new port at Dammam, to cost between £10 million and £12 million,
for the Saudi Arabian Government, and a £14-6 million university for the
Government of Libya.
Among important construction projects by British contractors in hand in
overseas countries during 1969 were: a £14 million gas treatment complex in
southern Iran, a £24 million deep-water harbour and a ^4 million air terminal
at Dubai in the Persian Gulf; bridges in Uganda and Zambia; a new capital
for British Honduras; and a £6-7 million hospital building scheme in Uganda.
It has been estimated that the total value of work carried out during the
year ending in March 1969 by over 100 British contractors, operating in 106
countries, was £204 million, compared with ^182 million in the previous
year, and that the value of new contracts obtained was £234 million, compared
with £232 million in the previous year. Members of the Association of
Consulting Engineers had projects worth about £1,638 million in hand on
1st January 1969.
The Directorate-General of Research and Development in the Ministry of
Public Building and Works is responsible for co-ordinating research and
information services to increase efficiency in the building industry. The
Building Research Station was originally set up in 1921, thus making Britain
the pioneer of organised building research, and is concerned with research
into all aspects of building. It became part of the Ministry in 1967.
The Construction Industry Research and Information Association was
formed in 1967 to extend to the whole industry the research activities
previously undertaken by the Civil Engineering Research Association and to
provide an information and advisory service. Its future is at present under
review.
The Heating and Ventilating Research Association, an industrial research
organisation, deals with problems of heating and ventilation of large buildings.
The major construction firms have research departments working on plant,
materials and methods. Other bodies concerned with research include the
universities and colleges of technology. Most of the producers of primary
building materials have trade associations which maintain research institutions
chiefly devoted to seeking new and more efficient use for their materials.
12 AGRICULTURE,
FISHERIES AND
FORESTRY
AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and
most important industries. It occupies 724,000 people or somewhat over
2 per cent of those in civil employment, provides about 3 per cent of the
gross national product, and uses 48 million of the 60 million acres of land.
In Northern Ireland 2-7 million of the 3-3 million acres of land are in
agricultural use, and the corresponding proportions for employment and
gross output are 10 per cent and 13 per cent.
THE LAND AND The soils of the country are extremely varied. Many of those in the west
and north, overlying hard rocks, are poor and thin. The lowlands and river
valleys are usually fertile, varying in texture from clay through silt to sandy
loam. There is also some peat. Clay soils everywhere necessitate under¬
drainage. Land used for farming is conventionally divided into improved land
suitable for cultivation (crops and grass) and rough grazing. In hill country
the area of improved land is often small, but is usually supplemented by
grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
In the United Kingdom as a whole there are 30 million acres under crops
and grass. Improved land and rough grazing together represent 81 per cent
of the land area. The rest is mountain and forest, or put to urban and kindred
uses. The area available for farming is gradually decreasing to meet the needs
of housing and industry; however, the loss is more than outweighed by the
increase in output from what remains. Rough grazing, nearly all of which is
hill or mountain land with a native herbage of coarse grasses, rushes, bracken,
heather or scrub trees, has a low potential output—usually assessed at about
one-sixth of that of agricultural land—but is valuable for sheep. In England
and Wales only about one-seventh of farming land is classified as rough
grazing. In Northern Ireland the proportion is about one-quarter, but in
Scotland it is about three-quarters.
Size and
Ownership
of Farms
For many centuries the bulk of land in Britain lay in estates ranging in size
from a few hundred acres upwards, comprising farms of varying sizes let to
tenants. Social changes of the past half-century have completely changed the
pattern of rural life in England and Scotland. Estate duties have been a
principal factor in the breaking up of estates. Most surviving estates are still
owned by private individuals or family trusts, but the Crown, local authorities,
and other corporate bodies hold considerable areas. Of the farms sold, many
have been bought by the tenants already in occupation. About half the farms
in Great Britain today are owner-occupied.
There are about 422,000 agricultural holdings in the United Kingdom.
Slightly over half are part-time holdings, the occupiers generally having
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
301
another source of livelihood besides farming. A recent survey has shown that
there are about 220,000 full-time holdings, and about half the industry’s
total output comes from the 42,000 holdings classified as large ‘commercial’
farm businesses. A further 66,000 fall within the category of small ‘commer¬
cial’ businesses, which are able to operate as viable enterprises. Of the
remaining 112,000 full-time holdings, farming is in general on too restricted
a scale for commercial viability, and amalgamations are being encouraged.
The average size of full-time holdings in England and Wales is between
155 and 160 acres of crops and grass. In Scotland the crops and grass area of
the 22,600 full-time farms averages 167 acres although the average for the
32,900 part-time and other holdings is only 15 acres.
In Northern Ireland the land is divided into about 64,000 holdings, almost
all of which are owner-occupied. About 40 per cent of these holdings are
either very small or let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops or grazing), so
that the number of effective farm businesses is about 38,000, of which half
provide a full-time occupation for the owner. The typical farm size is between
40 and 70 acres of crops and grass.
Most British farms produce a variety of products; the pattern varies from
farm to farm. Dairy farming is widespread throughout Britain. In England
the farms devoted primarily to arable crops are in the eastern part of the
country—in East Anglia, Kent, Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire.
Potato and vegetable growing on a substantial scale marks the farming of the
Fens (south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire), the alluvial areas around the
rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in south Lancashire. Else¬
where, horticultural crops are widely dispersed amongst agricultural crops.
In Scotland the rich lowlands of the east coast are also primarily arable.
Interspersed between these arable areas, and also in the Midlands, the
south-east of England and the north-east of Scotland, there are large tracts
where much of the land is under grass and the rearing and fattening of cattle
is an important enterprise. In the south-west of Scotland dairying is
extensively practised, but most of the north-west is devoted to rearing sheep
on rough hill land. The parts of England bordering the Pennine hills and most
of Wales are also sheep-rearing areas, though a good deal of dairying, based
on purchased feedingstuffs, is also done there. In Northern Ireland mixed
farming is practised, the most important products being milk, fat and store
cattle, pigs and eggs, with sheep and stock raising in the hill areas. Oats and
barley are widely grown, mainly for livestock feeding, and the only important
cash crop is potatoes, both ware and seed.
There are three main categories of grassland in the United Kingdom—
temporary grass, permanent grass and rough grazing. Temporary grass may
be part of an arable rotation, providing a break of from one to seven years
between tillage crops, or it may be part of an all-grass system where its
advantages over permanent grass are that it can provide early and late season
grazing and often heavier crops.
Since the end of the second wrorld war there has been an increase of well
over half a million acres in the area of temporary grass and the total arable
area is about 5^ million acres more than it was pre-war. In England and
Wales nearly one-half of the 24 million acres of crops and grass (excluding
over 3 million acres of rough grazing) is under permanent grass, one-third
under cereals and one-sixth under temporary grass. About three-quarters of
all agricultural land in Scotland is in rough grazing and of the 4-3 million

acres of crops and grass about one-quarter is in permanent and two-fifths in
temporary grass. Excluding about 636,000 acres of rough grazing the crops
and grass area of Northern Ireland is about 2 million acres, of which over half
is under permanent and over one-quarter under temporary grass.
Farmers everywhere are exposed to the vagaries of the weather, of pests and
diseases, and of the market; but over the past 30 years much has been done
in Britain to mitigate these risks. This has been partly due to the advance of
science, partly to self-help by farmers’ organisations, but largely to govern¬
ment action. The role of the Government as guarantor and provider of
technical and advisory services, is described on pp. 309-18.
The steady expansion in productivity which has taken place over the last 25
years is summarised in Table 21. Apart from a slight decline between 1961
and 1964 total cattle stocks have risen steadily each year since 1963. The milk-
producing herd reached its peak level in 1962, thereafter suffering a two-year
decline. Since 1964 the herd has increased each year despite heavy losses in
the foot-and-mouth epidemic of 1967-68. Numbers of sheep and lambs
reached their highest level in 1966 but declined slightly in 1967 and 1968,
while those of pigs and poultry have expanded considerably over the past
decade, though pig numbers showed a temporary reduction in 1966-67.
Production of wheat at over 3! million tons a year has almost doubled since
the end of the second world war, while barley production at over 8 million
tons a year is now more than four times the 1946 figure. There has been a
marked fall in the production of oats. Potato production is very susceptible
to weather conditions but on average adequate supplies are being maintained
from a steadily declining acreage. Between i960 and 1968 output of pigmeat
increased by over one-quarter, and eggs by just over one-fifth and these,
together with the increase in beef and milk output, resulted in higher con¬
sumption of feedingstuffs, mostly from home resources. Imports of concen¬
trated feeds have fallen slightly over the same period, from 6-i million tons
in 1960-61 to 5-8 million tons in 1968-69.
The index of agricultural net output (all holdings) at constant prices has
risen steadily. By 1953-54 it was about 56 per cent above the immediate
pre-war average. Based on the average of 1954-55 to 1956-57= 100, it was
112 in 1959-60 and 143 in 1967-68; 138 is forecast for 1968-69.
Since 1939 the population of the United Kingdom has increased by 7^ million,
or nearly 16 per cent. In spite of this growth Britain now produces about half
of its total food requirements or two-thirds of all that can be grown in
temperate climates; this latter figure comparing with about one-half before
the second world war. Home production of the principal foods is shown as a
percentage by weight of total supplies in Table 22.
Table 23 shows how the level of the main food supplies passing into
consumption has changed since before the second world war and within the
last decade. The main trends reflected in the table are that consumption of
bulky foods (carbohydrates), such as flour, has tended to decline, while that of
high-protein foods, such as meat and eggs, continues to increase with greater
availability and rising living standards.
Wheat growing is mainly confined to the East Anglia area of England.
Although there was an increase in the acreage under wheat in 1968 the bad
weather during the summer resulted in a sharp decrease in the yield per acre.

“ Including sugar in all home-produced and imported manufactured foods, and in
brewing.
About 3-5 million tons were harvested in 1968, with average yields estimated
at 29-1 cwt per acre. Just under a half of the wheat crop is used for flour
milling, the remainder going mainly for animal feed.
Since i960 the acreage under barley has increased by nearly 80 per cent
and production has almost doubled due to improved yields. The important
malting and distilling market currently absorbs about one-sixth of the crop,
most of the remainder being used for animal feeding purposes.
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also widely
used on a co-operative basis.
In England and Wales the total acreage of fodder crops is rising slowly,
although in many cases farmers can provide winter feed more economically

by increased grass production and improved methods of conservation. In
Scotland the acreage of fodder crops is declining but the acreage of turnips
and swedes is greater than in England.
Beet is grown mainly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire where most of the beet
sugar factories are situated. The crop is grown under contract to the British
Sugar Corporation, which takes the entire output at guaranteed prices and also
provides technical advice and assistance. Precision drilling is the usual method
of sowing and more than three-quarters of the crop is mechanically harvested.
Potatoes are grown in most parts of Britain. Early potatoes are cultivated
mainly in the south and on the west coast for immediate summer marketing.
The production of main crop potatoes (which may be stored until the
following spring) is centred on the eastern side of the country and in Northern
Ireland, which sends about one-sixth of its crop to Great Britain. Seed potato
requirements are met mainly from Scotland and Northern Ireland. Both areas
also export seed potatoes. The long-term trend is for the area planted with
potatoes to diminish and for yields to increase but Britain remains self-
sufficient in main crop potatoes except in years of unusually low yield. The
acreage has declined from 829,000 acres in i960 to an estimated 691,000 acres
in 1968. The yield in 1968 was 9-8 tons per acre, the record being io-i tons
per acre in 1965. Although the planting, cultivation, harvesting and grading
of the potato crop are becoming increasingly mechanised, much hand labour
is still needed.
Milk is much more valuable when sold on the liquid milk market than when
converted into cheese, butter or other milk products. In Great Britain milk
is produced primarily for liquid consumption, but in Northern Ireland the
greater part of the milk is used for manufactured products. Average
consumption per head is nearly five pints per week.
Average yields per dairy cow have increased during the last decade by more
than 11 per cent and now average over 800 gallons a year. Freedom from
tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and through the artificial insemination
(AI) centres, operated by the Milk Marketing Boards and other organisations,
the influence of a relatively small number of high-potential bulls is widely
disseminated. It is estimated that about two-thirds of Britain’s total cattle
are bred by AI. The Friesian breed is dominant in the dairy herds of England,
Wales and Northern Ireland, but in Scotland the Ayrshire breed is the most
numerous. Milk production has also been stimulated by advances in grassland
management, intensive grazing techniques and new methods of making high
quality hay; new methods of conversion into silage are being exploited. Most
dairy farmers practise some degree of intensive grass management, but hay of
the traditional type remains the basic winter feed; it is supplemented with
purchased concentrates.
Clean dairy farming methods and hygienic standards for equipment and
buildings used in milk production are prescribed by regulations made and
enforced by the appropriate ministers.
A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. It has been found that they meet the needs of breeders
in most countries and substantial export sales are made to buyers seeking
to replenish and improve their herds with British animals.
In the hill regions hardy herds of beef cattle are kept, especially of the Galloway
and Welsh Black breeds and their crosses; in marginal land and lower areas

the sires used are predominantly of the Aberdeen Angus and Hereford breeds.
About two-thirds of home-fed beef production derives from the dairy herds,
some females being mated to beef sires, the majority by AI. There is a large
and complex trade in store cattle (increased by animals imported from the
Irish Republic), a typical movement being from the upland west to grazing
areas in the Midlands.
Britain has outstandingly good pastures for sheep. Moreover, veterinary
research has provided vaccine and sera protection against nearly all the
epidemic diseases to which sheep are subject. More than 30 breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in Britain, each breed having originated
within a circumscribed area.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, winter conditions are usually
severe. Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas every autumn
to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages: first, to farms at inter¬
mediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a larger and more
rapidly maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on in due course
to the more genial lowland conditions and especially to the Midlands and the
south and east of England, where they become crossed again with Down
rams for fat lamb production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness and the
lowland sires fecundity and early maturity.
Although wool is of considerable importance to the sheep farmer the main
object is the production of fat lambs; this reflects the change in the preference
of consumers away from mature sheep.
Pig production is carried on in most parts of Britain but is particularly
important in the eastern counties of England. In the past pigs were found on
the majority of farms but there is now an increasing concentration into
specialist units and larger herds. The most frequently used breeds are the
Large White and the Landrace though considerable cross-breeding takes place.
Pig improvements are fostered by the Meat and Livestock Commission and
by leading commercial firms through schemes for progeny and performance
testing, litter recording and other development work. Attention is focused
on utility qualities, such as size and weight of litters, and on food consumed
per pound of liveweight gain. AI is available as a nationwide service.
Carcases are used for curing as bacon, for sale as fresh pork and for manu¬
facturing into sausages and other processed forms. In terms of pig meat,
about 30 per cent is used for bacon and 70 per cent for pork and manufacturing.
Specialist techniques and intensive husbandry have been introduced over a
large part of the poultry industry and considerable concentration has occurred.
There are now several flocks of over 100,000 birds and only a small pro¬
portion of total production is in the hands of the smallest producers. Nearly
80 per cent of the laying birds on farms are in flocks of 1,000 or more. With the
rise in the poultry population and in the yield of eggs per bird (now averaging
over 200 eggs a year), the estimated production of eggs has more than doubled
the 1938 level and for several years nearly all eggs consumed in Britain have
been home-produced. About 274 million broilers and other special table
chickens were produced in 1968.
Horticultural crops occupy only a small fraction of the cultivated land of
the country—about 2| per cent of the area under crops and grass—but
their value in terms of output per acre is very high. The total value of
horticultural crops sold in 1968-69 is estimated at about £201 million,
compared with some ^1,970 million for total agricultural output in the United
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 307
Kingdom. About 440,000 acres are under vegetables, about 220,000 acres
under fruit, and 35,000 acres under flowers and nursery stocks.
Market gardening has grown up around all the large centres of population,
notably in the Lea Valley, near London, and in more rural areas with favour¬
able soil or climatic conditions—in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincoln¬
shire, Hampshire and Kent, and in a concentration of smallholdings in the
Vale of Evesham. Districts with mild climates, such as the Penzance region of
Cornwall, have been favoured for the production of selected early crops. More
recently, selected vegetable crops, particularly peas, have been grown in
rapidly increasing quantities for quick-freezing.
Specialised horticultural holdings range from a few acres up to about
300 acres, and many have glasshouses, frames or forcing houses. Use of
fertilisers, particularly of an organic nature, is very heavy, and much of the
field work is mechanised. The larger holdings normally have specialised
packing sheds, with washing and grading machinery, and irrigation plants.
Growers, however, often join together in co-operatives for marketing their
produce and many of these provide grading and packing facilities.
Britain has over 4,000 acres of glasshouses, about half of the area being
used primarily for the cultivation of tomatoes, the main centres of which
are the Lea Valley in Essex and Hertfordshire, Lancashire, the East Riding
of Yorkshire, the rest of Essex, and Sussex. In the Lea Valley, on a narrow
belt of gravel and brick earth, about 500 acres are covered with glass. Produc¬
tion of tomatoes is estimated at about 80,000 to 85,000 tons annually and the
value of all glasshouse crops (including flowers) at some £40 million per year.
Hard fruits are grown in many parts of England and Wales, the chief risk
associated with their culture being late frosts. The main centres are in the
south, south-west and east of England, and Kent in particular. The acreage
of Cox’s Orange Pippin has increased in recent years but that of other dessert
varieties and of cooking apples has declined. About 23,000 acres of varieties of
cider apple are grown mainly in Devon, Herefordshire and Somerset for the
cider-making industry. In Northern Ireland there are 7,000 acres of cooking
apples—Bramley Seedlings—mostly concentrated in County Armagh. Plums
and soft fruits are grown in many counties; concentrations of plums and
cherries are found in Kent and Worcestershire, of blackcurrants in Norfolk,
Kent, Herefordshire and Worcestershire; and of strawberries in the Wisbech
area and in Kent. Raspberries are exceptional in that of some 8,800 acres
grown in Britain over four-fifths are in Scotland, mainly in the Blairgowrie
district of Perthshire and in Angus.
Hop-growing for the brewing industry is confined to two main areas, in Kent
and Sussex and in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Capital outlay and
cultivation costs are very high, but crops per acre average about 12 cwt.,
worth some ^460. The total annual value of the crop is about ^7 million.
Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agri¬
cultural producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments
(see Table 24). They show that Britain’s farming is based on livestock; two-
thirds of farmers’ income is derived from the sale of animals or their products.
The aggregate net income of farmers rose from £393 million in 1960-61 to
£477 million in 1968-69. The annual cost of direct support to agriculture
from public funds has averaged ^255 million during the past five years.
Of farm expenses, machinery and equipment amount to about one-sixth,
feedingstuffs about one-third and wages about one-fifth. Since i960

agricultural earnings have risen by nearly 55 per cent, offsetting the manpower
economies made possible by mechanisation.
Until 1958 rents tended to lag behind other costs. This was due partly to
the reluctance of landlords to put up the rents of satisfactory tenants, and
partly to the terms of reference given to arbitrators. These terms were
modified in the Agriculture Act 1958 and since i960 rents in England and
Wales have gone up by nearly 90 per cent.
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer,
if he is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant.
In 1968 ‘fixed capital’ totalling about ^85 million was added to the value of
land and buildings (annual gross investment in fixed assets exceeds £200
million). The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the farms is
provided by the occupiers. Bank advances are an important source of outside
capital, both fixed and working; about half the total bank advances to agri¬
culture are believed to be for short-term purposes. Agricultural merchants are
also an important source of short-term credit. Mortgage loans form the chief
source of long-term credit and are provided by building societies, insurance
companies, private sources, and specialised financial institutions (see p. 313).
Accounts of some 2,000 farms in England and Wales, collected by university
agricultural economists in 1967-68, show average valuations of occupiers’
capital ranging from over £10 to more than £65 per acre. In Scotland a similar
sample of 800 accounts shows a wide range in valuations per acre, from about
£2 on hill sheep farms with extensive rough grazings to between £50 and
£60 per acre on lowland farms. In Northern Ireland average valuations of
occupiers’ capital range from over £100 on the smaller, more intensive farms
to £50 per acre on the larger farms. On all types of farms investment in
machinery is a heavy item: on dairy farms it averages £17 per acre and on

arable farms nearly £20 per acre; on stock-rearing farms it may amount to
£6 per acre.
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with over half a
million tractors in 1968, or one to every 35 acres of arable land. Power-take-off
implements now characterise arable farming; and some 70,000 combine
harvesters were in use in 1968. A wide variety of machines for harvesting
and preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are installed
on all except the smallest farms, many with mechanical means of handling
milk.
Over 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply
and accompanying equipment. There are about 1,100 farmers’ machinery
syndicates through which farmers have the use of expensive equipment
without tying up their own capital.
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out by
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering.
The range of net incomes between individual farms is very wide, varying
with the type and size of farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the
occupier. The average net income for farms of different types is mostly within
the range of £5 to ^16 per acre with the exception of pig and poultry farms
and horticultural holdings, which are more intensive in their use of land. Net
income per acre on dairy and arable farms has nearly always been higher than
on stock-rearing farms, which are generally larger than the other types and
are situated on poorer land.
By the beginning of the 1930s the need for some form of State assistance
to agriculture had become pressing: it was during this time that the
Government initiated the various forms of protection and financial assistance
for agriculture.
During the second world war and the immediate post-war years, agri¬
cultural production was closely controlled by the State, with County War
Agricultural Executive Committees, composed of landowners, farmers and
farm workers, acting as the Government’s local agents.
Government policy today is founded on the Agriculture Act 1947. The
main objective, as set out in Section 1 of the Act, continues to be ‘a stable
and efficient agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the
nation’s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interest it is
desirable to produce in the United Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum
prices consistent with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers
and workers in agriculture and an adequate return on capital invested in
the industry’. To this end, the Government is empowered to provide, for
the main agricultural products, guaranteed prices determined in the light of
annual reviews (see p. 310).
The Agriculture Act of 1957 assured farmers that the prices guaranteed
under the 1947 Act would not be steeply reduced, and at the same time
provided grants towards the cost of bringing fixed equipment up to date.
The Agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964 gave the Government powers
to introduce minimum import prices for agricultural and horticultural
products. These powers have been used in the case of cereals. In the same
year an understanding with overseas suppliers on the sharing of the bacon
market became effective. This was renewed in 1969.

Annual Review
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1968 the selective expansion programme, announced in 1965, was
extended to 1973. The agricultural industry is expected to increase production 1
to produce substantial import savings on temperate foodstuffs.
The functions of government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised
by the agricultural ministers, that is to say, for England and Wales the ^
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for
Wales, for Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland, and for Northern !
Ireland the Home Secretary, who is the minister responsible for United
Kingdom aspects of Northern Ireland agriculture, local aspects being the
responsibility of the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture. The agri¬
cultural ministers are assisted by advisory committees composed of general
agriculturists, scientists and other specialists.
The headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is
divided functionally, each division being responsible for a particular subject
or service. Its relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly through
its local offices, grouped in England in regions, each administered by a
regional controller working in close collaboration with the regional heads of the
technical services. Local offices in Wales are grouped under a Welsh Secretary
with similar functions and with special responsibility for Welsh affairs.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The
Secretary of State for Scotland also appoints the members of the Crofters
Commission (see p. 314) and the Red Deer Commission, which deals with the
conservation and control of red deer.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for imple- ,
menting agricultural policy inaugurated by the Northern Ireland Government.
It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, for which it acts as agent in the administration in Northern Ireland
of United Kingdom agricultural schemes.
In November 1966 an Economic Development Committee (see p. 237) f°r
agriculture was established, comprising representatives of farmers, workers
and landowners, as well as official members.
In February each year, in accordance with the 1947 Act, the agricultural
ministers review the economic condition and prospects of the industry.
Between annual reviews, a special review may be held if the ministers consider
it warranted, but this has seldom been necessary. In holding reviews, the
ministers are required to consult with representatives of agricultural pro¬
ducers—in practice, the three farmers’ unions in the United Kingdom. The
ministers consider such factors as production trends and market requirements,
world market prospects, the cost of subsidies, the trend of profits in the
industry as a whole, the increasing efficiency of the industry and changes in
production costs, trading relations (especially with the Commonwealth) and
the national economic situation. In the light of their conclusions, they
determine guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep, fat pigs, eggs, wool,
milk, cereals, potatoes and sugar beet. These guarantees apply to livestock
and livestock products for the ensuing 12 months, and to crops to be
harvested in the current year. Various grants in aid of particular kinds of
production or farming practice (known as ‘production grants’) are also
considered. Any changes in ‘relevant’ production grants (broadly, those
payable to occupiers rather than landowners) are taken into account. The

Government’s conclusions and its decisions on changes in guaranteed prices
and relevant production grants are published as a White Paper.
The Agriculture Act 1957 gave statutory effect to long-term assurances that
set minimum limits to the price determinations that may be made after an
Annual Review. The cost of government support to the industry in 1968-69
was about £281 million; the estimate for 1969-70, adjusted for the effect of
the 1969 review decisions, forecast an increase to about ^3million.
The general policy of the Government is to use methods of agricultural
support that allow the ordinary channels of trade to flow freely. The form of
guarantee most generally used is the deficiency payment, which means that
the Government makes payments to producers, related to the differences
between the average market price realised and the guaranteed price, for
output eligible for the guarantee.
The deficiency payments scheme for cereals is administered directly by the
agricultural departments, and storage incentives are paid to growers who sell
their wheat and barley after the harvest period. ‘Standard quantity’1 arrange¬
ments for wheat and barley were introduced for the 1964 crop but were
abolished in 1968 and 1969 respectively. Deficiency payments for fatstock
are made weekly to producers on certified sales on a liveweight or deadweight
basis. For cattle and sheep there may also be a balancing payment at the end
of the year if the average return to producers falls short of the annual
guaranteed price.
For most of the remaining commodities and for fat pigs in Northern
Ireland, the Government operates the guarantee through the appropriate
marketing board, which takes account of any payments from or to the
Government in deciding what to pay producers for their produce. In the case
of milk there are five boards, and the full guaranteed price is paid only on a
‘standard quantity’ relating to the volume of liquid milk sales plus a reasonable
reserve. Milk produced in excess of the standard quantity is sold for manu¬
facturing considerably below the full guaranteed price. The retail price of
liquid milk is determined by the Government so as to cover the full cost of
the guarantee and, taking one year with another, there is no Exchequer
subsidy. For eggs, a subsidy is paid to the British Egg Marketing Board on all
first-quality eggs sold to the Board through packing stations. The Govern¬
ment intends to phase out the subsidy and remove eggs from the guarantee
by the end of March 1974. A deficiency payment is made for potatoes in years
in which the growers’ average price for potatoes for human consumption
(excluding new potatoes) is less than the guaranteed price; payment for the
benefit of growers is made to the Potato Marketing Board in Great Britain
and to the Ministry of Agriculture, Northern Ireland. Surpluses are purchased
by these authorities for stockfeed.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board
for every pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to
fix in advance a schedule of producers’ prices, based on types and quality,
after making allowance for the Board’s marketing costs.
1 The Agriculture Act 1947 postulates that the guarantees should be related to the
volume of agricultural produce which, in the national interest, it is desirable to produce
domestically (see p. 309). This is effected by including standard quantities in the
guarantee arrangements for milk, pigs, potatoes and sugar beet. Standard quantity
arrangements vary in form but, in general, the basic guaranteed price determined in
the Annual Review is related to a specific quantity of produce marketed annually on a
national basis; if this quantity is exceeded, the producers’ average unit return falls.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Under the Sugar Act 1956 and the Agriculture Act 1957 the British
Sugar Corporation contracts to buy the whole of the sugar beet crop pro¬
duced from a specified acreage (at present 443,000 acres) at a scale of fixed
prices, determined as a result of the annual review and related to sugar
content. Refined sugar produced by the Corporation is sold, under market¬
sharing agreements with the refiners, at a price based on the world price.
The Sugar Board buys Commonwealth sugar under the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement and sells it commercially. The deficits or surpluses which
result from the transactions of both the Corporation and the Board are
ultimately reflected in the Board’s accounts. When these accounts show a
deficit a levy is charged on all sugar, imported or home-produced, entering
the British market, including the sugar content of composite sugar imports,
and when there is a surplus a distribution payment is made correspondingly,
so that taking one year with another the Board balances its accounts.
The price supports outlined above relate only to current production. To
increase productivity, however, the Government offers to farmers a wide
range of inducements, known as production grants, for improvements to land,
crops, livestock and equipment. In 1968-69 the Exchequer’s contribution in
the form of production grants was ^’130 million. The form taken by these
schemes varies considerably but they fall into three main categories. Firstly,
improvements to land fertility, which include a subsidy on fertilisers and
lime and grants for field drainage, farm water supply and for ploughing certain
kinds of land; the Exchequer cost of these improvements currently runs at
over £45 million a year. The second type of inducement is aimed at main¬
taining breeding herds of cattle and flocks of sheep (particularly in upland
areas) and includes a calf subsidy on animals suitable for beef production;
the total cost is nearly £55 million a year. The third type consists of a
contribution towards farm improvements generally but with particular
reference to farm buildings, silage, roads, fences and other equipment. A
special business management scheme exists to help small farmers improve
the efficiency of their holdings. A grant is also available to farmers and
growers to encourage the keeping of farm business records as an aid to sound
management decisions. Under the Agriculture Act 1967 a hill land improve¬
ment scheme was introduced which provides for 50 per cent grants for various
improvements designed to increase the productivity of hill land.
Under the Agriculture Act 1967 the Government is empowered to make
grants to meet 50 per cent of the approved costs of voluntary amalgamations
of small farms with other land to form commercial units; and to pay lump
sums or annuities to farmers who give up such holdings for amalgamation.
Where an owner wishes to dispose of an uncommercial holding the Govern¬
ment may buy it outright for this purpose.
Horticultural produce, because it is perishable and liable to seasonal variation
in quantity and quality, does not lend itself to a system of guaranteed prices.
Hitherto the principal means of support has been tariffs on imports, but
greater emphasis has now been placed on the need to strengthen the com¬
petitive efficiency of the industry so as to reduce its dependence upon tariffs.
To this end grants of one-third are available to meet the capital cost of a wide
range of buildings, plant and equipment used in the production, storage, pre¬
paration for market and transport of horticultural produce. Additionally, small-
scale horticulturists who are prepared to undertake a three-year programme for

improving the efficiency of their businesses may qualify for a grant of up to
£500. The cost to the Exchequer of these schemes is over £4 million a year.
Special arrangements for the agricultural and horticultural industries have
been made under the investment incentives procedure which replaced invest¬
ment allowances in 1966. Broadly speaking, the Minister of Agriculture in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State in Scotland
are empowered to pay grants of 10 per cent of approved expenditure on fixed
equipment, plant and machinery, agricultural tractors and self-propelled
harvesters, and 5 per cent supplements to other improvement grants with a
basic rate of 45 per cent or less. For expenditure incurred between January
1967 and December 1968 grants have been paid at 15 per cent for tractors and
self-propelled harvesters, and at I2| per cent for fixed equipment.
A number of facilities for specific purposes enjoy government encouragement
and support.
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agri¬
cultural property is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Ltd. (see p. 375). The Corporation’s funds are derived mainly from public
issues of stock, but it receives a measure of government support. Similarly
in Scotland, loans for agricultural purposes secured on agricultural land in
Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd.
Improvement loans for carrying out improvements to agricultural land and
buildings are also available to landowners from the Lands Improvement
Company, whose funds are provided privately.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and financed out
of public funds. Half of the loans issued are short-term for agricultural
machinery and the remainder are medium- or long-term loans for such
purposes as the purchase of livestock, the erection and improvement of farm
buildings and farm dwellings, and the purchase of land for amalgamation and
subsequent restructuring.
Under the Agriculture Act 1967 the Government can make loans in Great
Britain to help finance the purchase of land acquired for approved amalgam¬
ations of small farms (see p. 312), and approved remodelling expenditure.
These loans may be granted up to 90 per cent (100 per cent for certain small
amalgamations) of the valuation of the combined unit determined by the
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd. in England and Wales and the
Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd. in Scotland, which act as
the Government’s agents.
Since 1892 county councils and county borough councils in England and
Wales have had powers to provide land for smallholdings. County councils are
obliged by statute to provide smallholdings and the Minister of Agriculture
is empowered to contribute towards their losses. In England and Wales,
about 13,250 smallholdings are provided by local authorities and about
950 by the Ministry. The Minister may also make loans for working capital
to tenants of statutory smallholdings. In this way they can be helped to
obtain livestock, machinery, implements and other necessary items; tenants
must, however, have available at least 25 per cent of the capital required.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which now owns and maintains about 420,000 acres of land
settlement estates, comprising some 3,450 crofts and holdings.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In the seven Scottish crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness, Inverness,
Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, and Shetland—much of the land is
farmed by crofters, tenant farmers whose holdings are generally either
rented at a cost of not more than £50 a year or have an area not exceeding
75 acres.
In these counties there are about 19,000 crofts, which produce about
one-quarter of the total agricultural output of the area. The special problems
of the crofting counties, which had for some time been suffering from a
declining population, led to the setting up, in 1955, of a Crofters Commission
whose functions are to reorganise, develop and regulate crofting in the
crofting counties, to promote the interests of crofters and to keep under review
matters relating to crofting. The Commission’s statutory powers include
supervising the letting of crofts and (if the crofters agree) the reallocation of
land to form viable and self-contained communities; it also acts as the
Secretary of State’s agent in administering development grants and loans.
Land drainage (including flood protection) in England and Wales is the
responsibility of 27 river authorities (see p. 295), two catchment and 372
internal drainage boards. Local authorities also have general drainage powers.
There are no comparable authorities in Scotland, where arterial drainage of
agricultural land is the owners’ responsibility. River authorities have powers
to maintain and improve watercourses scheduled as main rivers. Their work
is concerned with the improvement of land drainage by increasing the capacity
and efficiency of rivers and erecting pumping stations, the prevention of
inland flooding and the erection of defences to protect low-lying areas from
coastal flooding. River authorities also have powers relating to water resources
generally, freshwater fisheries and river pollution.
Internal drainage boards are concerned with very much smaller areas and
their work is chiefly in low-lying agricultural districts. Their main function is
to keep the land drained in their area by improving the main drains and,
where necessary, by pumping from low-lying land.
Drainage authorities derive their income directly or indirectly from local
authority funds. The Government pays grants towards the cost of the
improvement schemes. Grants to river authorities vary from 10 per cent to
80 per cent according to the financial position of the authority, with an
additional premium for sea defence works. Internal drainage boards receive
grants at a flat rate of 50 per cent. Local authorities receive grants varying
from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. In Scotland 50 per cent grants are available
to owners or occupiers of agricultural land.
In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Agriculture is the drainage authority
in respect of watercourses designated by the Drainage Council as main or
minor watercourses.
In Great Britain about half, and in Northern Ireland almost all, farms are
owner-occupied. The traditional form of tenancy in England and Wales runs
from year to year; in Scotland longer leases for terms of 10 to 14 years are
more common, although most tenants farm on a year-to-year basis. The
tenancy agreement may be either written or verbal (in Scotland it must be
written if the period of the lease exceeds one year) and may (but need not)
include provisions about such matters as rights of cropping, liability for repair
and maintenance, and compensation for tenant’s improvements.
In order to protect the respective interests of landlords and tenants and to
eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and liabilities, a code of landlord and
MARKETING
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 315
tenant relationships has been written into legislation. The Agriculture Acts
1947 (England and Wales) and 1948 (Scotland) lay down the basic rules of
good estate management and good husbandry for owners and occupiers
respectively. The Agricultural Holdings Acts 1948 (England and Wales)
and 1949 (Scotland) as amended by the Agriculture Act 1958 and the Agri¬
culture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts of 1963 and 1968 contain more detailed
provisions concerning the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.
The Acts provide for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception
of certain short-term lettings to which exemption can be given by the Minister
or Secretary of State, to continue in force from year to year until terminated
by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions the tenant can contest it
by serving a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes inoperative
unless the landlord can satisfy an independent body (in England and Wales
the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land Court) that
his claim for possession is in the interests of sound estate management or good
husbandry or that the land is required for certain purposes specified in the
Acts.
The Acts lay down a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled
on termination of the tenancy. Rent is a matter for negotiation between
landlord and tenant and may be varied by agreement at any time or, failing
agreement, by arbitration at intervals of not less than three years in England
and Wales and five years in Scotland.
Agricultural products are marketed mainly through private trade channels
such as corn merchants, livestock auctions and markets, and bacon factories;
or through producers’ co-operative organisations. For certain commodities,
however, marketing arrangements are influenced by boards operating under
the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 (which consolidated earlier legislation).
These marketing boards are producers’ organisations with statutory powers
to regulate the marketing of particular products. The schemes under which
they are constituted and operate must be approved by Parliament and
confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most of the members of the boards are
elected by the producers but a minority are appointed by the minister or
ministers concerned. Further safeguards serve to protect consumers and other
interests affected by schemes and the public interest generally.
Marketing boards fall into two broad categories: first, those which are
sole buyers of the regulated product from all producers not specially exempted
or, alternatively, those exercising a comparable influence by controlling all
contracts between producers and first buyers; and, secondly, boards which
maintain only a broad control over marketing conditions, leaving producers free
otherwise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for eggs, hops, milk
and wool fall into the first category and the potato board into the second.
Northern Ireland has its own marketing boards, based on local legislation,
for milk, pigs and seed potatoes.
The Home-Grown Cereals Authority, established to improve the marketing
of home-grown cereals, operates a scheme of bonuses and provides market
intelligence. It has reserve trading powers.
The Meat and Livestock Commission, established under the Agriculture
Act 1967, is charged with improving the production, marketing and distribu¬
tion of livestock and meat in Great Britain. It has a range of executive
functions extending from breeding to retail distribution, one of the most
important of which is to evolve a general scheme of carcase classification. It is
not empowered to trade in either livestock or meat.

Grants of up to one-third are available for the modernisation of major
wholesale horticultural markets; Covent Garden market is being moved to a
new site in south London, which should be in use in the early 1970s.
National statutory grades are being introduced to improve the competitive
position of home produce as against imported supplies and to speed its transit
through distributive channels. By May 1968 grades had been introduced for
apples, pears, tomatoes, cucumbers and cauliflowers.
The Apple and Pear Development Council publicises home-grown apples
and pears to increase sales.
In 1962 the Government earmarked million to assist the financing of
research and development in the marketing of agricultural and horticultural
produce. By March 1969 grants totalling about ^1-25 million had been
approved. The grant ceiling has been raised to £2 million and the scheme
extended to March 1971 to assist marketing developments other than those of
a co-operative nature.
The Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation was
established under the provisions of the Agriculture Act 1967 to promote and
develop co-operation in agriculture and horticulture and to administer a
scheme of grants. The Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation Scheme
1967 incorporates and extends grants for co-operative production and
marketing of agricultural and horticultural produce.
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
veterinary profession in private practice. The State veterinary service,
inaugurated in 1865 and covering Great Britain, deals with situations beyond
the control of the individual veterinary surgeon. Centred on London and
Edinburgh, it is able to deal promptly with outbreaks of notifiable diseases.
For many years Britain has been free from many serious animal diseases,
including rinderpest, sheep scab, glanders and rabies. The campaign to
eradicate swine fever has been successful. A major epidemic of foot-and-
mouth disease was experienced towards the end of 1967 but was eradicated
successfully by a stringent slaughter policy supported by other vigorous
control measures; the last case of the disease occurred in June 1968. In i960
the whole of the United Kingdom became a bovine tuberculosis attested area.
The incidence of bovine tuberculosis is now very low; all cattle are tuberculin
tested at regular intervals and reactors to the test are slaughtered, compensa¬
tion being paid to the owners. In 1967 the Brucellosis (Accredited Herds)
scheme was introduced as a first stage towards eradication of the disease.
The work of the service is backed by the extensive facilities of the Central
Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, and those of its subsidiary
laboratory at Lasswade, near Edinburgh. In addition, there are 21 investiga¬
tion centres with well-equipped laboratories in England and Wales. These
centres perform work requiring specialist knowledge and give advice on
disease problems to private practitioners. In Scotland a similar service is
provided by the investigation centres of the three Scottish agricultural
colleges.
In Northern Ireland the veterinary services are organised similarly to those
in Great Britain but are administered separately by the Northern Ireland
Government. Animal Health Control policies and the geographical situation
have kept the country free from nearly all the major epizootic diseases. A
scheme for the eradication of brucellosis was almost complete by the end of

1969. The full-time veterinary service is supplemented by the central
veterinary laboratory at Stormont, Belfast.
The State plant health service is responsible for statutory controls designed
to limit the spread of plant pests and diseases present in Britain and prevent
the introduction of new ones from abroad. It also issues the health certificates
required by other countries to accompany plant material imported from
Britain. Voluntary certification schemes are operated to encourage the develop¬
ment of healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks, particularly of
crops subject to degenerative diseases. The Plant Pathology Laboratory at
Harpenden, Hertfordshire, provides the information on which statutory
controls and certification schemes are based.
The problems of controlling mammalian pests and birds are studied at the
Ministry of Agriculture’s Infestation Control Laboratory at Tolworth, Surrey,
and its Land Pests Department at Worplesdon, Surrey. The laboratories
provide information to and liaise closely with Regional Pest Officers who in
turn advise local authorities, farmers and others concerned with these problems.
Safeguards against the dangers which could arise from uncontrolled use of
pesticides have been devised and are operating successfully. Regulations made
under the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 provide protection
for workers using the more toxic chemicals. The voluntary Pesticides Safety
Precautions Scheme, operated by the Government with the full backing of
the industry, ensures that new pesticides for use in agriculture and food
storage, or new methods of using existing pesticides, are not introduced until
enough experimental work has been done on their attendant hazards (including
contamination of food and harm to wild life) to allow the Government to make
recommendations for their safe use. Products approved for safety may then
be submitted through the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme for
efficiency approval. There is also a voluntary Veterinary Products Safety
Precautions Scheme on similar lines.
A key role in the administration of both these schemes is played by the
Government’s Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals.
Reports of this Committee, published in 1964, concluded that there was no
evidence that the use of the persistent organochlorine pesticides presented any
immediate hazard to human beings and animals, apart from certain species of
predatory birds. In 1967 the Committee recommended that the voluntary safety
precautions schemes should be replaced by compulsory licensing arrangements.
In England and Wales free technical advice on all agricultural and horticultural
matters, other than veterinary, is available through the Ministry’s National
Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS), which is organised on a regional and
county basis. Every county has a county agricultural adviser and is divided
into districts, in each of which there is a district agricultural adviser who can
call on an extensive system of specialist advisers. In Northern Ireland
advisory work is organised by the Ministry of Agriculture, with a county
organisation similar to the NAAS. In Scotland the advisory services, also
similar in scope to the NAAS, are based on the three agricultural colleges.
The Agricultural Land Service, through its qualified land agents, surveyors
and architects, provides a service without charge to owners and occupiers of
both agricultural and horticultural land needing advice on problems arising

from the ownership of land, and investment connected with it. The services
include general advice on the design, layout and construction or improvement
of all types of farm and horticultural buildings as well as roads, fences, shelter
belts and effluent disposal. The Service also provides professional advice and
services to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
Basic agricultural research in Britain is described on p. 198. In England and
Wales, research and advice on farm economics are combined in the Provincial
Agricultural Economics Service, which comprise ten university Departments
of Agricultural Economics and which is co-ordinated by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In Scotland, agricultural economists are
on the staff of the three agricultural colleges. The agricultural departments
in England and Wales and Scotland have economics and statistics units.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture also has an Economics and
Statistics Division and nine other Research Divisions dealing with different
aspects of agricultural research and development.
There are four types of institution which provide full-time education in
agricultural subjects: universities; non-maintained agricultural colleges; in
England and Wales, county agricultural colleges and institutes; and in
Scotland, farm schools. Twelve universities in Britain provide degree and
postgraduate training in agriculture. A National College of Agricultural
Engineering was established in i960 at Silsoe, Bedfordshire, and it offers
degree and postgraduate courses in agricultural engineering. In Northern
Ireland there are three agricultural colleges and two more are planned.
A new pattern of three-year sandwich courses leading to diplomas has
been introduced at three of the four non-maintained agricultural colleges and
at 12 of the county agricultural colleges and institutes in England and Wales.
The older two-year courses will be phased out in a year or two as the new
pattern becomes established. The 31 county colleges and institutes in England
and the five in Wales also provide one-year residential courses in general
agriculture or horticulture with supplementary courses covering the various
specialisms in greater depth. Local education authorities also provide short
courses, block-release, day-release and other part-time classes for farmers,
farm workers and horticulturists, as well as an advisory service for domestic
producers.
There are eight farm schools in Scotland, run by local education authorities,
providing courses—mainly residential—of from one to three years’ duration
for boys and girls of from 12 to 16 years. There is one residential agricultural
school in Northern Ireland, which provides short courses for boys over
15 years of age.
Courses in land management are available at the Universities of Cambridge
and London and at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.
FISHERIES
The sea fishing industry is of especial importance to the economy of Scotland.
In the rest of the United Kingdom it is an important source of employment in
the major fishing ports. The industry falls into three main divisions, concerned
respectively with white fish, herring and shellfish. The major element of the
catch (about 85 per cent by weight) is white fish: the catches of herring and
shellfish, although important, are relatively small. White fish are demersal fish

(such as cod, haddock, plaice, turbot and sole) which live on or near the sea
bed, and also pelagic fish (such as pilchard, mackerel and sprats) which live
mainly in intermediate waters or near the surface. Herring is a pelagic species
and constitutes a separate fishery. Shellfish include Crustacea (such as
lobsters, nephrops and crabs) and molluscs (such as escallops, mussels, cockles
and oysters).
The white fish section of the industry is made up of three main groups:
the distant water, the near and middle water, and the inshore fisheries. The
distant waters are those round Iceland and in the west Atlantic, Greenland,
Bear Island and the north coast of Norway, and the Barents Sea; the middle
water grounds lie around the Faroe Islands; and the near water grounds are
those in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and in the coastal areas around Britain.
The herring fishing grounds are mainly within 60 miles of land. The inshore
waters also yield considerable quantities of shellfish.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, Milford Haven, North Shields and Lowestoft. In Scotland the chief
centres for white fish are Aberdeen, Granton, Fraserburgh, the Moray Firth,
the west coast and Shetland Islands; herring landings are made mainly at
the east coast ports of Aberdeen, Fraserburgh and Peterhead, the west coast
ports of Ullapool, Mallaig, Oban, Tarbert and Ayr, and in Shetland Islands.
In Northern Ireland the fishing ports are Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel.
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, lining, and ring
and drift netting. Trawling is carried out throughout the year in the distant
and near waters for all species of demersal fish. Seining is also used for
catching demersal fish all the year round, mainly in the North Sea, the
Minches, the Firth of Clyde, and the Irish Sea. There are about 600 Scottish
and Northern Ireland seiners, and about 155 operating from English ports.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is summer fishing for herring
based on the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland, and the north-east
coast ports of England. Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast
of Scotland, in the Isle of Man area and off southern Ireland.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and
methods of capture; in addition, there are extensive fisheries for crabs,
lobsters, shrimps, mussels, escallops, cockles and oysters, and, off Scotland,
north-east England and in the Irish Sea there are valuable catches of
‘Norway lobsters’ (nephrops or Dublin Bay prawns).
Distant water vessels, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and
Fleetwood, numbered 165 at the end of 1968. They are mostly over 140 feet in
length and most of them make voyages of 17 to 23 days to fishing grounds in
the Arctic Circle. Partly due to the introduction of freezer trawlers and
factory vessels, there has been an increasing tendency to fish the waters
bordering Newfoundland, Labrador and Greenland. These vessels spend
from one to three months at sea and freeze, in some cases as fillets, much or
all of their catch immediately it is taken. At the same date, near and middle
water vessels numbered 383; they are between 80 and 140 feet long and most
of them work nearer home, making voyages of from a few days up to more
than two weeks, although some of the larger vessels fish regularly off the
Faroes and seasonally as far afield as Iceland. Included in the near water group
are vessels engaged in drift net fishing for herring; these vessels usually make
daily voyages. The inshore group consists mainly of vessels of under 80 feet

which, except for seiners, are seldom at sea for longer than two or three days
and more usually make daily landings, often fishing within sight of land.
In the British fishing industry in 1968 there were about 18,000 fishermen
in regular employment and some 5,000 occasionally employed; about two-
fifths of the former and one-third of the latter were from Scottish ports. In
Northern Ireland there are about 500 regular fishermen.
In 1968 landings of all types of fish by British fishing vessels totalled 900,000
tons (720,000 tons of demersal fish, 140,000 tons of pelagic and 40,000 tons
of shellfish), valued at about ^60 million. Imports totalled about 141,000 tons
of fresh and frozen fish (including 65,000 tons brought direct from the fishing
grounds), valued at about £24 million. Cod accounted for 44 per cent of the
total value of demersal and pelagic fish landed by British vessels; haddock
(19 per cent) and plaice (10 per cent) were the other most important sources of
earnings to the industry.
Imports of all types of fish (fresh, frozen, salted, canned or otherwise
preserved) in 1968 amounted to about 240,000 tons valued at £76 million,
including 44,000 tons of canned salmon to the value of ^33 million and other
canned fish worth £14 million.
Weekly disposals of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish and
imported canned fish) in Britain averaged about 15,500 tons landed weight
in 1968. Although consumption had been declining slightly, on an edible
(fillet) weight basis, it was 16-6 lb. per head in 1968 in comparison with a peak
total of 28-7 lb. in 1948 (see Table 23).
Processing and packaging of fish—curing, kippering, canning and quick-
freezing for consumer packs—are the subject of continuing research and
development. The growth of quick-frozen fish production has altered
radically the structure of the industry. With the increase in quick-freezing
(which now processes over a quarter of all white fish landings), new export
outlets have opened up for white fish, which in 1968 accounted for just under
half the total exports of fish and fish preparations, valued at ^12-3 million.
Exports of shellfish and other fresh, frozen and cured fish increased in 1968,
while exports of canned and preserved fish were somewhat reduced.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal food and, to a much lesser extent, for fertilisers. Home production of
white fish meal and herring meal in 1968 was 87,000 tons.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout, being worth far
more when caught by rod and line than similar fish netted at sea. Drift netting
for salmon is prohibited off the coast of Scotland and is strictly controlled
around England, Wales and Northern Ireland to protect the valuable sport
fisheries in the game rivers. A limited amount of estuary and river netting
for salmon is permitted under licence by river authorities. In England and
Wales the value of the salmon catch is approximately £370,000 a year, in
Scotland it amounts to over £2 million, and in Northern Ireland to some
£200,000. In Northern Ireland, eels worth about £300,000 a year are captured
by long lines and by eel nets placed in river weirs.
The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate
Market in London, which handles about 300 tons a day, but other large
cities also have central fish markets. The principal method of distribution is
through wholesalers, located at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell

to inland wholesalers; the port wholesalers prepare the fish for onward ship¬
ment. Fish lorries, including insulated and refrigerated vehicles, transport
the catch daily from the ports to inland centres, although rail transport is still
used from some ports. Retail sales are handled by some 25,000 to 30,000 fish¬
mongers and fish friers; the latter use about a third of the landings of white fish.
Trawler-owning companies have entered into the marketing and distribu¬
tive system. This process has been encouraged by the growing popularity of
quick-frozen consumer packs, which are sold by other retail outlets, such as
grocers, as well as by fishmongers.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels are provided for under the Merchant
Shipping Acts administered by the Board of Trade, under whose aegis a
committee of enquiry into deep-sea trawler safety was set up in 1968.
The Herring Industry Board was set up under the Herring Industry Act
z935 to reorganise, develop and regulate the herring industry; subsequent
amending Acts have also been passed. The Board consists of a chairman and
three other members, all part-time and independent of the industry, who are
appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, and the Home Secretary. The
Board, whose activities are financed partly by levies and licence fees and
partly by government grants and loans, is advised by the Herring Industry
Advisory Council, consisting of 32 members representing all sections of the
industry and consumers.
The functions of the Board include the promotion of sales of herring, both
at home and abroad, and the application of the benefits of technical progress
to the industry, including the adoption of new methods of catching, processing
and distributing herring. The Board administers the government grant and
loan schemes which provide for assistance towards the purchase of new fishing
vessels, and the improvement of existing vessels. Fishermen may also obtain
loans from the Board towards the purchase of second-hand vessels under
80 feet in length and towards the cost of new nets and gear. Up to 31st March
1969, £2,021,000 in loans and £1,468,000 in grants had been advanced.
The White Fish Authority and the Committee for Scotland and Northern
Ireland of the Authority were set up under the Sea Fish Industry Act 1951.
The function of the Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate the white
fish industry, and that of the Committee to advise the Authority about the
exercise and performance of its functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The Authority is composed of a chairman and six members, and the Scottish
Committee of five members and a chairman who is a member of the
Authority. They are appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Home Secretary
and (in the case of the Authority) the Secretary of State for Wales. The White
Fish Industry Advisory Council was also set up under the 1951 Act to advise
the Authority about the exercise and performance of its functions. It consists
of 53 members representing the various interests of the fishing industry.
The White Fish Authority administers government grant and loan
schemes for the purchase of new fishing vessels and engines and the improve¬
ment of existing vessels. It also administers loans for the purchase of nets and

gear and processing plants. Up to 31st March 1969, £34 million in loans and
^24 million in grants were approved for these purposes by the Authority. Its
other activities are financed by a levy on first-hand sales of fish, and a
government grant towards research and development.
The system which has been in force for some years is that subsidies have been
authorised which vary according to the class of vessel used; they are paid at
the rate of so much per day at sea according to the length of the vessel or at
so much per stone of fish landed, which varies according to the kind of fish,
from certain vessels under 60 feet in length. No subsidy is paid for shellfish.
Subsidies for white fish cost £3,897 million in 1968-69 and those for herring
£207,000.
Under the Sea Fisheries Act 1968 a new scheme of government financial
assistance to the deep-sea fishing industry has been approved by Parliament.
It is proposed to introduce the new form of subsidy for three years initially.
There will be a basic subsidy of £2 million adjusted by reference to operating
profits in the preceding year. The total annual subsidy will be limited to
£4 million, and payment will be related to the operating efficiency of vessels,
not as at present to their classification.
FORESTRY
The estimated total area of productive woodland in Great Britain is 3-28
million acres, or about 6 per cent of the total land area. If account is taken of
areas of scrub and old felled areas, including those cut down in the second
world war, the total rises to 4-35 million acres, or yf per cent of the land area;
about half of the area is in England, two-fifths in Scotland, the remainder in
Wales. The high proportion of unproductive woodland is largely a legacy of
two wars and, while rehabilitation of these areas continues to proceed, it is
unlikely that all areas (for instance, because of remoteness and poor site
conditions) will be replanted. A measure of the extent of rehabilitation is
provided by the fact that the area of unproductive woodland has been reduced
by 300,000 acres since 1945.
The area of productive forest managed by the Forestry Commission, at
1-65 million acres, represents 50 per cent of the total. The annual rate of
productive forest expansion is currently about 52,400 acres by the Commission
and about 35,000 acres by private woodland owners. The Commission’s
programme includes considerable planting in upland areas, especially in
Scotland, and consists mainly of conifers because of the difficult site conditions
encountered. The major species used are Sitka spruce, Lodgepole pine,
Scots pine and Norway spruce. In the older woodlands and taking the country
as a whole, the most common coniferous trees are Scots pine, Sitka spruce,
Norway spruce and the larches, while, among the broadleaved, beech and
oak occur widely.
Except for the period of the two world wars, when much over-felling took
place, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribu¬
tion to the nation’s total requirements of wood and wood products. Britain
imports 90 per cent of its needs by volume and a higher proportion still by
value, the total import cost of wood and wood products being £640 million
in 1968.

The Forestry Acts 1919 to 1945 established the Forestry Commission as the
national forestry authority charged with promoting the interests of forestry,
the development of afforestation and the production and supply of timber in
Great Britain (the Forestry Acts 1919 to 1963 were consolidated in the
Forestry Act 1967). As more and more of its coniferous woods reach the
production stage the Commission has assumed an increasingly important role
as a timber seller. The Commission consists of a part-time chairman, a full¬
time director general, three full-time executive commissioners and five part-
time commissioners. The Commissioners comply with directions given by the
forestry ministers, who are the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland has its
own separate organisation (see p. 325).
The Commission’s total estate covers some 2-8 million acres and includes
1-96 million acres of forest land, of which about 1-64 million are under trees
in nearly 400 forests distributed throughout England, Scotland and Wales. All
these forests are covered by management plans, which provide for such work
as planting, road construction, thinning, fire protection, and timber
production.
As already stated, a substantial amount of the Forestry Commission’s new
planting is carried out in Scotland, much of it in the Highland counties. The
poorer types of land are being used, such as sour, peaty soil which is unsuitable
for agricultural purposes, but has become suitable for forestry as a result of
advances in the technique of deep ploughing.
Production of coniferous timber from Commission woodlands, mainly by
way of thinnings, is expected to rise from about 1-3 million tons in 1968 to
about 2-7 million tons by 1980. Some of this kind of produce is meeting
traditional requirements of the coal mines but much is taken by the paper
pulp industry and by factories established to make chipboard, fibreboard and
wood wool.
The Forestry Fund was constituted under the 1919 Forestry Act; from it is
paid all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid
amounts voted annually by Parliament, together with the Commission’s
receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other sources. In 1967 drawings
from funds voted by Parliament amounted to £15-3 million, and receipts were
£6 million.
Privately owned woods comprise nearly two-thirds of the total forest area in
Great Britain and contain most of the mature and semi-mature timber. The
size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges from a few acres to several
thousand acres, and a high proportion of the private woodland area is in small
ownership (that is, owners of up to about 250 acres).
Impetus was given to the effective management of private woodlands
by the introduction of the Dedication of Woodlands Scheme, initiated in
1947. Under this scheme, owners are invited to put their land permanently
to timber production and to manage their woods in accordance with a plan
agreed with the Forestry Commission, in return for the provision of planting
and management grants and technical advice. By September 1967 the total
area dedicated was 875,000 acres. In addition, there are woodlands covered
by the Approved Woodlands Scheme and the Small Woods Scheme under
which a planting grant, but no management grant, is paid. More than 1 million
acres are managed under the first two schemes. Woodland owners are
represented, in their relations with the Forestry Commission, by the Forestry
324 BRITAIN I970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Committee of Great Britain, which co-ordinates the work of two associations of
woodland owners: the Timber Growers’ Organisation (for owners in England
and Wales) and the Scottish Woodland Owners’ Association.
There are a number of forestry co-operative societies providing for
landowners and farmers the services of skilled staff, centralised purchasing
facilities, and a central agency for the disposal of forest produce. The Forestry
Commission also co-operates with the principal forestry societies, such as the
Royal Forestry Society of England and Wales and the Royal Scottish Forestry
Society, in disseminating technical knowledge.
In 1959 the Home Grown Timber Marketing Corporation was established
by timber merchants to promote the use of home grown timber.
Under the Forestry Act 1967 the Commissioners maintain national com¬
mittees for England, Scotland and Wales, composed partly of Forestry
Commissioners and partly of persons outside the Commission. These
committees act in an advisory capacity, particularly as to the social, recreational
and amenity aspects of the Commissioners’ activities and relationships with
other land users. The Commissioners also maintain a regional advisory
committee for each Conservancy.
Advisory
Bodies
Consultative Other bodies have been set up to provide for consultation on the marketing
Machinery and utilisation of home grown timber. The Home Grown Timber Advisory
Committee (HGTAC) is a statutory body and includes representatives of
associations of landowners, timber merchants and processors and the trade
unions under an independent chairman. In 1949 the Forestry Commissioners
set up the Advisory Committee on Utilisation of Home Grown Timber (now
a sub-committee of the HGTAC) to advise on measures designed to promote
utilisation of produce from British woodlands.
A voluntary scheme was agreed upon in 1961 for consultation on proposals
for afforestation of land within National Parks (see p. 174). The Timber
Growers’ Organisation and the Country Landowners’ Association undertook
to advise their members to notify the park planning authorities about their
planting proposals.
Forestry The Forestry Commission maintains three forester training schools: in
Education and England, at Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire; in Wales, near
Research Betws-y-Coed in Caernarvonshire; and in Scotland at Faskally, near Pitlochry
in Perthshire. All three will be closed by 1972 as the responsibility for forester
training is being assumed by the Department of Education and Science.
Northerwood House in the New Forest, Hampshire, is the Commission’s
educational centre, and is used for practical courses for Commission staff and
for university students, landowners and agents, planning officers, school
teachers and others.
An Agricultural, Horticultural and Forestry Industry Training Board and a
Furniture and Timber Industry Training Board have been set up to provide
for training in forestry for employees of private woodland owners and in the
home-grown timber trade.
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities; a propor¬
tion of graduates is recruited by the Commission as forest officers.
The Commission’s Forest Research Station at Alice Holt Lodge, near
Farnham, Surrey, was opened in 1946. Expenditure on research work at this
station and in experimental areas in many forests in Great Britain amounted
to £717,000 in 1967. This sum included grants for special forestry research
Forestry in

Ireland
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 325
work to various institutions and to university departments including the
Commonwealth Forestry Institute at Oxford, which is also financed by the
university, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and overseas governments.
Research into the qualities of home-grown timber is carried out by the Forest
Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, Bucks, and also by
grant-aided research associations.
When the Government of Northern Ireland was formed in 1922, the new
Ministry of Agriculture became the forest authority working with similar
powers and duties to those conferred on the Forestry Commission by the
Forestry Act 1919. At that time the Ministry took over some 4,000 acres
for afforestation, of which 700 acres had been planted.
Forest policy is carried out under the authority of the Forestry Act
(Northern Ireland) 1953, which replaced earlier legislation. This Act pro¬
vides the Ministry with powers to acquire and manage land, and to give
financial and technical assistance for private planting. It introduced measures
for the protection of all woodlands, whether owned by the State or privately
owned, against destruction by over-cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
The State forest area has grown steadily and at a greatly accelerated pace
since the end of the second world war. By 1969 over 150,000 acres had been
acquired, of which about 95,000 acres had been planted. The present
afforestation programme provides for the creation, as soon as possible, of an
area of 150,000 acres of productive forest.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and
from receipts from forest produce and other sources. About 1,000 people are
employed in field labour and ancillary work. The area of exploitable private
woodlands is at present about 35,000 acres, and private planting, which is
gaining impetus, is assisted by schemes for the supply at a low cost of young
trees from the Ministry’s nurseries, by grants towards the cost of the estab¬
lishment of new plantations, and by free technical advice.
Pomeroy Forestry School at Pomeroy House, Co. Tyrone, provides
training and refresher courses for forestry workers, school teachers and
others interested in trees and forestry.
13 TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS
Technical
Trends
Inland and overseas transport and communications employed 6-4 per cent
of the total labour force in the United Kingdom in June 1968. Of the i-6
million persons so occupied, 31 per cent were engaged in road passenger
transport and road haulage contracting, 18 per cent in railways and 27 per
cent in postal services and telecommunications; sea and air transport absorbed
respectively 6 per cent and 4 per cent; port and inland water transport
and miscellaneous transport services and storage absorbed 14 per cent.
Transport and communications contribute about 8 per cent of the gross
national product and are responsible for the same proportion of the nation’s
gross fixed capital formation.
SHIPPING
Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over 11 per
cent is registered in Britain, making the British merchant fleet one of the
largest in active employment. The British shipping industry is, however,
exposed to severe international competition. The position has been made
more difficult by the prevalence among competitors of such practices as
flag discrimination and the use of ‘flags of convenience’. While from 1958 to
1968 Britain’s merchant fleet increased by 8 per cent from 20-3 million to
21-9 million gross tons, the total tonnage of all other countries, excluding the
US Reserve Fleet, increased by 98 per cent, from 84 million to 165 million
gross tons. After being positive until about 1959 the balance of payments
for shipping services remained adverse until 1965, but showed an estimated
surplus of j£6i million in 1968. Shipping’s net contribution to Britain’s
foreign exchange earnings was estimated at some £260 million in 1968.
By 1968 over 60 per cent of all tonnage was diesel-driven. In a variety of ways
technological change has been proceeding more rapidly under current
conditions. Vessels are becoming obsolete over a shorter period and as they
do so are being replaced by larger ships, with generally lower building costs per
ton; labour-saving devices, greater speeds and faster turn-round facilities
are reducing operating costs. The tendency to greater average size has
been the most marked in tankers and dry bulk cargo ships. Vessels are
specially built to carry ore, vegetable oils, cement, wine and various kinds of
chemicals. Many ships have been designed to carry fully loaded road vehicles,
pallets and containers. In particular the use of containers on long door-to-
door journeys can result in speedier, safer and cheaper carriage of a wide
range of goods. Two consortia of British shipping companies are operating
specially designed deep-sea cellular container ships on services to Australia,
and another company is operating a similar service to Canada.
1 One gross ton (g.t.)= 100 cubic feet. One deadweight ton (d.w.t.)= 1 long ton
(2,240 lb.). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed spaces on a ship.
Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which a vessel can carry before
submerging the load-line.

over were both owned and registered in Britain.1 The usual employment of
this fleet has been analysed by the United Kingdom Chamber of Shipping as
follows: 6-7 million gross tons were employed as foreign-going passenger and
cargo liners; 3-5 million gross tons as foreign-going tramps; 6-8 million gross
tons as foreign-going tankers; and o-8 million gross tons in coasting and trade
with ports between the Elbe and Brest (home trades).
Over one-third of British-owned shipping registered in the United Kingdom
consists of ocean-going passenger-cargo and cargo liners, mostly the latter.
Practically all these ships are owned by large liner companies. Many operate
wide networks of scheduled cargo and passenger services which, between
them, cover every ocean. The 3-5 million gross tons of ocean-going tramp
ships are operated by a large number of private owners, some having only a
small number of ships and some only one ship.
Examples of major British liner shipping companies operating scheduled
services from the United Kingdom are: the Cunard, to North America; the
Royal Mail, to South America; the Blue Funnel, to Australia and the Far
East; the Peninsular and Oriental (P. & O.) and the British India lines, to
India, Australia and the Far East; the Union Castle, to South and East Africa;
Elder Dempster, to West Africa; Furness Withy, to North America and the
West Indies; the New Zealand line, to Australia and New Zealand; and Shaw
Savill and Albion, to Australia and New Zealand. These and the other major
liner companies have for the most part amalgamated to form a small number
of major groups, of which the largest and best known are the P. & O., the
Furness Withy, the Ocean S.S., and the British and Commonwealth groups.
Over two-thirds of the total tanker fleet belong to the oil companies,
although there are a few important independent United Kingdom tanker¬
owning companies.
A government guaranteed loan scheme to benefit British shipowners
ordering from British shipyards was introduced in 1967.
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation (distinct from the Society of Lloyd’s, see
p. 377) which surveys and classifies ships with particular regard to their
safety and operational efficiency. It will accept responsibility for surveying
and giving technical advice on vessels of all flags from the initial stages of
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft,
Admiralty vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries
(including over 1 million gross tons of tankers).

building, at regular intervals during their service, and after casualties. A
satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an underwriter that he may
accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between the Register
and the Society of Lloyd’s.
The representative body speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for
the most part, owners of fishing vessels) is the Chamber of Shipping. There
are a number of local associations of shipowners centred around the main port
areas. Other organisations represent companies specialising in a particular
trade or type of cargo.
The British Shippers’ Council, formed in 1955, represents the shipping
interests of exporters and importers in matters of both national and inter¬
national concern.
The British Shipping Federation Limited is the employers’ organisation
concerned with labour relations and the regulation of employment throughout
the Merchant Navy. It is responsible for the administration of the Merchant
Navy Established Service Scheme, under which shipowners engaging crews
for ships of 200 gross tons and above engage them through the Merchant Navy
Establishment Administration unless they are prepared to offer two-year
company service contracts.
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representa¬
tives of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations of
wages and conditions of service in the Merchant Navy.
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a
series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of rates,
and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle
of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or
passenger fares from each port of departure. Each conference meets from
time to time to review and revise existing rates, or to compile new ones. Some
of the conferences are connected by rate agreements, or have joined together
to form wider groupings. There are over 60 conferences dealing with trade to
and from the United Kingdom.
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of
London’s seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest market
for the chartering of ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’
representatives meet here to arrange the chartering of dry-cargo tramp ships
for the carriage of goods to and from all parts of the world.
The Board of Trade is the government department responsible for most
matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the Merchant Shipping
Act 1894 and subsequent legislation, it administers many regulations for
marine safety and welfare, for instance: certifying the load-line (or Plimsoll
line) that shows that a ship is not overloaded; ensuring that standards of
safety are observed in ship construction; ensuring the provision of adequate
life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment; and dealing with the discipline,
professional standards, health and accommodation of seamen. Most of the
work which these responsibilities entail is carried out by the officers of the
Marine Survey and Mercantile Marine at the ports. There is also a Registrar-

General of Shipping and Seamen, in whose office at Cardiff a complete record
of all British ships and seamen is kept.
Abroad, certain parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts, in particular those
provisions dealing with the engagement and discharge of crews outside the
United Kingdom, are administered by H.M. Consuls and by officers of
Commonwealth Governments.
The discharge of oil into British territorial waters was first restricted in 1922.
Britain is a party to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of
the Pollution of the Sea by Oil which came into force in 1958. The nations
ratifying this convention (now numbering over 30) agree to prohibit their
national fleets from discharging persistent oil within a certain distance of
any coast (originally 50 miles but under amendments in 1962 extended in
many areas to 100 miles or more) and also in extensive areas of the north-east
Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, the whole of the North Sea, and around
Australia. The provisions were given legal effect for British ships under the
Oil in Navigable Waters Act 1955 which also prohibits the discharge of any
kind of oil from British and foreign vessels into British territorial waters.
Amendments to the 1954 Convention were agreed in 1962 and came into
force on 18th May 1967; the Oil in Navigable Waters Act 1963, applying the
amendments to British ships, became effective on the same date. The
Convention as amended prohibits ships of 20,000 gross tons and over, built
after 18th May 1967, from discharging persistent oil anywhere at sea.
Over 300,000 vessels pass through the Dover Strait every year. Recommended
one-way routes were marked in 1967 by navigational aids provided by the
French and British lighthouse authorities—a scheme worked out by the joint
Institutes of Navigation of France, the Federal Republic of Germany and
Britain and agreed by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative
Organisation, a United Nations agency with headquarters in London.
Additional traffic-separation schemes in areas around British and other coasts
have since been adopted, and others are under consideration.
The Board of Trade administers the Coastguard Service. This is primarily a
life-saving organisation which keeps watch at danger points around the coast
for vessels in distress and renders assistance either by coastguard rescue
equipment or by informing other authorities who may be able to give help.
There are some 550 regular coastguards and about 7,000 part-time auxiliary
coastguards. During the year ended 31st March 1969 life-saving action was
taken on 2,444 occasions. There is close liaison between the Coastguard
Service and the Royal National Life-boat Institution. The latter maintains
lifeboats and fast inshore rescue boats around the coast of the United Kingdom;
it is supported entirely by voluntary contributions, and depends largely for its
operation on voluntary workers. From its foundation in 1824 to the end of
1968 the Royal National Life-boat Institution saved 90,357 lives. Lifeboats
and inshore rescue boats were launched 2,295 ti™68 in !968 and rescued
1,008 people.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel
Islands and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its
first Royal Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a Board
of ten Elder Brethren, elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.
Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the

Lights. Trinity House controls about 60 lighthouses, many minor lights and
buoys, and a number of lightships, some of which are to be replaced by
unattended sea marks or by light towers; in 1969 a £600,000 concrete light
tower replaced the Royal Sovereign lightship off the Sussex coast.
Trinity House is also the chief pilotage authority, licensing some 700 pilots
in 41 districts in England and Wales, including London, Southampton and
Milford Haven. In some cases the harbour authority or local council is the
pilotage authority. In Britain there are 48 pilotage authorities for the 92
pilotage districts and over 1,600 licensed pilots. The Board of Trade also has
certain responsibilities in connection with lighthouses and pilotage.
About 86,000 United Kingdom personnel and a considerably smaller number
of aliens are employed by the merchant fleet.
The Board of Trade holds examinations for, and issues certificates of
competency to, ships’ officers as master, first mate and second mate of
foreign-going ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first-class
engineer and second-class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on board
ships in these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a higher, certificate.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio¬
telegraphy issued by the Minister of Post and Telecommunications on the
results of an open examination.
A seaman may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom
registered ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B. granted
by the Board of Trade, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain this certificate
a seaman must, among other qualifications, have served three years at sea on
deck, have obtained a certificate of efficiency as lifeboatman and have passed
a qualifying examination.
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of petty officer.
Service as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examina¬
tion for a second mate’s certificate.
The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies
of apprentices, cadets and ratings who are preparing for their examinations
for the various certificates of competency.
Wages and conditions of employment are negotiated by the National Maritime
Board. Minimum wages and holidays with pay are guaranteed for both officers
and ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme,
introduced by the Board in 1947, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take
two-year contracts, not only with individual shipping companies but with
the industry as a whole, and get special benefits between voyages in addition
to the normal unemployment insurance benefit.
There are over 300 sea ports in Britain. In 1968, 176 million tons of imports,
including 105 million tons of petroleum and petroleum products, passed
through the ports and 40 million tons of exports and re-exports, including
4 million tons of coal. Coastal traffic amounted to 106 million tons, principally
petroleum and coal.
As a result both of the anticipated increase in the country’s trade and of
technological changes affecting sea-going traffic (such as the shift to larger
tankers and bulk carriers implying a need for more deep-water berths,
demand for the development of mechanical handling methods, packaging of

general cargo in standard sizes and container and ‘roll-on, roll-off’ services)
large-scale modernisation of the ports system became necessary. Con¬
sequently capital investment in ports has risen from about £18 million
a year in the early 1960s to some £50 million in 1969.
The Port of London, with 92 miles of waterway and about 4,000 acres of
dock estate, including 36 miles of quayage, is the largest port in the Common¬
wealth and, with New York and Rotterdam, is one of the three largest ports
in the world. The Port of London Authority operates four main groups of
docks. A further group of older up-river docks was closed in 1968, and
facilities down-river, notably at Tilbury, are being extensively developed.
About 60 million tons of cargo were handled in 1968. Among the chief
commodities handled are petroleum, coal, timber and grain. Other imports
include textile fibres, scrap, sugar and meat. Vehicles, machinery and food¬
stuffs predominate among exports.
Liverpool is the second largest port in Britain. It handles a large proportion
of Britain’s exports to the Far East. There are extensive facilities for dealing
with imports of grain, sugar, wool and other specialist cargoes. In 1968 over
29 million tons of cargo passed through the port.
Other major ports are Hull and Immingham on the Humber, the port of
Clyde (or Clydeport) which includes the docks at Glasgow and at Greenock
(now being developed as a container port), Manchester (an inland port reached
from the Mersey via the Manchester Ship Canal), Bristol on the Bristol
Channel, and Southampton on Southampton Water. Other estuaries impor¬
tant for shipping are the Firth of Forth on the east coast of Scotland (Grange¬
mouth and Leith), the Tyne (Newcastle), the Tees (Middlesbrough and the
Hartlepools), and the Stour and Orwell on the East Anglian coast (Harwich,
Felixstowe and Ipswich). Among the smaller ports which have been growing
rapidly are Felixstowe, Grangemouth, and Shoreham on the south coast. The
major oil importing centres are London, the Medway, Milford Haven,
Southampton, Liverpool, Manchester, and Finnart on the Clyde; Port
Talbot and Newport in South Wales, the Tees, the port of Clyde and Liver¬
pool are the main ore handling ports; London, Liverpool, Bristol and Hull are
among the chief grain importers; and London, Hull, Liverpool and Garston
are the main timber ports. Dover is Britain’s most important port for short-sea
voyage passengers, and Southampton for travellers by ocean liner. Grimbsy,
Hull and Aberdeen are the largest fishing ports.
A development scheme costing over £30 million has been carried out at
Tilbury, London. In addition to a grain terminal, freightliner terminal, and
a riverside impounding station, a dock extension project, finished in 1969,
has provided 13 new deep-water berths, six of them for container traffic.
Another major scheme, costing over ^33 million and including deep-sea
container berths, is under construction at Seaforth, Liverpool. Container
facilities have also been provided at Southampton (where a completely new
container berth came into operation in 1969 and another is under construction),
Harwich, Greenock (port of Clyde), Felixstowe, Manchester, Newport and
Grangemouth. At Hull a £7 million extension to King George Dock was
brought into operation in 1969, and a new deep-sea coal terminal is being
provided at Immingham. A ^17 million deep-water harbour was completed
at Port Talbot in 1969, and serves as an ore terminal for the British Steel
Corporation.

The Minister of Transport makes grants of 20 per cent of approved capital
expenditure to statutory and other harbour authorities and persons carrying
out harbour operations.
Since 1948 ports handling about a fifth of the national sea-borne trade have
been government owned; the British Transport Docks Board (see p. 334)
owns the majority of such ports, which include Southampton, Hull, Imming-
ham, Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. The Government has proposed that
the major ports should be reorganised on the basis of public ownership.1
In 1968 shipping arrivals and departures at BTDB docks totalled over
no million net registered tons (including fishing vessels), and the total cargo
handled was about 75 million tons. Certain ports and docks used largely in
conjunction with railway services are administered by the British Railways
Board: examples are Folkestone, Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and
Parkeston Quay (at Harwich).
Other ports are controlled by public trusts on which are represented users
of the port, by local authorities and other interested bodies or by companies.
Examples of ports under public trusts are London (Port of London Authority),
Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour Board), and Belfast (Belfast Harbour
Commissioners). Several new estuarial authorities have been set up by
means of harbour reorganisation schemes under the 1964 Harbours Act.
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the main, set
down in private Acts of Parliament, other local legislation, and orders made
under the Harbours Act 1964.
The National Ports Council, set up in 1964 as a statutory body under the
Harbours Act of that year, is financed by a levy on harbour authorities and is
primarily an advisory body. It advises the minister on major port develop¬
ments, and has various responsibilities in relation to research, training and
charges, its main task being the supervision of long-term national planning
for the ports as a whole.
About 120,000 people are employed in the operation of ports in the United
Kingdom. At the end of 1968 there were 55,000 dock workers registered with
the National Dock Labour Board, concerned primarily with loading and
unloading cargo. The remainder included administrative, clerical and
technical staff, and pilots, lightermen and customs officials.
Because arrivals and departures of ships are liable to occur at irregular
intervals without conforming to set schedules a system of largely casual
labour existed at the docks in the past. However, a start was made on
‘decasualisation’ in 1941 when war-time controls were imposed. In 1947 the
National Dock Labour Board was established, with members appointed by
the Minister of Labour and representing both employers and workpeople, to
administer a scheme under which registered workers received a guaranteed
minimum wage for attendance even when no work was available. Under the
new government proposals the functions of the Dock Labour Board would be
transferred to the subsidiaries of the National Ports Authority and to Dock
Labour Committees.
In September 1967 each registered dockworker was placed in employment
with a licensed employer on a permanent basis in accordance with the
1 In a White Paper published in January 1969 (see Bibliography, p. 483) the Government

recommendations of the 1965 Devlin report (see Bibliography, p. 483).
Work is proceeding on rationalisation of the industry’s pay structure and
the elimination of all remaining restrictive practices.
Most of the oil tankers coming to the United Kingdom to discharge crude oil
are berthed at special tanker terminals which are near the oil refineries and are
owned and operated by the oil companies. The maximum deadweight tonnage
of fully laden tankers that some of the most important terminals can accom¬
modate at present is: Finnart (Clyde) 100,000; Isle of Grain (Thames estuary)
65,000; Coryton (London) 85,000; Tilbury Reach (London) 47,000; Thames
Haven (London) 100,000; Tranmere (Liverpool) 100,000; Milford Haven
(Pembroke) 100,000; and Fawley (Southampton) 100,000. Long pipelines
connect Finnart with the refinery at Grangemouth on the Firth of Forth,
Angle Bay (Milford Haven) with the refinery at Llandarcy (near Swansea)
and Stanlow (Merseyside) with the refinery at Heysham (Lancashire).
Facilities are being extended to accommodate larger vessels; Finnart and
Coryton will be able to accept tankers of 200,000 tons (partly laden). Follow¬
ing dredging Milford Haven will be able to take 255,000-ton vessels.
A deep-water oil terminal, costing £5 million, and serving two new oil
refineries, was brought into operation at Immingham (Humberside) in 1969.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The dense passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain1 is carried mainly
by road and rail, although coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, inland
waterways and pipelines are important in carrying certain types of freight,
particularly bulk cargoes. A small but increasing proportion goes by air.
Part of the inland transport system of Great Britain is nationalised; namely,
the railways, passenger transport in the London area, a large proportion of
road passenger and some road haulage services, most of the inland waterways
and some of the vessels on them. Road haulage is largely, and coastal shipping
almost entirely, in the hands of private enterprise.
In the third quarter of 1968 there were about 14-5 million vehicles licensed for
use on the roads. Of these, nearly 11 million were motor cars and 1-3 million
motor cycles, 2 per cent of the i-6 million road goods vehicles and 60 percent
of the public road passenger vehicles (excluding taxis) were publicly owned.
In 1968, 59 per cent of freight, in terms of ton-mileage,2 travelled by road,
20 per cent by rail, 20 per cent by coastal shipping, and 1 per cent by pipeline.
Since 1945 the rapid growth of private and commercial motor traffic, causing
congestion problems of increasing severity, especially in cities and towns, and
and the changing pattern of demand for transport services have led successive
Governments to undertake or commission fundamental studies of probable
trends in transport and problems which may arise therefrom. Over the
period 1966-75 an increase of over 50 per cent is forecast for total passenger
mileage, with demand for public transport diminishing and travel by private
transport still rising fast. Freight ton-mileage may rise by over 10 per cent,
fuel and steel traffic fall by 15 per cent as a result of structural and technological
change, while other freight traffic is expected to grow by some 30 per cent.

it was transported.

The Buchanan report, published in November 1963, was the result of a
study group set up to examine the problems of traffic in urban areas. It
estimated that Britain would have 40 million vehicles on its roads by a.d. 2010
and proposed radical measures to rebuild and adapt cities and roads to handle
the growth of traffic. It is now expected that the number of vehicles on the
roads will double by 1990.
The railway network has been reduced by nearly a third in recent years,
but it was decided in 1967 to fix a basic network of some 11,000 route-miles
for modernisation and development.
The present role and structure of the nationalised transport undertakings are
the result of a series of legislative measures, starting with the 1947 Transport
Act under which they were taken into public ownership. In accordance with
this Act the British Transport Commission (BTC) was established on
1 st January 1948 and assumed control of Britain’s railways, all railway-owned
steamships, docks, hotels and road transport interests, most of the country’s
canals (including all those owned by the railways), certain rivers (as navigation
authority) and the whole of the London passenger transport system. It was
also to arrange for the gradual acquisition of privately owned long-distance
road haulage firms.
Changes of policy following the coming into power of a Conservative
Government in 1951 were put into effect under the Transport Act 1953 which
modified the functions of the BTC. The Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage
Property) Act 1956 provided for the completion of the denationalisation of
road haulage, a process begun under the 1953 Act.
Over the next few years it became apparent that the activities of the BTC were
so large and diverse that they could not be run effectively as a single under¬
taking. The Transport Act 1962 therefore dissolved the BTC and set up four
boards, for British Railways, London Transport, British Transport Docks
and British Waterways. Each of these was responsible to the Minister of
Transport, who appointed the members.
The shipping services operated by British Railways and certain ports and
docks used for them passed to the British Railways Board.
The hotel property of the BTC was transferred to British Transport Hotels
Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary, first of the BTC and later of the British
Railways Board.
Road passenger, haulage and other undertakings, such as British Road
Services, the Tilling Bus Group, the Scottish Omnibuses Group, Thomas
Cook and Son, were operated as companies incorporated under the Companies
Act, with their own boards; they were grouped under a Transport Holding
Company, responsible to the Minister of Transport.
The Government’s plans to integrate and modernise the national transport
system are being put into effect under the provisions of the 1968 Transport
Act which has considerably altered the transport pattern laid down by the
1962 Act. The Act provided for a capital reconstruction and reorganisation of
British Railways; the setting up of Passenger Transport Authorities to control
and co-ordinate local transport arrangements; three new nationalised bodies—
a National Bus Company, a Scottish Transport Group and a National Freight
Corporation; a new licensing system and safety provisions for road haulage
operators; and new grants for public transport. Most of the functions of
the Transport Holding Company have been distributed among the new
bodies.

Britain was the pioneer of railways. The opening of the Stockton to Darlington
Railway in 1825, and of the Liverpool and Manchester line in 1830, when
George Stephenson’s famous ‘Rocket’ locomotive was used, began a century
of widespread railway development. The great period of railway building
was from 1840 to 1875.
The railways first came under centralised government direction during the
first world war, and afterwards some 130 private companies were amalgamated
into four large regional groups under the Railways Act 1921. Thereafter they
suffered from the prolonged industrial depression and growing competition
from road transport, and following the second world war the Transport Act
1947 brought the railways under public ownership as a single enterprise,
British Railways, operated under the overall management of a Railway
Executive established as the agent of the BTC. Under the Transport Act 1962
the British Railways Board was set up and came into existence on 1st January
1963 with sole responsibility for managing railway affairs.
In spite of technical and operational advances the Board’s financial position
remained unsatisfactory and, following a detailed review of railway policy,
the 1968 Transport Act made far-reaching changes. Capital debt was written
down from ^1,562 million (of which j£7°5 miHkm had already been suspended
under the 1962 Act) to ^300 million. Grants for rail passenger services which
are unremunerative but which are regarded as socially necessary were
introduced; £62 million was so paid in 1969. Grants not exceeding a total of
^50 million may be paid to the Railways Board on a gradually diminishing
scale during the years 1969 to 1973 towards the cost of maintaining surplus
track and signalling equipment pending their elimination; ^15 million was
paid in 1969. Deficit financing, which had been in operation since 1963,
ceased in 1968 and the Board is now expected to pay its way; the working
deficit for 1968 was £76 million. Other provisions of the Act removed certain
restrictions on the Board’s powers to manufacture and to run hotels, and
reduced the size of the Board.
The process of rationalisation arising from changing public transport require¬
ments is reflected in the reduction of over 5>000 ufil65 standard-gauge route
since 1961. A total of 830 million passenger journeys was made and 207 million
tons of freight traffic conveyed on British Railways in 1968; total receipts
amounted to £457 million. The railway operating deficit in 1968 was £91
million, while there was an overall surplus of ^8 million on other activities
ships, harbours, hotels and letting of land. At the end of 1968, 296,000 people
were employed by the railways, a reduction of 103,000 in four years.
In 1968 a subsidiary, British Transport Hotels Ltd., managed 34 (in¬
cluding one opened in 1968) hotels and the catering facilities on trains
(including Pullman trains); it also owned refreshment rooms at 197 stations,
managing 155 of them.
British Railways’ subsidiary, British Rail Hovercraft Ltd., set up in 1966,
runs regular hovercraft services across the Solent to the Isle of Wight, and
across the Channel between Dover and Boulogne. The 165-ton Mountbatten
(SRN-4) hovercraft, the largest in the world, is used for cross-channel
journeys.
The Railways Board and the shipping subsidiaries of the National Freight
Corporation have between them a fleet of about 100 vessels, providing
passenger and freight services on most of the important routes between
Great Britain and the Continent and the Republic of Ireland, as well as on
336 BRITAIN I970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
many domestic routes. Ownership of domestic services in Scotland was
transferred to the Scottish Transport Group under the Transport Act 1968.
Development In 1955 the BTC produced a modernisation plan designed to transform
virtually all the services offered by the railways. The plan has since been
modified in the light of ensuing economic and technical developments,
but capital expenditure has been substantial over the past few years and in
1968 amounted to £87 million.
The most important developments have been the replacement of steam by
diesel and electric traction completed in 1968; the improvement of inter-city
passenger services with the emphasis on speed, reliability and comfort;
the introduction of express freight services (‘freightliners’) enabling freight
to be handled throughout transit in standard containers (now the responsi¬
bility of Freightliners Ltd., see p. 337); and increased mechanisation in the
carrying of coal.
On main lines in 1955 there were about 18,000 steam, 7 mainline diesel
and 71 electric locomotives. At the end of 1968 there were 4,326 diesel
and 329 electric locomotives. In addition there were 3,810 diesel passenger¬
carrying multiple units and 7,348 electric multiple units.
The Board’s current programme includes the replacement of old passenger
coaches by new stock with improved amenities, and the construction of
new electric multiple unit stock to replace old vehicles. On certain sections
of the London—Bristol—South Wales line and of the London—Edinburgh
line passenger trains are permitted to run up to 100 mph. Similar speeds are
also in operation on the London Midland Region’s services on the electrified
line between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool. This electri¬
fication scheme, costing some jf 160 million, was the largest individual
capital investment project ever undertaken by British Railways and included
station reconstruction, bridgeworks, a new colour-light signalling system
and new rolling stock. Work on the scheme was finally completed in 1967.
Other projects have involved the electrification of the London-South-
ampton-Bournemouth line, the extension of modern signalling facilities and
the rebuilding of various stations, notably at Euston (London) at an estimated
cost of ^15 million and in Birmingham.
Motorail services (carrying both passengers and cars) have developed
fast and have a current capacity of 100,000 cars. The world’s first car-train
terminal was opened in London in 1966.
The efficiency of freight services is being improved as new vehicles come
into service and as facilities for concentrating traffic at fewer and better
equipped and sited marshalling yards and terminals are completed. The
freightliner services, now the responsibility of Freightliners Ltd. (see p. 337),
are to be developed further to bring the number of main terminals in operation
to 21. Services are operated throughout the country and to the Continent.
Traffic trebled in 1968. The first freightliner ran in November 1965.
The London International Freight Terminal, opened in 1967, links the
British Railways container port of Harwich with the main freightliner network.
The first fully cellular container ships built in a British yard are being used in
British Railways container services between Harwich and Zeebrugge, opened
in 1968.
Bulk products traffic is increasing. Oil is being moved from refineries
under long-term contracts, while coal is being fed direct from collieries to
power stations in ‘merry-go-round’ trains, on which coal is loaded and dis¬
charged automatically from a new type of high-capacity wagon. Long-term

contracts are in operation for the carriage of cars, china clay, milk, grain and
newspapers. ‘Steel liner’ trains have been running from South Wales since
i967*
British Railways’ workshops have been reorganised and modernised
into 15 main works, employing some 38,000 people, mostly on repairs and
construction of rolling stock.
The Railway Technical Centre at Derby covers 20 acres and will eventually
employ about 1,500 people. Work is proceeding on a large number of projects,
a major one being the development of a 150 mph gas turbine powered
passenger train to run over existing tracks. With the associated train control
system it is being given government financial help.
The National Freight Corporation was set up under the 1968 Transport
Act to provide or promote the provision of integrated road and rail freight
services, making the maximum economic use of rail. The Corporation took
over all the road haulage and most of the shipping interests of the Transport
Holding Company, and from the Railways Board the depots, vehicles,
warehouses, containers and other equipment, though not the actual trains
used, in the freightliners and sundries services, and also the Board’s road
haulage vehicles.
Freightliners Ltd., a company jointly owned by the Freight Corporation
and the Railways Board (with 51 per cent and 49 per cent of the shares
respectively), is responsible for the marketing and management of freightliner
services. The Railways Board makes a charge for providing and hauling the
trains, and profits are divided between the Board and the Corporation in
proportion to their holdings.
A Freight Integration Council was set up under the 1968 Act to advise
the Minister of Transport and the Secretary of State for Scotland on the
provision of integrated freight services by publicly owned bodies. It consists
of several independent members with an independent chairman, the chairmen
of the Freight Corporation and the Railways Board, and members representing
union interests.
The British and French Governments have agreed to the construction of a
rail Channel Tunnel (either a bored tunnel or an immersed tube) provided
that finance can be raised on acceptable terms in the private sector. The
construction cost is estimated at about £200 million. It is expected that the
Tunnel will be open in the 1970s.
The advent of the motor vehicle made it necessary for the Government to
set up a central road authority; accordingly, the Road Board was established
by the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909. In 1919 the
Board’s responsibilities were taken over by the newly established Ministry of
Transport.
In April 1968 Great Britain had 197,430 miles of public highway. There
were 8,379 miles of all-purpose trunk roads and 540 miles of motorways,
20,216 miles of principal roads, and 168,295 m^es °f other roads. Roads
are classified according to their traffic value, those of purely local traffic
importance remaining unclassified. Under the Local Government Act 1966
the classification of important roads other than trunk roads into classes I, II
and III (still retained for certain purposes) has been superseded, as far as the
making of grants for road building is concerned, by two categories of ‘principal’
roads, roughly equivalent in mileage to the Class I roads, and others. On maps
and signposts the trunk and principal roads can usually be identified by the

letter ‘A’ (or, in the case of motorways, ‘M’) in front of a route number. Trunk
roads are the main arteries of national traffic and the whole cost of their
upkeep is met from Exchequer funds. The Minister of Transport is the
highway authority for trunk roads in England and on these roads he
administers expenditure, which is provided wholly from central government
sources, although for many purposes he employs local authorities as his
agents. Work on major trunk road schemes, including motorways, is controlled
by regional road construction units, manned jointly by Ministry of Transport
and county council staff. The highway authority for principal roads is, in
general, the council of the county or county borough in whose area the roads
lie. The Minister makes specific grants towards approved expenditure on
construction and major improvement of these roads and contributions from
public funds towards maintenance and other expenditure is made through
grants to local authorities. The Secretary of State for Scotland has corres¬
ponding responsibilities for roads in Scotland and the Secretary of State for
Wales for roads in Wales. Roads other than trunk and principal roads are
entirely the responsibility of the local authority in whose area they lie.
A large and steadily expanding road-building programme has been in progress
since 1955. Public expenditure on new and improved roads in Great Britain
is estimated at over £2°° million in 1969-70. The current programme includes
a considerable mileage of motorways constructed for the use of limited classes
of traffic under powers granted by the Special Roads Act 1949 (consolidated in
the Highways Act 1959).
The motorways form part of a programme designed to provide a national
network of modern through routes. At the same time, work done under this
programme is eliminating some of the worst bottlenecks in urban areas and
thus helping to give free outlets from the big cities and from other main
sources of traffic to the trunk routes. Urban motorways are being built or are
already open in London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Bristol, Manchester, Leeds
and Newcastle.
Proposals for an inter-urban road plan, to be carried out in England over
the ten to 15 years following the completion of the current programme in the
early 1970s and with improvements to other trunk roads to cost about £2,250
million, were put forward by the Government early in 1969.
It is planned that 1,000 miles of motorways should be completed by the
early 1970s. At the end of May 1969 in England and Wales, 570 miles had
been opened for traffic and construction had started or tenders had been
invited for a further 294 miles. The lines of an additional 221 miles had been
fixed and draft schemes published for 96 miles. It is expected that some 720
miles of motorways will be in use by 1970- Among the motorways in England
and Wales open to traffic or under construction in May 1969 were:
Mi—London to Yorkshire (Leeds and Doncaster). The length of this
motorway is 206 miles including the Mio, M18 and M45 spurs, and
provides links between London, Birmingham and the Midlands, and
Yorkshire, the last section (outside London) being brought into use in
1968.

M4—London to South Wales. The projected length of this road, which
will link London with Newport, is 140 miles. In the east, 24 miles are in
use from Chiswick to Maidenhead, including a one-mile spur to London
Airport; a section of 38 J miles of road from Newport (Monmouthshire) to
Tormarton (Gloucestershire) including the bridge over the Severn was
completed in 1967. The route has been fixed for the 78 miles still
to be built, between the Maidenhead bypass and Tormarton, and
construction work is in progress.
M5—Birmingham to Bristol. Of this 114-mile motorway eventually reaching
to Edithmead (22 miles beyond Bristol), the first 26 miles running south
from Birmingham were opened in July 1962, followed by a further 6 miles
of the northward link with the M6 in 1965. There will be a connection
with the M4 north of Bristol. The 21-mile Ross Spur (M50), opened in
i960, links the M5 with the existing road system leading from Ross-on-
Wye (Herefordshire) to South Wales.
M6—Birmingham to Carlisle. The projected length of this road is 230 miles
including the Midland Link motorways connecting with the Mi and
the M5, due for completion in 1970-71; the 125! miles linking Darlaston
with Lancaster are open to traffic. It includes the 8-mile Preston bypass,
the first section of motorway in Britain, opened in 1958. The Penrith
bypass was opened in November 1968, and the remaining sections
between Lancaster and Carlisle are under construction.
M62—Lancashire to Yorkshire. A 6-mile stretch from Stretford to Eccles
bypass was finished in i960, and the remaining 70 miles are under
construction.
Draft schemes have been published for 38 miles of the Mu from London
towards Cambridge, the 26-mile M23 from London to Crawley, and 28 miles
of the South Coast motorway between Portsmouth and Southampton (M27).
In Scotland about 115 miles of motorways are planned including motorways
between Glasgow and Edinburgh, Edinburgh and Stirling, Edinburgh and
Perth, and a 16-mile section between Glasgow and Carlisle (of which 13^ miles
are in use). Altogether about 37 miles of motorway are now open. Following
the completion of the current programme about £500 million is to be spent on
trunk and principal roads over the period 1971-72 to 1980-81.
Notable schemes for improving existing trunk roads include that for the
A19 from the recently improved Ai (Great North Road) through Teesside
to the Tyne, the A38 from Exeter to Plymouth and the A12 from London to
Ipswich. Improvements on the A40 route, linking London with Gloucester and
South Wales via Oxford, include a 131-mile bypass around High Wycombe, in
Buckinghamshire, built to motorway standards and completed in 1968. It will
eventually form part of the London to Oxford motorway (M40). Several
major projects are under construction or planned for the industrialised areas
of South Wales.
A large programme of bridge and tunnel building has been undertaken in
recent years. The £2-3 million Medway Bridge, which is part of the M2 and
one of the largest prestressed concrete structures of its kind in the world, was
completed in 1963 and the suspension bridge across the Firth of Forth, one of
the longest bridges in the world, was opened in 1964. The Severn Bridge,
incorporating major advances in suspension bridge design, and the 7,000-ft.
bridge across the Firth of Tay, were opened in 1966. Tinsley Viaduct, near

Sheffield, a two-level viaduct over 3,000 feet long, was opened in two stages in

The second Blackwall Tunnel (under the Thames) costing £8 million and
the £13 million Tyne Tunnel between Wallsend (Northumberland) and
Jarrow (Durham) were opened in 1967. The £11 million Dartford-Purfleet
tunnel (under the Thames) has been open to traffic since the end of 1963.
Work on the £20 million second Mersey Tunnel began in 1967 and is due for
completion in 1970. A tunnel to carry a London motorway under the Thames
is to be built at the new town of Thamesmead.
Research on roads is carried out at the Road Research Laboratory (see p. 191).
Its aims are to find more economical ways of designing, constructing and
maintaining roads and of facilitating the flow of traffic on them and to reduce
road accidents. The layout of roads, their traffic, the safety features of road
vehicles and the behaviour of road users are investigated, and new methods,
materials and processes are developed for building roads and providing
them with a smooth, safe and durable surface. The Laboratory has a Tropical
Section, which undertakes research and advises on road problems overseas.
In 1968 there were about 14-5 million motor vehicles licensed to use Great
Britain’s roads. Of these, i-6 million were goods vehicles and 100,000 were
public road passenger vehicles (that is, buses and taxicabs).
The first world war greatly stimulated the development of motor vehicles,
which became serious competitors of the railways. Government regulation of
public road transport began with the passing of the London Traffic Act 1924,
which gave the Minister of Transport power to control the number of buses
and their journeys in London; this was followed in 1933 by the setting up of
the London Passenger Transport Board (see p. 345).
The Road Traffic Act 1930 ended the licensing of public service vehicles
(that is, buses and coaches) by local authorities and set up instead traffic areas
under the control of three traffic commissioners (except for the London
metropolitan area, which has one1) appointed by the Minister. The com¬
missioners regulate, by means of a licensing system, all public road passenger
transport services, and they sanction routes and time-tables in order to
secure proper co-ordination of services and eliminate unnecessary competi¬
tion; they may also control fares. Once the Passenger Transport Executives
(see p. 345) are operating ordinary bus services within their areas, these
services will no longer be subject to control by the traffic commissioners.
The Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933 established a system of licensing for
road haulage vehicles designed to restrict vehicle operations to proved needs
and to eliminate wasteful competition which will remain in partial operation
until the new licensing system proposed in the 1968 Transport Act is fully
operational. A licence has to be secured from the licensing authority (the
chairman of the appropriate body of traffic commissioners) before a goods
vehicle can be used on the road. There are three types of licence: the ‘A’
licence for general public haulage; the ‘B’ licence for public haulage limited to
certain goods or certain areas and covering also the carriage of the licensee’s
own goods; and the ‘C’ licence for the carriage by traders solely of their own
goods. Applications for ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences are examined by the licensing
authorities to see if they are necessary in view of existing transport services,

in the metropolitan traffic area (excluding the London Transport area).

and competitors may raise objections. The ‘C’ licence is granted on application,
as of right. Regulations concerning the fitness and loading of vehicles, the
keeping of records, and driving hours and rest periods of employees have
been made more severe under recent legislation.
Under the 1968 Transport Act a new licensing system, with the aims of
improving safety and promoting a fuller use of rail transport where this does
not impose higher costs on industry, will eventually replace the system
described above. Over 900,000 goods vehicles not exceeding 3^ tons gross
loaded weight (30 cwt. unladen), formerly mostly holding ‘C’ licences, have
already been exempted from licensing. Operators of goods vehicles of over 3!
tons will need to hold a ‘quality* licence, certifying that they can and will
provide or receive adequate maintenance facilities, and control loading and
the hours worked by their drivers; that they have adequate financial resources
to enable them to maintain vehicles properly; and that they or an employee
hold a ‘transport manager’s licence’ entitling them to manage the vehicles of
a transport undertaking. A new form of ‘quantitative’ control will apply to all
goods vehicles of over 16 tons gross weight engaged in hauls of over 100 miles
or carrying certain bulk materials, such as coal, in loads of over 11 tons over
any distance. The British Railways Board and the National Freight Corpora¬
tion will eventually have the right to object to the granting of any quanti¬
tative licence on the grounds that they can offer a rail service at least as good
in terms of speed, reliability and cost.

From September 1956 to January 1963 the nationalised road haulage services
were controlled by British Road Services (BRS), a division of the British
Transport Commission, and operated through five companies, which together
owned about 16,000 vehicles. Under the Transport Act 1962, these organi¬
sations operated companies incorporated under the Companies Act, with
their own boards, and were grouped together under the Transport Holding
Company, responsible to the Minister of Transport. The road haulage
interests of the Holding Company have been transferred to the National
Freight Corporation (see p. 337).
The number of licensed vehicles in the road goods transport industry has
shown only a relatively slow growth, from 1-4 million in i960 to i-6 million
in 1968, when 1 -2 million were on ‘C’ licence. Of the other 240,000 vehicles,
with ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences, about 18,000 were operated by British Transport
Holding Company subsidiaries. There are only a few operators with large
fleets of vehicles in any of the licence categories. ‘C’ licence vehicles include a
large number of small vehicles used locally in the delivery of groceries and
other goods. Other vehicles in this class are engaged in long-distance carriage
of traders’ own goods.

The 1968 Transport Act enables Passenger Transport Authorities (PTAs)
to be set up to control and co-ordinate the different forms of transport in
any particular area. The first PTAs were set up in April 1969 in Greater
Manchester, Merseyside, the West Midlands and Tyneside. The relevant
local authorities appoint most of the members, but up to one-seventh may be
appointed by the Minister of Transport (or by the Secretaries of State for
Scotland and Wales). Each appoints its own chairman, with the Minister’s
approval. The PTAs control policy and finance, and appoint professional
executives—Passenger Transport Executives—to be responsible to them
for day-to-day operations. The Executives may operate services themselves
and enter into agreements with other bodies, such as British Railways or
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the National Bus Company, to operate others; they will take over all the present
municipal bus undertakings in their areas.
The National Bus Company has been formed to take over the former bus
operating and manufacturing subsidiaries of the Transport Holding Company
in England and Wales, and operates through locally based subsidiaries.
A separate Scottish Transport Group has been set up to control bus and
some shipping services in Scotland, and has taken over the relevant interests
of the Transport Holding Company, operating through subsidiaries.
The National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group operate
about 21,100 and 4,700 vehicles respectively. The PTAs will take over
control of 6,300 vehicles now operated by 21 municipal undertakings.
The remainder of the industry, excluding London Transport, comprises
4,800 operators owning 34,000 vehicles; 71 of these operators are local
authorities outside PTA areas operating 10,000 vehicles, and 3,500 are small
concerns operating not more than five vehicles.
Capital grants are made by the Government towards the cost of invest¬
ment in public transport, at rates of up to 75 per cent of approved cost.
Eligible schemes include improvements or extensions of railway lines, new
fixed track rail and bus systems, interchanges, stations, and car parks. Grants
at the rate of 25 per cent are available towards the cost of newr types of buses
approved by the Ministry of Transport. Grants may also be paid through a
new rural bus grants scheme, and for a time to PTA executives towards the
cost of rail services covered by agreement with the Railways Board.
Britain has one of the highest densities of road traffic in the world. Road
accident statistics are compiled and published by the Ministry of Transport,
the Scottish Development Department and the Welsh Office from reports
made by the police. In 1968, 6,810 people were killed on the roads and about
342,000 injured. The fatal accident rate per vehicle is lower than that in
most other European countries, but slightly higher than in the United States.
Modern roads, designed for present-day traffic and segregating pedestrians
from vehicles, are safer than the roads they replace and surveys have shown
they result in a marked fall in casualties. The more important measures
directed primarily towards road safety include speed limits of 30 and 40 m.p.h.
in built-up areas and 50 m.p.h. on certain trunk and important classified
roads in rural areas; a 70 m.p.h. speed limit on all motorways and on ordinary
main roads where no lower limit applies; the provision of pedestrian cross¬
ings—usually illuminated by flashing beacons and marked with conspicuous
white stripes (‘zebra’ crossings); and the system of road markings and traffic
signs which are being replaced by greatly improved signs in accordance
with general European practice. The Road Safety Act 1967 made it an offence
to drive with more than a prescribed level of alcohol in the blood.
The design of vehicles, their use on the roads, and the maintenance of their
mechanical condition are controlled by regulations. Private cars and light
vans which are three or more years old must be tested annually at private
garages authorised as test stations. Heavy goods vehicles are tested annually
at government test stations. Public service vehicles must be specially approved
before being licensed to carry passengers, and are tested at regular intervals.
Any vehicle may be stopped on the road at any time by the police and
examined. Fitting of seat belts in cars registered in or after 1965 is compulsory,
and a high standard of tyre safety is enforced.
All drivers of motor vehicles, unless they have either held a full British
licence or passed the driving test in the last ten years, are required to pass the

test before being granted a full licence to drive. Until they pass the test they
must obtain a ‘provisional’ licence which necessitates their displaying ‘L’
(Learner) plates on their vehicle, and in all cases where vehicles are constructed
to carry passengers, other than pillion passengers, learner drivers must be
accompanied by a qualified driver. A learner driver of a motor cycle is
restricted, until he passes the driving test, to a machine not exceeding 250 c.c.
A scheme for special licensing and testing of drivers of heavy goods vehicles,
which lapsed in 1939, is to be brought up to date and reintroduced in February
1970.
The Road Traffic Acts, which embody the law relating to road users, are
enforced by the police and the courts. A person convicted of any of the 30
most serious offences is liable to be disqualified from driving for a period. The
standard of conduct for all road users and a summary of the requirements of
the law is set out in easily understandable form in the Highway Code, which
was revised in 1968. A failure to observe the code does not of itself render a
person liable to criminal proceedings but may be taken into account in any
such proceedings.
National campaigns to persuade people to take greater care on the roads
are conducted by the Ministry of Transport and the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents, acting as the Government’s agent and with the
participation of the local authorities. The police and education authorities
also help by arranging courses of instruction, especially courses for children.
In a White Paper published in 1967 (see Bibliography, p. 483) the Govern¬
ment announced further proposals for reducing accidents. These include
the setting up of a central road safety unit within the Ministry of Transport,
extension of local authority activity in safety matters, publicity and training
campaigns, and a review of pedestrian safety.
The Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967 empowers traffic authorities to make
orders regulating traffic and imposing parking control. With the exception of
trunk roads, which are the concern of the central Government, traffic is the
responsibility of local authorities. Several extensive schemes for the improve¬
ment of road safety and the relief of traffic congestion are being undertaken:
these include ‘fly-overs’ at road junctions; new outlet roads from cities; and
traffic management measures, including comprehensive control of street
parking, one-way’ systems, peak hour ‘clearways’ prohibiting waiting on
busy roads, and ‘tidal flow’ arrangements. A traffic Advisory Unit set up in
1965 in the Ministry of Transport advises local authorities. In most town
centres street parking is permitted for limited periods only, and in London
and some other towns on payment at parking meters usually under the
supervision of traffic wardens. Disc schemes providing free but limited
parking facilities are in operation at Cheltenham, Devizes, Harrogate and
Ripon. More off-street facilities are being provided. A computer-controlled
system to regulate traffic was installed in west London in 1968. Computer-
controlled systems are also operating in Glasgow and Liverpool.
In 1761 James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from
the collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester.
This marked the beginning of canal building in modern Britain, with which
the names of Brindley, Telford, Rennie, Jessop and other great engineers are
associated. Canals played an important part in promoting industrial and
commercial expansion in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The whole canal system was practically complete by 1830. As a result of
developing competition from the railways, however, about one-third of the

canal mileage had passed to the control of the railway companies by the middle
of the nineteenth century. During the two world wars government control of
railways included railway-owned canals. Under the Transport Act 1947, most
of the country’s canals passed to the British Transport Commission in
January 1948. From 1955 the canals were managed separately by the water¬
ways division of the Commission, known as British Waterways; under the
Transport Act 1962, control has been vested in the British Waterways Board
since January 1963. This control has been confirmed by the Transport Act
1968, under which a substantial grant-in-aid is to be paid to enable the Board
to maintain an extensive network of amenity waterways.
There are about 2,500 miles of navigable inland waterways in Great Britain,1
some 2,000 miles of which belong to the British Waterways Board; the
remainder are mainly still in the hands of local authorities or private com¬
panies. Many of the Board’s canals are narrow waterways which can generally
be used only by boats not exceeding 7 feet in width, capable of carrying a load
varying from 25 to 30 tons; the remainder are broad waterways and canalised
rivers, some of which can be used by craft of up to about 750 tons capacity.
The Caledonian and Crinan Canals in Scotland are broad waterways. Of the
2,000 miles of inland waterways under the control of the British Waterways
Board some 340 miles are commercial waterways. A substantial additional
mileage (1,100 miles, known as ‘cruiseways’) is to be maintained mainly for
recreational purposes; a statutory council has been set up to advise the
Minister of Transport and the Board.
Engineering, commercial and estate work is directed from the Board’s
headquarters at London, and through regional offices at Leeds and Gloucester.
In Scotland the canals (other than the Caledonian, which is run by a manager)
are, for engineering purposes, under the control of the engineer-in-charge at
Glasgow; estates work is supervised centrally from London.
In 1968 traffic on the Board’s waterways amounted to just over 7 million
tons, of which 3 million tons were coal, 1^ million tons liquids in bulk
and 2^ million tons general cargo. Some 97 per cent of the traffic is carried
on about 300 miles of broad waterways, which are mainly canalised river
navigations.
Although the British Waterways Board is the largest single carrying
operator, most of the traffic is handled by independent carriers or by traders
in their own craft. The Board at the end of 1968 owned 13 tugs and 646
carrying craft, with a carrying capacity of 29,350 tons, including 53 power-
driven craft with a carrying capacity of 4,379 tons. It operates 3 docks and
25 warehouses.
The Board continues to improve facilities on its commercial waterways, most
of which link important industrial districts with ports. These waterways are
the main navigations and broad canals in the Yorkshire-Humberside area,
together with the Trent and Weaver Navigations, and the Weston Canal in
Cheshire, the Lee Navigation, part of the river Severn, including the Glouces¬
ter and Sharpness Canal, and the Caledonian and Crinan Canals.
The total revenue of the British Waterways Board in 1968 amounted to
^5-1 million, of which j£o-6 million arose from the Board’s own freight¬
carrying activities, £1 million from warehousing and terminal services, and
j£i'i million from the docks. The sale of water for industrial and agricultural

purposes brought in £0-76 million. British Waterways encourages pleasure
boating and receipts rose to £ 147,000.
London is, with Tokyo and New York, one of the world’s three largest cities.
The area known as Greater London, within a radius of about 15 miles from
Charing Cross, contains about 7-8 million people.
London’s passenger transport system, in its modern sense, began in 1829
when the first omnibus, horse-drawn, appeared on the London streets. The
first regular tram service, also horse-drawn, began in 1870. In 1863 the first
underground steam railway, the Metropolitan, was built by digging a great
trench for the line and roofing it over. In 1870 the world’s first tube railway,
the Tower Subway, was constructed under the river Thames; it was cable-
operated and ran for only a few months. The first electric tube railway in the
world, the City and South London Railway, was opened in 1890, and this was
followed in 1900 by the opening of the Central London Railway. Shortly
afterwards the original steam-operated underground lines were electrified.
Meanwhile horse-drawn buses and trams were being replaced by motor buses
and electric trams.
Until 1933 there were many separate undertakings providing passenger
transport facilities in London, but in that year they were all vested in a single
public corporation, the London Passenger Transport Board. In 1948, with
the establishment of the British Transport Commission, the London Trans¬
port Executive took over control as an agency of the Commission.
Under the Transport Act 1962 the London Transport Executive was
replaced by a financially independent board, the London Transport Board.
Exchequer loans have financed the Board’s external capital needs. From 1965
the Board has been running a deficit (£10 million in 1968), due mainly to
competition from the private car and to increasing congestion. The deficit has
been met by government grants.
A basic reorganisation of transport in London is to take place, involving a
reconstruction of the Board’s capital, and the transfer of responsibility for
central bus and railway services’ activities to the Greater London Council.
The Council is to become the statutory transport planning authority for
London, and is to appoint the members of a new statutory body, to be respon¬
sible for the day-to-day management of transport services within the Greater
London area.
The London Transport undertaking operates all road and rail passenger
transport services in the London area with the exception of the London lines
of British Railways and the taxicabs. (Some 7,600 taxicabs that ply for hire
in the streets are privately operated by companies or owner-drivers and are
licensed annually by the Metropolitan Police. There are about 12,200 licensed
cab drivers.) London Transport’s operations at present extend beyond Greater
London to cover an area of 2,000 square miles (known as the London Passenger
Transport Area) within a radius of about 25 miles from Charing Cross and
with a population of over 10 million. In the ten years from 1959 to 1968 the
number of passenger journeys made annually on the London Transport
system fell from 3,425 million to 2,601 million, the fall being almost entirely
confined to bus and coach services, affected by increased private motoring
and changes in leisure habits.
London Transport’s railway network stretches 18 miles from north to south
and 32 miles from east to west. In March 1969 the total length of the railway
over which London Transport trains operated was 254 miles, of which 98

miles were underground. London Transport trains served 277 stations and
in 1968 its buses and coaches travelled over 3,239 miles of roads. To carry
traffic over all this area London Transport owned 4,240 railway cars and
7,894 buses and coaches. The total staff employed was 68,911.
Improvements carried out by London Transport have included complete
renewal of the bus and coach fleet, replacement of trams and trolleybuses by
diesel buses, extension and modernisation of parts of the Underground
system, and the introduction of automatic fare collection and automatic
trains. One-man operation of buses is being steadily extended over a period
of years.
Work on a new 14-mile underground railway, to cost about £89 million,
has been in progess since 1962. The main lo^-mile section from Walthamstow
in north-east London to Victoria Station is now in use, and an extension
to Brixton in south London should be in operation by the end of 1971. There
are plans to extend the underground system farther.
Reorganisation of public transport in Northern Ireland was completed in
1968. Under the Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 the Ulster Transport
Authority was wound up and its assets and liabilities transferred to a new
company, the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Responsibility
for operating services on the 203 miles of railway track was given to the
Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd., a subsidiary of the Holding
Company. The Act also provides for a licensing system for road passenger
operators in certain areas.
Ulsterbus Ltd., another subsidiary of the Holding Company, has taken over
the road passenger operations of the Authority, which formerly provided all
public road passenger services, apart from those of the City of Belfast. A
number of privately owned bus companies now operate in addition.
In 1966 the Authority’s monopoly of road carriage of freight was replaced
by a licensing system. About 1,500 operators and 3,600 vehicles have been
licensed, the biggest single operator being Northern Ireland Carriers Ltd.,
owned jointly by the Northern Ireland Holding Company and the British
National Freight Corporation.
On 31st March 1969, there were 14,016 miles of public roads in Northern
Ireland, comprising 382 miles of trunk roads, 999 miles of Class I roads,
1,727 miles of Class II roads, 2,874 miles °f Class III roads and 8,034 miles °f
unclassified roads.
The Ministry of Development is directly responsible for the trunk road
system and bears the entire cost of maintenance and reconstruction work on
these roads. In addition to major reconstruction schemes on trunk roads, an
extensive system of motorways is planned including an urban motorway
system in Belfast. About 46 miles of motorw'ay were in use by the middle of
1969.
The Ministry of Development administers the Road Fund (the proceeds of
motor vehicle taxation, driving licence fees, etc.), from which grants are paid
to the local authorities (county, county borough, borough and urban district
councils) which are responsible for the other roads. The rates of grant range
from 90 per cent for major improvement works on Class I roads to 25 per cent
for maintenance work on the unclassified roads.
Gross capital expenditure on all roads in the financial year to 31st March
1969 was j£i2-8 million, and expenditure on maintenance and minor improve¬
ments was about £5-8 million. Gross capital expenditure in the five-year

period 1969-73 is expected to be about £75 million, compared with about
£58 million in the five-year period to 1968. Expenditure on maintenance and
minor improvements in the five-year period to 1969 was ^24-1 million.
CIVIL AVIATION
British airmen were among the first to carry mails (at the time of the
Coronation of King George V in 1911) and among the first to operate regular
mail and passenger services, which were inaugurated on 25th August 1919,
when a daily passenger service was opened between London (Hounslow)
and Paris (Le Bourget).
In April 1924 four small British companies merged to form Imperial Airways
Limited and this company pioneered the commercial development of inter¬
continental air routes. By 1929 there was a through service from England to
India. The first passenger service to Australia started in 1935.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation, a public corporation, took over
the undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways Limited in
1940. British European Airways was established under the Civil Aviation
Act 1946 as a separate public corporation to cover the United Kingdom
and Europe. In addition to the two nationalised corporations, there are
between 20 and 30 independent air transport operators.
General responsibility for the development of United Kingdom civil aviation
was transferred in 1966 from the Ministry of Aviation to the Board of Trade.
Under the post-war nationalisation legislation the air corporations had a
statutory monopoly of British scheduled services, and independent operators
were confined, broadly, to charter work. From 1949, and increasingly from
1952, the independants were allowed to develop new scheduled services,
provided they secured ministerial approval and operated, technically, as
associates of the corporations. The Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act i960
abolished the corporations’ monopoly and provided for a licensing system,
administered by an Air Transport Licensing Board, to which the nationalised
and independent operators could apply on an equal footing for licences for
scheduled or charter services, or for revocation or variation of existing licences.
The ATLB is an independent body of six to ten members appointed by the
Board of Trade. Its main function is to consider and decide on applications for
licences (or their revocation or variation). The ATLB must have regard to an
applicant’s financial resources, staffing, organisation, the need for the proposed
services, the adequacy of, and possible effect on, existing services, and any
objections or representations made by interested parties. It also has the
general duty of furthering the development of British aviation.
There is provision for appeals on ATLB decisions to the Board of Trade,
which appoints independent commissioners to hear appeals publicly and report
with recommendations upon them. A committee set up to enquire into the
affairs of the civil air transport industry reported in May 1969. Its proposals
included the establishment of a Civil Aviation Authority to take over general
control of the industry, of a National Air Holdings Board to control the
state-owned airlines, of a privately owned ‘second force’ airline formed from
among the independent operators, and of a group of regional airlines owned
by both public and private interests.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The constitution and functions of BOAC and BE A are laid down in the Air
Corporations Act 1967, which consolidates, with certain exceptions, the
provisions of the Air Corporations Acts 1949 and 1966, and in the Air
Corporation Act 1969. Each corporation consists of 5 to 11 members, including
the chairman. The chairman of each board is a member of the other.
As a result of BOAC’s capital reconstruction in 1966, £35 million ‘Exchequer
Dividend Capital’ on which a variable dividend, related to each year’s earnings,
is payable, was created, together with a reconstruction reserve of some £30
million and appropriate loan capital. The introduction of Exchequer Divi¬
dend Capital (now £50 million and known as Public Dividend Capital)
is experimental. The statutory limit on BOAC’s total borrowings is ^90
million, which can be increased by Order to £120 million. BEA’s borrowing
limit is £200 million, which can be increased by Order to £230 million.
The Board of Trade has certain statutory powers and duties in respect of the
air corporations, including the power, very seldom used, to give directions
of a general character as to the exercise and performance of their functions
in relation to matters affecting the national interest. With the approval of the
Treasury, the Board has power to make Exchequer advances within the limits
laid down by Parliament. The Board of Trade is responsible for approving
the lines of the corporations’ capital expenditure. The Board also sets, after
consultation with the corporations, their financial targets and, in BOAC’s
case, approves the amount payable annually as dividend. There is also close
consultation on overseas traffic rights and air safety. Day-to-day matters
concerning the corporations’ activities are the responsibility of the commercial
management of BOAC and BEA.
Total capacity-ton-miles offered on all services has more than trebled since
1959, and had risen to 2,896 million capacity-ton-miles in 1968. In 1955,
2-5 million passengers entered or left the United Kingdom by air, compared
with 5-7 million who arrived or departed by sea; in 1962 there were for the
first time more air than sea passengers, and by 1968 the figures had risen to
15-7 million by air and 9-2 million by sea.
BOAC is engaged on long-haul airline operations. Its scheduled services link
Britain with Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australasia, Africa and
North and South America, and it also provides complete round-the-world
services. It co-operates closely with airlines of several other Commonwealth
countries; it also has financial interests in eight companies operating local and
regional services in the Far and Middle East and in the Caribbean in areas
adjacent to BOAC’s main routes; and in a number of hotel companies in areas
attractive to business and holiday travellers.
The capacity offered on BOAC’s own scheduled services reached 1,531 million
capacity-ton-miles in the year ended March 1969, having risen by 5-1 per cent
over the previous year. Over half of this capacity was on the western routes
to North and South America. The overall load factor in 1968-69 was 51-4 per
cent; the break-even load factor (the figure at which operating costs are
covered) was 43-6 per cent. The Corporation’s fleet, made up entirely of pure
jets, consists (June 1969) of Super VC 10s (17), VC 10s (12), Boeing 707-4365
(18) and Boeing 707-3365 (6 with a further 2 on order). Twelve Boeing 747s
are also on order; the first are due to enter service in 1970.
The VC 10, introduced into service in 1964, operates on African, Middle
East and Far East routes. The Super VC 10 (a larger and more powerful

aircraft than the standard version) went into service in April 1965 on trans¬
atlantic routes. The Boeing 707-336C took over the transatlantic all-freighter
operation in January 1966. BO AC has reserved delivery positions on eight of
the Anglo-French Concorde aircraft and on six of the projected US Boeing
SSTs (supersonic transports).
BOAC’s own passenger terminal at Kennedy International Airport,
New York, is due to come into use in 1970. The Corporation is making a
substantial investment over a period of ten years on the installation of an
advanced airline computer system to control a wide variety of international
activities, including accounting and flight planning. The first stages, con¬
trolling seat reservations, came into operation in 1968.
BO AC had another profitable year in 1968-69 when it earned an operating
surplus of £21-9 million and net profits of £21-7 million after interest on
borrowings and taxation. Of its gross traffic revenue (£170 million)
million was earned in foreign currencies.
BEA operates a network of services to over 80 places in Britain, Europe,
North Africa and the Middle East. Its services in Britain include a number
which cannot be operated on a commercial basis but which meet a vital
social need, mainly the services to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
BEA also co-operates with other airlines in order to create ‘through travel’
facilities. It has a financial interest in several associated companies, most of
which collaborate with BEA in providing a network of services.
For the year ended 31st March 1969, the increases in capacity offered, and
passenger-miles and freight-ton-miles flown on scheduled services were 5-3
per cent, 7 • 1 per cent and 10-2 per cent respectively over the previous year: in the
same year some 7-7 million passengers were carried, an increase of 5 -3 per cent.
BEA’s fleet consists (March 1969) of BAG One-Elevens (10, out of 18
on order), Trident Twos (11, out of 15 on order), Trident Ones (22), Comet 4BS
(12), Viscount 802s (20), Viscount 806s (15), Argosys (4), Vanguard 951s (5),
Vanguard 953s (14), and Herons (2). Twenty-six Trident Threes, enlarged
versions of the Trident One, have been ordered at a total cost of £80 million.
In 1968-69 the corporation earned over ^108 million in revenue and made
a net profit of ^3-5 million. Recent difficulties have included the effects
of financial restrictions in Britain, particularly the reduced currency allowance
for travel abroad, and political upheavals elsewhere.
Although the two State corporations had a statutory monopoly up to 1961
there has been a significant expansion in recent years not only of the number
of passengers and volume of freight carried but also in the diversity of services
operated by the independent operators. As well as a wide network of domestic
and international services they provide vehicle ferry services; specialised air
cargo facilities; and enable travel agents to offer low-cost all-in holidays abroad.
The independent companies compete with BEA over several domestic
routes, including the busiest internal route in Europe, from London to
Glasgow. In 1968 they carried some 6-9 million passengers. A large programme
of aircraft re-equipment has been carried out. Jet airliners on domestic
routes in Britain were first introduced by British United Airways in 1966.
In addition to the public transport operators there are a large number of
companies engaged in miscellaneous aviation activities such as crop-spraying,
aerial survey and photography, and flying instruction. About 30 companies
carry out air-taxi operations.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The proportion of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air is increasing steadily.
In 1956, 1-7 per cent of imports and 2-9 per cent of exports (by value) were
carried by air. In 1968 the corresponding percentages were 11 -8 and 12-2, and
the total value of exports, imports and re-exports by air was £1,753 million.
The chief export items are expensive machinery and parts, aircraft and vehicle
parts, and electrical and electronic products; furs and skins account for a large
proportion of the total value of re-exports.
At Heathrow, London, freight traffic is increasing at an annual rate of over
19 per cent and totalled 291,000 metric tons in 1968. Scheduled services of
British airlines carried about 304,000 tons of freight in 1968, compared with
196,000 tons in 1959.
The estimated number of aircraft on the United Kingdom register used for
business and private purposes is over 800, while approximately 600 are
owned by clubs, groups and training schools. About 16,000 student and
private pilots hold licences. About 130 companies use private aircraft and
some 80 companies are members of the Business Aircraft Users’ Association.
The Board of Trade has a general responsibility for civil aerodromes. It may
itself establish and maintain airports, and local authorities may also do so
subject to its approval. Aerodromes which are municipally or privately owned
and wffiich are used for the public transport of passengers and/or flying
instruction are subject to government licensing, inspection and regulation.
The Board of Trade is also responsible for navigation facilities at a number
of main municipal airports.
The British Airports Authority, an independent statutory body operating
on a commercial basis, took over on 1st April 1966 the ownership and manage¬
ment of London’s two major airports (Heathrow and Gatwick), Prestwick in
Scotland, and Stansted in Essex. At these airports the Board of Trade is
responsible for the provision of navigation services and may direct the
Authority to take measures to control noise and vibration.
There are approximately 135 civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom;
in addition, 52 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under
civil control include 13 directly controlled by the Board of Trade, 3 in the
Channel Islands and 1 in the Isle of Man administered by the local island
governments, and 40 aerodromes licensed for public use, of which 24 are
owned by municipalities. Two of the Board of Trade’s aerodromes and 28
others are designated Customs airports; limited customs facilities are available
at a further eight aerodromes.
Aircraft and passenger movements at the principal airports have risen very
markedly in the last five years, and in 1968 United Kingdom civil airports
handled 25-6 million passengers. The number of movements of aircraft
engaged on commercial transport operations was 560,000.
For international scheduled services Heathrow and Gatwick are the main
airports, and Heathrow is the largest and busiest airport in Western Europe.
The number of passengers handled at Heathrow has increased from 5-4
million in i960 to 13-4 million in 1968. The British Airports Authority is at
present spending some £25 million on improvements to Heathrow and its
other airports. The shorter of the two Heathrow runways is being extended to
12,800 ft. An £11 million passenger terminal for British short-haul airlines
and Aer Lingus was completed in 1969, and extensions are being made to
several other buildings. To accommodate the rapid expansion expected in

freight movements, £25 million has been invested in a new cargo terminal and
associated developments, which came into use in 1969. New facilities costing
some £12-5 million are planned for handling Boeing J47 (jumbo jet) aircraft
from 1970 onwards. There are plans to build a rail link between Heathrow and
central London (Victoria) to include a large station underneath the airport’s
central area.
The airport at Gatwick, 28 miles south of London, was opened in June
1958 as the second airport for the London area. Built alongside the main
London to Brighton railway and the A23 road, Gatwick airport was the first
in the world to contain road, rail and air transport in one unit. In 1968 it
handled over 2 million passengers. It is planned to extend the existing runway
and construct a second runway.
A privately owned helicopter terminal (or ‘heliport’) is in operation at
Battersea on the south bank of the Thames.
Prestwick airport in Scotland has been developed to accommodate large
jet aircraft. The freight facilities have been extended and further improve¬
ments are planned. A ^4^ million airport at Abbotsinch, owned and run by
the Glasgow Corporation, is expected to handle over 2 million passengers a
year in 1970. The main runway at Manchester has been extended.
Both Manchester (Ringway) and Glasgow (Abbotsinch) handled over a
million passengers in 1968; Belfast (Aldergrove), Luton, Edinburgh (Turn-
house), Birmingham and Prestwick each handled over 500,000.
The role of the Government in promoting air safety7 lies in research and in
setting up and supervising standards for both aircraft and personnel.
Research on aircraft design and construction is done at the Royal Aircraft
Establishments at Farnborough and Bedford, which are exceptionally well
equipped with testing facilities.
The Board of Trade determines the policy and legislative requirements for
the safe operation of civil aircraft, analyses accidents and initiates preventive
measures and research in flight safety.
All aircraft registered in the United Kingdom must have a valid certificate
of airworthiness issued (or rendered valid) by the Board of Trade on the
recommendation of the Air Registration Board, which was set up in 1937 and
consists of 18 members, two of whom are appointed by the Board of Trade—
one as an independent and one as an experienced professional pilot, the others
being representatives of constructors, operators and insurers of aircraft. No
aircraft built in Britain is granted a certificate of airworthiness unless it has
been constructed in accordance with British Civil Airworthiness Require¬
ments, a code compiled and frequently reviewed by the Board. Continued
airworthiness is ensured by regular inspection and by requiring aircraft to be
maintained in accordance with a schedule approved by the Board.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain weight used for public transport
must possess an Air Operator’s Certificate which is granted by the Director of
Aviation Safety when he is satisfied that the operator is competent to secure
the safe operation of his aircraft. The Director is advised by the Board of
Trade’s flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline pilots) on
all matters affecting the operation of aircraft, except aircraft maintenance,
which is the responsibility of the Air Registration Board.
Each member of a flight crew must hold the appropriate official licence. Flight
operations inspectors check the standards maintained by the operators, which
must be adequate for purposes of the Air Operator’s Certificate.

In order to supplement the diminishing supply of well-trained pilots for civil
airlines from the Royal Air Force, the College of Air Training was set up at
Hamble in i960. It is sponsored and financed by the Government and the
two airways corporations. Commercial pilots must attend a course of training
approved by the Board of Trade. Such courses have been approved at the
training schools at Carlisle, Elstree (near London), Oxford and Perth, in
addition to Hamble.
Responsibility for policy, planning and execution of both civil and military
air traffic control over the United Kingdom and the surrounding seas rests
with the National Air Traffic Control Services organisation, under the joint
control of the Board of Trade and the Secretary of State for Defence.
In 1950 a system of airways covering the main traffic routes with control zones
around the major airports was introduced. Subsequently, the airway system
has been revised and extended to meet traffic requirements. There are three
main air traffic control centres: at London for southern England, at Preston
for the north of England and Wales, and at Prestwick for Scotland and the
Atlantic Ocean to 30°W.
A variety of radar installations and other equipment provide the means by
which the system can accept the increasingly heavy load of air traffic. Britain
was the first country to use radar for the control of civil air traffic, and the
Instrument Landing System (ILS) is installed at all its major airports. During
the next few years virtually the whole of the airspace over Britain above
5,000 feet will be brought under surveillance by the latest types of primary and
secondary radar equipment, which will provide data to be used in two air
traffic control centres, located at West Drayton (near London) and
Prestwick. A subsidiary centre will be located at Manchester to deal with
traffic in the Manchester terminal control area. Extensive use will be made in
these centres of automatic data processing and other advanced electronic
techniques.
The Board of Trade provides radio navigational aids to help pilots navigate
in all weather conditions. In addition, the Board of Trade supports the Decca
Air and Marine Navigator System now operating over a wide area of Britain
and northern Europe, which can be used, by arrangement with the Decca
Company, by any aircraft fitted with the appropriate receiving equipment.
Britain has pioneered in the development of all-weather landing systems.
The Blind Landing Experimental Unit of the Royal Aircraft Establishment
at Bedford and private industry have worked towards fully automatic blind
landing, which has now been achieved with passenger-carrying aircraft.
Britain is a member of Eurocontrol, a European international agency con¬
cerned with the traffic control problems arising from the increasing use of
high-flying, high-speed jet aircraft. Set up in 1963 it provides control at the
higher flight levels for civil aircraft and for military aircraft operating
according to civil procedures.
The hovercraft, a vehicle which rides on a cushion of air over both land and
water surfaces, has been in regular public passenger service around the coasts
of Britain since 1965. Large-capacity passenger and car ferry craft (165 tons)
were introduced in 1968 as an extension to the present cross-channel services
to France, making an all-year-round service possible. A hovercraft terminal
at Pegwell Bay, near Ramsgate, came into use in 1969.

The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides the postal and public telecom¬

was formally set up as a public authority under the Post Office Act 1969.
The Post Office, previously controlled by a Minister, the Postmaster General,
is now headed by a chairman and board, appointed by and responsible to the
Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. In March 1969 the Post Office
had 417,000 employees and 24,820 post offices.
The Post Office has authority to borrow up to £2,300 million. At 31st March
1969 it had borrowed £1,681 million. Over 90 per cent of total expenditure
on fixed assets is accounted for by telecommunications. The postal, tele¬
communications and data processing services are now managed separately.
Recent figures of financial results are shown in Table 24.
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from
the time when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern
airmail transport. The first dispatch of mails by train was made in 1830
between Liverpool and Manchester. The inauguration of the penny post
(the uniform charge for any inland distance being prepaid by means of
postage stamps, which originated in Britain) in 1840 was followed by a rapid
extension of the scope of the postal services. The registered post, ensuring
additional safety for valuable mail, was introduced in 1841. The money order
system, which had operated as a private venture from 1792 to 1838, was
supplemented in 1881 by the issue of postal orders for fixed amounts.
Letterboxes had been instituted in London in 1855, and in 1883 the parcel
post was introduced. In 1919 the Post Office inaugurated its own motor
transport fleet and the first mail was carried by air in Britain in 1911.
Table 24 gives statistics of items of inland and overseas mail carried. Each
year about 7,500 tons of mail are carried by air within the United Kingdom.
Out of the 559 million items of overseas mail carried in 1968-69,67-5 per cent was
carried by air, compared with 51 per cent in 1955-56. The air parcel service now
operates to all countries in Europe and to over 190 countries outside Europe.
Several new highly mechanised sorting office buildings were opened in
1969. Over the next ten years £50 million is to be spent on conveyance and
sorting equipment and research into new techniques. About half of this
sum will be spent on letter coding and automatic letter-sorting machines.
Letter segregating and facing machines are being installed at over 60 centres.
Postal address coding is being continuously extended, and is expected to
cover over 10 million addresses by March 1970. A two-tier letter service was
introduced in 1968 consisting of a more highly priced service for first-class
mail and a cheaper one for less urgent items; it has succeeded in reducing
pressure at peak periods.
A Postal Consultancy Service offers facilities to overseas countries to aid
them in the planning and mechanisation of their services.
At the post office counter, besides making use of its postal and telegraph
facilities, the citizen can draw his pension and his family allowance, buy a
licence for his dog, sound radio or television receiving set, renew his car
licence and buy national insurance stamps. He can also use the wide range of
facilities for savings and investments (see p. 372) offered by the National
Department for Savings, and the money transmission services of the National

other government departments or local authorities. The value of some
important items is shown in Table 24.
All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to the control of
the Postmaster General in 1870. Teleprinter-working for the transmission
of inland telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the
present automatic switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now
one of the most up-to-date systems in the world and gives direct connection
between any of the 350 or so larger telegraph offices. The overseas telegraph
services were shared until 1950 between the Post Office and Cable and
Wireless Ltd. This company was brought into public ownership in 1947.
The Post Office, which acquired the British services, operates all overseas
telegraph services from the United Kingdom, except those offered by foreign

telegraph companies. Cable and Wireless Ltd. continues to operate its cable
and wireless services in many dependencies and foreign countries.
Telegraph services to overseas countries are operated from Electra House in
London, the world’s largest overseas telegraph office, and from nine other
London and provincial area telegraph offices. Direct connection via the Centex
system between these British offices and the larger towns in Belgium, France,
Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, Italy and Norway minimises delivery delay.
In addition, the Post Office is well to the fore in the development of telegraph
message relay techniques for services beyond Europe.
The Telex Service (opened in England in 1932) combines the speed of the
telephone with the accuracy of the printed word. Calls may be made direct
between the rapidly increasing number of telex users in Britain (about 25,000
by the end of 1968) and also to well over 300,000 subscribers throughout the
world. Britain is linked to over 130 countries by telex. For call charging
purposes Britain is divided into 50 charging areas, each with its own telex
centre. The United Kingdom telex service is fully automatic and immediate
connection is made by direct dialling to any subscriber in this country, and to
many subscribers in Europe, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.
Other overseas calls are connected by operators at the International Telex
Exchange in London which provides a teleprinter service to over 120 countries
abroad. Inland and overseas telex traffic is growing annually by about 20 per
cent; the Post Office is planning for a system of about 140,000 United
Kingdom subscribers by 1980. A new radioteleprinter service extends the use
of telex to ships at sea (see p. 357).
The demand for facilities enabling digital data for computers to be trans¬
mitted over telephone and telegraph lines has greatly increased; to meet it
the Post Office has developed a range of datel services providing for trans¬
mission at speeds of up to 50 bits per second over telegraph-type circuits
and up to to 2,400 bits per second over speech-type circuits. Datel facilities
are available to a number of European countries and over speech-type
circuits to the United States. In the year ending March 1969 the number of
British datel terminals rose by 130 per cent to about 4,400.
When the Post Office bought the property of the National Telephone Com¬
pany in 1912 it became the owner of almost the whole telephone service.
Hull Corporation was the only municipality to exercise its option of operating
its own service under licence from the Postmaster General; this service (and
the service in the Channel Islands, also operated under licence) is connected
to the Post Office trunk network.
At the end of March 1969 there were 6,125 local telephone exchanges and
just under 13 million telephones. On that date, only 150 exchanges remained
to be changed to automatic working. Trunk dialling by subscribers began in
Bristol in December 1958; by March 1969 the facility had been extended to
2,176 exchanges, serving 81 per cent of all subscribers; by 1970 it will be
available on over 90 per cent of all telephones. The introduction of group
routing and charging equipment brings the advantages of quicker service,
automatic accounting and cheap long-distance calls of short duration, and
constitutes the most radical reform of the telephone service since the Post
Office assumed national responsibility for it. Telephones in London and five
other large cities have been given all-figure numbers in which exchange names
are replaced by figures, to facilitate handling of rapidly expanding domestic
and international traffic.
356 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Electronic exchanges are now being ordered for all new exchanges with
from 200 to 2,000 lines. The first operational electronic exchange in Europe
was opened at Ambergate, Derbyshire, in December 1966. Similar equipment
for larger exchanges is being tested.
Pulse code modulation systems are being used to increase the circuit
capacity of lines on short-distance routes between exchanges. Over 900 should
be installed by the end of 1969. A new time-division electronic switching
system for interconnecting routes equipped with pulse code modulation
systems has been used experimentally.
International subscriber dialling operates between London, Edinburgh,
Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and most of Western Europe;
it is planned to extend it to Italy and other European countries.
Operator-connected calls are handled at the London Continental Exchange,
from which well over 2,000 direct telephone circuits give service to European
countries and at the London International Exchange, which is linked by
transatlantic cables to the US and to the Commonwealth cable network. High
frequency radio is used for calls to other destinations and communications
satellites carry an increasing proportion of intercontinental telephone calls.
The various overseas circuits are also used to send and receive pictures, and
special circuits are used for broadcast transmissions.
A radio tower, 620 feet high, in London provides microwave radio links for
carrying long-distance telephone and television circuits. There are over 100
Post Office communications masts and towers in use, including a tower of
500 feet in Birmingham.
Special Telephone Several specialised services are available by telephone, including the ‘999’
Services emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected as quickly
as possible, and free of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire brigade
services; the speaking clock; and a recorded weather forecast, motoring
information, recipe, cricket, and ‘Dial a Disc’ services. In London a recorded
service provides details in English, French, Spanish and German of important
events taking place in and around the capital on the day of the call and a
similar service (in English only) is provided in Edinburgh during the summer.
A public radiotelephone service, introduced in 1959, enables the users of
vehicles fitted with suitable radio equipment to make calls to, or receive them
from, any telephone in the United Kingdom network.
Private

Cables
In March 1969 there were 107,000 private circuit stations not connected with
the public exchange networks. These are associated with circuits rented for
private use for telephone conversations, teleprinter connections, photo¬
telegraphy, television, music, or for the transmission of signals which
represent data for computers or operate other devices.
The first transatlantic telephone cable, TAT 1, connecting Britain with Canada
and the United States, was laid in 1956. Many submarine telephone cables
have been laid in succeeding years. Cable and Wireless Ltd., in co-operation
wdth the Post Office, carried out a comprehensive Commonwealth telephone
cable plan. The plan was agreed upon in 1958, and covered the construction
of three long-distance telephone cable systems: CANTAT (2,100 nautical
miles), from Scotland to Canada, was opened in 1961; COMPAC (8,130
nautical miles), connecting Canada, Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia,
opened in 1963; and SEACOM (7,070 nautical miles), connecting Australia,
New Guinea, Guam, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, was completed in
stages from 1965 to 1967 and opened as a complete system in March 1967. All

three can provide 80 telephone circuits throughout, apart from the heavily
used section of SEACOM between Guam and Australia, which can provide
160. The submarine cables are linked overland across Canada and Australia by
radio microwave systems. CANTAT was the first single-cable ocean telephone
system to use the new lightweight cable and rigid two-way repeaters, both
developed by the Post Office.
Submarine cable systems using transistors in place of thermionic valves
have been developed by British manufacturers in consultation with the Post
Office Research Station. Three such systems providing 480 telephone circuits
were opened for service in 1968, and another, providing 640 between Britain
and Portugal, in 1969. Three new cables with a capacity of 1,260 circuits are
to be laid between Britain and Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The
long-life transistors used were developed and manufactured by the Post Office
Research Station.
The Goonhilly satellite communication earth station in Cornwall was brought
into operation in 1962, and took part in the first experiments in satellite
communications using the Telstar and Relay satellites. After major extensions
and improvements, including the installation of a second large aerial, the
station now provides commercial telephone and television circuits via high-
capacity, geo-stationary satellites positioned over the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans. By the end of 1970 over 20 countries will have direct satellite links
with Britain. The satellites used in the global communications systems are
provided by INTELSAT (International Communications Satellite Con¬
sortium) of which Britain is the second largest shareholder.
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post
Office has 11 coast radio stations in the United Kingdom. These stations
provide radiotelegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea
at ranges of up to some 500 and 250 miles respectively. There is also the
long-distance radiotelegraph station, Portishead Radio, which communicates
with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with
safety of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radio¬
telegraph and radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or
aircraft and take immediate action to obtain assistance for any vessel in
distress. During 1968-69 the stations handled 504 urgent and SOS calls
from ships and aircraft.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange
radiotelegrams with ships and connect radiotelephone calls between telephone
subscribers ashore and suitably equipped ships; they also broadcast naviga¬
tional warnings and weather bulletins.
The stations operate a free medical advice service whereby the master of a
ship of any nationality may obtain advice from appropriate medical authorities
on the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury aboard ship. During
1968-69, 440 medical enquiries were dealt with in this service.
An Act passed in 1967 enabled the Post Office to offer its data processing
facilities developed for its own use to commerce and industry. The National
Data Processing Service has already attracted a considerable volume of
commercial work. It has 14 operational computers situated at centres in
London (3), Edinburgh, Portsmouth, Derby and Leeds. Other machines are
on order and additional centres planned.
14 FINANCE
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities (that is, the
central Government and local authorities) finance their activities—how their
expenditure is decided upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Money administered by public authorities1 can be roughly divided into:
1. The funds of the central Government raised mainly by taxation which are
paid into and out of the Consolidated Fund in accordance with the
proposals of the Government as approved by Parliament (principally the
House of Commons). Additional central Government funds are raised by
borrowing and are paid into the National Loans Fund set up under the
National Loans Fund Act 1968.2
There are also funds administered for special purposes by central
government departments and wholly or partially maintained by receipts
which do not pass through the Consolidated Fund. The most important
one is the National Insurance Fund, administered by the Minister of
Social Security and used for the payment of benefits under the National
Insurance Scheme.
2. The funds of local authorities, obtained partly from rates (local taxes on
dwelling-houses and other real estate) and income from property and
trading receipts, partly from grants and loans from the central Government
and partly from loans raised in the open market (see p. 73).
The following broad account of government finance is concerned mainly
with central Government taxation and borrowing and only incidentally with
local government and other public funds.
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law,
parliamentary rights and custom.
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the
principle that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was
gradually evolved. The principle was established, at the end of the constitu¬
tional struggles of the Stuart period, by the Bill of Rights 1689.
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once the
king was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, he was free to
spend it as he chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the House of
Commons gradually developed the modern system of controlling expenditure
through the device of Appropriation which was embodied in the Exchequer
and Audit Departments Act 1866. But by a Standing Order of the House of
Commons dating from the early eighteenth century the Crown’s consent is
required for all proposals involving new spending from the Consolidated Fund.
The House of Commons cannot, therefore, initiate expenditure which must be
proposed by a Minister.
1 For an account of public finance in Northern Ireland and its relationship to that of the
United Kingdom, see pp. 368-9.
2 Prior to April 1968 the funds from both these sources were paid into the Exchequer.
The term ‘Exchequer’ took its name from the ‘chess-board’, or table with chequered
cloth, round which the King’s financial officials sat for accounting purposes in the
twelfth century.

Classification of
Expenditure
359
From the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such
financial control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of
Commons. This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seven¬
teenth century, but as regards expenditure it was not effective until the
nineteenth century. The controlling power of the House of Commons is
acknowledged today in the Speech from the Throne at the opening of a new
session of Parliament, which is addressed to both Houses but contains a
special paragraph on expenditure addressed to the Commons alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power to
modify financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions; thus,
to minimise the chance of rejection, the practice was started in 1861 of
embodying the main financial provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill.
Since the passing of the Parliament Act 1911, however, if the Finance Bill is
certified by the Speaker to be a Money Bill, it may be presented to the Queen
for the Royal Assent and become law without the consent of the House of
Lords if it has not been passed by them within one month (see p. 36).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all
expenditure by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue
by taxation or borrowing. All government revenue, other than the proceeds of
borrowing and sums received by government departments in the course of
their normal activities (known as appropriations-in-aid), is paid into an
account with the Bank of England (known as the Exchequer Account) which
forms the Consolidated Fund. With certain exceptions (the main ones being
government loans and national insurance benefits), all payments by the
Government come out of this account.
The following sections outline the machinery by which expenditure and
revenue are authorised and controlled, the purposes on which public money
is spent and the sources from which revenue is obtained.
Central government expenditure falls into three main groups:
1. The main part of government expenditure which is authorised by annual
Appropriation Acts and includes, broadly, expenditure on defence, on the
social services and on the general administration of the country. These are
called Supply Services because the House of Commons, when voting
money, is granting to the Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are required to
satisfy ... the pecuniary necessities of the Government’. It should be
noted that some of this expenditure may also depend on legislation, such
as the National Health Service Acts, which relates to a specific object of
expenditure.
2. Expenditure which is specifically authorised by Acts of Parliament other
than annual Appropriation Acts. These are the Consolidated Fund
Standing Services which represent a direct charge on the Consolidated
Fund, covering the residual cost of servicing the National Debt,1 the
financial provision made for members of the royal family, and salaries and
pensions of judges and certain high officers, such as the Speaker of the
House of Commons and the Leader of the Opposition, whose indepen¬
dence of the Government is thought to be better guaranteed by permanent
grant than by annual vote. This group also includes expenditure from the
National Insurance and similar special funds.
1 The servicing of the National Debt is charged in the first instance to the National
Loans Fund. After taking account of certain receipts by the Fund, including interest
received on loans to nationalised industries and local authorities, the residue is charged
to the Consolidated Fund.

3. Government lending and debt, which under the National Loans Act 1968
are channelled through the National Loans Fund. These include most of
the Government’s domestic lending to the nationalised industries, local
authorities and public corporations as well as the principal repayments and
the servicing (that is, interest and expenses) of the National Debt.
The Estimates for the Supply Services are considered by the House of
Commons during the 29 days (known as Supply days) which are allotted by
Standing Order of the House to consideration of Supply business in each
session. The choice of subject for debate on these days rests with the
Opposition. The House usually discusses general questions of policy relevant
to the Estimates, though any Estimate may be examined in detail if members
wish and if time allows (see p. 39).
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on 1st April
are submitted to the Treasury by each department in the preceding December.
Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called ‘Votes’ which
are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House of Commons
approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later confirmed in
the Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the money to specific Votes.
No civil department may spend money granted on one Vote for the purposes
of another; but Service departments may do so providing they get Treasury
sanction, which, in turn, requires the retrospective authorisation of Parliament.
Within each Vote, ‘virement’, that is, the spending of money on one subhead
instead of on another, is permissible so far as Parliament is concerned, but
only with Treasury consent.
An insufficient Estimate, or a new service not covered by the Vote, or
virement of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should be
brought to the attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate.
The Treasury exercises the same power of scrutiny over this as over the
ordinary Estimates.
Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller
and Auditor General, and by the Public Accounts and Estimates Committees
of the House of Commons.
The power of the Treasury to control expenditure derives from the responsi¬
bility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for financial policy.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the
House of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by departments,
the Treasury has to look at the proposals for expenditure in relation to
the results of the public expenditure surveys (see below); and to eliminate
any overlapping, uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where this has escaped
the net of departmental financial control. Apart from the scrutiny of Estimates,
throughout the year the Treasury exercises a general supervision over all
departmental expenditure. The Treasury also lays down general rules of
financial and accounting procedure for departments and prescribes the
principles on which departmental contracts shall be made and the limits
within which certain classes of losses may be written off.
In 1961 the Plowden Committee on the Control of Public Expenditure
recommended in its Report (Cmnd. 1432) that regular surveys should be
made of public expenditure as a whole over a period of years ahead and in
relation to prospective resources, and that decisions involving future expendi¬
ture should be taken in the light of these surveys. Surveys, therefore, are now
made annually and have become an established part of the Government’s

machinery for the planning and control of expenditure (see p. 234). Changes
in the presentation of the Estimates and in the procedures for consideration
by Parliament of expenditure were proposed in a White Paper Public Expendi¬
ture: A New Presentation (Cmnd 4017), published in April 1969.
Control over issues of money to departments and the audit of accounts is
exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is a permanent
Crown appointment. Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller he
controls receipts and issues of public money to and from the Exchequer
Account and the National Loans Fund; and as Auditor General he audits
departmental accounts and submits his report on the Appropriation Accounts
and other accounts, as required by statute, to Parliament. His statutory
function is to ensure that all expenditure is properly incurred, for example,
that no payments are made which go beyond any relevant statutory authority,
and that Treasury sanction has been obtained wherever necessary. In addition,
however, he has been encouraged by successive Public Accounts Committees
(see the next paragraph) to examine departmental expenditure with a view to
drawing attention to any cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The accounts of each department and the reports on the accounts made by
the Comptroller and Auditor General are considered by a select committee
called the Public Accounts Committee. This was first set up in 1861, on the
motion of Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of ensuring that expenditure was
properly incurred in accordance with the purpose for which it was voted and
with any relevant Acts of Parliament. The terms of reference of the committee
are to examine the accounts and these terms have been widely interpreted by
successive committees which have investigated whether full value has been
obtained for the sums spent by departments and have examined cases in which
the administration appears to have been faulty or negligent. The committee
has therefore become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste and
inefficiency. It embodies its findings in reports which may be debated in the
House of Commons. Its recommendations are considered by the Treasury
in consultation with departments and put into effect, so far as they are
accepted, according to Treasury instructions. A reply to each report is
submitted by the Treasury to the committee of the following session and
where the recommendations have been unacceptable to the Treasury the
committee may either accept the objections or return to the charge in sub¬
sequent reports.
This committee was originally set up in 1912 and has been reappointed
annually except during the war years. In i960 it was made a select committee
set up each session under standing orders. The committee’s functions are
to examine the Estimates, to report how, if at all, the policy implied in the
Estimates can be carried out more economically and to consider the principal
variations between the Estimates of the current year and those of the previous
year and the form in which the Estimates should be presented. Usually, the
committee selects each year a few Votes for review.
Through the medium of a number of sub-committees, the committee carries
out extensive investigations into the departments or subjects under considera¬
tion. In practice the Estimates for the current year are not affected, but the
committee’s recommendations produce changes in future Estimates and
strengthen Treasury control. One of these sub-committees examines the
winter and spring Supplementary Estimates and the principal variations
between the Estimates presented and those of the previous year. The other
sub-committees are organised on functional lines, each sub-committee being

allocated a different sphere of government policy and administration. Addi¬
tional parliamentary time has been allocated for discussion of the reports of
the Estimates and the Public Accounts Committees.
‘Budget’ is an old word meaning a bag containing papers or accounts. The
use of the word in public finance originated in the expression ‘The Chancellor
of the Exchequer opened his Budget’, which is applied in Parliament to the
annual speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining his proposals for
balancing revenue and expenditure.
The annual Budget speech is normally the main occasion of the year for
reviewing the central Government’s finances and the economic state of the
nation, and its formal basis is the Chancellor’s proposals for raising money by
taxation. In recent years it has become the practice for Chancellors to discuss
in the Budget speech the prospects for the economy in the period ahead in
some detail. By the time the Budget is introduced (usually in April) the
Estimates of expenditure under various headings will have been presented to
Parliament and published, and the expected total of government expenditure
for the year will be known. The Chancellor estimates the yield of the revenue
on the basis of existing taxation and proposes such changes in taxation as he
considers desirable on economic grounds. These proposals are later embodied
in detail in a Finance Bill. The interval between the Budget Statement and the
Royal Assent to the Finance Bill (usually given in July) is covered by legisla¬
tion (mainly the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968), whereby changes
in income tax, corporation tax, purchase tax, selective employment tax and
customs and excise duties have statutory effect before the passing of the
Finance Bill if adopted by Resolution of the House of Commons.
The Budget also takes into account the finance needed to cover government
lending. Details for the current year were given in a White Paper, Loans from
the National Loan Fund 1969-jo, issued on Budget day. For 1969-70 it is
estimated that rather more than half of the net issues from this Fund would
be loans to nationalised industries; just under one-third would be loans to
local authorities; and the remainder loans to public corporations, private
industry, and certain advances within the central Government.
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money
for government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated
that taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and the
level of expenditure on particular goods and services. At a later period it was
realised that taxation also affected the nation’s total expenditure and therefore
the general level of economic activity. Since the second world war, Budgets
have been consciously designed in greater or lesser degree to bring the total
demand for goods and services into balance with total national output.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure and, therefore, the total
demand for goods and services in the following way: if there is an increase in
government expenditure without an increase in taxation then total demand for
goods and services will tend to rise; the same thing will happen if there is a
decrease in taxation without a decrease in government spending. In this way
the Budget can be used to counter unemployment. On the other hand, if
there is an increase in taxation without an increase in government expenditure,
or a decrease in government expenditure without a decrease in taxation then
the total demand for goods and services will tend to fall. Particular taxes may
be used with the intention of bringing about certain desired effects. For
example, taxes on income and capital affect the distribution of wealth because

the rates vary according to the size of the income or capital, the proportion of
a high income or capital taken in tax being much greater than the proportion
of a small one; while taxes on expenditure may influence the allocation of
resources and the pattern of trade by discouraging or encouraging the con¬
sumption of particular goods.
The main objectives of British budgetary policy in recent years have been
the achievement and maintenance of a strong balance of payments together
with a high rate of economic growth and a high level of employment. In order
to regulate demand more closely, successive governments have adopted a
much more flexible attitude towards fiscal policy and have not hesitated to use
budgetary measures between annual Budgets. At the same time consideration
is given to the long-term strategy for taxation and to ways in which the
existing system of taxation can be improved by ensuring that its incidence
is fair and by closing loopholes. The Budgets of 1968 and 1969 were used to
reduce the level of domestic demand so as to obtain the maximum benefit
from the devaluation of the pound sterling in 1967.
In the United Kingdom the principal taxes fall into three main categories.
First, taxes on income, which include income tax, surtax and corporation tax;
second, taxes on capital, which include estate duty, capital gains tax and the
tax on short-term gains; and third, taxes on expenditure (including taxes
on the ownership or use of certain assets)—these include not only customs and
excise duties and the purchase tax, but also the selective employment tax (in
service and construction industries), local rates, stamp duties and licence duties
(for example, on motor vehicles and dogs). Taxes on individual (though not
corporate) incomes are progressive taxes, that is, larger incomes and estates
bear a proportionately higher rate of tax. The Board of Inland Revenue
collects the taxes on income and capital and the stamp duties, the Board of
Customs and Excise collects the most important taxes on expenditure, the
customs and excise taxes and the purchase tax, while a variety of authorities
are responsible for the collection of the remainder, including the Ministry of
Social Security for the selective employment tax.
Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April, which is at present 41-25 per cent (8s. 3d. in the £). The tax
imposed on an individual is graduated by means of personal allowances and
reliefs, by a reduced rate of tax on the first section of taxable income1 and by
the surtax. In the case of a married couple the incomes of husband and wife are
aggregated and are treated as one income, but higher allowances are given
than for a single person. A special allowance is given against any earnings of
a married women. Earned income bears less tax than other income as certain
fractional deductions (‘earned income relief’) are allowable.
A single person earning £1,000 a year pays £186 in income tax, while a
married man with the same earned income pays £137; if he has two children
under the age of 11, his tax (after taking into account the receipt of family
allowances) falls to £75; when the children are between the ages of 11 and 16,
the tax is £60; if the children are over 16 and receiving full-time education,
only j£45 18 paid. The range of tax payable by a single person varies from, for
example, £40 on an earned income of £$00 a year to ^I>515 on an earned
income of £5,000; if the income is unearned, tax liability on £500 will be £53
and on £5,000 will be £2,441.
1 The balance of income remaining after deduction of the personal allowances and
reliefs is taxable income. For 1969-70 there is one reduced rate of 30 per cent (6s. in
the j0 on the first £260 of taxable income. The remainder is charged at the standard rate.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay-as-
you-earn’) scheme, under which tax is deducted at source, thus enabling them
to keep up to date on tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons (including
companies) resident in the United Kingdom. The main exceptions are that
interest on certain United Kingdom government securities belonging to
persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is exempt; and
income from certain classes of possessions abroad is chargeable not on the
amount of income arising but on the amount of income remitted to the United
Kingdom. The United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many
countries providing for relief from double taxation; where such agreements
are not in force unilateral relief is allowed.
The surtax, which is essentially an income tax at higher rates, is charged on
personal incomes exceeding £2,000 a year after deducting certain personal
allowances in excess of the single person’s basic allowance. In addition, the
same earned income relief as for income tax and a special earnings allowance
(not exceeding £2,000) are deductible from earned income only. Surtax is
imposed at rates which increase progressively until, on the portion of taxable
income above £15,000, the combined rate of income tax and surtax payable
in 1969-70 (being income tax for 1969-70 and surtax for 1968-69) reaches
91-25 per cent (18s. 3d. in the £).
Companies are liable to corporation tax on both their profits and their capital
gains. In addition, a company now deducts income tax from dividends and
other distributions and pays it over to the Inland Revenue as a separate matter
from its own liability. The rate of corporation tax is fixed retrospectively in the
Budget for the past financial year; for 1968-69 it is 45 per cent. The tax is
assessed on the profits of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate for
the financial year in which the accounting period falls. The basic rule for the
calculation of income for corporation tax purposes is that, except for special
provisions, it is computed in accordance with income tax principles.
Estate duty is chargeable on the value of all property which passes at death.
The charge to duty is not limited to property owned by the deceased but may
extend to other property, for example, to trust funds from which the deceased
received income in his lifetime and to gifts made by the deceased within
seven years of his death (one year in the case of a gift for public or charitable
purposes). Since the 1969 Budget estates not over £10,000 are exempt from
duty; but on estates of a higher value duty is chargeable by reference to rates
ranging from 25 per cent to 85 per cent applied to successive slices of the
estate.
Capital gains accruing on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax
or, in the cases of companies, to corporation tax. Where assets were acquired
before 6th April 1965, the charge is restricted to the part of any gain attribut¬
able to the period since 6th April 1965. The rate of tax for persons other than
companies is 30 per cent, but in the case of individuals may be less, depending
on their circumstances. Certain assets are exempt from tax including the
principal private residence, chattels worth less than £1,000 (and any chattels,
except those used for the purpose of a trade, with a predictable life of less than
50 years), private motor cars, National savings certificates and (from 15th
April 1969) British Government and Government-guaranteed securities. The
gains of an individual for a year are exempt if, after deducting losses, they do
not exceed £50. Gains arising to individuals from the disposal of assets

within 12 months of their acquisition are in general liable as short-term gains
to income tax (and surtax) and not to capital gains tax.
The largest group of taxes on expenditure are those administered by the
Customs and Excise Department, namely, the duties on tobacco, hydrocarbon
oil, alcoholic drinks, purchase tax, protective duties, betting and certain
miscellaneous items. In British usage the distinction between customs and
excise depends on whether the goods are imported (customs duties) or British
produced (excise duties). These taxes are sometimes known as indirect taxes
since they are normally paid by the importer, manufacturer, or wholesaler,
who adjusts the prices charged to customers accordingly. In 1969 the tax
burden was equivalent to about 4s. 6d. on a gallon of petrol, 4s. qd. on a
packet of 20 standard plain cigarettes, £2 4s. on a bottle of whisky, and nd. on
a pint of beer of average strength.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has power to vary by Order by up to 10
per cent the rates of purchase tax and any of the other main groups of customs
and excise duties (that is, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, oil, and the minor revenue
duties). This power known as the ‘regulator’, requires annual renewal.
Purchase tax is charged on a wide range of goods, nearly all of them consumer
goods, at four rates, which are currently 13! per cent, 22 per cent, 36! per cent
and 55 per cent of the wholesale value. Articles subject to revenue duties of
customs and excise are in general exempt from this tax; other goods free
of purchase tax include food (other than confectionery, soft drinks, ice cream,
crisps and pet foods), fuel, books and newspapers, young children’s clothing
and footwear, certain non-proprietary drugs and medicines, and some house¬
hold appliances.
The principal betting duties are: the pool betting duty (which applies to
football pools and betting by coupon at fixed odds) charged at a rate of 33^ per
cent of the stake money; and the general betting duty, which is charged on
most other kinds of betting at the rate of 5 per cent of stake money. An annual
licence duty equivalent to three times the rateable value of the premises where
off-course betting is carried on was imposed in the 1969 Finance Act. Gaming
is taxed at different rates mainly by licence fees.
Taxes on motor vehicles are collected by the local taxation authorities (the
county or county borough councils in England and Wales and the correspond¬
ing councils in Scotland); the proceeds are paid by the local authorities into
the Exchequer. The licence duty on a private motor car is £25 a year; motor
cycles and three-wheel vehicles, etc., pay £2 10s., £5 or £10 a year according
to engine capacity.
The selective employment tax is designed, among other things, to encourage
economy in the use of labour in the service industries. It is paid by all employers
throughout the United Kingdom at a rate per week of 48s. for men, 24s. for
women and boys and 16s. for girls. Employers, however, are affected in
various ways. Employers in manufacturing industries in the development areas
receive a refund of tax and additional sums, made up of a selective employment
premium and a regional employment premium (see p. 254). Employers in
manufacturing industries not in the development areas and employers in
transport and communications, public service, including the nationalised
industries, agriculture, extractive industries and charities have the tax refunded
but receive no premium. Employers in service industries and construction pay
the tax without refund, but schemes have now been introduced for the refund
of the tax in respect of certain part-time and elderly workers, employees working
overseas and employees in hotels in certain rural parts of development areas.

After allowing for the Budget changes, total expenditure for the financial year
ending 31st March 1970 is estimated to reach £12,551 million, including £751
million for Consolidated Fund Standing Services and £11,800 million for
Supply Services. The estimate for total revenue is £15,008 million of which
£14,464 million is receipts from taxation. A surplus of £2,457 million for
transfer to the National Loans Fund is therefore expected. Net lending from
the National Loans Fund (see p. 360) is estimated to reach £1,631 million.
Thus in 1969-70, after special transactions, there is likely to be a net
repayment of debt by the central Government of some £826 million.

The National
Debt
PUBLIC FINANCE
IN NORTHERN
IRELAND
BRITAIN I970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Capital expenditure consists chiefly of loans to the nationalised industries, the
local authorities and other public corporations, such as the New Towns
Development Corporations. These loans, less repayments, are financed
from the National Loans Fund by the surplus of revenue over expenditure
(if any), by the proceeds of government borrowing including borrowing
from extra-budgetary funds, such as the National Insurance Fund, and
by the sterling receipts (if any) accruing to the Exchange Equalisation
Account.
Exchequer borrowing may be in the form of borrowing from the public
either through the National Savings Movement (see p. 372) or by borrowing
on the market by means of new issues of securities. New issues of government
securities are made from time to time for the purpose of refinancing maturing
issues (conversion issues) or to raise new money (issues for cash). The
capital requirements of the nationalised industries are met by the central
Government while those of the local authorities are met partly through the
Public Works Loan Board (see p. 73) and partly by borrowing direct from
the public, although both may also now borrow, with Treasury consent, in
foreign currencies.
The National Debt increased particularly rapidly during and immediately
after the first and second world wars. It rose from £650 million in 1914 to
£7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7,131 million in
I939 t0 £23>637 million in 1946. On 31st March 1969 the total National Debt
(provisional) was £33,991 million, of which £2,253 million was repayable
in currencies other than sterling, mainly to the United States and Canadian
Governments. Of the £31,738 million of internal debt, £6,078 million was
short-term debt, mainly in the form of 91-day Treasury bills, while the long¬
term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds, loans, and certificates carrying
fixed rates of interest (ranging from 2^ to 8f per cent) and with fixed or
indeterminate dates of repayment.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole, under
which public revenues, with a few minor exceptions, are paid into the
Exchequer Account, from which no money can be withdrawn except on the
authority of Parliament. That authority is expressed in the case of Consolidated
Fund charges in permanent legislative form, and in the case of Supply Services
by annual Appropriation Acts based on estimates prepared by departments
and sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major sources of revenue flowing into the Northern Ireland Exchequer
are the main national taxes imposed by the United Kingdom Parliament over
the whole country and paid, in the first instance, into the United Kingdom
Consolidated Fund. These taxes, which are referred to in the Government of
Ireland Act 1920 as ‘reserved’ taxes (that is, reserved to the United Kingdom
Parliament), comprise the Inland Revenue group (income tax, surtax,
corporation tax and capital gains tax) and customs and excise duties on goods.
After the cost of collecting these taxes in Northern Ireland (and the cost of
some other reserved services) and an Imperial Contribution have been
retained in the United Kingdom Consolidated Fund, the balance, termed the
‘Residuary Share of Reserved Taxes’, is paid to the Northern Ireland Ex¬
chequer where it joins up with the ‘transferred’ taxes (that is, where taxation
powers have been transferred to the Northern Ireland Parliament) to form the
public income. Among items of Transferred Tax Revenue are estate duties,
lie Bank of
Ingland
FINANCE 369
stamp duties, betting duties, various excise licence duties, motor vehicle
duties and selective employment tax.
A joint Exchequer Board, representative of the Treasury and the Ministry
of Finance for Northern Ireland, constituted in accordance with the Govern¬
ment of Ireland Act 1920, determines the amount of Reserved Revenue and
the cost of Reserved Services attributable to Northern Ireland for each year,
the amount of the Imperial Contribution, and such other questions affecting
the financial relations of the two Governments as may be referred to it.
In the Northern Ireland Budget for 1969-70 (year ending 31st March),
total revenues were forecast at ^339 million and expenditure at £337 million.
After allowing for the Imperial Contribution, provisionally estimated at £2
million, there was a Budget surplus of £67,380.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £281 million on 31st
March 1969, is covered by repayable advances and investments held by the
Ministry of Finance.
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland, various funds have been
established, in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific
purposes. In general, these funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the
principal funds being those relating to National Insurance and government
loans. The latter constitutes a pool of capital money available mainly for local
and public authority borrowings; on 31st March 1969, a sum of approximately
£222 million was outstanding against such borrowers.
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It
comprises a central bank; commercial banks which carry on the usual main
banking services; the United Kingdom offices of banks whose main business
is in other countries; merchant banks and other specialised institutions.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal
Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act 1946.
As the central bank, the Bank acts as banker to the Government, to
overseas central banks and to commercial banks; it is the note-issuing
authority and the registrar for some 200 government, nationalised industry,
local authority, public board and Commonwealth government stocks. As
agent for the Government the Bank administers exchange control and the
voluntary arrangements to limit investment in the more developed countries
of the sterling area. On behalf of the Treasury it manages the Exchange
Equalisation Account (EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves of gold
and foreign exchange; using the resources of the EEA the Bank designs its
interventions in the foreign exchange market both to prevent undue fluctua¬
tions in the exchange value of sterling and to conserve the means of making
payments abroad.
As banker to the Government in the widest sense, among other things,
the Bank examines and seeks to anticipate banking and financial problems
and to undertake the appropriate operations in the money, capital and the
foreign exchange markets; consequently the Bank has a major responsibility
for advising the Government on the formulation of monetary policy and for
its subsequent execution.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In implementing monetary policy the Bank acts almost daily in the money
market, by buying or selling Treasury bills, and similarly in the market for
government stocks. A prime concern is to maintain orderly conditions and,
when necessary, the Bank also exerts influence on interest rates; an important
instrument in this context is Bank Rate, which is the minimum rate at which
the Bank will discount approved bills of exchange for the members of the
London Discount Market or will normally lend to them; virtually all other
short-term interest rates are related to it.
As the recognised channel of communication between the commercial
banks and other financial institutions of the City of London on the one hand,
and the Government on the other, the Bank has been called on in recent
years to administer direct control of credit. This has been achieved by means
of ‘special deposits’ which the London clearing banks and Scottish banks are
called upon to make with the Bank; through requests to the banks and other
financial institutions not to extend credit beyond stipulated quantitative
ceilings; and by general guidance to them on lending policy.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. Notes thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold, securities
and coin. Very little gold is now held by the Issue Department of the Bank,
by far the major part of the note issue being covered by securities and coin;
this part is the fiduciary issue, the level of which is subject to parliamentary
control. (The Scottish and Northern Ireland banks have limited rights to
issue notes; these issues, apart from an amount specified by legislation for
each bank, must be fully covered by Bank of England notes and by coin.)
The provision of coin for circulation is the responsibility of the Royal Mint,
a government department.
The primary business of the deposit banks is the receipt, transfer and
encashment of deposits. The principal deposit banks are the 11 London
clearing banks, 4 Scottish banks and 3 Northern Ireland banks. Recent
mergers have resulted in the formation of six banking groups, four based in
London and two in Scotland. When they have been completed there will be
only six London clearing banks and three Scottish banks. The three Northern
Ireland banks are owned by London clearing banks, but two groups of banks
based in the Republic of Ireland also operate in Northern Ireland.
At the end of 1968 current and deposit accounts with the deposit banks
operating in Britain amounted to over £11,600 million, and accounted for
just over half of the total deposits of the banking sector, which also includes
the National Giro, the accepting houses, overseas banks, other banks and the
discount market. The deposit banks provide full banking services throughout
Britain, operating through over 14,000 branches at the end of 1968; several
have interests in British overseas and Commonwealth banks, and in other
banks which have been formed specially to compete in international markets.
They have also acquired substantial interests in hire-purchase finance houses,
and some have set up their own unit trusts.
Together with the Bank of England the London clearing banks make up
the membership of the London Bankers’ Clearing House. In 1968 cheques,
drafts, bills and bankers’ effects passing through the clearing system averaged
in value £50,021 million monthly, while the average monthly value of the
credit transfer clearing was £970 million.
Current account balances with the deposit banks are repayable on demand
and no interest is paid on them, but on deposit account balances interest is
paid at a rate generally 2 per cent below Bank Rate. The London clearing

banks maintain a ratio of about 8 per cent between cash reserves and total
deposits. It is also a convention among the London clearing banks that at
least 28 per cent of deposits should be held in the form of liquid assets.
The banks’ profits are largely earned through their advances to customers
partly in the form of overdrafts and partly in the form of loans (with or
without collateral security); these are normally for a short term only unless
renewed. The ratio of London clearing bank advances to total deposits
declined from about 43 per cent in 1938 to 17 per cent at the end of the
second world war but it has since risen and in June 1969 it was around 50 per
cent. In recent years the banks have several times been asked to restrain the
growth of their lending and to ensure that, within the total, priority is given
to finance for exports and for productive investment in manufacturing industry
and agriculture: this has involved the restriction of advances to the personal
sector. (In November 1968 they were asked to reduce their advances by
2 per cent of the level of November 1967.) The banks’ ‘liquid’ assets, that is,
those that are quickly realisable, are their loans to discount houses (money
at call), and their holdings of Treasury and commercial bills and certain export
and shipbuilding credits refinanceable with the Bank of England: they also
hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio (mainly British Government
securities) or trade investments.
The bank giro, originally introduced as the credit transfer scheme, and the
direct debiting system, by which a creditor with the prior approval of the
debtor may claim money due to him direct from the latter’s banking account,
have helped to improve the money transmission services. Another fairly
recent banking innovation has been the introduction by some banks of
automatic cash dispensing machines, which allow customers to obtain cash
at any time. Credit cards have become increasingly popular for the settlement
of accounts in retail shops.
There are also some 35 British overseas and Commonwealth banks, many of
them having their headquarters in London. They provide a comprehensive
banking service in many parts of the world and engage in the financing of
trade not only between Britain and other countries but also between third
countries. There are also currently in London about 25 United States banks,
10 Japanese banks and over 50 other foreign banks.
The National Giro came into operation in October 1968. It provides a postal
cheque service for all customers with a current account, but no overdraft
facilities. Payments and withdrawals may be made through any post office in
Britain, but the records of all transactions and all the accounts are maintained
at a single central office at Bootle, near Liverpool.
The merchant banks have helped to give London an international reputation
as a world financial centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. They
are of two kinds, and are known as accepting houses and issuing houses
according to whether they specialise predominantly in the work of acceptance
credit1 or in transactions involving the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf
of their customers. They arrange to issue and themselves underwrite long-
and short-term loans to governments of, or enterprises in, overseas countries
1 Acceptance credit has been defined as fundamentally a three-month operation
financing exports from and imports to Britain and to other markets. The expression is
derived from the method of financing trade by which commercial bills are ‘accepted’
or guaranteed by a merchant bank against documents, after which they may be
discounted for cash by a discount house.
372 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in sterling (where permitted by exchange control regulations) or in other
currencies which have been deposited with them; this latter type of transac¬
tion, in what are called the euro-dollar markets, has increased considerably in
recent years. They are also engaged in the work of the gold and foreign
exchange markets, and they have many other functions in connection with the
financing of trade, investment management, and insurance.
The Discount The London discount or money market is a distinctive part of the British
Market banking system. It consists of 12 discount houses and its principal function
is to marry the needs of lenders of money for short periods with those of the
borrowers of such money.
The discount houses borrow ‘at call’ from banks and other financial
institutions at a relatively low rate of interest. To them the Bank of England
acts as a lender of last resort. The clearing banks do not borrow money
directly from the Bank of England; if they need to add to their cash resources
they call in part of their loans to the discount market. If, as a result, any
particular discount house is unable to cover its needs for cash elsewhere, it is
obliged to borrow from the Bank of England, normally at Bank Rate for
seven days, but the Bank may charge a higher rate and has also at times lent
overnight, or for short periods, at the rates of interest prevailing in the
market.
An important part of the money borrowed by the discount houses is
invested in British Government Treasury bills. The discount houses accept as
an informal responsibility that they should cover the Government’s need to
borrow on Treasury bills, which are offered on tender each week. The
clearing banks do not buy Treasury bills at the weekly tenders except on
behalf of customers, but they purchase, from the discount market, bills which
are of a maturity required by them.
The discount houses provide a specialised market in commercial bills and
in short-dated Government bonds (that is, those with not more than five years
to run before repayment), local authority bonds, and certain other negotiable
instruments.
The National
Savings
Movement
National Savings
Securities
The National Savings Movement started in 1916 to help finance the war by
promoting savings. The present movement encourages the widespread
investment of savings in Trustee Savings Banks and the National Savings
Bank (see p. 374), formerly known as the Post Office Savings Bank, and in
National Savings securities. The movement is led by the National Savings
Committee for England and Wales and similar committees for Scotland and
Northern Ireland.1 The committees are bodies of independent persons
representing regional savings organisations and various national institutions
connected with such matters as finance, industry and education. They are
assisted by a salaried staff of civil servants. Voluntary local savings com¬
mittees, often assisted or promoted by local authorities, co-ordinate the work
of voluntary local savings groups.
The administration of the National Savings Bank and all forms of national
savings is carried out by the Department for National Savings. Three forms
of National Savings securities are currently on sale: the National Savings
1 The Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance is responsible for the administration of
Ulster Savings, but the furtherance and organisation of the savings movement in
Northern Ireland is the concern of a central voluntary committee, which is voluntarily
assisted by county and local committees and district groups.

National Savings Certificates, in units of j£i, are encashable at par at any
time; interest, which is free of income tax and surtax, is only paid on encash¬
ment; the limit on individual holdings is 1,500 units of the current issue.
British Savings Bonds, sold in units of £5 with a maximum holding of
£10,000, bear interest at 7 per cent and are repayable at par on one month’s
notice. Premium Savings Bonds are in units of £1 and individual holdings
are limited to £1,250. After a qualifying period of three months the bonds
give investors a chance to win tax-free prizes instead of receiving interest.
There is now a weekly draw for a prize of £25,000 and a monthly draw for
prizes ranging from £25 to £5,000. At the end of June 1969, £726 million
was invested in this form of savings. Nearly all British Government securities
are held on the Post Office Register and can also be bought or sold at most
post offices.
A contractual savings scheme was announced in the 1969 Budget for
introduction in October 1969. Known as ‘Save as You Earn’ (SAYE), it
enables savings to be made in regular monthly amounts within a minimum
of £1 and a maximum of £10 in deposits with the Department for National
Savings by means of deductions from pay or by other regular payments. At
the end of five years, savings will qualify for a bonus equivalent to one year’s
savings free of tax. Completed savings which are not withdrawn will qualify
for a double bonus at the end of seven years, that is, two years’ savings.
For example, contributions totalling £60 payable over five years at a rate of
£1 per month will qualify for a bonus of £12 at the end of that period, or
£24 if left on deposit for a further two years. Savers who wish to stop pay¬
ments will be able to withdraw the total sum saved (but there cannot be
partial withdrawals). Tax-free compound interest will be paid at the rate of
2^ per cent on amounts withdrawn after the first but before the end of the
fifth year, or at 4^ per cent where the contributions cease but the savings
are left invested for the remainder of the five years or where the saver dies

Development Bonds and the Defence Bonds.

before the contributions are completed. A ‘Save as You Earn’ scheme (with
the same ^10 limit) will be operated by the trustee savings banks and a
similar but separate scheme will be operated by building societies.
The National Savings Bank, formerly known as the Post Office Savings Bank
which was set up in 1861, is the largest organisation of its kind in the world.
It provides a countrywide system for depositing and withdrawing small
savings and has over 23 million active accounts. Ordinary Accounts bear
interest at 2^ per cent and the first £15 of interest is tax-free. Up to £10 can
be withdrawn on demand at any post office, but a few days’ notice is required
for larger amounts. The moneys are lodged with the National Debt Office
and are invested in government securities. Deposits up to a limit of £10,000
bearing a higher rate of interest may be made in Investment Accounts where
investors have a qualifying deposit of £50 in an Ordinary Account. All
deposits carry a government guarantee; in June 1969 they totalled £1,770
million.
The Trustee Savings Banks, many of which also started in the nineteenth
century, operate under their own trustees but are subject to statutory provi¬
sions and National Debt Office surveillance. There are 77 individual banks
with 1,427 Trustee Offices and over 12 million accounts. Deposits can be
made either in the Ordinary Departments, the Special Investment Depart¬
ments or the Current Account Departments. The terms for deposits in the
Ordinary Departments are similar to those in the National Savings Bank.
Withdrawals can usually be made on demand though notice is required for
large sums. Deposits are invested with the National Debt Commissioners and
both capital and interest are guaranteed by the Government. The Special
Investment Departments offer a higher rate of return, which is taxable.
Deposits are limited to £10,000, but are not government guaranteed. At
the end of June 1969 total sums in the Ordinary Departments of the Trustee
Savings Banks were £1,070 million and in the Special Investment Depart-
ments £1,349 million. Most Trustee Savings Banks operate cheque services
on deposits in the Current Account Departments. In January 1968 the
Trustee Savings Banks set up their own unit trust (see p. 376).
At end-June 1969 National Savings totalled £8,546 million, about a
quarter of the National Debt. The diagram on p. 373 shows the distribution
of National Savings between the different outlets in 1958 and 1968.
The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed a deposit and loan department
about the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to engage in
banking was recognised in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of 1876.
The primary purpose of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank was to
serve the co-operative movement, whose financial centre it has become, but
its clients include trade unions and other mutual societies, local authorities
and individual depositors. The bank’s headquarters are in Manchester. The
Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society, which has its headquarters in
Glasgow, has similarly engaged in banking since 1948.
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of many
special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities,
which are supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are
mainly provided through the savings banks, finance corporations, hire-
purchase finance companies, the stock exchanges, investment trusts, building
societies and the insurance market. The firms engaged in such activities are

in the main highly specialised, for example, discount and other finance houses,
stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers.
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited (FCI) and
the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited (ICFC), were
set up in 1945 to assist in dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction
and development. The corporations are ordinary limited companies with no
official representation on their boards and having no recourse to public funds.
Another corporation, the Commonwealth Development Finance Company
Limited (CDFC), was established in 1953 to assist development projects in
the Commonwealth. Among other financial corporations are the Agricultural
Mortgage Corporation Limited and the Scottish Agricultural Securities
Corporation Limited.
The FCI was formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of
£200,000 and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of industry.
The FCI has an authorised and issued capital of £25 million and may
borrow up to four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of
j£i25 million. The share capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance
companies, 30 per cent by investment trust companies and 30 per cent by the
Bank of England. At 31st March 1969 the capital called and paid up was
10 per cent (£2-5 million); the Bank of England paid £5 million in advance
of call in 1959. The liability of the shareholders in respect of the uncalled
capital represents security to the banks providing loans for the corporation’s
working capital. The value of its investments at that date was £38-4 million.
The ICFC has as its main object the provision of credit and finance by means
of loan and share capital for small and medium-sized industrial and commer¬
cial concerns in Great Britain, particularly in cases where the existing
facilities provided by banking institutions and the Stock Exchange are not
readily or easily available. It has a number of subsidiaries including Technical
Development Capital Ltd. and others which own ships which are chartered
to responsible shipowners.
The authorised and issued share capital of the ICFC at 31st March 1969
was £40 million fully paid up. In addition, public debenture issues have been
made to a total of £yo million. The current resources of the ICFC group,
including reserves shown in the balance sheet, total about £144 million.
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company is a private enterprise
institution. Established in 1953, CDFC is not now necessarily confined to the
Commonwealth. It aims to support business enterprise overseas by providing
finance in the form of share capital and loans on mutually acceptable terms.
Its authorised share capital is .£30 million, of which about 14J million ‘A’
ordinary shares of £1 (2s. paid) are held by industrial, shipping, mining and
banking interests in the United Kingdom, and nf million ‘B’ ordinary shares
of £1 (10s. paid) are held by the Bank of England and certain central banks
in the Commonwealth. Up to the end of March 1969 CDFC had investments
in nearly 100 undertakings. They were spread over a wide range of industry
in 27 countries and had a book value of £28 million.
There are 8 stock exchanges in the British Isles. In addition the Provincial
Brokers’ Stock Exchange operates in no cities and towns throughout Britain
and the Irish Republic. The Federation of Stock Exchanges in Great
Britain and Ireland, comprising with one exception all these organisations,
N
376 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
was set up in July 1965 to co-ordinate their work. Four Scottish stock
exchanges are linked, as are also those in the north of England and in the
Midlands and west of England.
The London Stock Exchange is by far the most important of these stock
exchanges and is one of the world’s two foremost free markets in securities.
Some 9,000 securities are quoted on the London Stock Exchange; at the
end of March 1969 these had a total market value of £131,679 million. About
8,100 securities of companies are quoted, including a number of leading over¬
seas companies. Companies issues represented 45 per cent of the securities at
nominal values, and the remainder were British and overseas government and
corporation stocks; at market values the proportion was over four-fifths.
The London Stock Exchange is linked by cable or telephone with stock
exchanges all over the world. Therefore, a quoted company, subject to any
limitations imposed by the exchange control regulations, has a world-wide
market for its issues. This is an important factor in the raising of new capital
by government and commercial borrowers. Arbitrage transactions by brokers
—the buying or selling of a particular security on one stock exchange with the
intention of reversing it on another—play an important part in equating
price differentials between different markets and maintaining a continual
flow of business between centres.
The stock exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains
are made between members reflect the interaction of supply and demand
for the securities concerned. All the stock exchanges operate under strict
rules of conduct which they formulate themselves.
In recent years there has been a constantly rising demand, except for short
periods, for ordinary (equity) shares, partly in expectation that such shares
will maintain their real value or grow in value in periods of rising prices.
Insurance companies and pension funds invest a larger proportion than
formerly of their assets in these shares, and the Trustee Investments Act 1961
permits trustees, under certain conditions, to invest up to half the funds they
hold in trust in equity shares.
The ownership of securities on the London Stock Exchange is much more
widespread than formerly: it is estimated that there are about 2% million
shareholders in the United Kingdom and that their shareholdings are widely
distributed. The largest public company in Britain has nearly 600,000
shareholders and there are several others with more than 100,000.
Investment Through investment trusts and unit trusts, investors may spread their risks
Trusts and and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
Unit Trusts The ordinary type of investment trust is constituted as a public company
registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business is
to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies,
it may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits
to build up reserves. Investment trusts grew to importance in the latter half
of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital
towards overseas investment.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the securities. Normally, the managers
sell units to the public and invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of
Stock Exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly
by an initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit, and partly by a
semi-annual service charge which is taken usually out of the income of the
trust. The level of both charges is controlled by the Board of Trade, whose
FINANCE
377
authorisation is required before units can be offered to the public; this is
only granted if the trust deed is satisfactory to them.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at £80 million. This medium of saving
has grown considerably since 1957. At the end of June 1969 there were nearly
2 million unit holdings. The value of the funds invested in authorised trusts,
numbering some 180, has risen from £60 million in 1958 to £1,315 million
in June 1969; it has more than doubled since the end of 1966. There are now
a wide variety of trusts, both as to the range of investments covered and the
ways in which they cater for the differing needs of investors.
The Insurance
Market
Insurance
Companies
Lloyd's
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by friendly societies and
trade unions, most insurance services in Britain are in the hands of either
mutual or joint stock companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.
Table 28 shows the distribution of business in terms of net premium
income in 1967, the latest year for which figures are available.
There are about 400 insurance companies incorporated in the United Kingdom
but most of the business is in the hands of about 100 companies. Most
British insurers write several of the main classes of business although some
specialise in one class, particularly in life assurance, where about 60 companies
write only that type of business. A few specialise in re-insurance.
In addition about 170 overseas companies carry on business (and even more
companies are represented) in the United Kingdom, thus emphasising the
international nature of the London market. Some of the large British com¬
panies, however, have their administrative headquarters in the provinces.
In 1968 the total insurance funds of the British insurance companies and
collecting societies amounted to about £13,000 million, the bulk of which is in
respect of life assurance business. The accumulation of life funds has
increased greatly with the growth of group pension schemes.
There is no government control over the investment policy of insurance
funds at home and these represent one of the most important sources of funds
for investment in commerce and industry. Almost a half of the total assets
of British insurance companies is now invested in equity shares and debentures.
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of private insurers in London. The name
‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late

and the latter for a further £223 million.

seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century,
Lloyd’s coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business
and intelligence of shipping movements. Although in its earlier history
the activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance
business, there has also been built up at Lloyd’s a very considerable world¬
wide market for the transaction of other classes of insurance business in its
non-marine, aviation and motor markets.
Lloyd’s is now regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting
in 1871; the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are
administered by the Committee of Lloyd’s, which does not itself transact
insurance business.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business
is transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and
in competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through
Lloyd’s brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the
insured. Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact
insurance with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent
financial regulations laid down by the Committee of Lloyd’s, are permitted to
transact business at Lloyd’s; these financial safeguards give a security behind
the Lloyd’s policy which is second to none. Since 1968 non-Commonwealth
underwriters have been admitted to membership of Lloyd’s, if they satisfy
the requirements.
Today there are over 6,000 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped into
some 300 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents who
accept risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
In conjunction with its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a
world-wide organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping
intelligence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on
behalf of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and
a valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance
business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London repre¬
sentatives of the latter.
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine insurance business is
carried on overseas, partly by re-insurance on the London market and partly
through branches and agencies established in over 100 countries. The basic
principle of this international business is that resources capable of meeting
any potential loss are instantly available for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the whole of the deposits, underwriting trust funds and
personal fortunes of Lloyd’s underwriters.
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on
the security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner-occupation,
though loans are occasionally made on the security of commercial and
industrial premises and farms. The funds of building societies are derived
mainly from the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount
of share capital is not fixed; shares, which have a fixed value, are not dealt
with on the Stock Exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given.

The Building Societies Act 1962, which consolidated a number of earlier Acts,
prescribes the general way in which societies must conduct their business.
The Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies has discretionary powers to stop
a society either advertising or accepting money from investors if he considers
that the way in which the society’s business is conducted is jeopardising
investors’ money. The rapid expansion of building society activity in the
twentieth century has been accompanied by a concentration of most of
the business in the hands of a few large societies. At the end of 1968,
525 societies were in operation, with total assets of £8,298 million. Seven of
the largest societies, however, each with assets of over £250 million, account
for w ell over half of the total funds. The amount advanced on mortgage in
1968 wras £1,590 million.

OVERSEAS TRADE
Although relatively small in area and accounting for less than 2 per cent of
the world’s population, the United Kingdom is the world’s third largest
trading nation, conducting about 11 per cent of international trade in manu¬
factured goods in 1968.
For well over a century international trade has been of vital importance to
Britain’s economy. Britain relies upon imports for about half its total con¬
sumption of foodstuffs and nearly all the raw materials needed for its industries.
Its exports of goods and services together represent about a fifth of the gross
national product. It is a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal
manufactures, electrical apparatus, chemicals and textiles. It is the world’s
largest market for foodstuffs, and among the largest for metals and ores,
textile raw materials, petroleum and many other products.
Changes in value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
The value of imports (including cost, insurance and freight) during the 1950s
fluctuated between £3,000 million and £4,000 million a year. Since i960
imports have risen in all years except 1961 and 1962. There was a particularly
rapid expansion in 1964 (of 14 per cent) and again in 1968 (of 21 per cent),
when they were valued at £7,754 million (excluding purchases of US military
aircraft, see note “ to Table 29). The increase in exports (valued free-on-board)
during the 1950s and 1960s has been at a steadier rate, increasing at an
average annual rate of 5 per cent from the i960 total of £3,648 million until
1968, when they rose by 23 per cent over the previous year, to reach £6,176
million.
Between 1961 and 1968 the volume of exports rose by 36 per cent and
that of imports by 43 per cent. Since 1956 the terms of trade, that is, the ratio
between the general level of export prices and that of import prices, has
tended to move progressively in Britain’s favour except for a small adverse
movement in 1963 and 1964, and a slightly larger one in 1968.
The value and volume of exports and imports in selected years from 1959
to 1968 are shown in Table 29.
The expansion of domestic agricultural production has reduced Britain’s
dependence on imported food supplies and the proportion of imported food¬
stuffs to total imports has fallen from 39 per cent in 1954 to 24 per cent in
1968 when imports of foodstuffs (including beverages and tobacco) were
£1,904 million. There has been a similar downward trend in the proportion
accounted for by basic materials—from 30 per cent in 1954 to 15 per cent in
1968. This reflects a growing economy in industrialised countries in materials
consumption per unit of output, with the gradual switch from the pro¬
duction of goods with a high material content to those with a relatively low
material content plus the increasing use of synthetic materials.

* The ratio of export to import unit value index numbers; a fall indicates an adverse

Imports of crude petroleum and lubricants are by far the biggest single
item by value among Britain’s imports: they have accounted for about 11 per
cent of the total value of imports during the past ten years, and amounted to
£905 million in 1968.
The most marked change in recent years has been the rise in the proportion
of imports of finished manufactures, from nearly 7 per cent of total imports in
1957 to 21 per cent in 1968. Strong growth in these imports is a common
feature in the trade of industrial countries. Most of the rise in recent years
has been in capital goods which account for nearly three-quarters of the
value of imports of finished manufactures. Imports of semi-manufactures
have also been increasing steadily and since 1962 have accounted for a
greater proportion of the total import bill than basic materials. This trend is
due partly to the tendency for countries producing the basic materials to
embark upon the subsequent stages of manufacture themselves. Imports of
semi-manufactured (excluding chemicals) and manufactured goods amounted
to £1,705 million and £1,653 million respectively in 1968, accounting for
22 per cent and 21 per cent of Britain’s total imports.
More than five-sixths of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods.
By far the most important group are engineering products, which in 1968
accounted for 44 per cent of total exports. Within this group, exports of many
types of machinery, electrical equipment, road vehicles, tractors and scientific
instruments have expanded markedly over this period. The share represented
by chemicals has grown fairly steadily, reaching 9-7 per cent of total exports in

1968. The proportion accounted for by metals has tended to fall (being 11-7
per cent in 1968). Exports of textiles have fallen from over 18 per cent of the
total in 1948 to 8 per cent in i960 and 5 per cent in 1968. Exports of coal are
now of minor significance (0-3 per cent), and those of petroleum products
were at 2-4 per cent in 1968, their level for the previous four years. The
proportion accounted for by foodstuffs, at 6-5 per cent, has also shown little
change in the past few years.
An analysis of the commodity composition of total imports and exports
and the composition of engineering exports and food imports is given in the
diagram above.
The growth of trade between Britain and Western Europe has been a notable
feature of the area distribution of trade in recent years, and conversely there
has been a decline in the proportion of Britain’s exports going to primary
producing countries. In 1958, 27 per cent of exports went to Western Europe,
but in 1962, for the first time, these exports began to exceed those to the
sterling area and by 1968 they formed 37 per cent of the total (a fall 1 per¬
centage point over the previous year). Exports to Western Europe increased
by 19 per cent in 1968, compared with a o-6 per cent increase in 1967. Exports
to the European Economic Community (EEC) increased by 24 per cent in
1968, compared with 0-7 per cent in 1967, and to the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) they increased by 13 per cent compared with 3 per cent
in 1967. Both rates of increase were significantly higher than the average over
the past decade.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There has been a similar relative fall in respect of imports, although these
recorded an increase of 28 per cent in 1968. Canada, Australia, South Africa
and the Republic of Ireland, however, are among Britain’s most important
trading partners. The United States has been both Britain’s largest single
market and source of supply since 1957. The proportion of total exports going
to North America in 1968 was 18 per cent, the highest ever, and reflected an
increase in the value of deliveries of 37 per cent in 1968 over 1967. Exports
to Latin America increased by 35 per cent in 1968 compared with 5 per cent
in 1967- Britain’s trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has been
growing rapidly over the past decade though it is still small in relation to
trade with other parts of the world. Exports to the Soviet Union rose by
61 per cent in 1968. Trade with Japan continues to grow, with increases of
15 per cent in exports and 26 per cent in imports in 1968.
Re-exports are goods which are exported (1) in the condition in which they
were imported or (2) after having undergone minor operations—such as
simple blending, cleaning, husking, repacking—which leaves them essentially
unchanged. Traditionally, the greater part of United Kingdom re-export trade
has been in raw materials and foodstuffs, for example, wool, rubber, tea, non-
ferrous metals and fur-skins. Commodities imported from Commonwealth
countries and sent on to countries in Europe, particularly traditional re-exports
such as tea and wool, account for a considerable proportion of the total value.
In recent years a considerable re-export trade has developed in manufactured
goods, part of which is accounted for by machinery, for example, aircraft and
aero-engines which have been repaired or have been overhauled in the United
Kingdom.
In 1968 the value of re-exports was £218 million, easily the highest annual
total. The principal items were: fur-skins, non-ferrous metals, electrical
and other machinery and tea. Over half of the re-exports went to countries in
Western Europe.
As previously mentioned, the United Kingdom has traditionally imported
more goods than it exports; however, the gap has been covered in the long¬
term by net earnings from ‘invisible’ transactions. These are defined as
earnings from the provision of services to overseas persons or from the
ownership of overseas assets.
Invisible transactions are divided for statistical purposes into six main
groups: government, transport (shipping and civil aviation); travel; other
services (which covers a variety of items including royalties, films and tele¬
vision transactions, financial services, and other commercial and miscellaneous
services); interest, profits and dividends; and private transfers (migrants’
funds, legacies and private gifts). Some of these figures are precise (for
instance, for government transactions), others are estimates. Table 31 shows
the breakdown of the figures from 1963 to 1968. The total invisible balance
in 1968 was a record ^412 million (in the previous five years the annual surplus
averaged £190 million). Excluding government transactions, the net balance
on private transactions was a surplus of £874 million. Private invisible receipts
in 1968 rose to ^3,653 million (second only to the United States). Earnings
from invisibles amounted to slightly more than half the total from visible
exports.
As shown in Table 31, in recent years there has been a considerable net
surplus on ‘other services’ and on interest, profits and dividends. Over half
of Britain’s receipts under this heading comes from investments in the sterling
area. There has also been a surplus on civil aviation services. Shipping

transactions have been moving into surplus since 1966. Travel credits exceeded
debits for the first time in 1968. Over half the net deficit in respect of govern¬
ment expenditure relates to military expenditure overseas; other substantial
items of expenditure are grants to developing countries and subscriptions to
international organisations.
Tourism yields a substantial income from overseas; in the ten years 1959-68
overseas visitors spent around £2,000 million in Britain. For 1968 these travel
and tourist receipts, excluding fares, are estimated at about £282 million.
United Kingdom residents on holiday, or travelling for business or other
purposes overseas, spent about £2ji million (excluding fares) in the same
year. The continuing increase in both the average expenditure per visitor
and in the number of travellers visiting Britain coupled with the fall since
1966 in the expenditure by British travellers abroad caused travel credits to
exceed debits in 1968. The total number of visitors to the United Kingdom
in 1968, including visitors from the Republic of Ireland, is estimated at some
5 million—an 11 per cent increase over the 1967 figure, and more than twice
the number in 1956.
Britain’s national tourist organisation is the British Travel Association, a
voluntary body deriving the major part of its income from a government
grant-in-aid. The Association undertakes publicity overseas aimed at
attracting visitors to Britain and works towards the improvement in Britain
of hotel accommodation, catering, transport, entertainment and other
386 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
amenities for the tourist. It maintains offices in 16 overseas countries. The
Association works in close collaboration with the Scottish Tourist Board and
the Wales Tourist Board (contributing to their information and publicity
services), as well as the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, which is a statutory
body receiving a grant from the Government of Northern Ireland.
The Development of Tourism Act 1969 provides for the establishment of a
statutory tourist organisation which will take over the British Travel Associa¬
tion’s responsibility for promoting tourism. The new organisation has powers
to give financial assistance towards hotel development and the development of
other tourist facilities and amenities. In addition it will be responsible for any
scheme for the classification or grading of tourist accommodation.
COMMERCIAL Britain’s prosperity depends on the prosperity of those who buy her exports
POLICY an(j theij-g wip depend on how they sell their exports elsewhere. Thus Britain
is a strong advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade and to this end
has taken a leading part in the setting up and subsequent activities of such
organisations as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the General Agree¬
ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). It has also played a full part at the
two plenary sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Develop¬
ment held in 1964 and 1968 and is a member of the Trade and Development
Board which acts on behalf of the Conference between sessions.
Customs duties on imports into Britain are divided into two broad cate¬
gories: revenue duties (to which there correspond excise revenue duties on
comparable British-produced goods) and protective duties. Purchase tax is
chargeable on imported as well as home-produced goods but in the main the
charge on imports is deferred until the goods are sold by a registered to a
non-registered trader. In the financial year 1968-69 revenue duties charged
on imported goods yielded about £2,355 million, by far the greater part of
which came from tobacco and hydrocarbon oils (petroleum products). The
yield from protective duties was £218 million, or about 3 per cent of the value
of all imports.
At the beginning of the twentieth century the only customs duties were
those imposed for revenue purposes on a small range of products. Certain
duties were imposed during the first world war (the McKenna Duties), in
1921 (for strategic reasons) and in 1925 (initially for revenue purposes) but it
was not until the Import Duties Act 1932 that any serious departure was made
from the principle of free trade. This measure provided a degree of protection
for British industry and, at the same time, a basis for negotiations with foreign
countries already in possession of a tariff structure. A series of bilateral trade
negotiations between 1932 and 1939 led to some modification in the level of
protection but in the next ten years, because of government purchase and
import controls introduced during and immediately after the second world
war, the tariff lost much of its importance. The substantial relaxation of
quantitative import controls from 1949 onwards re-established the tariff as
the main instrument of protection.
The Import Duties Act 1958 replaced existing legislation relating to the
protective tariff and brought it up to date in a single measure. The tariff was
recast into an internationally agreed form (the Brussels Nomenclature), which
came into use from 1st January 1959. Under the Customs Duties (Dumping
and Subsidies) Act 1969, the Board of Trade is empowered to impose duties
on imported goods of any description which have been dumped or subsidised
if it is satisfied that these are causing or threatening material injury to a

ment on Tariffs
and Trade
Commonwealth
Preference
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 387
particular industry and that such action would be in the national interest.
The Act also empowers the Board of Trade to take provisional action where a
prima facie case of dumping or subsidisation and consequent material injury
has been made out.
An import deposit scheme was introduced for a one-year period in
November 1968 as part of measures taken to assist in bringing the balance of
payments into surplus. Importers of those classes of goods subject to the
scheme (these exclude, for example, foodstuffs and raw materials) are required
to deposit 50 per cent of the value of the goods for six months with Customs
and Excise.
The United Kingdom’s protective tariff has been considerably modified in
recent years as a result of a series of international tariff negotiations held under
the auspices of the GATT, which seeks to increase the volume of world trade
by reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade, and by eliminating discrimina¬
tion in international commerce. Tariff reductions, and bindings against
increase, negotiated between countries under the GATT are applied equally
to all other GATT countries under the ‘most favoured nation’ clause.
As a result of the latest series of GATT tariff negotiations, the ‘Kennedy
Round’ (May 1964-June 1967), average reductions of over 30 per cent are to
be made by the major trading countries in their tariffs on industrial goods.
The reduction to be made in the British tariffs on dutiable industrial goods
imported from the EEC, the United States and Japan will amount to about
37 per cent, 40 per cent and 34 per cent respectively. This is closely in line
with the reductions which these countries are making, which will affect well
over 70 per cent of British exports of dutiable industrial goods to these coun¬
tries. Some reductions in the tariffs on agricultural goods are also being made.
The implementation of the British tariff reductions will be spread over
1968-72; the first cuts were made on the 1st July 1968 and subsequent
reductions are due to be made on the 1st January 1970, 1971 and 1972
respectively.
The principle of Imperial Preference was introduced into the United Kingdom
customs duties in 19tQ and at the Ottawa Conference in 1932 agreements
were concluded with independent Commonwealth countries providing for
reciprocal preferential tariff treatment over a wide range of goods. The
Import Duties Act 1932 had already provided for the duty-free entry of goods
from the United Kingdom dependencies.
Most imports into Britain from the Commonwealth preference area (which
includes the Republic of South Africa and the Republic of Ireland) enter free
of duty. Some two-thirds of them enjoy a tariff preference of about 11 per cent
(defined as the difference between the full duty rate and the preferential rate-
in this case generally nil—expressed as a percentage of the import value).
It is estimated that approximately half of Britain’s exports to the Common¬
wealth preference area enter free of duty and about the same proportion enjoy
an average tariff preference of 12 per cent.
In 1964 the first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) in Geneva, Britain declared itself prepared to extend tariff
preferences on a non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis to all the
developing countries if other major industrialised countries would do the
same, if the Commonwealth countries concerned would agree and provided
that preferences were not given in such a way as to impede the continuing
reduction of tariffs on a most-favoured-nation basis. The establishment of a
388 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
system of generalised preferences for manufactures and semi-manufactures
exported by developing countries was agreed in principle at the second
UNCTAD conference in New Delhi in 1968, the detailed arrangements to be
worked out during the course of 1969.

The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) was set up under the Stock¬
holm Convention of January i960 by Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal,
Sweden, Switzerland and Britain, with the object of creating an industrial free
trade area between the members and of working towards a wider European
settlement. Under the Convention, protective tariffs and quotas on trade in
industrial products between members of EFTA were to be eliminated by
1st January 1970. The first tariff cuts were made in July i960, and duties were
finally removed (with certain minor exceptions) on 31st December 1966, three
years earlier than originally planned. Finland, which joined EFTA in 1961 as
an associate member, made its final cuts in December 1967. EFTA was the
first completed free trade area in the world and forms a single market of almost
100 million people. Since 1959 intra-EFTA trade has more than doubled and
has increased more than twice as fast as trade between the group and non¬
member countries.
A free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the Republic of
Ireland came into operation on 1st July 1966. On that date the United
Kingdom removed all protective import duties on goods of Republic of
Ireland origin imported from that country. After 1st July 1975, with certain
exceptions, the Republic of Ireland will not apply any protective duties on
goods of United Kingdom origin.
In August 1961 the British Government applied formally to join the EEC
but negotiations were suspended in January 1963- A renewed application for
membership was made in May 1967. At the meeting of the EEC Council of
Ministers in December 1967 five of the member states favoured the opening
of negotiations with Britain, but the French Government did not agree, and
the request for accession remains on the Council’s agenda.
The export trade and virtually all the import trade of the United Kingdom are
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the
industry, the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export
trade, especially of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through
exports merchants in the United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to
importers and consumers abroad through their own agents or resident repre¬
sentatives in the countries concerned; in other cases, sales are made through
a firm’s own branch offices, distributing organisations or subsidiary sales
companies established in overseas markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or
domestic trade buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms may
find it more convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export
houses, commission agents, and the representatives of overseas firms.
CONTROLS ON
TRADE AND
PAYMENTS
Most of the restrictions imposed on the movement of goods and services
during and immediately after the second world war have been progressively
abolished.
Exchange Exchange control is confined mainly to transactions between residents of the

latter may settle transactions between themselves in sterling, and any sterling
held on an external account is freely convertible into other currencies,
including dollars.
The remaining important restrictions relate to the movement of capital
from the United Kingdom to non-sterling area countries. Because of the
balance of payments deficits, exchange control requirements for investments
outside the sterling area have, since 1961, been revised and made more
stringent. Exports of goods to destinations outside the sterling area are
subject to exchange control and, in general, have to be paid for within six
months in any foreign currency (except Rhodesian pounds) or by sterling
from an external account. Control is also exercised over imports to ensure that
currency authorised for their payment is used for that purpose.
There are also certain restrictions on the release of gold for manufacturing
and industrial purposes, and on the buying, selling and holding of gold coins.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of
the administration is, in practice, carried out by the Bank of England as agent
of the Treasury; and, in turn, the Bank of England has delegated to the
commercial banks a wide variety of powers to deal with applications.
Residents of Britain visiting countries outside the sterling area for pleasure
are at present restricted to a basic foreign exchange allowance of ^50 a year.
The purpose of this restriction is to assist the balance of payments. This
allowance covers all foreign exchange expenditure taken in the form of cash
or travellers cheques, and also the cost of hotel and other travel services,
except fares paid in sterling to travel agents in the United Kingdom. The
amount of steiling notes that a traveller may take out of the country is
restricted to £15 a journey.
Under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 the
Board of Trade is empowered to prohibit or regulate the import or export
of goods.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the
IMF, the United Kingdom Government has progressively removed quanti¬
tative restrictions from almost all its imports from the countries of the free
world. The very short list of goods on which controls remain includes some
items of special difficulty and a few where restrictions are recognised inter¬
nationally, such as arms, ammunition and radioactive materials. They require
a specific import licence and quotas have been set up for most of them. Some
quotas refer specifically to individual countries and are usually shared out
among exporters by the authorities of the countries concerned. Others are
accorded on an overall or global basis, and are generally allocated by the United
Kingdom authorities to United Kingdom importers, usually on the basis of
their share of the trade in the commodity in the past. Apart from these
quantitative controls, some further restrictions or prohibitions are applied
on health grounds (for example, on animals, plants and drugs). There is also
a temporary general import restriction on goods from Rhodesia.
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations outside
the sterling area are paid for in the proper manner, United Kingdom exports
are not, except in a very minor way, subject to any government control or
direction. The few controls that are in operation are imposed to supervise
exports of military and strategic importance; to conserve materials which may
be in inadequate supply; to assist exchange control operations in preventing

the export of capital in the form of valuable goods; to ensure the humane
treatment of horses, cattle, sheep and pigs; and to prevent the export of works
of art classed as national treasures. Normally, individual licences are required
for specific consignments of goods subject to export licensing control. Goods
controlled for strategic reasons, not included in the category of atomic energy
materials and appliances, arms and ammunition, may, with certain exceptions,
be exported to the Commonwealth, the Irish Republic, the Republic of South
Africa and the United States of America without licence. There is also a
temporary general export restriction on goods to Rhodesia.
The British Government1 assists exporters by its efforts to create conditions
favourable to the export trade and by providing credit insurance facilities and
information and advice about opportunities for trade in other countries.
Facilities exist for the repayment of protective duties paid on goods which
have been imported for export trade purposes.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult Board of Trade offices
throughout Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts of Her
Majesty’s Diplomatic Service overseas. There are over 200 posts located in all
the principal cities and trade centres abroad and they supply the Board of
Trade with information of every kind affecting trade with their territories.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial
conditions, pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities,
and generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of govern¬
mental regulations. These officers investigate potential markets for British
products, advise about methods of trading with particular areas, and seek out
and pass on opportunities for export business and enquiries for British goods.
Assistance is also given to United Kingdom exporters in appointing agents
and locating potential importers. From records kept up to date in London by
reports from its overseas commercial officers, the Export Services Branch of
the Board of Trade can provide information concerning any country on the
prospects for exports and requirements of particular markets, government
regulations affecting trade (including import restrictions and tariffs and duties
on particular commodities), methods of trading, local tastes and preferences
in design, and the commercial standing of firms with which an exporter
contemplates business relations.
The Government’s official information services overseas are used exten¬
sively to promote Britain’s export trade.
The Overseas Marketing Corporation, financed partly by private equity
capital and partly by loan capital made available by the Board of Trade, was
set up in November 1967 to promote exports from British firms which
encounter difficulties in selling abroad because of their size or structure. It
seeks out new export opportunities overseas and ensures an adequate marketing
effort to fulfil them. The Board of Trade also supports, by a three-year grant
commenced in July 1967, the Export Marketing Partnerships scheme
operated by the Institute of Marketing to enable smaller manufacturers to
reach profit-sharing agreements with established exporters.
1 Export promotion is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry)
and the Development Corporation for Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Ministry of
Commerce provides a liaison service with the Board of Trade Export Services Branch
and the overseas posts.

The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) is a government
department, responsible to the President of the Board of Trade, which
provides insurance for exporters against the main risks in selling overseas,
and guarantees to banks providing finance for export credit. It covers more
than a third of the country’s export trade. The ECGD is required to carry
on its business on a self-supporting basis; it does not provide subsidies to
exporters, nor is it a charge on the taxpayer.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer,
governmental action which blocks or delays transfer of payment to the
United Kingdom exporter, imposition of new import licensing restrictions
in the buyer’s country, war between the buyer’s country and the United
Kingdom, cancellation or non-renewal of a United Kingdom export licence,
additional handling, transport or insurance charges incurred after shipment
through interruption or diversion of voyage or ‘any other cause of loss
occurring outside the United Kingdom and not within the control of the
exporter or the buyer, and not normally insurable with commercial insurers’.
Cover may commence from the date of contract or (at lower premiums) from
the date of shipment.
Policies may be comprehensive, covering all export business in all markets
(or in an agreed group of markets) on goods sold on six months’ to five years’
credit, or specific, covering large, single capital transactions sold on credit
terms of five years or more.
Some 300 exhibitions, of which about 200 were trade fairs, wrere held in
Britain in 1968. Some of the specialised fairs, such as the Motor Show and
the Royal Agricultural Show, attract large numbers of the public, as well as
many trade buyers from home and overseas, and provide an important means
of advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom products are shown at most of the large international
trade fairs throughout the world and United Kingdom manufacturers have
been prominent at the many specialised fairs held in Europe and North
America. Special displays of British consumer goods have also been presented
in hotels in North America and elsewhere.
Participation in trade fairs, ‘British weeks’ and store promotions overseas is
a form of export promotion for which the Government provides information,
financial assistance and, in certain cases, free facilities. (‘British weeks’ dilfer
from trade fairs and exhibitions in that they are primarily designed to promote
sales of consumer goods in shops overseas.) The amount allocated to the
Board of Trade for these purposes has risen from £60,000 in 1955-56 to nearly
£4 million in 1968-69. In 1968 the Board of Trade assisted some 5,300 British
firms to participate in 239 specialised and general trade fairs in 39 countries;
and provided practical help to one major and seven minor ‘British weeks’,
and to some 84 overseas store promotions, including 3,000 stores and shops.
The British National Export Council (BNEC), a promotional body formed in
July 1964, is sponsored by the Government and by representatives of industry,
trade, finance, and organised labour in Britain. Associated with it are 12 Area
Committees with the primary responsibility for developing British exports
to a particular market or group of markets: Africa, Asia, Australia, the
Caribbean, Israel, Latin America, the Middle East, New Zealand, Europe,
Canada, southern Africa and the United States.
The tasks of the BNEC are to keep all British export activity under constant
review: to stimulate exports in all markets; to advise on organisations relating

to particular markets; to provide a central point for the export effort; and
services for this purpose such as the sending overseas of export missions.
There is an annual scheme for royal recognition of outstanding export and
technological achievement by industry, namely, the Queen’s Award to
Industry; the first awards were made in 1966.
In the nineteenth century, the rapid growth of British industry, commerce
and shipping under the stimulus of the industrial revolution made Britain
the market as well as the workshop of the world. It became the site for the
chief world markets in raw materials (see below), freight, insurance, and
precious metals. A sound commercial banking system and a flexible system
of central bank control have been built up, while specialised institutions such
as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the stock exchanges,
investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to satisfy particular
needs for short-term or long-term finance. The facilities provided by merchant
banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been used to finance
shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but also between other
overseas countries. (Exchange control no longer allows the financing of trade
between two non-sterling area countries.)
At the same time, the banks which were already engaged in financing trade
were able to assist in raising finance for longer-term ventures. British capital
invested in overseas countries has furthered their development, increased
their output and exports, and provided markets for manufactured goods. A
number of specialised institutions help in providing financial services for
overseas countries.
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world’s basic
commodities. Among the more important are the Baltic Exchange (the market
for shipping and air transport, grain, seeds and vegetable oils), the London
Commodity Exchange (cocoa, coffee, copra, hides and skins, rubber and
sugar), the London Wool Exchange, the London Metal Exchange, the
Liverpool Cotton Exchange and the Liverpool Corn Exchange. A soya bean
oil futures market opened in London in July 1967 and a coconut oil futures
market in June 1969. These markets not only cater for the import of goods
for home consumption but do much business in effecting transactions between
buyers and sellers in other countries. In addition to these formal markets,
there is scarcely any product which cannot be traded through an intermediary
in Britain. For example, London is the world’s most important philatelic
market and also the leading international centre for the sale of works
of art.
The market consists of over 180 authorised banks and nine firms of brokers,
all linked together by telephone in the United Kingdom, and by telephone,
telex and cable with overseas centres. The turnover of the market has
increased progressively since the introduction in December 1958 of external
convertibility for the principal European currencies. The Foreign Exchange
Market is subject to United Kingdom exchange control regulations governing
the purchase and sale of foreign currencies in the sterling area.
The London Gold Market, which had remained closed from the outbreak of
war in I939> was reopened in March 1954, under the general supervision
of the Bank of England. All authorised banks may deal in gold but, in
practice, dealings are largely concentrated in the hands of the five members
The Sterling
System

of the gold market. The five members meet twice daily to fix a price for all
transactions which customers ask to have executed at the fixing.
A gold pool was set up in i960 to co-ordinate the gold operations in London
(including supplying gold to private buyers) of certain European central banks
and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Following heavy world-wide
speculation in gold at the end of 1967 and the beginning of 1968, the gold pool
was terminated in March 1968. Officially held gold is now used only to effect
transfers between monetary authorities where these are not replacing gold
sold in private markets.
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, several
countries tended not only to use sterling as their natural currency for inter¬
national transactions, but also to maintain central currency reserves in
Britain. When Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931 these countries,
which came to be known as the ‘sterling bloc’ and later as the ‘sterling area’,
did likewise, and pegged their currency exchange rates to the pound sterling.
In 1939, after the outbreak of war, the pound sterling was no longer freely
convertible into other currencies and the sterling area became more formally
defined as a currency area for exchange control purposes. The United
Kingdom imposes no exchange control on transactions with residents of other
sterling area countries. Sterling became convertible again in December 1958
but there is still exchange control against the non-sterling area.
All the Commonwealth countries (except Canada and Rhodesia), together
with Iceland, the Irish Republic, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, the Republic of
South Africa, South West Africa, the Republic of Southern Yemen, the
British Protected States in the Persian Gulf, and Western Samoa, are members
of the sterling area. The main features of the sterling area are that the greater
part of the overseas trade of member countries is financed in sterling, while
much of their foreign reserves are held in sterling. Member countries sell their
foreign currency earnings in London in exchange for sterling and purchase for
sterling the foreign currency they require. Britain’s reserves of gold and
foreign currencies are held in the Exchange Equalisation Account. These
arrangements are voluntary; there are no strict or centralised rules of conduct.
Consultations were held during 1968 between Britain and sterling area
countries to devise means of stabilising their sterling balances. As a result
12 central banks outside the sterling area agreed to make available via the
Bank for International Settlements a $2,000 million medium-term credit
facility, to enable Britain, in return for certain assurances, to offer dollar-
value guarantee on the bulk of each sterling area country’s official sterling
reserves.
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
A summary of Britain’s balance of payments position between 1966 and 1968
is given in Table 32, p. 395. It will be seen that the various items are subject
to considerable fluctuation.
The transactions fall into three main groups—current account, long-term
capital account and monetary movements. The balance on current account is
composed of the balance of visible trade (that is, the difference between mer¬
chandise imports and exports and re-exports) and the balance of invisibles.
394
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
On long-term capital account, the main groups of items are intergovernmental
loans (including amortisation) and other identified net long-term investment
abroad by United Kingdom residents, or in the United Kingdom by non¬
residents. The third heading, monetary movements, reflects in part the
United Kingdom’s position as an international banker. It includes miscel¬
laneous capital transactions, generally of a short-term character, changes in
external assets and liabilities of the banking system and changes in the United
Kingdom reserves of gold and convertible currencies.
Between 1952 and 1963 there were surpluses in the balance of payments on
current account in all years except for 1955, i960 and 1961. In 1964 there was
a substantial deficit of £381 million, which turned to a surplus of £64 million
in 1966. This improvement was not maintained in 1967 and 1968, when
deficits of £283 million and £265 million were recorded. These resulted from
the increased deficit in the visible trade balance. The invisible balance, which
benefited from the deferment of interest payments on the North American
loans, increased by almost 50 per cent over 1967 to a net surplus of ^412
million, see p. 385. The deterioration in the trade balance was largely due to
the initial adverse impact of devaluation upon the terms of trade. However,
the second half of 1968 saw a marked improvement in the visible trade
balance, with exports rising at a faster rate than imports.
The net outward flow of long-term capital, which reached a peak of £363
million in 1964, was £142 million in 1968. The balance on official account
(see Table 32) moved into surplus in 1968. This resulted partly from certain
debt repayments and also from the deferment of the North American loan
repayment. Gross drawings and repayments on the United States Export/
Import Bank—the credit to finance the purchases of American military
aircraft—increased by similar amounts and net lending under the aid pro¬
gramme was unchanged. There were exceptionally large increases of £279
million in outward private investment and of .£193 million in inward private
investment in 1968, giving an increase of .£86 million in the net outward flow,
to £163 million. A large part of the increased outward flow represented
increased portfolio investment in Australia and South Africa; increases in
reinvested profits and in investment by foreign oil companies in Britain largely
accounted for the higher inward flow of private investment.
The balance on current and long-term capital transactions combined was in
surplus in 1961 and 1962 but moved into a considerable deficit of £744
million in 1964. By 1966 this deficit had been substantially reduced to £48
million but it increased in 1967 and dropped slightly in 1968 to £407 million.
Movements of short-term capital may mean that changes in the balance on
current and long-term capital accounts are not necessarily reflected in the
reserves of gold and convertible currencies.
The general level of the reserves has not changed greatly since the early
1950s and has usually been in the region of £1,000 million. In 1964, when
there was a very large deficit in the balance of payments, they fell to £827
million. Subsequently, they have regained their £1,000 million level though
this has been maintained in part by transfer from the dollar portfolio in 1966
and 1967 of £520 million. At the end of 1968 the reserves amounted to
£1,009 million. They were made up of £614 million in gold and £395 million
in convertible currencies. Britain’s net external liabilities in sterling (excluding
liabilities to the IMF) amounted to £4,077 million at the end of 1968. Over
half of these were towards countries in the overseas sterling area. In addition,
net external liabilities in non-sterling currencies amounted to £233
million.

In addition to its reserves of gold and convertible currencies, Britain has
drawing rights on the IMF based on its quota, which was raised to $2,440
million (£871 million) in March 1966. (The sterling equivalent of the British
quota after devaluation in November 1967 is £1,017 million.) Britain has had
recourse to the IMF on several occasions. Three drawings are either wholly
or partly outstanding. A drawing of $1,400 million in 1965 has been partly
repaid and the remainder is due to be repaid by May 1970. A further $1,400
million agreed in 1967 was used to repay short-term debts to central banks;
and a stand-by facility for $1,000 million (£417 million) agreed in June
1969 is being drawn in instalments ($500 million immediately and the

remainder in three equal instalments up to May 1970). Part of this drawing is
being used to repay the amounts due to the IMF under the 1965 drawing.
With each request to the IMF for a stand-by facility, a Letter of Intent is
sent by the British Government setting out its policy and intentions for the
domestic economy.
Britain has also taken part since 1961 in the international network of
reciprocal credit (‘swap’) facilities arranged between central banks. These
facilities (full details of which have not been published) include one of
$2,000 million with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Under these
arrangements each central bank is able to exchange on request its own
currency for the currency of another country up to a maximum agreed for a
limited period. It agrees to reverse the transaction at a specified date at the
same rate of exchange. The currencies so obtained can be retained in the
reserves or used in exchange operations.
In the estimates of Britain’s external assets and liabilities,1 it should be
emphasised that the various elements are fundamentally different in kind and
are subject to different methods of valuation, hence the totals are of limited
significance. However, they do illustrate two features of basic importance in
Britain’s external situation. It has a very large excess of long-term assets over
long-term liabilities and a considerable excess of short-term liabilities
over short-term assets. At the end of 1968 net long-term assets amounted to
about £5,590 million while net short-term liabilities amounted to about
£3,615 million.
Britain’s official long-term liabilities have mostly arisen from the second world
war and its aftermath. At the end of 1968 about £2,997 million was still out¬
standing, of which £2,24.2 million was owed to other Governments, the greater
part to the United States and Canada. Devaluation had increased the amount
outstanding by about one-sixth.
The largest item among official external long-term claims is British
Government aid in the form of loans (see p. 399).
Overseas investors in Britain are allowed to repatriate the proceeds of the
sale of their investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued.
Earned profits and dividends can be transferred, irrespective of the amount;
transfers of this kind have never been restricted. In 1968 the net inward flow
of private investment amounted to £573 million (^193 million more than in
the previous year). Of this, £245 million represented direct investment and
£87 million portfolio investment; the rest was largely investment by the oil
industry.
Overseas long-term liabilities arising from investment in the private sector
of the British economy have increased steadily since the war. The market value
of overseas portfolio holdings of British company securities at the end of 1968
was of the order of £2,220 million. The book value of direct investments held
in Britain by companies incorporated abroad (except banks, oil and insurance
companies) was £2,570 million, of which some four-fifths was in the manu¬
facturing industry.
Nearly two-thirds of this direct investment came from the United States.
The book value of the net assets in Britain of United States and European oil
companies was some £1,150 million.

Private investment abroad may take several forms: portfolio investment,
that is, investment in overseas securities including the loans raised by overseas
countries on the London capital market; or direct investment by the estab¬
lishment of subsidiary companies abroad, by ploughing back profits earned
overseas, or by acquiring an interest in an overseas enterprise.
Apart from the voluntary programme introduced early in 1966 to restrain
the flow of British capital to Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and the
Irish Republic, the United Kingdom imposes no restriction on investment in
the sterling area by United Kingdom residents. Direct investment is frequently
made from a firm’s existing resources. However, borrowers outside the United
Kingdom must in certain circumstances obtain the consent of the Treasury
if the amount borrowed exceeds £50,000 in any one year. Borrowing by
Commonwealth Governments in the London capital market has fallen in
recent years, but averaged about £50 million a year in the 1950s.
Direct investment outside the sterling area is normally permitted provided
that it is financed by foreign currency borrowing or by the reinvestment of an
appropriate portion of profits. Other means of finance (including the use of
official exchange in a limited category of cases) are allowed only when invest¬
ment promises a benefit to the United Kingdom balance of payments in the
short-term. The Board of Trade estimated that the flow of private direct
investment abroad by British companies (excluding oil) was about £267
million in 1967 (the latest survey available); 53 per cent went to the sterling
area. The figures include long-term and short-term investment and reinvested
profits.
Britain’s private long-term capital assets abroad include portfolio invest¬
ments which, at the end of 1968, had a total estimated market value of some
£5,8°° million. In addition, the book value of British direct investments
abroad (except oil, insurance and banking) was £6,105 million at the end of
1968. Roughly half of this was invested in manufacturing industries. The
approximate book value of oil companies’ assets at the end of 1968 was some
£1,650 million. The total value of the overseas interests of British insurance
companies is not known but the value of their direct investments in the United
States alone amounted to £500 million at the end of 1967. The British insur¬
ance industry also operates extensively in other foreign countries and
throughout the Commonwealth.
Owing to the increase in recent years in British aid to developing countries,
intergovernmental loans form the largest item among official external long¬
term claims. The total of such loans outstanding at the end of 1968 was
£739 million. New government loans (less repayments) totalled £60 million
in 1968. Other official lending included an £11 million investment by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (see p. 399).
In addition, there are the official subscriptions to, and shareholdings in,
international financial organisations (see below). The Government also owns
real estate overseas, such as embassy buildings and military installations.
Britain’s aid programme to the developing countries consists of loans and
grants for economic and social development, technical assistance, budget
support and contributions to multilateral agencies providing financial aid and
technical assistance to these countries. (In addition to this official aid pro¬
gramme, an important contribution is made to economic development by
private investment and by private voluntary organisations engaged in relief,
development and educational work.)

Since 1945 total aid disbursements amount to over £2,000 million and in
the four years 1965-68 they have averaged just over £200 million a year (see
Table 33). In 1968 they amounted to nearly £210 million, of which bilateral
disbursements were £191 million including £41 million technical assistance;
assistance provided through multilateral agencies was ^19 million. Repay¬
ments of capital and interest during the year on old loans totalled about
£57 million.

The net flow of British resources to developing countries, private capital
as well as official aid, exceeded the target of 1 per cent of national income as
set by the first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) in 1964 in each of the nine years to 1966. In 1967 the percentage
was 0-97. The second UNCTAD in 1968 revised the target to 1 per cent of
gross national product which represented, in Britain’s case, an increase of
about one-quarter. The provisional percentage figure for 1969 in terms of
the revised target was 0-83.
Historically, Britain’s aid programme began as part of the discharge of its
responsibilities towards the dependent territories and the main emphasis
remains on territories which are, or were until recent years, a British
responsibility. In 1968 nearly £171 million (89 per cent) of the bilateral pro¬
gramme was disbursed to Commonwealth countries both dependent and
independent.
Economic difficulties have made it necessary to restrain public expenditure
including expenditure overseas. The target for the basic aid programme in
1969-70 is being maintained, however, at the 1968-69 level of £205 million;
in addition, there will be an expenditure of some £22 million on other aid
commitments, for example, a contribution of £6 million to the Food Aid
Convention as part of the Kennedy Round (see p. 387), economic assistance
to Singapore and Malaysia in connection with the withdrawal of British
forces, and a payment to the World Bank to maintain the dollar value of
Britain’s capital subscription after devaluation.

Assistance
Of the total of bilateral financial aid of ^150 million in 1968, 35 per cent was
in grant form and 65 per cent in loans. Budgetary aid is provided in grant
form. Development aid is in either grant or loan form depending on the
economic circumstances of the recipient countries, but is mainly in loan form.
The terms of new development loans from Britain have been progressively
softened since 1958 and a policy of interest-free loans for the poorest
developing countries was introduced in June 1965. In 1968, the total value of
loan commitments entered into, excluding investments by the Common¬
wealth Development Corporation (CDC) (see below), was ^116 million and
of this over 91 per cent was on interest-free terms. The recipients included
India, Malaysia and Singapore.
Where loans are made on interest-bearing terms waivers of interest for a
period of years are granted in appropriate cases, and both kinds of loan may
carry grace periods during which repayments of capital are not made. Of all
loans committed in 1968, 89 per cent of value carried grace periods for capital
repayments averaging just over five and a half years, while the weighted
average maturity of loans was about 24 years.
Loans and grants are used mainly for the purchase of goods, equipment and
services from Britain, although there may be a substantial element for local
costs in appropriate cases. Between 1958 and the end of 1968, 204 loans were
negotiated involving a commitment of ^719 million, of which £576 million
has been disbursed. The largest recipients have been India and Pakistan.
During the same period bilateral grants amounted to around ^802 million.
Aid to dependent territories includes budgetary assistance, development
grants and loans under the Colonial Development and Welfare (CD & W)
Acts, technical assistance, and investments by the CDC. Grants account for
the predominant share of this assistance. Economic aid to the dependent
territories increased to a peak of j£ioo million in 1961, but has declined to
£15 million in 1968 as colonies have become independent.
Although Britain’s formal responsibility to a dependent territory ceases when
it attains independence, its continuing needs have been recognised by offering
aid in appropriate forms. Almost all independent Commonwealth developing
countries have received help towards their development by way of loans. In
1968 independent Commonwealth countries received £149 million in bilateral
financial aid and technical assistance (80 per cent of the bilateral programme).
The CDC was set up in 1948 to provide finance and management for
development projects in Commonwealth countries, and acts on a commercial
basis, often in partnership with private enterprise or territorial governments.
Most of its finance has been provided by loans from the British Government
(^9-4 million in 1968). By the end of 1968, a total of £120 million had been
invested out of a total commitment of j/,’150 million. Of the latter, £26 million
was in the Far East, £28 million in the Caribbean and virtually all of the
remainder was in Africa.
Expenditure on technical assistance (the provision of skilled personnel, advice
and training) has increased to form 20 per cent of the total aid programme in
1968. The largest component of expenditure (£27-3 million in 1968) is that of
sending or maintaining experts, including volunteers; the next largest is for
students and trainees in Britain (£6-6 million).

personnel in the public services. The schemes cost ^19-1 million in 1968 and
covered over 9,000 expatriate officers in 39 Commonwealth countries,
principally in East and Central Africa. Britain receives large numbers of
students and trainees from developing countries. Over 10,000 were financed in
Britain in 1968 under regional programmes of technical assistance, by awards
under the Commonwealth Education Co-operation Scholarships and Bursary
Schemes, and under the various schemes of the British Council. At the end of
1968, of the 13,430 British persons other than volunteers who were working
in developing countries and financed by the British Government, almost
10,000 were engaged in the maintenance and improvement of education, public
administration and communications.
In addition, the British Volunteer Programme has been expanding (the
first volunteers were sent overseas in 1958-59) until in 1968 there were 1,787
volunteers in developing countries. These included graduates and school-
leavers, whose recruitment, training and placing overseas is undertaken by a
number of voluntary bodies; 75 per cent of the British costs (^0-7 million
in 1968) are met by the British Government.
Britain is the second largest contributor (after the United States) to the
World Bank group of institutions including the International Development
Association, to which Britain has undertaken to provide ^65 million in the
three years 1968-70. Britain has contributed ^40 million to the United
Nations Development Programme since its inception in 1950 and has provided
more experts and training places under multilateral schemes than any other
country—1,200 experts and 1,135 training places in 1968. Other contributions
are to the regional development banks, the World Food Programme, the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA),
and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
INTERNAL TRADE
Britain’s internal trade can be divided into two broad categories: trade in raw
materials, capital goods and intermediate products (for example, vehicle
components) and trade in consumer goods, involving the network of distribu¬
tive trades by which home produced or imported goods reach the consumer.
(For the pattern of consumers’ expenditure see p. 231.)
There have been a number of official statistical enquiries into the distributive
trades. The latest censuses taken in Great Britain refer to the wholesale trades
in 1965 and the retail trades and certain service trades in 1966. Sample
monthly and annual enquiries are also undertaken, covering such aspects of
the distributive trades as turnover, stocks and capital expenditure. Most of the
figures given in the following pages derive from either the last published
censuses or the sample enquiries.
The first census of retail distribution and other services to be taken in
Northern Ireland relates to 1965.
Only a proportion of the trade in consumer goods passes through wholesalers:
sales are also made to consumers through producers’ own selling organisations
(including their own retail outlets and mail order businesses); and other sales
are made directly by producers to retailers. Wholesale channels are particularly
in evidence in the distribution of textiles, agricultural produce and foodstuffs.
The 1965 enquiry showed that out of a total of 23,643 business units engaged
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 40I
in wholesale distribution in Great Britain, 3,435 dealt in clothing, footwear
and textiles, 2,007 in grocery and provisions, 2,630 in vegetables and fruit,
and 3,469 in other food and in drink. In addition, there were 8,282 dealers
(wholesale or retail) in coal, builders’ materials, grain or agricultural supplies,
and 9,117 dealers in other industrial materials and machinery. The value of
stocks held by wholesalers and dealers at the end of 1968 is estimated at
£1,431 million; expenditure on capital assets during the year was about
£159 million.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers (who
sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres) or, increasingly, is
sold by contract to fryers and processors, or direct to retailers. Fruit and
vegetables may be sold by growers to commission agents (who dispose of the
produce either to wholesalers or direct to retailers) or the grower may deal
only with wholesale firms. The sale of some agricultural products is regulated
by statutory marketing boards (see p. 311).
London’s wholesale markets play a leading part in the distribution of
foodstuffs, particularly imported supplies. Every year Covent Garden1 handles
about 1 -2 million tons of fruit and vegetables, and over 340,000 tons of meat
and poultry pass through Smithfield market; Billingsgate is the principal
distributing centre in Britain for fish. Others in London include Leadenhall
Market (poultry) and Spitalfields Market (fruit and vegetables).
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
societies, the two largest being the Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd.
(CWS) and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd. (SCWS), to
serve the needs of retail societies, membership being restricted to incorporated
co-operative organisations. The CWS had sales of £510 million in 1968 and
the SCWS had sales of some £90 million.
Since 1954, many wholesalers have joined, either singly or in groups, with
groups of retailers to form voluntary chains to help to preserve the existence
of retail outlets for the wholesaler and to give to retailers the advantages of
the lower costs of large-scale trading without significant loss of independence.
The 1961 Census of Distribution showed that about 27 per cent (or 40 per
cent in terms of turnover) of smaller grocers—mostly medium-sized inde¬
pendents and small multiples with not more than nine branches—then
belonged to these chains and in 1969 the proportion is believed to be
considerably higher. A more recent development is the growth of ‘cash and
carry’ warehouses from which retailers themselves collect their purchases.
RETAIL TRADE
Types of
Retailers
Retail businesses in Britain may be classified under three main headings:
(1) multiple traders, that is, organisations other than co-operative societies
with ten or more branches; (2) retail co-operative societies (see p. 402); and
(3) independent retail businesses, including for this purpose the small
multiple stores (that is, chains of stores with nine or fewer branches). Busi¬
nesses in each of these categories may own department stores. Other retail
outlets include gas and electricity showrooms owned by the area gas and
electricity boards, and mail order houses (see p. 405).
The findings of the 1966 Census of Distribution (Table 34) show that, in
comparison with 1961, a larger volume of trade had been handled by rather
fewer shops. A notable feature is the continuing expansion of large multiple

firms relative to other types of shop. Independent shops, however, still account
for over half of Britain’s retail trade.
A very wide range is covered in the size of retailing establishments. Ten
shops (nine of them department stores) had sales in 1961 exceeding £5 million
or takings of more than £2,000 an hour; at the other extreme there were more
than 70,000 establishments taking less than £2,000 a year. Some of these were
market and street traders, whose volume of business may be very small.
According to the Census of Distribution there wrere nearly 74,000 shops
owned by multiples (including multiple department stores) in 1966 with
a total turnover of £3,858 million. This form of organisation showed the
largest rise in numbers between 1961 and 1966 and their share in total sales
went up from 29 per cent to 35 per cent. Their turnover increased faster than
that of independent businesses between 1966 and 1968.
The share in total retail trade of co-operative stores dropped from 11 to 9 per cent
between 1961 and 1966 which was rather less than the relative decrease in the
number of stores. However, their turnover did not increase between 1966 and
1968.
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary organisations controlled
by their members. Membership is open to anyone paying a small deposit
on a minimum share, which entitles the member to an equal voice with other
members in determining the policy of the society. Share investment by
individual members is limited to £1,000 (less in some societies) and only a
low rate of interest is normally paid on the shares.
In the past the trading surplus, after allocation to reserves and other
payments, has been paid out periodically to members in the form of a dividend
in proportion to their purchases. Most recently some societies have favoured
reducing prices (especially on foodstuffs) to consumers in preference to
dividends, or have introduced gift stamps redeemable for cash or available
for buying other goods.
At the end of 1968 there were 539 retail co-operative societies registered
under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act. Amalgamations are slowly
diminishing the number of societies (the total in 1958 was 1,015). The

largest single society in Britain is the London Co-operative Society with
1-15 million members and a turnover of £75 million a year. Total sales of
the retail co-operative societies in 1968 amounted to £1,000 million (this figure
includes certain activities not covered by the Census of Distribution figure
in Table 34). (The approximate average rate of dividend paid to members
in 1968 was y-gd. in the £.)
Independent shops have been giving ground gradually in the face of increased
competition from the larger undertakings. The proprietors of many of the
smaller shops often have other means of livelihood. Average turnover per shop
has continued to increase, though by less than for the retail trade as a whole.
None the less, even allowing for a 15 per cent increase in prices, the average
independent shop sold more goods in 1966 than in 1961.
There were 778 department stores in Britain in 1968 with a turnover of
over £662 million—about 6 per cent of the total turnover of all retail establish¬
ments. Between 1966 and 1968 their turnover increased by 12 per cent.
Department stores were defined for the purposes of the census as having 25 or
more persons engaged in selling a wide range of commodities notably clothing
and household goods. Co-operative societies owned 238 department stores
in 1966 and 213 were owned by multiples.

groups numbered over 225,000 establishments, and the clothing and foot¬
wear group over 81,000.
Though the total value of retail trade in Great Britain (inclusive of
electricity and gas showrooms and mail order business) rose by a quarter
between 1961 and 1966, rates of growth (measured in turnover) varied
appreciably between different types of trade. The slowest growth was in
general stores, in the food sector, and department stores. The fastest growth
was in radio and television hire, mail order business, gas and electricity
showroom sales of durable goods, sports and leisure equipment, and chemists’
and photographic goods. However, the actual trends are blurred by the
introduction into specialised shops of other specialities, for example, clothing
multiples opening food sections, and vice versa. Though gas and electricity
showroom business was buoyant between 1961 and 1966, their combined
turnover is relatively small, amounting in 1966 to just over £185 million.
The real expansion in the volume of sales in Great Britain between 1961 and
1966, taking into account the exclusion of market traders (included in the 1961
Census) and a general increase in prices of 15 per cent, was about 7 per cent,
or an average of 1 - 6 per cent a year.
Sales by all kinds of retail business increased again by 9 per cent between
1966 and 1968, while retail prices increased by 8-5 per cent.
The Northern Ireland 1965 Census of Retail Distribution and Other
Services shows total spending of £385 million through 22,000 establishments.
The value increased by 9 per cent between 1965 and 1968.
The development of self-service trading has been a feature of the last two
decades. At the end of 1967 there were some 23,000 stores operating wholly
or partly on self-service lines, compared with about 9,500 towards the end of
1961 and less than 500 in 1950. This development has mainly been associated
with multiple stores and has been accompanied by a trend to larger shops in
terms of both staff and floor space.
Supermarkets may be defined as self-service shops with a minimum selling
area of 2,000 square feet. There were about 870 supermarkets in 1961, accord¬
ing to the Census of Distribution, of which 524 were owned by multiples,
308 by co-operative societies and 38 by independents. It has been estimated
that by the end of 1968 over 3,000 had been opened.
Automatic Vending New forms of automatic vending machines have come to the fore since 1955.
Machines Possibly some 300,000 machines are in use. Machines now sell not only
cigarettes, sweets and stamps but also hot and cold beverages, prepared
foodstuffs, stockings, paper-back books and other commodities, including
various types of fuel. Another form is the self-service petrol pump. Organisa¬
tions specialising in automatic vending machines (not otherwise engaged in
retail trade) numbered 56 in 1966, with sales of over ^11 million.
Mobile Shops Some 11,700 mobile shops1 were reported in the Census of Distribution for
1961, with sales amounting to £93 million. Nearly a quarter of this turnover
was concentrated in Scotland (where the density of population is lower than
in England) compared with a tenth of all retail sales. Co-operative societies
accounted for 39 per cent of sales through mobile food shops, against 16 per
cent in ordinary food shops. For the most part, mobile shops were concerned
with food sales; about 42 per cent were travelling grocers, and over 28 per cent
and 21 per cent respectively were greengrocers and butchers. Only a very

small proportion (about 6 per cent) were non-food shops, and these specialised
mainly in paraffin supplies and hardware.
An increasing number of ‘out of town’ stores are being opened, providing a
range of goods under one roof, associated with extensive car parking facilities,
away from established central shopping areas.
All forms of consumer sales promotion have been expanding, including
reduced price offers, gift schemes, and stamp trading. The stamps, by law,
have to be marked with their cash value and redeemed for cash on request.
It has been estimated that manufacturers spent some £200 million on
promotions in 1967 compared with £117 million in 1965.
A facility which is spreading in Britain is the ‘credit card’. Users are issued
with a card on production of which their signature is accepted on bills in
participating shops, hotels and restaurants. The issuers then meet the bills and
recover from the card-holder through a single account presented periodically.
Users of certain cards are also required to pay a regular subscription.
Mail order trading has been one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain in recent years. The 1966 Census of Distribution showed that the
sales of specialist retail mail order businesses had almost doubled in five years
from £227 million to £431 million; an increase of just under ten times since
1950, when they amounted to ^46 million. Turnover continued to rise steadily
between 1966 and 1968.
Sales by manufacturers direct to the public totalled £144 million in 1961,
compared with £70 million in 1950. Mail order sales accounted for 24 per
cent of the former total, sales to employees for 11 per cent, and charges for
work done for 9 per cent. Other direct sales, including sales by door-to-door
salesmen, accounted for the balance. Included in these sales were items as
various as carpets, washing machines, brushes, books and soft drinks.
Closely connected with the distributive trades are those which offer a service
directly to the public, notably catering and hotel trades, laundries and dry
cleaners, garage and motor repair trades, hairdressers and boot and shoe
repairers.
In 1964 there were 151,000 establishments primarily concerned with catering
(defined to cover public houses, canteens, and fish and chip shops, as well as
licensed hotels and restaurants, etc.) with a total turnover in that year of
£2,036 million. Hotels and holiday camps (excluding boarding houses and
unlicensed hotels) had receipts of about £286 million, of which £124 million
was from residential accommodation. Nearly half the total turnover of the
catering trades was from the sale of alcoholic drinks. Between 1964 and 1968
the catering trades’ turnover increased by 17 per cent. In addition coin-
operated machines are widely being installed in factories—some 60,000
beverage and snack machines are estimated to have been provided in industrial
sites—and in commercial premises as well as in normal retail outlets.
There were about 6,000 commercial laundry, launderette and dry cleaning
businesses with an annual turnover of about ^182 million in 1966. Between
1961 and 1966 it increased by 61-7 per cent, but in the following two years
turnover of this group, other than launderettes and coin-operated dry cleaning
establishments, showed little change.
There were nearly 47,000 businesses in the motor trades in Britain in 1962,
with nearly 58,000 establishments. Total turnover amounted to £2,979
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
million, including transactions between traders amounting to £800 million or
less. Traders classified as new vehicle dealers had nearly 14,700 establishments
and accounted for over two-thirds of total turnover. Over 14,000 establish¬
ments were classified as being primarily petrol stations, and 12,600 were also
general repairers. Between 1962 and 1968 the motor trades turnover has
increased by about 55 per cent.
Takings in hairdressing establishments increased very rapidly between 1950
(£38 million) and 1961 (£97 million), and between 1961 and 1966 to £136
million. Between 1966 and 1968 they rose by only 4 per cent. There are about
48,000 hairdressing establishments.
There are some 8,700 establishments specialising in boot and shoe repairs
(excluding repairs handled through footwear shops); they had takings of £26
million in 1966.
Other establishments found in shopping areas and offering a service to the
public include those of radio and television rental companies (over 3,800
shops), licensed betting offices (over 15,700 in 1968) and over 3,500 funeral
undertaking businesses.
Packaging British industry’s current annual expenditure on packaging has been estimated
at £800 million. The expansion of self-service shops, the spread of branded
and standardised products, and developments in partly prepared foods, for
example, ready-washed vegetables and ready-made cake mixes, have been
major factors in the great changes which have taken place in packaging
methods. Paper packaging, including cartons and boxes, remains the most
extensively used (turnover of some £370 million a year), the fastest growing
sector being paper sacks. New uses are being found for tinplate (output,
^130 million a year), especially in sales of soft drinks and beer. Glass and
plastics packaging account for about £65 million and £70 million a year
respectively. The use of plastics continues to develop; output of polythene
bags reached some 35,000 tons in 1968, and that of bags made of poly¬
propylene, and other film, about 6,500 tons.

Hire-purchase The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such
Sales as cars, furniture, washing machines, television sets, refrigerators and cookers,
has been greatly helped by instalment purchase. Instalment credit debt
outstanding to the main providers amounted to £1,027 mdlion at the end of
March 19691; nearly three-quarters was owed to finance companies and the
remainder to durable goods shops and department stores. A few finance
companies which operate on a national scale account for a high proportion of
the total business.
The Board of Trade has powers to regulate the terms of hire-purchase and
credit sales agreements in order to restrain the expansion of consumer credit.
The current terms are: a minimum deposit of 33^ per cent on most durable
consumer goods except cookers and water-heaters (10 per cent), mattresses
and furniture (20 per cent), and cars (40 per cent). There is usually a maxi¬
mum repayment period of 24 months for most goods except cookers and
water-heaters (4 years).
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating from offices in Northern Ireland amounted in 1968 to nearly

£21-7 million and at the end of 1968 the hire-purchase debt owed to them
amounted to £21-6 million.
About £494 million is estimated to have been spent on all forms of advertising
in 1968; as a proportion of the gross national product (1-4 per cent) and of
consumer expenditure (i-8 per cent), it has remained almost unchanged
over the last ten years. About £320 million was expended on press advertising
and £i32 million (including tax) was spent on television advertising. The re¬
mainder was divided between outdoor signs, posters, films, and radio. Most of
the advertising is carried out by advertising agencies, which, in some cases,
also provide marketing, consumer research and other services; their rep¬
resentative organisation is the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. The
trade association for the industry as a whole, including agencies, advertisers and
owners of advertising media, is the Advertising Association. It was responsible
for the setting up of the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent
body whose objective is the promotion and enforcement of the highest
standards of advertising, in particular through the British Code of Advertising
Practice.
Various legislative measures exist in the United Kingdom to protect the
consumer against specific abuses. Non-statutory organisations also exist to
further the consumer’s interests. Weights and measures legislation, one of the
earliest forms of consumer protection, was brought up to date and extended
in scope by the Weights and Measures Act 1963; it is strictly enforced by
qualified inspectors of local weights and measures authorities. The Trade
Descriptions Act 1968 deals with misdescriptions of goods and services and
provides for positive enforcement by the same authorities. The purity,
hygiene and description of food are controlled by the Food and Drugs Acts
1955 and 1956. The Consumer Protection Act 1961 gives the Home Office
power to make regulations to ensure the safety of any class of goods.
The Hire-Purchase Act 1965 and the Hire-Purchase (Scotland) Act 1965
provide safeguards to the consumer who buys goods on hire-purchase or
credit sale terms. The protection extends to agreements up to £2,000 although
most of the safeguards do not apply to credit sale agreements for less than £30.
Similar legislation operates in Northern Ireland. As a precaution against
fraud, virtually every hire-purchase agreement on a car is registered with
H.P. Information Ltd., a non-profit-making company whose members are car
dealers or finance companies concerned with car sales; dealers and finance
houses can check with it in confidence.
The British Standards Institution (see p. 251) has established a number of
standards for consumer goods, and the Council of Industrial Design (see
p. 218) helps to foster improvements in the design of consumer goods.
The Consumer Council, financed by grant-in-aid from the Board of Trade,
was set up in 1963 to concern itself with and promote the consumer’s interests.
Within the limits of its finance and terms of reference it is fully independent
and so free to criticise government departments and to exert pressure on
other bodies. It undertakes research into consumer reactions to, and experience
of, goods and services, publishes reports, advisory booklets and leaflets,
promotes consumer education in schools, produces a monthly magazine,
Focus, and has introduced an informative labelling (Teltag) scheme. (It is
debarred from engaging in comparative testing of products, law enforcement
action or taking up complaints on behalf of individual consumers.) A general

advisory service dealing with individual consumers’ problems is provided by
the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (see p. 122).
Advice to its members on the merits of consumer goods is provided by the
Consumers’ Association (CA), a private body financed by the subscriptions of
members. It arranges tests and makes reports on the quality of goods bought
on the open market and its findings are published in its monthly bulletin
Which?, issued to subscribers. The Research Institute for Consumer Affairs,
established with a grant from the CA, undertakes research into consumer
goods and services, and publishes reports. There are also a number of local
independent consumer groups, which in 1963 formed themselves into a
national Federation of Consumer Groups. Assistance with certain aspects of
consumer guidance is also given by a number of other private bodies and by
certain government departments and local authorities. Individual trades and
industries have also taken measures to raise standards of quality.
The practice of resale price maintenance and its enforcement by cutting off
supplies was made unlawful under the Resale Prices Act 1964; some limited
exemptions for certain classes of goods have been granted by the Restrictive
Practices Court (see p. 242).
16 LABOUR
Less than 200 years ago, government concern with all aspects of employment
was at a minimum. State intervention came first in the sphere of safety, health
and welfare. The first factory legislation was enacted in 1802. The first
effective Factory Act was that of 1833 which set up a national system of
inspection to enforce its provisions. Trade unions—forbidden in the eighteenth
and early nineteenth centuries as a threat to civil peace and individual liberty—
ceased in 1824to be ‘actionable conspiracies in restraint of trade’. During the
nineteenth century new unions of skilled and semi-skilled workers grew up,
more soundly organised than their forerunners and more acceptable to the
public because their ambitions were more restricted. A number of employers’
associations, mainly local, were formed; unions and employers learned to
bargain together; and procedures for conciliation and arbitration began to be
agreed. Legislation passed in the 1870s clarified and regularised the legal
status of trade unions. In 1910, the first employment exchanges were intro¬
duced to provide a national service for putting employers in touch with
workers and vice versa. In 1917 the exchanges were transferred to the newly
created Ministry of Labour. The factory inspectorate was added to its
responsibilities in 1940. This department became the principal instrument of
the Government’s labour policies in Great Britain; it was re-named Depart¬
ment of Employment and Productivity (DEP) in 1968 and took over
responsibility for productivity and prices and incomes policy. In Northern
Ireland employment matters are among the responsibilities of the Ministry of
Health and Social Services.
MANPOWER
The total working population of Great Britain at the middle of June 1968 was
about 25 million, some 47 per cent of the total population, and included
about 73 per cent of persons of normal working age (15 to 59 years for
women, 15 to 64 years for men). About 92 per cent of the men of working
age are today in or seeking gainful work. The remaining 8 per cent consist
mainly of those continuing their education, of the severely disabled and of
some persons of private means. The proportion of women of working age in or
seeking gainful work is much lower, about 53 per cent, as many housewives
either do not wish or cannot manage to take employment outside the home.
Just over half of the women at work are married. Besides those of normal
working age, there are over a million older men and women still at work. The
great majority of the working population work for a wage or salary, but about
1 -7 million are employers or self-employed.
Northern Ireland, which has 27 per cent of the total population of the
United Kingdom, has 2-3 per cent of its working population. The ratio of
working to total population in Northern Ireland is about 40 per cent, and
farmers and smallholders working their own holdings account for about
one-twelfth of the working population.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
For demographic reasons the size of the working population increased slowly
between 1959 and 1966 but has since fallen (see Table 36). The reasons
include a tendency for young people to stay longer in full-time education,
a higher proportion of women marrying and interrupting their working life
(many re-enter the working population later on when their family responsibili¬
ties permit), and a reduction in immigration resulting in a change from a net
inflow to a net outflow.
Because of the effect of the lower birth rates in the early 1950s and of the
change in migration patterns, no net growth in the working population
between 1967 and 1973 is expected, and because of the raising of the minimum
school-leaving age in 1973 it is expected to be lower between 1974 and 1976
than it was in 1967. After 1976 the working population is expected to increase
again, so as to show a total increase of some 3 per cent in the period 1967 to
1981, compared with an increase of some 5 per cent between 1956 and 1967.
Though successful development policies in the less-prosperous regions may
raise the numbers above the levels forecast, it is clear that increasing demand
for labour must be met by better deployment of manpower and improved
productivity. Married women form the only substantial reserve and the
Government is studying the nature of the obstacles to employing those who
are willing to work and how they may be overcome.
The industrial distribution of employees in civil employment is shown in
Table 37. Of all employees about 40 per cent are employed in the mining and
manufacturing industries and only about 2 per cent in agriculture and
fisheries, even during the harvest season. Over 55 per cent of those in manu¬
facturing are in the metal, engineering, vehicles and chemicals groups of
industries.
Most industries employ women as well as men though not always for the
same types of work, for example, few women are managers and few personal
secretaries are men. It is illegal to employ women in certain jobs, such as
underground work in coal mines. The industrial groups in which women are

and professional and miscellaneous services.
The numbers given in Table 37 as working in any industry or service
include those engaged on administrative, technical and clerical work, so that
the totals given for the production industries are greater than the numbers on
productive processes. According to an enquiry made in May 1968 by the
Department of Employment and Productivity into the occupations of
employees in manufacturing industries in Great Britain (in firms with 11 or
more employees) 26-2 per cent were administrative, technical and clerical
workers (the ratio ranged according to industry from 13-5 per cent in clothing
to 38-7 per cent in chemicals and allied industries).
Manpower
Research Unit
The DEP has a manpower research unit, set up in 1963 to examine manpower
requirements over the whole economy and in particular industries and
occupations during a period five to ten years ahead. Its forecasts are designed
to help the industrial training boards determine the future requirements of
skills (see p. 416) and all concerned with training to meet future requirements

in industry, careers officers (see p. 413) and others giving vocational guidance
to new entrants to the labour force, and in economic planning generally.
The general unemployment rate in Britain as a whole in the last 25 years has
been among the lowest in the world—usually between 1 and 2 per cent—but
has been somewhat higher since 1966. It has been particularly low in the south¬
east and Midlands of England, and consistently higher in those parts of the
country which have the greatest dependence on shipbuilding, coalmining, and
certain branches of the heavy engineering and metal manufacturing industries,
notably parts of Scotland and Wales, and north-east England and Merseyside.
These areas have been the subject of a series of measures of selective
assistance to stimulate industrial expansion; and, more recently, counter¬
measures have been taken to limit expansion in areas of manpower shortage
(see p. 253). The general unemployment rate in Great Britain in August 1969
was 2-5 per cent; the areas with the highest rates were northern England,
Wales and Scotland.
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed but excluding certain unpaid helpers—was about 592,000 in
June 1968 (394,000 males and 198,000 females). The number of insured
employees was 515,000. The largest productive industries are agriculture,
engineering, textiles and clothing. Most of the agricultural work in Northern
Ireland is done without hired help.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
other parts of the United Kingdom. In July 1969 it was 7-2 per cent of
insured employees. The Ministry of Commerce of the Northern Ireland
Government has wide powers (similar to those in Great Britain) to assist the
development and diversification of industry. It is using these powers
vigorously in an attempt to improve the situation.
EMPLOYMENT, TRAINING AND PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES
The main government employment services are provided in Great Britain
through the country-wide network of over 900 offices of the Department of
Employment and Productivity, which act as employment exchanges. The
services in Northern Ireland are run on similar lines by the Ministry of Health
and Social Services but there are some variations related to the much smaller
area of administration.
The employment exchanges provide a free and confidential service for
employers needing staff and for workpeople, whether or not already in
employment, seeking jobs. Information and advice on any employment
problem is available to all. Employers and employees alike remain free to use
general or specialised fee-charging private employment agencies and direct
recruitment by advertisement or personal introduction. Exchanges, including
the specialist placing services described below, handle the full range of
occupations and deal with full-time, part-time and temporary vacancies.
Details of unfilled vacancies (or of people seeking jobs) can be circulated
quickly in the ‘travel to work’ area, or more widely if necessary. Local employ¬
ment committees, on which employers, workers and other local interests are
represented, are attached to certain employment exchanges as advisory bodies
to secure the full benefit of local knowledge and the close co-operation of
employers and workers.
LABOUR 413
The employment exchanges offer a selective service to certain groups of
employers and employees through specialised registers. All exchanges hold
a Commercial Register of situations vacant and wanted in the distributive
trades, clerical and typing posts, and catering and other services. Over 40 of
the larger exchanges hold a Professional and Executive Register concerned
with senior posts in industry, commerce and the professions both at home
and overseas. There are nearly 30 offices, in places where there are large
groups of hospitals, which have officers specially trained to deal with the
employment problems of nurses, midwives and those in related occupations.
Elsewhere nurses and their employers are dealt with at the local employment
exchange. In view of the increasing number of older persons in the population,
employment exchanges have instructions to make special efforts to find them
employment and to encourage employers to consider older workers on their
merits.
Vocational guidance services for young people and the Disablement
Resettlement Service are described below as is the selection of candidates
for the government vocational training scheme (see p. 416). An Occupational
Guidance Service for adults is available through about 30 units in the main
centres of population. Expert advice is given by specially trained staff to any
persons over the age of 18 in doubt about the kind of work or career for which
they are best fitted.
Employment exchanges holding the Professional and Executive Register
are also ready to give information about the professions and allied occupations
to young men and women considering a career and to older people seeking a
new one, for example, ex-Regular officers of the armed forces.
The DEP’s Regular Forces Resettlement Service helps Regular officers
and other ranks returning to civilian life to find suitable employment. Nearly
all those leaving the Services are successful in securing satisfactory
resettlement.
Youth
Employment
Service
The Youth Employment Service in Great Britain is the responsibility of the
Department of Employment and Productivity and is under the general
direction of the Central Youth Employment Executive (CYEE) composed of
senior officers of the DEP and the education departments. It is operated in
most areas through offices known as Youth Employment Offices or Career
Offices (COs) established by local education authorities in accordance with
schemes approved by the Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity
and 75 per cent of the relevant expenditure of local education authorities is
reimbursed by the DEP.
The service has four main activities: (a) the CYEE produces and circulates
careers literature to schools and careers offices. Careers employment officers
work with teachers in schools to give pupils background knowledge about
careers; (b) COs give vocational guidance in individual interviews; (c)
school leavers are helped to find employment. Career offices also provide
an employment service for any young person seeking work, or employer
seeking young workers; (d) COs follow up the progress of the young people
and give any necessary further advice. In many areas there are specialist
officers to advise the more able young people and the handicapped.
In Northern Ireland the functions of the Youth Employment Service are
similar to those in Great Britain but its organisation is different in that
parliamentary responsibility rests with the Minister of Education and the
service is operated by a statutory board composed of representatives of local
education authorities and other educational and industrial interests. Of the

board’s expenditure, 80 per cent is met by the Ministry of Education and
20 per cent by local education authorities.
The Disablement Resettlement Service is designed to help disabled persons
to get and keep suitable work. It is available to anyone over school-leaving age
who is substantially handicapped as a result of injury, disease or congenital
deformity in obtaining or keeping employment. The DEP is responsible for
the administration of the Service and is assisted by the National Advisory
Council on the Employment of the Disabled.
The help given falls under five main headings:
Vocational guidance is given at local offices by specialised disablement
resettlement officers (DROs) in consultation, as necessary, with the local
disablement advisory committees, hospital resettlement clinics and medical
interviewing committees, and also in the industrial rehabilitation units.
Having regard to a disabled person’s qualifications and aptitude and to medical
guidance, the DRO endeavours to find the work most suited to him, with
or without an intervening period of industrial rehabilitation or vocational
training. A Register of Disabled Persons is maintained, and in mid-April
1969 the number registered was nearly 645,000; registration is voluntary. All
employers of 20 or more persons are required to employ a quota (at present
3 per cent for all industries, except shipping, in respect of the manning of
ships) of registered disabled persons. The number of registered disabled
persons unemployed in mid-April 1969 was 68,600.
There are 30 specialised Blind Persons Resettlement Officers (BPROs)
attached to offices of the DEP.
Industrial rehabilitation is provided at 22 units (including one combined
medical/industrial rehabilitation unit) run by the DEP. Their aim is to
provide the final link between sickness and employment by enabling men
and women to adjust themselves gradually to normal working conditions
and to receive vocational guidance based on skilled assessment of their
aptitudes in a practical workshop situation. Attendance at a unit is voluntary
and maintenance allowances are paid. They also provide special short
assessment courses for young people finding it difficult to enter suitable
employment and at some there are work preparation classes for handicapped
school leavers (run in co-operation with local education authorities). The
staff includes a doctor, occupational psychologist, social worker, DRO,
industrially experienced workshop supervisors, and usually a remedial
gymnast, all under the general leadership of a rehabilitation officer.
The Department of Employment and Productivity gives financial assistance
to two centres conducted by voluntary organisations which provide similar
facilities for the blind, to four schemes by other bodies for the rehabilitation
of patients with mental handicaps, and to two centres for spastics.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government
Training Centres (see p. 416), educational institutions and employers’ estab¬
lishments. For the more seriously disabled there are special residential
training colleges run by voluntary organisations with the financial assistance
and technical help of the DEP. There are also arrangements for the training
of special categories such as the blind, and for providing grants to disabled
persons qualified to undertake study or training for professional or comparable
employment.

under special conditions. In April 1969 it employed 7,550 severely disabled
men and women in 86 factories. Some 140 home workers were supplied with
work from 8 centres. The directors are appointed by the Secretary of State;
loans and grants for capital development and to meet operational costs are
provided from public funds.
The DEP also gives financial assistance to local authorities and voluntary
organisations towards the cost of providing facilities for sheltered employment
for 2,400 severely disabled sighted workers and for 3,000 blind workers.
The Manpower and Productivity Service of the DEP, set up in 1968, seeks
to bring about the effective use of productive resources and to encourage the
adoption and spread of good management practices. It consists of some 80
manpower advisers, organised on a regional basis, with a central consultancy
service. The Service’s facilities are available free of charge, and one of its
particular interests is in helping industry to improve collective bargaining and
to draw up productivity agreements.
As part of the policy of encouraging geographical mobility of labour within
Britain to balance resources and demands, the Department of Employment
and Productivity makes grants and allowances to help with costs of fares,
temporary lodging and acquisition of and removal to the new home, in
specified instances. They are available to unemployed workers moving to new
employment, and therefore settling, in another area, to key workers transferred
by a firm into a development area to inaugurate a new plant, and unemployed
workers recruited to new plants in development areas and sent to the parent
works for preliminary training.
Commonwealth citizens from overseas are subject to control under the
Commonwealth Immigrants Acts 1962 and 1968 which apply, broadly, to all
Commonwealth citizens1 (except for those who were born in Britain or have
close family links, see p. 12). If they wish to enter Britain to take or seek
full-time employment, they must first obtain a voucher issued by the DEP.
They can apply themselves if they have certain special skills and qualifications
(mainly of professional or graduate standard), or an employer can apply on
behalf of a particular individual. The issue of vouchers to citizens of
independent countries is mainly restricted to those with offers of employment
in manufacturing industries (these restrictions do not apply to citizens of
Malta or of dependent territories). Commonwealth citizens who wish to
work in Northern Ireland, and who are not ‘Northern Ireland workers’,2
need special Northern Ireland employment permits, which are issued only
in respect of definite jobs. (For immigration and community and race relations,
see p. 145.)
Foreigners are admitted to Britain to take up employment provided they
hold a permit issued to the prospective employer by the Department of
Employment and Productivity (the Ministry of Health and Social Services
for Northern Ireland if the proposed employment is in Northern Ireland).
In Great Britain, over 62,000 such permits were issued in 1968. About 16,300
workers, mainly skilled, came to work in industry and commerce, 19,200 to

work in the hotel and catering industry, 10,000 for domestic work and 7,500
as student employees. Employment is limited to a maximum of one year in
the first instance but may be extended on the employer’s application.
Before a permit is issued, the DEP must be satisfied that there is a vacancy
for which no suitable British or foreign worker already long-resident in
Britain is available, and that the wages and conditions of employment are not
less favourable than those enjoyed by British workers. These conditions are
waived for student employees who are admitted for limited periods in order
to improve their English and to gain a wider knowledge of their occupations.
A foreigner in employment in Britain may not change his job unless his
prospective employer has obtained prior approval from the DEP.
Britain, as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, participates with 13 European countries in the arrangements
for assisting nationals of the countries concerned to obtain employment in
other member countries.
As part of its plans for increasing productivity in industry the Government is
fostering the expansion and improvement of industrial training. The whole
framework of training in industry and commerce was transformed by the
Industrial Training Act 1964. Under this Act industrial training boards are
appointed to be responsible for the quantity and quality of industrial training
in the industry concerned; up to June 1969, 26 boards had been set up com¬
prising over 15 million employees or about 85 per cent of those in industry
and commerce to whom the Act applies. Each board covers as wide a sector
of industry as possible to reduce costs of administration and simplify prob¬
lems of co-operation between boards. It can provide its own training courses
or arrange for other organisations to provide training. It raises a levy from
employers and makes grants to those whose training it approves. The
Secretary of State meets the initial administrative costs of each board and is
making grants towards certain other expenditure: for example, training
courses for trainers and research projects. To advise the Secretary of State
on the administration of the Act and on industrial training questions generally,
a Central Training Council (CTC) consisting of employer and trade union
members, representatives of nationalised industries, educationists, selected
chairmen of training boards and others with a special interest in industrial
training has been set up. It also advises on the running of the Industrial
Training Service (ITS), which includes assessing training needs both for
industries and individual companies, developing training schemes, and
promoting group training.
The Government Vocational Training Scheme, administered by the
Department of Employment and Productivity, is intended to augment what
industry is doing to overcome shortages of skilled workers in industries of
national importance as well as helping persons in special need, such as the
disabled (see p. 414) and ex-Forces men and women, to fit themselves for
suitable employment. Training is provided for suitable persons over 18 years
of age who are unskilled or whose prospects of work in their existing trade
are poor. (Employed persons as well as the unemployed are accepted for
training in trades of importance to the national economy.) Most of it is done
at Government Training Centres (GTCs), which are within easy reach of the
main industrial centres of the country, and between them offer courses in
over 40 different trades, with emphasis on those in which there is a shortage
of skilled labour. In June 1969 there were 42 GTCs (being increased to 55 by
Special DEP
Services
LABOUR 417
the spring of 1971). Schemes of training for particular trades are agreed with
representatives of the employers and workers concerned.
For the disabled and for ex-Regular Service men and women and the un¬
employed with special resettlement problems, training in trades and
commercial work is also available under the scheme at technical and commer¬
cial colleges and private training establishments or by means of individual
courses at employers’ establishments. For severely disabled persons training
is provided at four residential training colleges run by voluntary organisations
with government financial assistance.
During training, trainees are paid good allowances to maintain themselves
and their dependants. During 1968 more than 13,000 people were trained
under the scheme and over 90 per cent of them were subsequently employed
in the trade for which they had been trained.
Training can also be given in GTCs to workers sponsored by their
employers where it can be fitted in with the DEP’s other training commit¬
ments. The employer continues to pay the trainee’s wages. The DEP arranges
special six-week business training courses for Regulars and ex-Regulars
(mainly ex-officers) at commercial and technical colleges; four-week courses
in industrial supervision are provided at a centre in London for non-technical
warrant officers and senior NCOs (or other Service equivalent ranks). In
addition to full courses for a civilian trade, refresher courses and conversion
courses required for ex-Service men and women can be arranged under the
Vocational Training Scheme.
The DEP also provides assistance with training for firms moving into a
development area or expanding an existing business there. The assistance
includes grants for training carried out by the employer and direct training of
employees on the firm’s premises by staff loaned by the DEP. A new scheme of
grants administered by the industrial training boards has been introduced to
promote craft and technician training in development areas. Grants are
available to employers in these areas (see p. 254) who provide additional
off-the-job training facilities for apprentices or technicians, or otherwise
increase the numbers of such trainees.
A special service to industry is the Department of Employment and Producti¬
vity’s Training Within Industry for Supervisors (TWI) scheme. Its object is
to develop the skill of supervisors in instructing others, in human relations, in
improving methods and in preventing accidents (there are separate pro¬
grammes for each of these). There are special versions of TWI, usually in
courses of a week’s duration, for supervisors employed in offices, retail
distribution and hospitals, and an in-plant training development service
including the training of operatives as instructors. Training Officers of the
DEP either give these courses or train employers’ nominees to enable them to
run TWI courses in their own concerns.
In addition, two-week courses in industrial instructional techniques for the
training of apprentice and trade instructors are available to outside firms (as
well as GTC staff) at the Department of Employment and Productivity’s two
Instructor Training Colleges (one in England and one in Scotland), and at five
Instructor Training Units. A one-week refresher course is available for
instructors likely to benefit.
Vocational training services at GTCs, TWI courses, and courses at
Instructor Training Colleges are available to trainees from overseas under
approved schemes (for instance, those of the ILO or joint DEP/Ministry of
Overseas Development technical assistance).

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
Legislation and There are few restrictions in Britain on the freedom of an employer to hire
Conventions an employee on any terms which the employee will accept. Recent legislation,
however, embodies certain safeguards for the employee. The Terms and
Conditions of Employment Act 1959 provides machinery for enforcing on
an employer the observance of terms or conditions established by collective
agreement in his industry; under the Contracts of Employment Act 1963
employers are required to give their employees written particulars of the
main terms of employment, and both employers and employees are given
rights to minimum periods of notice when employment is to be terminated ;
and under the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 employees with a minimum
period of service of two years are entitled to lump sum payments if their jobs
cease to exist (for example, because of technological improvements or because
of a fall in demand) and their employers cannot offer suitable alternative work,
the cost being partly met from a fund subscribed to by industry as a whole.
Under present law employers are under no legal obligation to recognise a
trade union, or to refrain from refusing to employ trade unionists; nor is a
collective agreement with a trade union held to be in itself a legal contract of
employment, though the terms of a collective agreement may be expressly or
by implication incorporated in an individual contract of employment. How¬
ever, it is by collective agreements that in the majority of trades and industries
minimum or standard wages, normal working hours and other terms of
employment are effectively settled. The negotiation and observance of settle¬
ments continue to depend primarily on the strength, integrity and repre¬
sentative character of the signatory organisations rather than on any legal
sanction. The determination by statute of minimum wages, holidays and
holiday pay is in principle confined to those trades and industries where the
organisation of employers or workers, or both, is inadequate to negotiate
collective agreements and to ensure their observance. (For government
powers embodied in prices and incomes legislation, see p. 236.)
Legislation prescribes minimum standards of safety, health and welfare in
most places of employment; a single comprehensive statute is under
discussion. However, it is recognised that the causes of many accidents are
not amenable to statutory control. Therefore, voluntary action taken by
employer organisations, often in association with trade unions, is encouraged.
The further considerations which affect workers’ satisfaction with their
jobs and promote harmony between employers and employed, which can be
summed up as ‘good human relations’ between management and individual
employees, are hardly susceptible to codification; they have been recognised
for some time and are receiving increasing attention from managements and
from voluntary and official organisations.
Earnings Minimum or standard time rates for the lowest-rated manual workers, as
determined by agreements or by statutory orders, vary between 5s. and
6s. 6d. an hour for men and between 3s. qd. and 5s. 3d. for women. Actual
earnings are usually higher. Higher rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates,1
shift rates and overtime rates raise the level of average earnings.
On the basis of the latest survey in a series conducted half-yearly by the
Department of Employment and Productivity into earnings and hours of
work in manufacturing industries and some leading non-manufacturing
1 Piece rates are of declining importance in manufacturing industries, where methods
of production tend to dictate the output of a worker, not his or her own skill or energy.

industries throughout Britain, the average earnings of full-time male adult
manual workers in October 1968 were 9s. nd. an hour and £23 a week. Full¬
time women manual workers at the same date earned an average of 5s. nd.
an hour and ^11 6s. a week.
Minimum time rates for women manual workers tend to be set at around
70-90 per cent of the corresponding male rate, though the gap is gradually
closing. Women’s earnings are markedly lower than those of men, partly
because on average they work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at
premium rates, but also because a smaller proportion of women do skilled
work. The Government has announced its intention of implementing the
principle of equal pay and is having talks with the Trades Union Congress
and the Confederation of British Industry about the problems involved.
Earnings in coalmining, not covered by the half-yearly survey, are somewhat
above the average; earnings are about the average in railway work and below
the average in agriculture.
Between 1955 and October 1968 average weekly wage rates increased by
76 per cent and average weekly earnings by in per cent. Part of the increase
has been offset by a rise in prices of about 53 per cent. The trends of manual
workers’ wage rates and earnings, and retail prices from 1955 to 1968 are
shown in the diagram above.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally
by annual salary, often on a scale carrying annual increases, and such careers
generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with higher remunera¬
tion. Starting salaries may be in the range of ^800-^1,000 (lower for trainees
in their teens and higher for some graduates entering industry). The average
weekly earnings of male administrative, technical and clerical employees in

October 1968 were found by a Department of Employment and Productivity
survey to be ^29 15s. The average weekly figure for females was £15 15s.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
are in the range of £2,750 to £7,000 a year. The posts with salaries in the
range of £8,000 to £15,000 a year include those of Cabinet Ministers, top-
ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions in government depart¬
ments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily newspapers,
some persons outstanding in their professions and in the higher managerial
posts in industry, commerce and banking. A few persons in business draw
still higher salaries, while the earnings of star entertainers and certain other
very successful people exceed £20,000 a year.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices,
administrative posts and professions. They are paid the same salary for
doing the same work in journalism, broadcasting and architecture, and as
Ministers of the Crown, members of Parliament, salaried magistrates and
solicitors. Women in independent professions are not expected to charge
lower fees than men. The principle of equal pay applies to non-manual work
in the public sector but remains the exception in private non-manual
employment.
The average earnings of all salaried employees increased by 107 per cent
between 1955 and 1968.
In October 1968 the number of hours actually worked by manual workers
averaged 46-4 for full-time men and 38-3 for women on full-time work. Agreed
weekly hours are mainly in the range 40 to 42 and are generally worked as
either a five-day or a five-and-a-half-day week according to the industry and
the rule of the particular establishment. Hours actually worked by men are
somewhat longer owing to overtime working. While the hours of work of
adult men are not, in general, restricted by statute, normal hours of work for
both sexes and those of all ages are usually within the legal limits on the hours
of women and young persons.
National legislation limits and defines permissible hours of work for
women and young persons in a number of industries or trades—the maximum
permitted, with limited exceptions, being 48 hours a week and 10 hours a
day (9 hours a day for 6-day-week workers) in premises covered by the
Factories Act (see p. 421) for adult women over 18 and young people between
16 and 18; young people under 16 are limited to 44 hours a week. The
employment of women and young people at night is prohibited in industrial
undertakings, except that in certain continuous process industries young men
over 16 may, subject to certain conditions, be so employed.
With a few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in indus¬
tries covered by agreements or statutory orders are entitled to paid holidays
of at least 12 days or two weeks. Moreover, payment is made for bank or
statutory public holidays, which are as follows: in addition to Good Friday
and Christmas Day, there are bank holidays in most parts of England, Wales
and the Channel Islands on Easter Monday, the last Monday in May or first
in June, the last Monday in August or first in September, and the first
weekday after Christmas (Boxing Day); and in Scotland on New Year’s Day,
the last Monday in May or first in June and the last Monday in August or
first in September.1 Northern Ireland observes all the English holidays and,

in addition, has a holiday on St. Patrick’s Day, 17th March, and on 12th July
(commemorating the Battle of the Boyne, 1690); the Tuesday after Easter is
also a customary holiday for industry and trade. Many agreements provide
that payments should also be made for specially proclaimed holidays.
In some industries agreements provide for extended holidays related to
length of service, work status, or both.
Where statutory wage-regulating machinery exists, it consists of bodies
known as Wages Councils. These are composed of equal numbers of repre¬
sentatives of employers and workers in the respective sectors of industry,
with additional independent members. Wages Councils may submit proposals
for fixing minimum remuneration and holidays with pay to the Secretary of
State who must then make orders giving statutory force to such proposals,
subject only to his right to return them as a whole for further consideration.
The DEP’s Wages Inspectorate helps employers and workers to interpret the
provisions of wage regulation orders and sees that they are complied with.
Agricultural Wages Boards (there are separate Boards for England and
Wales and for Scotland) perform similar functions in relation to employment
in agriculture.
A variety of additional benefits in monetary form exist in varying degree. It
has been estimated that in 1964 13 million employees were covered by
occupational sick pay schemes, and in 1967 12 million by occupational pension
schemes (additional or complementary to the State schemes, see p. 126). A
smaller number are covered by schemes for redundancy payments above the
statutory minimum (see p. 418). Such ‘fringe’ benefits are rather more usual
among clerical and professional employees receiving a standard salary than
among manual workers with a chance to earn overtime and other additions
to their pay. The former also tend to get longer holidays. Senior members
of firms may enjoy the use of a company car. Some firms provide for profit-
sharing.
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their
employees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a
duty of care towards each other. In addition, minimum required standards
of safety in certain kinds of workplaces or work are laid down under a number
of statutes; some of these also deal with health and welfare.
About 213,000 industrial premises (factories, warehouses, shipyards and
docks) come under the Factories Act 1961 (consolidating earlier legislation),
which is administered by the Department of Employment and Productivity
and enforced by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Factories, v/hich forms part of
the DEP. About 700,000 premises come under the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act, which is also administered by the DEP; enforcement is shared
by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Factories and local authorities. Under these
Acts, anyone intending to employ other people in industrial or commercial
premises to which they apply has to notify the enforcing authority of his
intention before he begins to employ people and every fatal accident and every
accident causing more than three days’ incapacity must be reported; under the
Factories Act provision is also made for compulsory notification and for
investigation of certain dangerous occurrences.
The Acts are designed to secure the health, safety and welfare of employed
persons, and a wide range of provisions in the Acts and in regulations,
422
Other Work
Premises
Prevention
Advisory Bodies
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
according to the nature of the premises, deal with such matters as: the
fencing of machinery; precautions against fire, dangerous substances and
special risks; the safe condition of the premises, cleanliness, lighting,
temperature and ventilation; and the employment of women and young
persons.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and
quarries under the Mines and Quarries Act 1954; two statutes are concerned
with agriculture—the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 and the
Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956; and specialised
statutes and delegated legislation are concerned with transport—the Railway
Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act 1900, the Merchant Shipping
Acts, the Road Traffic Acts and the Air Navigation Order and Regulations.
As with the Factories Act these other provisions are, with some exceptions,
enforced through inspectorates—the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate (part
of the Ministry of Power which is responsible for safety in mines and quarries),
the Agricultural Inspectorate of the agricultural departments, and, as regards
railways, the Railway Employment Inspectorate of the Ministry of Transport.
The Board of Trade is responsible for administering the Merchant Shipping
Acts and for safety in air transport (most of the powers in respect of air
worthiness are delegated to the Air Registration Board, see p. 351), and the
Minister of Transport is responsible for road and rail transport safety matters.
There are at present no specific statutory safety requirements in hotels,
places of entertainment or educational establishments, except in so far as
they are covered by fire regulations applicable under local authority by-laws
to all large buildings or (in respect of their offices and shops) by the Offices,
Shops and Railway Premises Act. The Department of Employment and
Productivity has no statutory responsibility in regard to safety in workshops
or laboratories in educational establishments, though it keeps in touch with
university authorities and the education departments. Employers, however,
are bound by their common law obligation to provide a safe system of work,
and employers and educational authorities may voluntarily seek the advice and
help of the Factory Inspectorate, which is given freely on request.
The voluntary accident prevention movement is strongly supported by the
Factory Inspectorate. Inspectors enquire into notified accidents and safety
aspects of machine design and specification, circulate expert advice by personal
exhortation, lectures and literature, and encourage the appointment of safety
officers and the formation of works safety committees. The Factory Inspector¬
ate maintains an industrial health and safety centre in London, at which
various types of machinery demonstrating the effectiveness of guards are
displayed, as well as a wide range of protective clothing and equipment. The
DEP also actively encourages the development of voluntary central organisa¬
tion within each industry at national level for the consideration of safety
matters and the formulation of policy on accident prevention.
Organisations in industry are now concerning themselves to an increasing
extent with the promotion of safety at work and the provision of information
and advisory services to their members. They participate also in joint standing
and advisory committees appointed by the Secretary of State. Representatives
of the Trades Union Congress, the Confederation of British Industry, the
nationalised industries and other interests meet on the Industrial Safety
Advisory Council under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State.

Training for safety is an important facet of the accident prevention effort and,
to help in this work, the Department of Employment and Productivity
provides a safety course in its TWI scheme (see p. 417) and the Industrial
Training Boards (see p. 416) include specific provisions for safety training in
their general training recommendations.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) provides a
variety of safety courses for special needs at its Industrial Safety Training
Centre in Birmingham and elsewhere. Other courses are organised by bodies
such as local accident prevention groups and organisations such as the
Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors. RoSPA also helps the accident
prevention movement by providing publicity and organising conferences; its
corps of Regional Industrial Safety Officers work to promote safety activity
among top-level managers. The British Safety Council also provides publicity
and offers safety training courses.
A substantial amount of research is being done by industry, universities
and other academic bodies, and government research organisations into
problems of guarding machines, ergonomics, safe handling, electrical hazards,
protective personal equipment, construction methods, fires and explosions,
psychological factors and causes of accidents, both generally and in particular
sectors of industry. A register of research into industrial health and safety
matters has been compiled by the DEP to give an indication of the scale and
nature of research being undertaken. Industrial research associations include
amongst their more purely economic research projects the improvement of
working conditions and the reduction of hazards.
The National Coal Board has its own safety organisation—a Standing
Committee on Safety, a chief safety engineer, and safety engineers at divisions,
areas and the largest collieries. It conducts courses of safety training for
workmen and officials and is constantly on the alert for new methods of
reducing risks. Its research programme includes a number of projects with a
direct bearing on safety.
The Minister of Power has a statutory responsibility for research concerning
the safety and health of coal miners. This responsibility is largely exercised
through its Safety in Mines Research Establishment.
To safeguard the many interests which might be adversely affected by the
use of chemicals in agriculture and food storage, a voluntary scheme is
operated by the Government with the help of an advisory committee and with
the full co-operation of the chemical industry.
Transport operators and ministries concerned with road and air travel give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every
endeavour is made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic
densities, by improving the design of vehicles, transport plant and equipment,
by traffic regulation and control of standards of maintenance and by training
crews in competency and safety awareness.
Local authorities have power, under the Public Health Acts, to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary accommodation in houses and at places of work
and to treat workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded
as nuisances the abatement of which can be enforced. Factories, certain other
industrial premises, offices, shops and railway premises must comply with the
health and welfare requirements of the Factories Act or the Offices, Shops and
Railway Premises Act. These include: the cleanliness of workrooms, adequate
ventilation and suitable temperature and lighting, the avoidance of over¬
crowding and the provision of sanitary accommodation, and the protection
IP
424 BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of workers against inhaling harmful dust or fumes; the provision of washing
facilities, lockers or other accommodation for outdoor clothing, drinking
water, first aid, and seats. Legislation concerning safety in other types of
work, for example, agriculture, also prescribes appropriate measures.
The laws restricting the employment of children, young persons and women
form an important part of protective legislation. National legislation, besides
forbidding employment of children under 13 years of age, forbids the
employment of children who have not reached the statutory minimum school¬
leaving age (see p. 153) in any industrial undertaking; of women and young
persons underground in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations
(for example, certain processes connected with lead manufacture); and of
women in factories and workshops within four weeks after childbirth. It also
limits and defines the permissible hours of employment for women and young
persons (see p. 420). Local authorities, moreover, have wide powers under the
Children and Young Persons Acts 1933-63 as well as the Education Acts
1944-48, which regulate hours and conditions of employment of children
under 15 years within their areas within the limits of national legislation.
There are some 1,550 appointed factory doctors1 and some 760 works
medical officers whose duties include the initial and periodic medical examina¬
tion of all young people entering industry, and certain other medical
examinations required under the Factories Act for workers in particular
hazardous trades.
These are the main legislative provisions relating to health and welfare at
work, but it is essential to note that employers frequently achieve standards
considerably higher than those prescribed by law. They are helped to do this
by the inspectorates, by government departments and agencies, by employers’
associations and trade unions and by expert voluntary bodies.
Industrial A number of employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their
Health Services employees over and above the statutory requirements. It is estimated that
there are about 580 factories with doctors providing full-time medical cover
and about 4,500 factories with part-time medical cover. In addition several
thousand nurses are employed in industry.
The big employers, including the State and the boards of nationalised
industries, have naturally taken the lead but a number of smaller factories
also provide medical services and in a few cases have joined together in group
medical services. The Secretary of State is advised on measures to further the
development of industrial health services by the Industrial Health Advisory
Committee which includes members nominated by the Confederation of
British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the nationalised industries,
the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and other
organisations closely concerned with the promotion of industrial health.
Occupational hygiene services can give valuable assistance in securing
healthy working conditions in industry. Her Majesty’s Factory Inspectors
give advice on occupational hygiene problems as part of their normal duties.
In addition there are at present four centres in Great Britain (including the
TUC’s Institute of Occupational Health) which undertake studies of
particular problems or health risks and also carry out routine physical,
chemical and biological tests for industry.
Research facilities are provided by government agencies such as the
Medical Research Council; by university faculties of industrial health and

social medicine; and by the research departments of various industries and
large industrial concerns. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory
Inspectorate, which has specialised medical and technical branches.
Other types of amenity vary considerably from one firm to another. The
requirements of a factory, office or shop where the work is light, and where
many employers are women or young persons, are different from those of an
iron foundry or steelworks, where much of the work is arduous and is under¬
taken by men. Progressive firms are careful to find out what their employees
want, and welfare policy is often decided in consultation with the workers,
through regular consultative machinery or by other means. An increasing
number of firms pay part or all of the cost of recreational facilities. Some have
their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes. The provision
of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become usual in large
undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Many offices and shops
which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff have adopted
luncheon voucher schemes.
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been
the subject of legislation which, with some exceptions, is similar to that in
Great Britain and is embodied in the Factories Act (Northern Ireland) 1965
and the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. Many firms
voluntarily employ safety officers, and an Industrial Safety Group for the area,
supported by representatives of industry, trade unions, insurance companies
and public authorities, makes a valuable contribution in the field of industrial
accident prevention on similar lines to what is done in Great Britain.
Practically all large industrial firms and many small ones now have a personnel
department staffed by one or more specialist officers. While the form of
organisation of personnel departments varies, personnel officers are generally
responsible for advising all levels of management on every aspect of labour
relations. They also have particular duties with regard to recruitment,
selection, education and training, transfer of labour, the application of wage
agreements, the promotion of good communication and consultation and the
supervision of working conditions and employees’ amenities.
Recruitment and promotion policies are matters which each undertaking
decides for itself, although in some industries the decisions may be limited
by collective agreements or by trade practices. Great importance has recently
been attached to selection; and courses for training personnel officers in
modern interviewing techniques, including the use of test procedures, are
now well attended.
The Manpower and Productivity Service of the DEP (see p. 415) is
available to give advice on personnel policies, personnel management tech¬
niques and problems of human relations at the workplace. It can also assist
in the creation and support of machinery for the negotiation and settlement of
disputes.
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting
better human relationships in industry. The Government has sought to
extend by research the available knowledge of the factors influencing human
relations in industry and human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or
conducted by the Social Science Research Council (see p. 203) and the
Medical Research Council (see p. 197). Voluntary organisations include
bodies which deal with management problems and provide a service to
426

Associations

subscribing firms; professional associations, linking individuals with a com¬
mon interest in particular functions of management; and bodies providing
specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
basis, and the extensive changes currently proposed (see below) are
designed to retain the voluntary principle while modernising the conditions
in which it operates. The system will still rest on the organisation of employers
and workers into employers’ associations and trade unions. These organisa¬
tions1 discuss and negotiate terms and conditions of employment and other
matters affecting the workpeople at their work. In some industries these
negotiations are conducted simply by ad hoc meetings, which are held when
necessary; in others, voluntary joint machinery has been established on a
permanent basis. Industry-wide agreements are commonly supplemented by
further agreements at firm or factory level. Normally these arrangements for
collective bargaining suffice to settle all questions which are raised, but
provision is often made for matters not so settled to be referred for settlement
to independent arbitration; nowadays this provision is seldom used. The
machinery for settlement in certain trades where wages cannot be effectively
controlled by voluntary agreement has already been described (see p. 421).
The existence of these employers’ and employees’ bodies facilitates liaison
between the Government and industry on labour matters in which they have
a common interest (though it does not preclude individual contact). Standing
arrangements exist for consultation at national level between the Government,
the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the Trades Union Congress
(TUC) (see pp. 427 and 428) and the nationalised industries through the
National Joint Advisory Council, which was set up in 1939 to advise the
Government on matters in which employers and workers have a common
interest. It meets under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State.
In January 1969 the Government announced (Cmnd. 3888) its proposals
for implementing some of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on
Trade Unions and Employers’ Associations (Cmnd. 3623). The principle is
to be recognised that every worker has a right to membership of a trade union;
new machinery is to be created to resolve disputes arising from refusal of
employers to recognise or negotiate with trade unions, or from inter-union
rivalries, and to consider complaints by individuals against trade unions;
registration of procedural agreements at the level of firm or factory (if they
cover an appreciable number of workers) is to be introduced; the Government
is to have power, under specific conditions, to impose a ‘conciliation pause’
or require a ballot of a trade union’s members before declaration of a strike;
and a Commission for Industrial Relations (CIR) is to form a focus for study
and development of improved industrial relations. Some of these changes
require legislation, but the CIR started work in March 1969 on a non-statutory
basis, and registration by the Manpower and Productivity Service of the DEP
of collective agreements has been introduced on a voluntary basis for companies
with 5,000 or more employees.
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ organisations
wholly or partly concerned with labour questions. The primary aims of such
organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and conditions of
1 Some employers, including the central Government and the public corporations
operating the nationalised industries, negotiate directly with the trade unions repre¬
senting their different types of employees.

employment, including a sound wage structure and proper standards of
safety, health and welfare; to promote good relations with employees and
the efficient use of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes
which may arise. Different employers’ organisations vary in the emphasis
which they put upon these different aims and in the means by which they try
to achieve them. Although the negotiation of wages and working conditions
and the settlement of disputes remain their essential function, the majority
of the organisations provide help and advice on many aspects of industrial
relations, with the aim of developing positive employment policies and
promoting productivity.
There is diversity of structure as well as function. Generally, however,
employers’ organisations are organised on an industry basis rather than a
product basis. Some are purely local in character and deal with a section of
an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole
of a particular industry. In some of the chief industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national federations, while in others,
within which different firms are engaged on making different principal
products, there is a complex structure with national and regional federations
for these different sections of the industry as well as for the industry as a
whole. Although there are some 1,360 employers’ organisations dealing with
labour matters, about 90 of these are national employers’ associations, many
of which are in membership of the OBI and are the ones that negotiate the
important national collective agreements with trade unions.
The final authority of a local or small national organisation may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local
organisations or through regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council or central committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect committees and to
ratify their work. A small paid staff under a director or secretary carries out
the organisation’s day-to-day work. There is usually a small working group,
consisting of senior officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal
with urgent questions and co-ordinate the work of committees.
The central body of employers’ organisations is the CBI, which deals with
all matters (not only labour relations) affecting the interests of organised
employers and represents them nationally to the Government and the public
and also internationally, for instance, in the International Labour Organisa¬
tion. CBI representatives sit on various government advisory committees, on
other statutory bodies and on a number of voluntary bodies concerned with
labour matters.
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over a great many years, and consequently, their
form and organisation vary considerably as do their traditions and attitudes,
for example, their degree of concern with political movements. Trade unions
started more than two hundred years ago among the skilled craftsmen and
spread later to the general labouring and unskilled classes. More recently
trade unionism has increased among clerical, supervisory, technical and
administrative workers. A number of associations of professional workers,
formed primarily for the preservation and improvement of professional
standards, have also come to exercise many of the functions of trade unions,
428
Trades Union

including negotiations on salary and fee scales, and are legally trade unions.
The qualification for membership of some unions is occupational (for
instance, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed), while in others
the qualification is industrial (that is, they seek to recruit all persons in an
industry, whatever their occupation). In a number of unions recruitment is
based on a combination of these principles. A few large unions recruit
members in a number of different occupations and industries.
At the end of 1967 the total membership of British trade unions was just
under 10 million. There were 555 unions, but nearly 70 per cent of all trade
unionists were in the 19 largest unions, while just over a half were in the
nine unions with a membership of over 250,000. The number of trade
unionists has increased during the last decade but the number of unions has
gone down owing to amalgamations.
The basic unit of organisation in most British trade unions is the local
branch (sometimes called a lodge). Every member of the union belongs to a
branch. He may attend its meetings, make suggestions about terms and
conditions of employment, discuss the work of the union, and take part in the
election of the union’s officers. The branch takes action on certain matters
considered to be entirely, or mainly, of local interest and forwards its views on
wider issues for action by the union’s national or regional bodies. Many
unions also have shop stewards or other representatives at the place of work
to enrol members and collect dues, to ensure that local and national agreements
operate satisfactorily, to take up individual problems with management
and to keep the union informed of developments at the workplace. Only in a
few trade unions is organisation based primarily on the place of work.
In most large unions the central organisation is along the following lines:
elected officials, including a general secretary assisted by clerical and specialist
staff, are in charge of the work of the head office and are responsible to an
elected national executive council or committee which may be part-time or
full-time, and which is responsible to annual or biennial conferences of
delegates from the branches. Executive committees or councils play an
important part in the government of the unions; between conferences they
are the highest authorities and carry out policy decisions made by delegates.
Most unions also have some regional, district or area organisation.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations
whose main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade
unions in an industry in negotiations with employers. The scope and authority
of these federations and confederations vary greatly.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the TUC, which
celebrated its centenary in June 1968. The TUC’s objects are to promote
the interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and
social conditions of the workers. Its membership comprises 160 organisations,
some of which are themselves federations of smaller organisations. Together
they represent about 8-73 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all
general questions which concern trade unions both nationally and inter¬
nationally and gives assistance on questions relating to particular trades or
industries at the request of the trade union concerned.
The congress of delegates, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for a
week every year to discuss matters of general interest to trade unionists and
to employees generally. It elects annually a General Council which represents
it during the remaining 51 weeks of the year. This is responsible for carrying
out congress decisions, for watching economic and social developments, for
providing educational and advisory services to unions, and for presenting to

the Government the trade union viewpoint on economic, social and industrial
issues. It is also empowered to mediate in inter-union disputes in certain
circumstances and, through the General Council’s Incomes Policy Com¬
mittee, to comment on claims for improvements in wages and working
conditions notified to the TUC by affiliated unions. A further enlargement of
its functions was agreed between the Government and the General Council
in June 1969. The General Council undertook to use its powers, strengthened
by a special congress held in the previous month, to deal with unauthorised
and unconstitutional stoppages of work.
The TUC is a non-political body but under the Trade Union Act 1913
individual trade unions can, by a ballot vote of members, decide to set up a
political fund, financed by a separate levy, which any member can refuse to
pay without loss of his normal union rights and benefits. About 100 separate
trade union organisations, including most of the largest trade unions, have
such a fund and, in most cases, it is used to support the Labour Party.
Both the TUC and many unions conduct extensive educational services for
members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade unionism and
industrial relations principles and practice.
Branches of various trade unions in a locality generally affiliate to a local
trades council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common
interest and as a local agent of the TUC, by which it is registered each year.
There are just over 500 trades councils in England and Wales alone, grouped
together in 22 federations.
Affiliation to the TUC is open to all trade unions anywhere in the United
Kingdom, but Scottish trade unionists have their own national centre, the
Scottish Trades Union Congress, similar within its objects to the TUC. The
Scottish TUC, to which trade unions may affiliate in respect of their member¬
ship in Scotland (a number of unions are affiliated to both bodies), also accepts
affiliation from trades councils and has an affiliated membership of about
842,000. It holds an annual congress and has consultations with the Govern¬
ment on issues affecting Scottish trade unionists.
In most of the main industries there are, at national level, joint committees
(sometimes referred to as joint negotiating machinery) composed of represen¬
tatives of employers and trade unions. Their functions vary considerably,
some being simply negotiating bodies, while others deal with a wide range of
subjects affecting the interests of the industry concerned. Provision is
sometimes made in their constitution that a dispute on which it is not found
possible to reach agreement should be referred to some form of conciliation
or arbitration by independent persons, including the means provided under
the Conciliation Act 1896, or the Industrial Courts Act 1919.
Collective agreements between employers’ associations and trade unions are
not civil contracts between particular employers and employees, and are not
in themselves enforceable at law. Observance of agreed terms and conditions
is based mainly on the good faith of employers and the mutual respect and
vigilance of trade unions and employers’ organisations, but can be secured in
particular instances through reference to the Industrial Court.
Arrangements for negotiation and joint consultation also exist at district and
factory level in many industries, where matters are discussed either between
the appropriate representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis, or through
regular machinery provided by District Joint Industrial Councils or similar
bodies and Works Councils. Such bodies discuss how agreements reached at
43°

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a national level may be applied to their district or factory, but as a rule have
no power to alter the terms of such national agreements. They also discuss
new problems which may arise, and if no solution can be found at factory or
district level, refer them to the national body.
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred
by agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators, and one way in which
the parties can find such persons is by invoking the help of the Secretary of
State. Under authority derived from the Conciliation Act 1896, and the
Industrial Courts Act 1919, the Secretary of State has certain powers to assist
industry to settle disputes which it is not found possible to resolve through an
industry’s own machinery and procedure. These powers are all intended to
supplement and not to supersede the industry’s own machinery. There is no
legal obligation on the parties to a dispute to notify the dispute to the Secretary
of State nor to place the question before a conciliator.
The Department of Employment and Productivity assists with conciliation
in industry through its Industrial Relations Division and the field staff of the
Manpower and Productivity Service, who keep in touch with the course of
relations between employers and workers at national, district and, in some
cases, factory level and assist them, if requested, to settle their problems by
joint discussion and negotiation. Conciliators have no legal powers.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both
parties, be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or
an ad hoc Board of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent
tribunal established under the Industrial Courts Act. The court normally
consists of three members—the president, one member experienced in
representing employers and one in representing workpeople.
Like collective agreements, arbitration awards are not in themselves
enforceable at law, but under the Terms and Conditions of Employment
Act 1959, reports that a particular employer is not observing the recognised
terms or conditions of employment in his trade or industry may be made to
the Secretary of State by organisations which are parties to the relevant
agreement or award. If the matter is not otherwise settled, the Minister must
refer it to the Industrial Court which, after hearing the case, may issue an
award requiring the employer to observe the recognised terms or conditions.
Such an award becomes an implied term of the contract of employment of
individual employees and so enforceable at law.
The Secretary of State is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry or
Committee of Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended.
These procedures are primarily means of informing public opinion of the
facts of a dispute (the report of a Court of Inquiry has to be laid before
Parliament). Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such
bodies are not binding on the parties, they often provide the basis for further
negotiations leading to a settlement.
Over the past 30 years the number of working days lost each year through
stoppages of work arising from industrial disputes, that is through strikes and
lockouts, has been on an average about 2| million which, taking the working
population as a whole, works out at approximately one hour per worker per
year. These figures, however, only record the time lost at establishments
where strikes actually take place; they take no account of the effect in other
establishments or industries. Nevertheless, the time lost through strikes is very
much less than that lost on account of sickness, accidents and absenteeism and

Britain’s record over the past ten years or so compares favourably with that of
most other industrial countries.
Strikes in Britain are not in general caused by a breakdown in the collective
bargaining machinery. This on the whole works smoothly and well. In fact
it is estimated that about 95 per cent of all strikes, accounting for between
60 and 70 per cent of the time lost through strikes, are the result of unofficial
(and usually unconstitutional) action.
These unofficial strikes are therefore symptoms of a breakdown in relations
between management and workers at the place of work itself. The problem of
securing a fundamental improvement in relations between employers and
workers and the loyal observance of agreements and constitutional procedures
freely negotiated is currently the subject of public discussion as well as in
industry generally, but it seems likely that there is no single solution.
Joint consultation in industry is based on the understanding that the work
force needs to have a proper comprehension of management’s aims and plans
if they are to co-operate in achieving and carrying them out. A wide range of
subjects can be fruitfully discussed by joint consultative committees including
hours of work (within the framework of agreements), safety and health,
productivity, absenteeism, labour turnover, training and education, and
amenities generally. These committees are usually kept informed about the
state of the firm’s business, and consider problems resulting from decisions
to change production methods. It has been generally agreed by both manage¬
ment and trade unions to exclude from these discussions all questions relating
to wages and conditions of employment, but developments in productivity
bargaining have tended to blur this distinction. In a number of instances such
bargaining at plant level has resulted in a merging of negotiation procedures
and joint consultation.
While labour relations in government service and in the nationalised industries
are, in general, organised on the same principle as in private industry, there
are some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are dealt with by the Civil Service Department (see
p. 47) are permitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service
staff associations (trade unions) and there is a highly developed system of
negotiation and joint consultation by means of the National and Depart¬
mental Whitley Councils (see p. 64). If there is failure to reach agreement by
negotiation a department or association may, subject to certain limitations,
report the dispute to the Secretary of State for reference to the Civil Service
Arbitration Tribunal, an independent body appointed by the Secretary of
State by powers under the Industrial Courts Act 1919. Industrial employees
of the central Government are organised by trades and not by departments;
negotiations regarding their wages and conditions of employment take place
on Trade Joint Councils and unresolved matters are referred to the Industrial
Court for arbitration. In the major employing departments, Departmental
Joint Councils also exist for the discussion of matters other than trade
questions which are of mutual concern to the department and its industrial
employees (and which are domestic to the department).
In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils for
the main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical
432
Nationalised
Industries

Ireland
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
employees) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other
matters. There are corresponding regional and district councils.
In the nationalised industries, the main corporations, though not subject to
detailed governmental control, have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining in their industries and for joint
consultation with their employees; but in carrying out these duties they are
free to choose suitable arrangements. The main difference from private
industry is that the corporations are not usually members of employers’
associations (although the majority are ‘industrial associates’ of the CBI). In
some industries they are sole or main employers, but even where part of the
industry is in private hands, as for example in road transport, the corporations
are separately and directly represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of managements and trade
unions at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local
bodies, similarly representative, to deal with local implications. Most of the
industries use the facilities for arbitration offered to industry generally by the
Department of Employment and Productivity but coalmining and rail
transport have their own special arrangements. Consultations at all levels,
including the workplace level, have been arranged in all the nationalised
industries according to the traditions and needs of each industry.
Some of the nationalised industries have felt that joint consultation was
best carried out by their negotiating bodies; others have established separate
and specially constituted joint committees at all levels.
The system of labour relations in Northern Ireland is based on the same
principles as that of Great Britain and the Minister of Health and Social
Services has powers and duties similar to those of the Secretary of State in
Great Britain. Nearly 90 per cent of trade unionists in Northern Ireland are
members of trade unions with headquarters in Great Britain.
17 SOUND AND
TELEVISION
BROADCASTING
Broadcasting of sound and of television in the United Kingdom is regulated
by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, formerly the Postmaster
General, under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts 1949-1967, which prohibit the
sending or receiving of radio communications, except under licence.
Sound broadcasting services are provided solely by the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC), which was established as a public corporation by Royal
Charter in 1927. Television services are provided both by the Corporation
and by the Independent Television Authority (ITA), which was established
by the Television Act 1954.
Users of sound and television sets must obtain an annual receiving licence,1
which can be bought from most post offices. There were some 17-9 million
receiving licences current in Britain in June 1969 of which more than 15-4
million were for sound and television combined and 2-4 million (including
a million for sets fitted in cars) for sound only. The cost of receiving licences
is £6 for sound and television combined (£11 for sound and colour television),
and £1 5s. for sound broadcasting alone. One licence covers all receiving sets
in a household, but a separate licence is required for a set fitted in a car.
Registered blind people are entitled to free sound licences, or to combined
licences at a reduced rate and special licences at reduced rates are available
for radio and television dealers’ business premises, and for retired people
resident in old persons’ homes.
Broadcasting The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by the Royal Charter
Authorities of 1964 and the Licence and Agreement of 1969 and those of the ITA by the
Television Act 1964 and its 1969 Licence. Both the Royal Charter and the
1964 Act define the services of the BBC and ITA as a ‘public service’ with
the purpose of disseminating information, education and entertainment.
The BBC and the ITA are independent authorities in the day-to-day
operations of broadcasting, including programmes and administration. The
Government, however, retains ultimate control, and the Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications, as the responsible minister, is answerable to Parliament
on broad questions of policy and may issue directions to the BBC and the
ITA on a number of technical and other subjects. Both organisations are
expected to show balance and due impartiality in their general presentation of
programmes—particularly where matters of public policy or controversial
subjects are concerned—and in this connection the Minister has powers to
prohibit the broadcasting of any particular matter or class of matter, or to
revoke the licences of the BBC or ITA at any time. These powers, however,
are treated as major reserve powers and, in fact, no formal veto has ever been
1 The Government announced in August 1969 that from April 1971 the sound only
licence, including those for car radios, would be abolished, and that the combined
licence fee would be raised to £6 10s.

placed on the broadcasting of a particular item. Both the BBC and the ITA
are required to prepare annual reports and accounts which are presented to
Parliament.
The number of hours of television broadcasting are regulated by the
Minister and an arrangement has been approved which permits any one service
a basic maximum of 53 J hours a week (32 hours a week for BBC 2), but with
additional hours for outside broadcasts, religious and educational programmes,
and broadcasts in the Welsh language. In 1969 the BBC was broadcasting
about 65 hours of programmes from London in its domestic sound services
during a normal weekday.
The Corporation consists of 12 governors (including a chairman, a vice-
chairman and separate national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland), each appointed for a period of not more than five years by the
Queen on the advice of the Government. The governors, who are constitu¬
tionally responsible for the conduct of the whole broadcasting operation,
including the content and presentation of the programmes in sound and
television, and the provision and working of the necessary installations and
equipment, appoint the chief executive officer of the BBC—the Director
General, with whom they discuss all major matters of policy and finance.
A number of councils exist to advise the governors: they include the
General Advisory Councils and the regional advisory councils for the English
regions and for Northern Ireland which must be appointed under the terms
of the Charter, and a number of other councils and committees not specifically
required by the Charter but established by the BBC to advise on such matters
as religious broadcasting, charitable appeals, music, agriculture, school broad¬
casting, further education, programmes for immigrants, science and engineer¬
ing. The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales control the
policy and content of sound and television programmes intended primarily
for reception in their respective countries. Local broadcasting councils,
representative of the local community, have been appointed by the former
Postmaster General (in consultation with the BBC) to help in the development
of local radio stations. The Corporation’s Board of Management consists of
the Director General; the Managing Director, Television; the Managing
Director, Radio; the Managing Director, External Broadcasting; the Director
of Programmes, Television; the Directors of Administration, Finance, Public
Affairs, and Engineering; and the Editor, News and Current Affairs.
The services of the BBC are financed from: an annual grant voted by
Parliament, for the domestic services, "which is the income from the sale of
broadcast receiving licences less certain deductions for collection and other
expenses; an annual grant-in-aid voted by Parliament, for the external
services; and profits from BBC publications, mainly the Radio Times, which
has a weekly sale of about 3-9 million copies and attracts a large advertising
revenue; and income from BBC Radio and Television Enterprises. The
net revenue from the sale of licences for the year ended March 1969
amounted to j£8o-6 million and the grant for the external services was ^11
million. The cost of providing the local radio services is raised partially from
local sources.
The Independent Television Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and, at present, nine other members (three of whom have special
responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern Ireland
severally) whose appointment is in the hands of the Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications. The ITA owns and operates the transmitting stations,

but the production studios and equipment are owned, and the actual pro¬
grammes are provided, by programme companies appointed by the ITA.
Fifteen programme companies are at present under contract: Anglia Televi¬
sion Limited; ATV Network Limited; Border Television Limited; Channel
Television Limited; Grampian Television Limited; Granada Television
Limited; Harlech Television Limited; London Weekend Television Limited;
Scottish Television Limited; Southern Independent Television Limited;
Thames Television Limited; Tyne-Tees Television Limited; Ulster Televi¬
sion Limited; Westward Television Limited; and Yorkshire Television
Limited. A common news service is provided by Independent Television
News Limited, a non-profit-making company in which all the programme
companies are shareholders.
The Authority has controlling and regulatory powers of a wide and
important character over the content and quality of programmes: for example,
it ensures that a ‘proper balance’ of views is expressed and has drawn up a
code on violence stating that special precautions are to be taken when children
are likely to be viewing. There are also safeguards in the Television Act 1964
to prevent newspaper shareholdings in a programme company leading to
results contrary to the public interest. However, the ITA believes that
newspapers bring valuable qualities to the development of television and is
not opposed to investment by them.
In the discharge of its duties the ITA is advised by a General Advisory
Council and by committees on educational broadcasting, religious broad¬
casting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist panel advises on
medical and allied advertisements.
The chief executive officer of the ITA is the Director General. There are
also two deputy directors general, and a headquarters and regional office staff
covering all technical and administrative services. Regional officers act as
representatives of the ITA to the programme companies.
There is an Independent Television Companies Association, a body
designed for joint discussion and action by the companies. It is particularly
concerned with advertising policy, in co-operation with the ITA.
The ITA receives no payments from licence revenue; the finance for its
operations is drawn from annual rental payments made to it by the programme
companies amounting to about £7-5 million in the year ended March 1969.
In return for the valuable public concession enjoyed, the programme com¬
panies also paid to the ITA for transfer to the Exchequer a further sum
(the levy) related to their advertising revenue; this amounted to about
£25-js million during the same period.
The BBC operates, nationally, four domestic sound broadcasting services,
two television services, and the external broadcasting services. The ITA
provides one television service.
Each of the separate, but inter-related, domestic sound services has its own
characteristics.1 Radio 1 (broadcasting 20J hours a day partly in conjunction
with Radio 2) provides a programme of continuous popular music while
Radio 2 provides light music and entertainment programmes. On average,
three-quarters of the daily radio audience listen to these services. Radio 3
includes the Music Programme (which provides a range of classical music for

specialisation by each of the four networks, was published by the BBC in July 1969

some 10 hours during the day); the Third Programme, which offers works of
artistic interest and intellectual distinction each evening (and has an esti¬
mated audience of 1^ million people); educational sessions; and a sports
service on Saturday afternoons. Radio 4 (broadcasting 17 hours a day) is a
general programme providing the principal news and information services of
the BBC. In addition a wide range of music and drama is presented; broad¬
casts for schools are an important feature. The various regions of Britain have
their own version of the service.
Local radio is at present provided by the BBC in eight towns,1 Brighton,
Durham, Leeds, Leicester, Merseyside, Nottingham, Sheffield and Stoke. The
stations, transmit daily about six hours of programmes of particular interest to
the local community which they serve in addition to their output from the
BBC network.
In 1936 the BBC launched the world’s first regular public service by high
definition television. It now transmits two services: BBC 1, which is trans¬
mitted on 405 lines on very high frequency (VHF) and is available to over
99 per cent of the population of Britain; and BBC 2, which is transmitted on
625 lines on ultra-high frequency (UHF) and is available to about three-
quarters of the population. During 1967 the first regular colour television
service in Europe began on BBC 2. A duplicate BBC 1 service with colour is
to be introduced on 625 lines on UHF by 1970.
Productions on BBC television include talks and documentary programmes,
drama and films, sport and outside broadcasts, light entertainment, music,
family programmes, broadcasts for schools, educational programmes for
adults, and religious programmes. Provision is also made for programmes for
minority interests—an aspect of broadcasting which has been facilitated by
the introduction of BBC 2.
In the course of a year, the BBC television service broadcasts on a national
network for some 6,100 hours. Some 16,000 of its programmes are exported
annually to 88 overseas countries, including those in eastern Europe.
The external broadcasting services of the BBC are intended to provide a link
of culture, information and entertainment between the peoples of the United
Kingdom and those in other parts of the world; to report events of world-wide
importance with speed, accuracy and objectivity; and generally to reflect
British opinion and the British way of life. These services, which reach a
growing audience,2 broadcast in English and in 38 other languages for some
700 hours a week.
There are two divisions of the external services, one responsible for all the
transmitted output and the other concerned with programme production.
The Services Division comprises: the English Network, which includes the
World Service, broadcasting for 24 hours a day; the African Service, providing
programmes in Hausa, Somali and Swahili; the Arabic Service for the Middle
East and North Africa; the Eastern Service, providing programmes in
Bengali, Burmese, Hindi, Persian, Sinhala, Tamil and Urdu; the Far Eastern
Service, providing programmes in Cantonese, Standard Chinese (Kuoyu),
Indonesian, Japanese, Malay, Thai and Vietnamese; the Latin-American
Service, broadcasting in Spanish and Portuguese; the French Service to
Europe and Africa; the Central European Service, broadcasting in Czech,
1 In the BBC plan (see footnote, p. 435) it is envisaged that there will be 20 local radio
stations in operation by September 1970, with a further 20 becoming operational over
the next four years.

‘German Democratic Republic’, Austria and Switzerland; and the Overseas
Regional Service, providing programmes in English and French to North
America, in English to the Caribbean and the Falkland Islands, and in Maltese
to Malta.
The Programme Division includes the External Services News Department,
which produces more than 150 news bulletins daily; the Talks and Features
Department, which supplies talks and documentary programmes; and the
English by Radio and Television Department, which broadcasts some 230
programmes of English lessons weekly, with explanations in 27 other
languages, and supplies recorded lessons to some 270 stations in 80 countries.
English by Television programmes, produced for teaching purposes, have
been shown in more than 50 countries.
In addition to the direct transmission, many programmes are produced and
recorded for distribution and sale to overseas radio stations. The Transcrip¬
tion Service, for instance, records nearly 500 hours of sound programmes
annually, and the Topical Tapes Service produces 16 weekly programme
series which are sent to more than 60 subscribing stations.
Another part of the external services is the Monitoring Service which
listens to and reports on foreign broadcasts. It works in collaboration with its
United States counterpart under an exchange agreement which gives virtually
world-wide coverage, and thus makes available speedy and accurate reports
or significant news and comment from overseas to the BBC, the Press, and
government departments.
Programme links, both permanent and temporary, are generally rented by
the BBC from the Post Office, although some are provided by the BBC with
Post Office agreement. The operation and maintenance of the transmitting
stations from which its various programmes are sent out are, however, solely
a BBC responsibility. For the domestic sound services there are 69 medium-
and long-wave transmitters in normal programme service at 45 transmitting
stations and 222 YHF transmitters at 73 stations, plus 9 VHF transmitters at
experimental local broadcasting stations. There are 105 television trans¬
mitting stations in use for BBC 1 and 40 for BBC 2. In addition, 68 trans¬
mitters are used for external broadcasting, 44 of which are in the United
Kingdom and 24 overseas for relay purposes—the latest of which is a new
medium-wave transmitter on the island of Masirah off the coast of Muscat
and Oman, which will greatly improve the reception of the Arabic, Persian and
world (in English) services between Saudi-Arabia and the Indian sub-continent.
For its domestic sound programmes, the BBC uses 151 studios, of which
60 are in London and 91 at various centres in the regional areas. The external
services use 44 London studios. In addition, there are 40 semi-automatic
studios which can be operated by programme officials without engineering
staff. BBC television productions come from main studios at the Television
Centre in west London and other studios in various parts of London, and
from fully equipped regional studios at Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff,
Glasgow and Manchester. A number of small interview studios have, in
addition, been established throughout the country. The Television Film
Department of the BBC is housed at the Ealing Film Studio, and television
news and newsreel programmes originate from Alexandra Palace, London.
Outside broadcasting is covered by a number of mobile units.

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The first regular independent television (ITV) service was inaugurated in
x955 ^ a programme transmission from the ITA London station at Croydon.
Programmes are now transmitted on 405 lines on VHF from 32 stations
throughout Britain reaching more than 98 per cent of the population—
programme links being provided by the Post Office. From 15th November
1969, duplicate ITV programmes with colour will be introduced on 625 lines
on UHF in certain areas, to be followed in 1970 and 1971 with coverage of
further areas.
The main items broadcast in an average week by the programme companies
(which are subject to the same limitations on the number of broadcasting
hours as BBC 1) are films, entertainment programmes, plays and serials,
talks, discussions and documentaries, sport, and children’s and educational
programmes. More than one-third of viewing time is filled with ‘serious’
programmes.
Each programme company submits its quarterly programme schedule to
the ITA, and the ITA is also consulted about the content and timing of
individual programmes.
The programme companies broadcast for some 3,500 hours a year in each
region. Overseas sales of independent television programmes total about
16,000 a year.
Independent television programmes are produced at studio centres in Aber¬
deen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Carlisle, Dover, Glasgow, Leeds,
London, Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Plymouth, St. Helier, and
Southampton. The establishment of these studios is the direct result of the
ITA’s policy of encouraging the development of regional television, and the
programmes are designed for either local or national broadcasting.
Broadcasts on political issues include a daily factual and impartial account of
proceedings in Parliament, transmitted on BBC’s Radio 4 when Parliament
is in session, and weekly reports on the same subject broadcast on BBC 2 and
on ITN; and there is frequent coverage of political subjects in current affairs
programmes. Ministerial and party political broadcasts are also transmitted
from time to time under rules agreed between the major political parties,
the BBC and the ITA.
In 1968 experimental closed-circuit sound broadcasts of the proceedings
of both Houses of Parliament, and a three-day closed-circuit experiment of
televising the proceedings of the House of Lords, were carried out.
The BBC does not give publicity to any individual firm or organised interest
except when it is necessary to provide effective and informative programmes
under the terms of the Charter. It must not broadcast sponsored programmes
or, without the consent of the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications,
broadcast any matter for payment. Advertisements are broadcast on indepen¬
dent television subject to the relevant provisions in the Television Act, in
particular that there should be no sponsoring of programmes by advertisers,
that all advertisements should be clearly distinguishable as such and
recognisably separate from the programme, and the amount of time given to
advertising should not be so great as to detract from the value of the pro¬
grammes as a medium of information, education and entertainment. The
ITA has drawn up a code governing standards and practice in advertising,
giving guidance about the types and methods of advertisement that may not
be used. Certain types of advertising are prohibited, notably that of cigarettes

(under a government ruling of 1965) and for betting. Advertisements may
not be inserted in certain types of programmes, for example, in broadcasts to
schools. The cost of inserting advertisements in the ITA service is borne by
the advertisers, who pay the programme companies for advertising time.
The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications is advised on the technical
aspects of television and VHF sound broadcasting by the Television Advisory
Committee, which consists of an independent chairman, the Director General
of the BBC, the Director General of the ITA, representatives from the radio
industry, independent members, and representatives of interested government
departments.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and
engineering staffs of the BBC, the ITA, the Post Office, the Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications, and the radio industry. Recent developments by the
BBC include: the electronic conversion of monochrome and colour television
pictures between the European and the American systems; the reproduction
of television pictures in slow motion; and the development of a sound-and-
vision system, which enables the television sound and picture to be carried
over a single 625-line vision circuit, and thus eliminates the operational
complexity and expense of a separate circuit for the sound.
The BBC and the ITA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The
union, whose administrative headquarters are in Geneva and technical centre
in Brussels, now has 28 full members among the broadcasting organisations in
Western Europe and nearly 50 associate members (mostly from outside
Europe, including the United States and many of the nations of the Common¬
wealth). It manages Eurovision; is responsible for the technical and admin¬
istrative arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes over
that network and for intercontinental satellite links; and it maintains a
technical monitoring station, where frequency measurements and other
observations on broadcasting stations are carried out.
Within the Commonwealth, where the range of broadcasting co-operation
is very wide, each national organisation extends to the others facilities, for
instance, in the use of studios, recording channels, and programme contribu¬
tions. The BBC, in addition, provides a large amount of technical aid,
particularly in staff training to Commonwealth broadcasting organisations,
and members of the BBC’s staff are seconded for service overseas. Co-opera¬
tion and mutual assistance between Commonwealth broadcasters is also
furthered by Commonwealth Broadcasting Conferences, the seventh of which
took place in New Zealand in 1968.
The BBC, Reuters, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation and the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation are
joint partners in Visnews Ltd., a Commonwealth and international newsfilm
agency which provides a daily service of international news on film for
television subscribers in 68 countries. The International Television Federa¬
tion (Intertel) whose members are broadcasting organisations from Canada,
Australia, the United States and the BBC produce high-quality information
programmes which are exchanged overseas. United Press International, a
television newsfilm agency, and Independent Television News jointly provide
an international service to television organisations via the Eurovision network
and by satellite.

44° BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Both the BBC and the independent television companies are associated
with the Centre for Educational Television Overseas (CETO) (see p. 165),
which helps education in developing countries through television. The centre
receives an annual grant from the Government of £70,000, but most of its
funds come from private sources, including the independent television com¬
panies. The BBC provides free technical and other facilities. Training in
television work is also provided for overseas trainees at the Thomson Centre,
in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a charitable trust. The
Ministry of Overseas Development spends about £100,000 annually on radio
and television training for overseas students in Britain.
The BBC and the ITA participate in the work of the International Tele¬
communication Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency
responsible for the regulation and control of all international telecommuni¬
cation services (including sound and television), for the allocation and
registration of all radio frequencies and, through its international consultative
committees, for the promotion and co-ordination of the international study of
technical problems in broadcasting. The BBC is also represented on the
United Kingdom Committee of the International Special Committee on
Radio Interference (CISPR).
Inter-continental Inter-continental television relays by means of communication satellites began
Television in 1962 when the first live programme exchanges between the United States
and Europe were made via Telstar, and have increased in range and scale as
synchronous satellites, which are stationary relative to the earth and thus
permit two-way transmissions, have been commissioned.
Direct links with other continents were achieved in 1964: between Europe
and Japan, and between Britain and Australia. In 1967 the first world-wide
television programme, containing live sequences from several countries in
Europe and Africa, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia and Japan,
was broadcast.
18 THE PRESS
The British press caters for all political views, different levels of education
and a wide range of interests. It is not subject to State control or censorship.
A \ ery large number of newspapers per person are sold in Britain every day,
and although there are relatively few national newspapers, some of them have
circulations comparable with the greatest in any other part of the world. Ten
of the national newspapers (five dailies and five Sundays) and one London
evening newspaper have circulations in the millions.
The high consumption of newspapers in Britain is partly due to the fact
that some people buy more than one newspaper each day, and partly to the
concentration of the population in a relatively small area and the highly
developed system of distribution, which means that the national newspapers
are available almost everywhere on the day of publication.
Britain imports just over half its newsprint requirements, about i| million
tons annually, while the rest is made from imported raw materials. The average
size of national morning newspapers varies between 13 and 26 pages, and that
of the Sunday newspapers between 27 and 38. The price of the national
mornings ranges from 5d. to 8d. and that of the national Sunday newspapers
from 6d. to is. od. In addition to their normal paging a few newspapers carry
regular weekly colour supplements. The Times issues an entirely separate
Business News section with every edition.
According to The Newspaper Press Directory1 133 daily and Sunday news¬
papers and 1,177 weekly newspapers are published in Britain. These figures
include certain specialised papers, the circulations of which are limited not
by region, but by interest; for instance, business newspapers, sporting news¬
papers, newspapers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other lands
resident in Britain, and religious newspapers.
Ownership Newspaper ownership in Britain is concentrated mainly in the hands of a
comparatively small number of large press groups, although some enterprises
are organised as limited liability companies and individual and partner
proprietorship survives. The six major newspaper and periodical publishers
are. International Publishing Corporation Limited; Associated Newspapers
Limited, Beaverbrook Newspapers Limited; the Thomson Organisation
Limited; United Newspapers Publications Limited and S. Pearson
Publishers Limited.
The large national newspaper and periodical publishers are major corpora¬
tions with diversified interests over the whole field of publishing and com¬
munications, and some have shares in the independent television contracting
companies. The International Publishing Corporation and the Thomson
Organisation Limited also have newspaper interests overseas.
Although pronounced views may be expressed in newspapers and their
political leanings may be obvious, they are financially independent of any
political party and not obliged to follow any specific party line.2 In order to
1 Changes in the number of newspapers occur constantly; figures are based on the
1909 edition of The Newspaper Press Directory.

society and is accepted as expressing the views of the Communist Party of Great Britain.
442 BRITAIN I970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
preserve their character and traditions, certain newspapers and periodicals
(including The Guardian and The Observer) are governed by arrangements
which vest ownership of the undertaking in trustees, or operate it in accord¬
ance with a deed of trust, or provide that the transfer of shares be in the hands
of trustees. Others have management arrangements intended to ensure the
authority and independence of the editors.
The trend towards concentration of newspaper ownership, which began in
the early nineteen hundreds and was accentuated after the second world war,
giving rise to some public concern lest press monopoly would affect freedom
of information, was studied by two Royal Commissions on the Press, one of
which reported in 1949 and the other in 1962. The results of the recommenda¬
tions of these Commissions included the establishment and reconstitution of
the Press Council; the provision in the Television Act 1963 which stipulates
that, if it appears to the Independent Television Authority at any time that
newspaper shareholdings in television programme companies have led or are
leading to results which are contrary to the public interest, the Authority may,
with the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telecommunications (formerly
the Postmaster General) notify the companies that their programmes may
cease to be transmitted; and the provision in the Monopolies and Mergers
Act 1965 which gives the Board of Trade powers to control the transfer of a
newspaper or newspaper assets to a newspaper proprietor whose newspapers
have an average daily circulation amounting, with that of the newspaper to be
taken over, to 500,000 or more copies, after (in some cases) the Board of Trade
has received a report from the Monopolies Commission (see p. 242).
Technological Technological advances in the newspaper industry include the introduction
Developments of web-offset lithography (which is often combined with photo-composition
and the use of the computer in the composing room) and facsimile
transmission.
The ‘National* Ten morning papers are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout
Press the British Isles, and there are seven national Sunday papers (see Table 38).
All the national dailies are produced in London, but those with big circulations
also print northern editions in Manchester, and the Daily Express has a Scottish
edition printed in Glasgow. The leading Scottish papers {The Scotsman and
The Glasgow Herald) have a considerable circulation outside Scotland. Each of
the (two) London evening papers has ownership affiliations with a national
daily, but both have their distinctive style, drawing their readership very
largely from people living in and around London.
The provincial newspapers of England and Wales (87 morning or evening
dailies and Sundays and 820 newspapers appearing once or twice a week)
provide mainly regional and local news. Some of the daily newspapers also
give extensive coverage to national affairs, and a number co-operate to
provide their own foreign news service. The leading provincial newspapers
have wide regional circulations; a few have nation-wide reputations.
Generally speaking, provincial evening newspapers are non-political, while
the morning newspapers are independent or conservative in outlook.
The total circulation of the provincial morning and evening papers is
estimated at about 8 million. Of the morning papers The Journal (Newcastle),
the Yorkshire Post (Leeds), the Northern Echo (Darlington) and the Western
Mail (Cardiff) have circulations of over 100,000 and two provincial Sunday
papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and the Sunday Mercury

figures of provincial evening papers start at about 25,000; most are in the
50,000-100,000 range; a few have circulations of over 400,000. Weekly
papers are mainly of local appeal; they are also a valuable medium for local
advertising. Most have circulations in the 8,000-35,000 range, but one or two
have much higher circulations—of up to 100,000.
The London local weeklies (151) include papers for every district in
Greater London. They are assembled mainly in groups of six to eight,
affiliated in some cases to larger groups.
Scotland has six morning, seven evening and two Sunday newspapers, in
addition to the Scottish editions of the Daily Express and Sunday Express.
The leading morning papers are The Glasgow Herald and The Scotsman,
published in Edinburgh. Others are: the Daily Record and the Noon Record,
published in Glasgow, the Courier and Advertiser, published in Dundee, and
the Press and Journal of Aberdeen. Evening papers include the Evening News
of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s Evening Times and Evening Citizen, Dundee’s
Evening Telegraph and Post, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily
Express and the Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail
and the Sunday Post.
Weekly newspapers published in Scotland number 155. The most widely
known is the People's Journal, which has many local editions.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening paper and one
Sunday paper, all published in Belfast: they are The News-Letter (Unionist)
and the Irish News (Nationalist), the evening Belfast Telegraph and the
Sunday News. There are 42 weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland, with
circulations ranging from about 5,000 to over 25,000. The majority are
published by individual companies.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in
Cardiff; it circulates mainly in southern Wales. In North Wales the Liverpool
Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening papers
published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South Wales Argus,
Newport, and the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea. North Wales is served by
the Liverpool Echo and to a smaller extent by the Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (some 55 papers) includes the English language papers
(by far the largest category), some of which carry articles in Welsh; two
bilingual papers; and 11 papers in Welsh, of which five are denominational.
The Channel Islands have two daily (evening) papers (one in Guernsey and
one in Jersey), the Guernsey Star with morning and evening editions and a
Sunday paper [Island Sun) and two weeklies, which also circulate in Alderney
and Sark. The Isle of Man Times is issued from Mondays to Wednesdays with
a special weekly edition which is published on Friday: there are four other
weeklies.
There are over 4,100 periodical publications in Britain, classified as ‘general
and specialised’ and ‘trade, technical and professional’. There are also some
600 ‘house magazines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business houses
or public services for the benefit of their employees and/or clients.
General and specialised periodicals include magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals for all

denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, gardening,
hobbies, and humour; journals specialising in various subjects such as politics,
finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and the arts; and the
publications of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and
other associations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales in Britain are: Woman
(2,600,973); Woman's Own (2,046,993); Woman’s Weekly (1,762,200);
Woman's Realm (1,201,697); and Weekend (1,361,014); together with the
Radio Times (3,960,784) and TV Times (3,386,518). The leading journals of
opinion are The Economist (circulation 100,537), a politically independent
publication covering topics from a wider angle than its title implies; the
New Statesman (circulation 83,907), which is a review of politics, literature
and the arts with an independent socialist political tendency; the Spectator,
which covers much the same subjects from an independent conservative
standpoint; Tribune, which has a strongly left-wing but anti-communist bias;
New Society, which covers the sociological aspects of current affairs; and
New Scientist, which reports on the progress of science and technology in
terms which the non-specialist can understand. Punch (123,019), traditionally
the leading humorous periodical, has in recent years devoted increasing
attention to public affairs.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, generally speaking
appeal to the more serious type of reader.
Business magazines include technical, trade, export and professional and
semi-professional journals, the publication of which has become one of the
more important aspects of the British publishing industry. In addition to
circulating in Britain, these journals have a considerable circulation outside
the United Kingdom and are an important media for selling British goods
overseas. Their publication ranges in frequency from weekly to quarterly.
In addition to the circulation of periodicals published in England, a farming
weekly, the Welsh Farm News, and several monthly and quarterly journals
in both Welsh and English are produced in Wales.
Four monthly illustrated periodicals are published in Scotland: Scottish
Field, Scotland's Magazine, Scots Magazine and Scotland-, and two weeklies
devoted to farming interests: Farming News and Scottish Farmer. Among
literary journals, probably the most famous is Blackwood's, published in
Edinburgh. Numerous popular magazines are also published in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, weekly, monthly and quarterly publications cover
farming, the linen industry, building, motoring, politics and social work.
News Agencies There are three principal British news agencies:
Reuters Ltd. is a world news agency owned by the newspapers of the
United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand through the Newspaper
Publishers Association, the Press Association, the Australian Associated Press
and the New Zealand Press Association, and operated on a non-profit-making
basis under the terms of a deed of trust which guarantees the independence
and integrity of the news service and ensures that all profits are used to
develop it. Founded in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1850 and transferred to London
in 1851, Reuters has about 1,000 correspondents in 175 countries and
territories throughout the world, and links with 69 associated news agencies,
which give it access to coverage by many thousands of local reporters.
Between 600,000 and 700,000 words of news and Economic Services reports
are received in London every day from which regionalised news services,
44-6 BRITAIN I970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
specially tailored to the needs of recipients in the United Kingdom and eight
main overseas regions, are transmitted through an extensive private network
of communications to 124 countries, and are distributed to approximately
6,600 daily newspapers with an aggregate circulation of over 300 million, as
well as to radio and television networks feeding nearly 650 million sets.
Reuters Economic Services supply a comprehensive service of market prices
and financial reports to some 5,800 private subscribers throughout the world.
A computerised message-handling system is used to speed up the handling
and distribution of news.
The Press Association Ltd., the British national news agency founded in
1868, is co-operatively owned by the principal newspapers of the United
Kingdom outside London, and Eire. It provides newspapers, the broadcasting
organisations, Reuters (of which it is the principal owner) and other inter¬
national agencies with a complete service of home news, including general and
parliamentary news, legal reports, and all branches of financial, commercial
and sports news. Provincial papers are also supplied with the world news of
Reuters and the Associated Press. Through its Photographic Department the
Press Association serves London and provincial newspapers with a daily
picture service, including its own world photos and those of the Associated
Press. Its Special Services Department supplies reports of local or special
interest to daily and weekly trade papers and periodicals. All profits are used
to develop the service.
The Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd. (Extel), an independent news
agency founded in 1872, is a public company with over 1,000 shareholders,
which supplies financial and sporting news to newspapers and broadcasting
organisations. Racing services are also supplied by teleprinter and telephone
to subscribers in London and the provinces from offices in all important cities
and towns.
The Associated Press Ltd., which is the British operating company of the
Associated Press of America, supplies a world-wide overseas news service to
the British press and broadcasting organisations.
A number of other United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign agencies
and news services have offices in London, and there are agencies in other
cities, specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in the United Kingdom as
in some countries, but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
Training for The Industrial Training Board for the Printing and Publishing Industry
Journalism (which has 23 members—nine employers, nine employees and five from the
educational services) is responsible for overall training in the newspaper
industry. Under the Industrial Training Board the National Council for the
Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which represents the principal press organisa¬
tions, is the official training body for editorial staffs.
Training controlled by the NCTJ includes full-time courses of a year’s
duration for potential journalists of under 20 who have gained two passes at
the Advanced level of the General Certificate of Education, and a national
training scheme, compulsory for all junior entrants and in which adult
entrants also participate whenever possible, which consists of a six-month
probationary period followed by a three-year apprenticeship (two years for
graduates). During the apprenticeship, trainees combine on-the-job
experience with eight-week residential training courses at centres established
by the Council throughout Britain. There are now seven of these centres for
reporters (five in England, one in Wales, and one in Scotland) and one centre

for photographers. The syllabus covers practical journalism, shorthand,
English, law, government and current affairs, and at the end of their
apprenticeship trainees take a professional examination organised by the
Council. Specialist courses for senior journalists are also provided by the
centres and by the Council direct.
Other training developments include a university course in management,
sponsored by the Newspaper Publishers Association and the Newspaper
Society, at Warwick University.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Travelling Fellowship Scheme for
the training and education of young journalists throughout the Common¬
wealth, each year about eight journalists from overseas spend five months
in the United Kingdom; two months in the offices of newspapers or
periodicals and three months acquiring a general idea of life in Britain.
A limited number of travelling scholarships are also awarded to British
journalists to enable them to visit Commonwealth countries overseas.
The Thomson Foundation offers scholarships and organises training
courses at its Centre in Cardiff for journalists from all parts of the world,
and provides consultants and tutors for courses for journalists overseas.
The most important organisations to which employers in the industry belong
are the Newspaper Publishers Association, whose members publish national
newspapers in London and Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which
represents the regional and London suburban press; the Scottish Daily News¬
paper Society, which represents the interests of daily and Sunday newspapers
in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors Association, which repre¬
sents the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern
Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Publishers Association, whose
membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical
publications and general magazines. On the journalists side there are the
Institute of Journalists (loj), founded in 1884 as the National Association
of Journalists, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in 1907.
All practising journalists (including those engaged in radio, television, public
relations and freelance journalism) are eligible for membership of both these
organisations. In order to achieve joint working and prepare the ground for a
single organisation, an arrangement has been made for dual membership
without the payment of extra subscriptions. At the same time, to avoid over¬
lapping, different activities have been allocated to each organisation, the loj
being responsible for professional questions and the NUJ, primarily, for
industrial relations. Total membership is about 24,200 (NUJ about 22,000,
loj about 2,200).
The main aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are to sustain
the dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of
editors, to protect the rights and freedom of the press, and to improve the
education and training of journalists: the Guild has about 350 members. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong.
The Printing and Kindred Trades Federation is the federation of the printing
trade unions which include the National Graphical Association, the Society
of Graphical and Allied Trades, and the Scottish Typographical Association.
The Press Council, established in 1953 and reconstituted in 1963, has a lay
chairman and 25 members. Its aims are: to preserve the established freedom
448
The Press and
the Law
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the British press; to maintain the character of the British press in
accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep
under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of
public interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct
of the press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press; to
report on developments in the British press which may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly; to make representation on appropriate occasions
to the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to press organisations
abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodical reports recording its work,
and to review from time to time developments in the British press and the
factors affecting them. Reports, which include statistics of the newspaper and
periodical press and a series of articles examining the structure of the leading
press groups, are published annually.
The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say
what it likes provided it does not transgress the law; in general, it is at liberty
to comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments relating
directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers for postal purposes,
there are no specific press laws but certain statutes include clauses which
apply, in particular or incidentally, to the press. These relate to such matters
as the extent of newspaper ownership in television companies; the transfer
of newspaper assets (see p. 442); restrictions on newspaper reporting of
preliminary hearings of indictable offences (in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland); the right of press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local
authorities; restrictions on the publication of (a) divorce and domestic pro¬
ceedings in courts of law, (b) advertisement and investment circulars, which
are governed by Acts dealing with the publication of false or misleading
descriptions of goods and services and with fraud and (c) advertisements of
remedies for certain diseases, which are covered by public health legislation;
agreements between the Post Office and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic
communications, which must comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions
on certain types of prize competition; and copyrights, which come under
copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the work of the press are the laws on libel and
defamation; contempt of court—a newspaper may not publish comments
on the conduct of judicial proceedings which are likely to prejudice their
reputation for fairness before or during the actual proceedings nor may it
publish before or during a trial anything which might tend to influence the
result; and seditious libel, incitement to disaffection and revealing official
secrets.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the
majority of actions that do take place are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may all be
held responsible.
19 SPORT
Central and
Local
Government
Participation
In Britain, the word ‘sport’ is used generally to describe such activities as
organised outdoor games, athletics, field or country sports, indoor games and
sports, aquatic sports, and such popular pursuits as horse-racing, greyhound
racing, show jumping, riding, rock climbing, orienteering, motor racing, and
rifle shooting as well as those (for instance, archery, fencing, gliding and
skating) which, although less popular judged by the number of participants
and spectators, all have their own devotees. Those who engage in sport may be
professionals (that is, paid players) or amateurs.1 Professionals keep up the
technical standards of the sports in which they take part and spectators make
a vital contribution by their enthusiasm and their financial support; but the
sporting life of Britain derives its character principally from the amateur
element—people who devote time and energy to organising sport and to
teaching and training, as well as the many thousands of all ages who engage
in sport for pleasure alone.
The Government is not directly concerned with the organisation or promotion
of sport in Britain but it has assumed responsibility for providing encourage¬
ment, guidance and help; it gives financial aid to national and local voluntary
organisations towards approved expenditure on playing fields, swimming
baths and other facilities for physical recreation, and to national governing
bodies of sport in Great Britain towards the cost of their administration and
coaching schemes, participation in international events overseas and for the
holding of world championships and events of similar importance in Britain.
The Government is advised on matters relating to the development of
amateur sport and physical recreation by the Sports Council, whose members
serve in a voluntary capacity and are appointed for their wide experience of
all aspects of sport and recreation. The chairman of the Council is the Parlia¬
mentary Under-Secretary for Education and Science, who is the minister
with special responsibility for sport. Nine regional sports councils in England,
a sports council for Scotland and a sports council for Wales, bring together
representatives of local authorities, voluntary sports organisations and the
government departments principally concerned, to consider regional require¬
ments for facilities, to promote regional co-operation on planning and to
advise government departments on regional needs and priorities. In Northern
Ireland the Ministry of Education is advised by the Youth and Sports Council.
The Council works in close co-operation with the Central Council of
Physical Recreation, the National Playing Fields Association, the Scottish
equivalents of these bodies, and the British Olympic Association.
In 1968-69 direct government expenditure on sport in Great Britain
totalled some £2-3 million. This covered capital grants to national and local
voluntary organisations towards the provision of facilities, grants to national
voluntary organisations for administration, coaching and participation in
international events and grants for research projects sponsored by the Sports
Council. Local authorities also spend money on sports facilities, such

entirely amateur, but in other sports the distinction between professional and amateur
status is becoming less strictly defined.
45° BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
expenditure being taken into account in determining the aggregate amount of
Exchequer grant to local authorities under the rate support grant system
(see p. 72).
In Northern Ireland ^447,000 in grants was given to public authorities
and voluntary organisations for sports facilities and coaching schemes in 1968.
Facilities for The Secretary of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for
Sport Scotland and the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland require that
all publicly maintained schools shall provide for the physical education
(gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and swimming) of their pupils. Schools
in the national systems (excepting those solely for infants) must have their
own playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a
gymnasium and other amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and
halls designed for dance and movement, which local education authorities are
encouraged to make available to the public in the evenings, at week-ends, and
during the school holidays. Facilities for, and instruction in, many kinds of
sport are likewise provided at the independent preparatory and public schools
and at the universities (some of which have departments of physical educa¬
tion). Local authorities also provide playing fields, gymnasia, tennis courts,
golf courses, boating lakes, swimming baths and sports centres on an
increasing scale, and some arrange further education classes in various
physical education subjects. In addition, some larger industrial and commer¬
cial undertakings have developed sports facilities for their employees.
Composite
National Bodies
The Central
Council of Physical
Recreation
The national voluntary organisations most closely concerned with the general
development of sport are the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the
Scottish Council of Physical Recreation, and the National Playing Fields
Association. The British Olympic Association, whose main functions are
connected with the participation of British teams and competitors in the
Olympic Games, is also interested in all matters likely to benefit sport or
physical recreation in Britain as a whole. In addition, each sport has its own
governing body with, in many cases, entirely separate autonomous governing
bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR) whose membership
represents all national bodies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland con¬
cerned with the development of post-school physical recreation, provides the
Sports Council with such services as may be agreed in the administration,
technical and research fields. It receives grants from the Department of
Education and Science and from the Ministry of Education for Northern
Ireland. Its General Secretary is also the Director of the Sports Council.
The CCPR consists of about 300 members, over 200 of whom represent
national bodies concerned wholly or in part with the development of some
branch of physical recreation. The Council’s headquarters are in London and
it has nine regional offices in other parts of England. Its activities in Wales
are controlled by a representative Welsh committee, and in Northern Ireland
by a separate section with its own executive committee.
Broadly, the Council’s function is to promote all forms of physical
recreation. Its activities include the organisation of courses for coaches and
instructors, classes in personal performance, lectures, displays and other
publicity events. It runs, on average, about 2,000 courses for more than
40,000 people each year. Its staff give advisory, technical and administrative
help wherever required, but particularly to the headquarters, regional, county
and local branches of the constituent organisations and to local educational

authorities and industrial concerns. Its regional officers are the secretaries of
the regional sports councils.
The Scottish Council of Physical Recreation (SCPR) is the counterpart in
Scotland of the CCPR, and has 140 affiliated organisations, including the
governing bodies of all the Scottish sports; it receives a grant-in-aid from
the Scottish Education Department.
The main aim of the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA) is to
stimulate the provision of playing fields, playgrounds and sports centres by
publicity and technical and financial assistance. Since its inception in 1925
it has distributed over £1-83 million in the form of grants for playing field and
playground schemes and about £443,000 in the form of loans. It assists more
than 400 schemes a year.
The NPFA council is composed of representatives of the governing bodies
of various sports organisations, of the British Olympic Association and the
CCPR, and of a number of educational bodies, voluntary youth organisations,
physical education associations and local authorities. The national head¬
quarters in London employs a small full-time staff, including a technical and
research department which gives advice on all aspects of recreational
planning including the provision and layout of indoor and outdoor sports
facilities. Advice is also given on matters relating to the play and recreational
needs of children from their earliest years, and the establishment of play¬
grounds and play leadership schemes. The Association derives its funds
mainly from voluntary contributions but it also receives a small contribution
towards administrative costs from the Department of Education and Science.
The NPFA has branches in Scotland and Northern Ireland; there are also
branches in nearly every English and Welsh county; administration is carried
out, in the main, on a voluntary basis—in many cases in association with a
local authority or Rural Community Council.
There are five National Sports Centres in Britain, outside London—two in
England, one in Wales and two in Scotland—administered by the CCPR
and the SCPR with the help of government grants. The centres, some of
which were established by voluntary funds, provide a wide range of courses
for coaches, instructors and performers in many games, sports and other
physical activities. A National Sailing Centre has recently been established
at Cowes, Isle of Wight, with a grant from the Department of Education and
Science. This centre, which is also administered by the CCPR, provides
courses on sailing, boat handling, cruising, navigation, racing, boat main¬
tenance and boat building, for school and youth groups and for adults.
The Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London covers 36 acres; it
has a main stadium with seating for 12,000 spectators, a sports hall with
seating for 2,000 spectators, a swimming hall with pools of Olympic dimen¬
sions, a teaching pool and a gallery for 2,000 spectators, an indoor cricket
school, practice rooms suitable for all indoor activities, a hostel for 140
residents, and staff housing. These facilities, which are available for inter¬
national competitions as well as for the training of leaders, coaches and
performers, are managed by the CCPR and supported by grants from the
Greater London Council and the Department of Education and Science.
Outdoor games played in Britain include team games such as football,
cricket, and hockey, and games such as lawn tennis and golf, in which
individuals or couples match their skill. Judged by the number of participants
452
Football
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and spectators, the most popular of the team games are football and cricket;
the most popular of the individual games is lawn tennis.
Although football of a kind was played in the Middle Ages or even earlier,
as an organised game it dates from just over a century ago. One type of
football, in which only the feet are used, was adopted at Cambridge in 1848;
the other type, in which the ball is handled as well as kicked, was first played
at Rugby School, whence it derives its name, and was adopted by the
Blackheath football club in 1859.
In England the controlling body of the non-handling game, Association
Football1 (‘soccer’), is the Football Association (FA) formed in 1863. Its chief
function is to promote the interests of the game and to prevent infringement
of the agreed rules; it also arranges for the instruction of promising young
players (some £50,000 is spent annually on coaching); organises various
matches and competitions, including the international matches played by
England, the Amateur Cup competition, the FA Sunday Cup competition,
two national youth competitions, and the competition for its own leading
trophy, the Football Association Challenge Cup; and chooses and manages
English international teams. Over 350 clubs are registered with the FA, more
than 250 as full members and between no and 120 as associate members.
There are also some 31,000 clubs affiliated to county (that is, district or
regional) associations. The FA derives its main income from subscriptions
and admission charges to international and cup matches, and ploughs back a
large portion of the money into the game. Scotland, Northern Ireland and
Wales have their own controlling bodies: the Scottish Football Association,
the Irish Football Association and the Football Association of Wales.
The principal professional matches in England and Wales (played once or
twice weekly) are controlled by the Football League, which comprises 92
professional clubs in these countries. The funds of the League are derived
largely from contributions paid by member clubs in the form of a levy of
4 per cent of the net gate receipts from league matches, after allowable
expenses have been deducted; from annual payments from the leading
football pools promoters for the use of league fixture lists; and from television
rights.
In Scotland the Scottish Football League comprises 37 clubs; Northern
Ireland has its own League. Clubs belonging to the English and Scottish
Leagues are organised in divisions, the members of which compete against one
another for the respective league championships. Their positions in the
divisional tables are decided at the end of the season by the number of points
gained for wins or draws. During the season about 29 million people watch
Football League matches and gate receipts usually amount to between
£8 million and £8| million.
Several million people stake small weekly sums on the results of the league
matches by filling in what are known as ‘pools’ coupons. The odds against
winning anything in the pools are very great, but the prizes are high and
individual payments of £300,000 are occasionally made. The promoters
deduct varying amounts from the stakes for commission and expenses.
The annual competition for the FA Cup is organised on a knock-out basis
and the Cup Final is one of the most important football matches of the year
in England; it is always played at Wembley Stadium, near London, which
1 Recommendations on the organisation, management, finance and administration of
association football have been made in the report of a Committee on Football made to
the Secretary of State for Education and Science in 1968.

can accommodate some 100,000 spectators. The Scottish Cup Final is played
at Hampden Park, Glasgow. The matches between England, Scotland, Wales
and Ireland also excite great interest, as do other international matches.
There are many more amateur association football players than there are
professionals (the comparative figures are nearly 1 million amateurs, including
schoolboys and members of the armed forces, to 7,000 or 8,000 professionals),
but with one or two notable exceptions their teams cannot compete on equal
terms, since professional teams are more systematically and intensively
trained. Amateur teams compete against each other for the Football
Association Amateur Challenge Cup.
Rugby football (‘rugger’) is played according to two different sets of rules.
Rugby Union Football is played (in England) under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union, established in 1871. There are 15 players in a side. Inter¬
national matches between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and France are
played regularly at the leading rugby football grounds of each country,
including Twickenham, London—the headquarters of the Rugby Football
Union—and there are tours by international teams to and from New Zealand,
Australia and South Africa. Other important rugger matches are the county
championship competitions, the annual match between the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, the Hospitals’ Cup Final, and the Inter-Services
tournament. Membership of the Rugby Union is strictly confined to amateur
clubs of which there are over 1,600 in membership, with about 1,000 schools.
Rugby League Football—a 13-a-side game played by professionals as well
as amateurs—is played mostly in the north of England. The League, which
was instituted in 1895 and now has its headquarters at Leeds, regularly sends
touring teams to Australia and New Zealand and has annual international
games, professional and amateur, against France. The major match of the
season—the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final—has attracted crowds of
100,000 at Wembley Stadium in recent years.
Cricket is often called the English national game. It originated as a rustic
medieval pastime; by 1550 it is known to have been played by boys at
Guildford Grammar School, and after the Restoration it became fashionable
with the nobility, who competed with each other to sponsor matches for very
large sums of money. Among the many clubs founded in the eighteenth
century was the famous Hambledon Club in Hampshire, whose members
were cricket’s elite and supported the most brilliant players of the day. In 1787
the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in London and, assuming
responsibility for reframing the ‘Laws of Cricket’, became the governing body
of the game in Great Britain. Its first headquarters were at a ground on the
site of the present Dorset Square, rented by a Yorkshireman called Thomas
Lord, who gave his name to this and the two succeeding grounds. The second
ground, at which MCC was established from 1811 to 1813, was on the
perimeter of Regent’s Park. The present ground, at St. John’s Wood, was
opened in 1814.
Cricket in Britain is now governed by the MCC Cricket Council, made up
of representatives of MCC, the Test and County Board of Control (represent¬
ing first-class cricket) and the National Cricket Association (representing club
and junior cricket). MCC retains world-wide responsibility for the laws of
cricket.
The game is played in schools and universities, and most towns and villages,
as well as industrial sports clubs, have teams which play at least one match a
week from late April to early September. In the London area a large number
of pitches are provided by local authorities to augment those leased or owned

by clubs. In the Midlands and the north of England there is a network of
League cricket, contested by teams of Saturday afternoon players reinforced
by one or more professionals, often distinguished overseas players.
The focus of the season centres on a series of ‘Test matches’ played between
England and a touring team from overseas (or sometimes two teams). The
first of these matches was played in Melbourne between England and
Australia in 1877. Since then international tours have taken place regularly
between countries of Test status, who now number seven. The matches last
30 playing hours spread over five to six days and arouse great popular interest.
The principal grounds in England on which Test matches are played are
Lord’s; the Oval, Kennington, London, headquarters of Surrey County
Cricket Club; Old Trafford, Manchester; Trent Bridge, Nottingham;
Headingley, Leeds; and Edgbaston, Birmingham.
In addition to the Test matches a First Class County Championship,
decided on a points system, is played for by 17 counties, each playing 24
three-day matches. The counties not deemed first-class and second elevens of
the first-class counties play in a Minor Counties Championship. The Univer¬
sity Elevens of Oxford and Cambridge rank as first-class and play an annual
match at Lord’s. Since 1963 the counties have also competed in a single
innings knock-out competition for the Gillette Cricket Cup and in 1969 a
Sunday League was inaugurated.
Since 1963, the distinction between amateur and professional players in
county and Test cricket has been abolished. In 1968 the qualification rules
were relaxed to allow a limited number of top-class overseas cricketers to play
in the English county championships.
The forerunner of modern lawn tennis (the game known as/^M de paume) was
introduced into England from France in the fifteenth century and a ‘tennis
court’, built by Henry VIII, is still in use at Hampton Court. The modern
game, first played in England in 1873, quickly became very popular; in 1877
the words ‘and lawn tennis’ were added to the title of the All England Croquet
Club at Wimbledon, near London, and in the same year the first champion¬
ships were played. The Lawn Tennis Association, the controlling body of the
game in Britain, was founded in 1888. The governing body of the game in the
world (the International Lawn Tennis Federation, with headquarters in
London and Paris) was founded in 1913.
The number of people who play lawn tennis has greatly increased during
the present century, particularly since the game has spread to practically
every country in the world. In Britain the game is played in almost all girls’
schools and in very many boys’ schools where the pupils are of secondary
school age. It is also played on private courts, in parks and recreation grounds
and at several thousand tennis clubs.
The annual championships held at Wimbledon for two weeks at the end
of June and beginning of July are the main event of the lawn tennis season
in Britain and, in fact, in the world. These championships, in which men and
women of many nationalities compete, draw large crowds; there is accom¬
modation for over 30,000 spectators in the grounds of the All England Club—
14,000 can be accommodated round the centre court where the finals are
played. Other tournaments which attract a good deal of attention are: the
British Hardcourt Championships, the British Junior Championships, and
the County Championships. There are also competitions for boys’ and girls’
schools on a national basis. The most important international events are the
Davis Cup (for men) and the Federation Cup competition (for women).

Women players from Britain and the United States of America also compete
annually for the Wightman Cup.
Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, but it did not become really well known in the other
countries of the United Kingdom until towards the end of the nineteenth
century. Since then, however, it has gained steadily in popularity (particularly
since the mid-1950s); nowadays there are golf courses in the vicinity of many
towns and villages in all parts of Britain—some owned by local authorities,
but the majority owned by golf clubs—and the question of the game’s large
land requirements is being studied by the Department of Social and Economic
Research at the University of Glasgow. The headquarters of the Royal and
Ancient Golf Club is St. Andrews, Scotland.
The main event of the golfing year is the British Open Golf Championship,
which was first played in i860; other important matches include the Walker
Cup (for amateurs) and the Ryder Cup (for professionals), both played
between Britain and America; the Amateur Championship; the World
Amateur Team Championship; and the Ladies Championship.
Y ariants of hockey (as distinct from ice-hockey) have been played in Britain
for at least five centuries, and some, like hurley in Northern Ireland and Shinty
in Scotland, are still played extensively. Modern hockey, however, dates from
the formation (in 1886) of the Hockey Association of England. The Inter¬
national Hockey Rules Board, comprising the Association of England,
Scotland and Wales and the Irish Hockey Union, together with delegates from
the Federation Internationale de Hockey, representing the rest of the world,
controls the rules of the game. There are some 2,000 men’s hockey clubs
throughout Britain with at least 30,000 male adult players; some 600 boys’
schools also play the game. Although there are no professional county teams
and no cup ties in England, a county championship is held annually. In
Scotland there is a Scottish cup competition and six local league competitions
and the Welsh Hockey Association organise a Welsh cup competition.
Regular amateur international matches are also played. Men’s hockey is an
Olympic sport, and the arrangements for England and Scotland are in the
hands of the British Hockey Board.
The controlling bodies of women’s hockey are: the All England Women’s
Hockey Association (founded 1895) to which are affiliated some 900 clubs and
2,200 schools, representing a total membership of about 72,000 adults and
1 • 1 million schoolgirls; the Irish Ladies Hockey Union; the Scottish Women’s
Hockey Association; and the Welsh Women’s Hockey Association. The first
international women’s hockey match took place in 1896. Nowadays such a
match is played annually at Wembley Stadium (in addition to those played in
other parts of the country), where it attracts some 60,000 spectators.
Lacrosse, adapted from the game played by the Iroquois Indians of North
America, is played mainly by women—in girls’ schools, at lacrosse clubs, and
at universities. International matches are played, as well as regional matches,
by women’s teams representing the East, West, South, North and Midlands
of England, under the auspices of the All England Women’s Lacrosse
Association.
The men’s game, of which the controlling body is the English Lacrosse
Union, is played in ten universities, six teacher-training colleges, and by clubs
and schools, mainly in the London, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and
Nottingham areas. Matches played include county matches, an annual fixture

between the North of England and the South, and international matches
between Australia, America, Canada and England.
Netball is a popular game for girls and women. The controlling body is the
All England Netball Association to which are affiliated the English county
associations, the netball clubs of the three Women’s Services and sections of
the national youth and university organisations for girls and women. Inter¬
county and home international matches are played regularly and inter-
Commonwealth tours are arranged.
Polo, of which the earliest records are Persian, was first played by the British
in India, and brought to England in 1869. The governing body of British
polo is the Hurlingham Polo Association to which all the Commonwealth
polo associations and that of South Africa are affiliated. Polo players are a very
small section of the community, for the cost of keeping polo ponies is high.
However, many of the clubs now own trained ponies which are hired out to
members at moderate cost. There are about 375 players handicapped by the
Hurlingham Polo Association, but many less expert players take part in club
games for which they may be locally handicapped.
Public interest in polo has increased in recent years and large numbers of
spectators attend inter-club tournaments and matches between high-handicap
teams composed of players from several countries.
The game of bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century.
Nowadays the flat green game is regulated, as far as the English Bowling
Association is concerned, by the International Bowling Board (IBB), founded
in 1905. The Bowling Associations of Ireland, Scotland and Wales also come
under and play to the laws laid down by the IBB, but there are other bowling
associations in England—the English Bowling Federation, the Crown Green
Association and the English Women’s Bowling Association—which are not
under the IBB’s control.
During the summer bowls is played on bowling greens in the open; in
winter it is played on indoor greens, which are increasing in number. At one
time regarded as a pastime for the elderly, the game is now played by people
of all ages. Over 2,620 bowling clubs in England are affiliated to the English
Bowling Association alone. International, inter-county matches, and national
championship competitions of singles, pairs, triples and fours are played.
The popularity of mountaineering has greatly increased in recent years. The
number of clubs in the British Mountaineering Council (BMC) and the
Association of Scottish Climbing Clubs, the representative bodies of the sport,
is now over 190, ranging from national clubs, such as the Alpine Club (founded
in 1857, the oldest mountaineering club in the world) and the Scottish
Mountaineering Club, to small regional clubs with 20 to 30 members. A
number of local education authorities, as well as national bodies such as the
Central Council of Physical Recreation and the Outward Bound Trust,
have established mountaineering training centres in the hills. Training
courses are run jointly by the CCPR and BMC, the Youth Hostels Associa¬
tion and other bodies, and many universities and schools have mountaineering
sections. Membership of the known clubs is about 15,000 but several times this
number take part in climbing and mountaineering.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring most of the
great ranges of the world and in climbing their peaks; for example, the first
ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865, of Everest in 1953, and of Kangchenjunga
in 1955. In recent years frequent expeditions have gone to far off mountains,

to Greenland, Alaska, the Andes, Patagonia, the Caucasus and the Pamirs,
as well as the Himalayas.
Ski-ing in Scotland has become very popular, especially at the winter sports
centres established in the Cairngorms, Deeside, Glencoe and Glenshee,
where ski-runs equal to those in other areas of Europe have been developed,
and ski-lifts, ski-tows and professional instruction are now available. There
are, in addition, 24 artificial ski-slopes in other parts of Britain.
Amateur athletics, which include running (track, road and cross-country),
relay racing, jumping, hurdling, throwing and race-walking, are governed by
the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA), which was founded in 1880 to
encourage amateur athletics, to improve the management of amateur athletic
meetings by the establishment of uniform regulations, and to promote annual
championship meetings. The Association, whose membership increased
rapidly, is now organised from club to national level by honorary officers
and managed by representative members appointed by the Northern, Midland,
Southern and Welsh areas and by affiliated clubs and associations (amateur
athletic clubs, schools and youth organisations), of which there are hundreds
throughout England and Wales. The AAA administers a coaching scheme
under which eight full-time national coaches, working mainly in separate
regions, lecture, demonstrate and coach in schools, youth clubs, evening
institutes, training colleges and universities and at special courses organised
by the national associations, by regional associations or by the Central Council
of Physical Recreation. Some of the work of the national coaches is directly
concerned with coaching young athletes but their main duties are to instruct
men who wish to qualify as AAA coaches, over 1,600 of whom give
voluntary services in the counties and districts of England and Wales. Scotland
and Northern Ireland have their own amateur athletic associations, with
similar functions; there are also separate women’s AAAs for each country.
International athletics and the selection of teams representing the United
Kingdom are dealt with by the British Amateur Athletic Board, which is
composed of representatives of the three national associations for men and
of the Women’s Council, and is affiliated to the International Amateur
Athletic Federation.
Track meetings are held throughout Britain from April to October. The
main events in England and Wales are: the AAA championships for men
and international matches held in London; area and county championships;
and the universities, Services, business houses and schools championship
meetings. Clubs usually compete in cross-country running from October
to March, and county, area and national cross-country championships
are held.
Teams representing Britain compete in the Olympic Games (held every
four years) and separate teams representing England, Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games, held at four-yearly
intervals between the Olympic Games.
The Highland games are traditional gatherings of local people in the High¬
lands of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the
weight, and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions
take place. Among the better known Highland games are the Braemar
Gathering on Deeside (traditionally attended by the royal family), the
Argyllshire Gathering at Oban, and the meeting at Aboyne. The Highland

Country Sports

games are a unique spectacle which attracts large numbers of spectators from
all over the world.
The most popular country sports are hunting, shooting and fishing; these are
old-established sports with a long history, and they still play a considerable
part in the life of the countryside. The organisation which looks after their
interests is the British Field Sports Society.
In Britain hunting means primarily fox hunting on horseback with a pack of
hounds; but it also includes stag hunting, which preceded fox hunting and
still goes on, mainly in Devon and Somerset; hunting the hare, either on foot
with beagles or with harriers when the followers are mounted; and otter
hunting along the banks of rivers. Hunting depends not on right but on the
goodwill of small landowners and farmers, the majority of whom support
their local hunt by allowing it to ride over their property.
Fox hunting originated some 200 years ago. Originally a sport mainly for
the landed gentry and local farmers, it has gradually widened its appeal, in
spite of the fact that it is an expensive pastime for those who ride to hounds.
The sport is not without its critics, but an ever larger number of people,
including many townsmen, take a keen interest in it. Most hunts meet two
or three times a week and it is estimated that between 25,000 and 30,000 people
ride to hounds weekly, and many others follow in cars, on bicycles or on foot.
The fox hunting season proper starts in early November and lasts until April;
it is preceded by cub hunting, that is, the hunting of young foxes, when
young hounds are trained. At the end of the season most hunts organise
steeplechases, known as point-to-points, which are patronised by large
crowds.
There are 200 packs of hounds in England and Wales, 13 in Northern
Ireland, and 10 in Scotland. The packs range in size from the large establish¬
ments in the Midlands of England (for instance, the Belvoir, the Cottesmore,
the Quorn, and the Fernie) to small kennels in the west and north.
Hunts are financed mainly by the subscriptions of their members (£15 or
less to £50 or more), from ‘caps’ (contributions paid by non-subscribers), and
from the proceeds of such annual events as the point-to-point races and the
hunt ball. Sometimes the Master of Fox-hounds (MFH), who is in charge
of the hunt, bears a proportion of the cost.
Game shooting as an organised country sport may be said to date from the
early part of the nineteenth century; nowadays, game consists mainly of
grouse, partridge, pheasant, snipe and woodcock.
There is virtually no free shooting in any part of Britain. Firstly a shot gun
certificate, for which a fee is payable, must be obtained from the local chief
of police by anyone who possesses, purchases or acquires a shot gun1; and
secondly, nearly all game birds are to be found on privately owned land, shot
over either by the owner and his friends or by syndicates which have leased
the shooting. However, in some parts of the more remote countryside, rough
shooting may be enjoyed in a less formal way. Much of the country’s wild¬
fowling is controlled by the Wildfowling Association of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, through its numerous clubs.
1 A shot gun is defined in the Criminal Justice Act 1967 as ‘a smooth bore gun having
a barrel not less than 24 inches in length, not being an air-gun’. Shot guns with barrels
less than 24 inches long are subject to control under the Firearms Acts 1937 and 1965,
and a firearm certificate must be obtained from the police by anyone wishing to possess,
purchase or acquire them.

Grouse, partridge, pheasant and certain other birds are ‘preserved’: that
is to say, there is a ‘close season’ during which they are protected by law and
allowed to breed in security, often under the care of privately employed
gamekeepers on numerous estates. The grouse, partridge and pheasant
seasons open on 12th August, 1st September and 1st October, severally, and
last for between four and five months. Grouse shooting takes place mostly
in Scotland, northern England and North Wales; partridge and pheasant
shooting in nearly every county in England, Wales and Scotland, the former
mainly over farm land, and the latter in or near woodland; and wildfowling on
the marshes and fenlands of the coastal areas.
The Game Research Association, formed by landowners, farmers and others
interested in game conservation and research, collects and collates information
on a national scale and makes a detailed study of factors controlling game
population.
Deer stalking, which derives its name from the fact that, in order to get
an effective shot, a very cautious approach is needed (since red deer have a
keen scent, are far-sighted, and take alarm at the slightest sound), is mainly
a sport of the Highlands of Scotland. The deer are preserved in privately
owned ‘deer forests’, ranging in size from 9,000 to over 30,000 acres. The
close seasons in Scotland are October to June, inclusive, for stags and
February to October, inclusive, for hinds. In England and Wales, the close
seasons are May to July for stags, and March to October for hinds.
Fishing is the most popular of the country sports in that it is within the reach
of everyone in some form or another (from the small boy with his hook and
line to the experienced fly-fisherman), and that many more people fish in
their leisure hours than hunt or shoot.
The outstanding forms of the sport in Britain are salmon and trout fishing.
Trout streams are to be found in most parts of the country, and in Scotland
there are also many hundreds of lochs which provide good sport. Salmon
fishing may be enjoyed in England, North Wales and Northern Ireland,
but the best salmon rivers are to be found in Scotland. In England and
Wales the most widely practised form of fishing is for coarse fish such as
pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench, chub and bream, and the National
Federation of Anglers (NFA) had some 450,000 members in over 3,000 clubs
comprising 116 associations. Match angling—competitive fishing for coarse
fish by weight—is a feature of the many angling clubs affiliated to the NFA,
particularly in the Midlands and north of England. A national angling cham¬
pionship, composed of 112 teams of 12 anglers, is organised annually by the
NFA, and the NFA enters a team in the International Angling Competition.
Fishing around the coasts is another popular pastime, while deep-sea
fishing for tuna and shark has gained many adherents during the past 20 years.
Coastal and deep-sea fishing is free to all (except for salmon and sea trout
fishing in Scotland) but, as a rule, freshwater fishing has to be paid for and
local enquiries made about any permit or licence required. Most coarse
fishing is let to angling clubs; trout and salmon fishermen either rent a
stretch of river, join a club, stay at an hotel with its own fishing rights, or
pay for the right to fish by the day, week or month. The cost of salmon
fishing is often high.
Aquatic sports include rowing, sailing, swimming, canoeing, punting and
water ski-ing. The first three are the most commonly practised in Britain
and are included in the Olympic events and the Commonwealth Games.

Rowing

Swimming
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Rowing as a pastime is enjoyed by people from all sections of the community,
and as a sport it arouses considerable public interest. The two most popular
annual rowing events are the University Boat Race, which originated in 1820
and has been rowed annually on the Thames in the early spring since 1836;
and Henley Regatta, founded in 1839, which takes place each July at Henley-
on-Thames in Oxfordshire. The University Boat Race is between eight-oared
crews from Oxford and Cambridge over a course of some 4J miles between
Putney and Mortlake; it is watched by many thousands of rival supporters
gathered on both sides of the river. Considerable interest is also shown in
the Head of the River Race from Mortlake to Putney, in March, in which
more than 350 eights row in procession—the largest assembly of racing craft
in the world.
Crews from all over the world compete at Henley Regatta, where various
kinds of races are rowed over a straight course of 1 mile 550 yards; for
instance, for the Grand Challenge Cup, open to eight-oared crews from any
nation, the Silver Goblets for pair oars, the Diamond Sculls for single
scullers, the Ladies’ Challenge Plate open to crews from schools and colleges
and the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup for eights open to schools from
Britain and overseas. Many other riverside resorts arrange regattas every
summer.
The oldest annual event in the English racing calendar is Doggett’s Coat
and Badge, founded in 1716 and organised since by the Worshipful Company
of Fishmongers. Originally for professional watermen and limited to six
entrants, the race is now open to amateurs (who must, however, still be
apprentice watermen); if necessary, it may be rowed in heats. The course
is from London Bridge to Chelsea.
The art of oarsmanship is taught in many schools, universities and rowing
clubs, including women’s rowing clubs, throughout Britain; and women as
well as men compete in the European rowing championships. The Amateur
Rowing Association is the governing body of the sport in England and
Wales and the Scottish Amateur Rowing Association in Scotland.
Enthusiasts have always devoted much of their leisure to yachting on the
inland waters and round the coasts of Britain, but in recent years the sport,
and in particular small boat sailing, has greatly widened its appeal. The Royal
Yachting Association (RYA), the national governing body for both sail and
power yachting, has over 1,500 clubs and 30,000 personal members. The
RYA has approved sailing schools giving courses for novices, a National
Sailing Centre where instructors are coached and tested, and is responsible
for the selection of Great Britain’s Olympic team. One of the world’s main
regattas takes place from Cowes in the Isle of Wight annually during the first
week of August. Other major events are held throughout the year at such
sailing centres as Poole, Lowestoft, Harwich, Burnham on Crouch, Plymouth,
Falmouth and the Clyde. Inshore racing is subject to the rules of the Inter¬
national Yacht Racing Union, founded in 1907.
Off-shore, or ocean, racing is based on rating and measurement rules drawn
up by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, founded in 1925. Typical courses are:
Cowes to Jersey (Channel Islands), Plymouth to La Rochelle (Charente
Maritime, France) and Harwich to the Hook of Holland.
Many children in Britain learn to swim at school, or during holidays at the
seaside, and swimming as a summer pastime is enjoyed by millions of people.
The existence of indoor swimming baths makes all-the-year swimming
possible, and instruction and coaching is provided in some places by qualified

teachers who hold certificates for elementary or advanced teaching and coach¬
ing awarded by the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA). The objects of
the ASA are to promote the teaching and practice of swimming, diving and
water polo and to stimulate public opinion in favour of providing proper
accommodation and facilities for them; and to draw up, publish and enforce
uniform laws for the control and regulation of amateur swimming, diving and
water polo championships and competitions in England.
Racing is a term which, in Britain, is taken to mean, first and foremost,
horse-racing. Other forms of racing include greyhound racing, coursing,
pony-racing, trotting races, and pigeon flying.
The history of the English turf proper began with the formation of the
Jockey Club in 1750, although horse-racing was known in Tudor times and
even earlier. The Jockey Club, which controlled flat racing, and the National
Hunt Committee (founded in 1866), which controlled steeplechasing, amalga¬
mated as The Jockey Club in December 1968. This body exercises control
over all horse-racing in England and indirectly in many other countries, and
its rules are the basis of universal turf procedure.
Flat racing is carried on from late March till November, and steeplechasing
from August to June.
The classic races are: the Two Thousand Guineas for colts and fillies,
run at Newmarket; the One Thousand Guineas for fillies only, also run at
Newmarket; the Derby for colts and fillies and the Oaks for fillies only, both
run at Epsom; and the St. Leger for colts and fillies, run at Doncaster. The
Derby is the outstanding event in the racing calendar; it takes place annually
in late May or early June and the scene on Epsom Downs on Derby Day is
one of the most colourful and exciting of the sporting year. The most fashion¬
able race-meeting of the flat racing season is held on the course at Ascot in
Berkshire, in mid-June, and is known as ‘Royal Ascot’, being traditionally
attended by the Sovereign.
The most important steeplechase meeting is the National Hunt Festival
Meeting at Cheltenham in March. The best known single steeplechase is the
Grand National at Aintree, near Liverpool, run annually since 1839.
In England and Wales there is racing on 58 racecourses (excluding point-
to-point courses) and Scotland has six racecourses. There is a total of about
800 days’ racing annually. There are some 11,000 horses in training in Great
Britain, at an average cost of about £19 a week each.
Horse racecourses must be licensed by the Jockey Club. Facilities for cash
and credit betting are available on and off the racecourse, turnover being
subject to a government tax of 5 per cent. On-course facilities are provided by
bookmakers, who must have personal permits, and by totalisators operated
by the Horserace Totalisator Board, which is empowered to deduct from
money staked with the totalisator such percentage as it may determine.
Facilities for off-the-course betting are provided in licensed betting offices, of
which there are some 15,000 throughout Great Britain. People under 18 years
old are forbidden by law to place bets.
A levy from both bookmakers and the Horserace Totalisator Board is
collected by the Horserace Betting Levy Board, which distributes the revenue
for purposes conducive to the improvement of horse breeding and racing, and
for the advancement and encouragement of veterinary science and education.
The Horserace Betting Levy Board is also responsible for the work of the
National Stud at Newmarket, which concentrates on providing stallions for
British breeders.

Greyhound Racing
Riding
BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare started in Britain in 1926,
when the first modern greyhound track was opened at Belle Vue, Manchester.
There are now about 130 licensed tracks in operation, nearly all of which are
situated near large towns, and meetings are held two or three times a week.
The licensing authorities for greyhound racing tracks are the county and
county borough councils. Some 12 million people a year attend greyhound
racing, which is Britain’s second largest spectator sport.
The main authority of the sport is the National Greyhound Racing Club,
founded in 1928; its functions include drawing up the rules of greyhound
racing and keeping strict discipline over the sport. The 53 greyhound race¬
courses which accept the rules of the Club are the largest in the country and
account for approximately 92 per cent of the total attendance and totalisator
turnover. All are members of the National Greyhound Racing Society which
controls the general policies of greyhound racing, administers the affairs of,
and acts as spokesman for, the sport.
Greyhound racing can be conducted only at a licensed greyhound racecourse
on 104 racing days (chosen by the racecourse) in a licensed year (1st July-
30th June). There are some 10,500 greyhounds in training under the National
Greyhound Racing Club Rules, and average cost for their upkeep including
training is about £3 10s. a week.
Where a totalisator is operated at a greyhound racecourse, up to 6 per cent
(variable by regulation) of the money invested can be deducted for operational
expenses, and 5 per cent must be paid to the Government in respect of general
betting duty. Bookmakers are allowed to operate at a greyhound racecourse,
but are not permitted to bet on greyhound racing at totalisator odds unless
the consent of the occupiers of the tracks at which the totalisators are operated
is given.
The classic greyhound races are held at various racecourses in London, as
follows: the Gold Collar at Catford; the Greyhound National at the White
City; the Greyhound Derby at the White City; the Greyhound Oaks at
Harringay; the Scurry Gold Cup at Clapton; the Laurels at Wimbledon; the
St. Leger at Wembley; and the Cesarewitch at West Ham.
Interest in the art of horsemanship continues to increase rapidly, and many
more people have learned to enjoy riding as a pastime since the end of the
second world war than at any time since the advent of the motor car. There
are 200 riding schools inspected and approved by the British Horse Society,
membership of which has risen to over 13,000. There are over 260 riding
clubs with a total membership of over 16,000, and the Pony Club (open to
young people up to the age of 21 years) now has an overall membership of
about 75,000. There are over 1,000 branches of the Pony Club throughout the
world, of which 280 are in Britain.
The British Horse Society, as the National Equestrian Federation of Great
Britain, is the authority on all matters relating to horses and ponies, including
breeding, training, riding, show jumping, combined training and dressage,
and is responsible for preparing equestrian teams for the Olympic Games and
all international events. The Society, which runs the National Equestrian
Centre at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, is also the parent body of the Pony Club
and the riding clubs, and organises and provides tests, lectures, publications,
courses and examinations to promote horsemanship and horsemastership.
Horse trials are held throughout Britain during the spring and summer.
The three-day trials held each year—in April at Badminton, Gloucestershire,
in May at Tidworth, Hampshire, and in September at Burghley House,

Boxing

Lincolnshire—are among the outstanding equestrian events of the year.
These trials include dressage, cross-country riding, and showjumping; some
30 one-day trials on similar lines are held annually.
Show jumping competitions are held each year at over 800 shows. The
main events take place during the Royal International Horse Show (held at
the Wembley Stadium, under the auspices of the British Horse Society
towards the end of July)—the outstanding contest being the individual
jumping championship for the King George V Gold Cup. Jumping competi¬
tions are also a feature of the Horse of the Year Show, which takes place in
October at the Empire Pool, Wembley, and is acknowledged to be one of the
finest indoor horse shows in the world. The total membership of the British
Show Jumping Association has risen to over 8,000. The number of horses and
ponies registered is more than 6,000 and over ^150,000 is distributed annually
in prize money.
The selection of British riders and horses taking part in international
competitions (whose successes have materially contributed to the increased
popularity of show jumping) is the responsibility of the executive committee
of the Association.
Boxing as an English sport probably originated in Saxon times. Its modern
form, and the one that has been adopted in many overseas countries, dates
from 1865 when the Marquess of Queensbury drew up a set of rules which
eliminated much of the brutality that had hitherto characterised prize fighting,
and made the basis of the sport a trial of strength and skill.
Nowadays, many boys learn to box at school and in boys’ clubs, and there
are various amateur boxing competitions carried out according to the rules of
the Amateur Boxing Association (ABA), which controls all amateur boxing,
including schoolboy boxing, club and association boxing, and boxing in the
three Services.
Professional boxing is covered by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The Board has strict medical regulations which provide
for the examination of boxers before each contest, and the appointment of
inspectors to ensure that the regulations are observed and that all contests are
‘vetted’ to safeguard against over-matching and exploitation.
Championships at fixed weights have been the rule in boxing contests since
the presentation of the Championship Challenge Belts by the late Lord
Lonsdale in 1909. Those organised by the ABA are decided at ten weights:
flyweight, bantamweight, featherweight, lightweight, light welterweight,
welterweight, light middleweight, middleweight, light heavyweight and
heavyweight. In professional boxing two new weights—junior lightweight and
junior welterweight—were introduced in 1967.
Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world. The style most commonly
used in Britain is the ‘free’ style, which evolved from the Catch-as-Catch-Can
or Lancashire style, but Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling is still
practised in the north of England and in Scotland, and Cornish style wrestling
(in which the contestants wear rough canvas jackets by which all holds must
be taken) takes place in Cornwall. Wrestling in the free and Graeco-Roman
styles are used at the Olympic Games; in the Commonwealth Games only
free style is wrestled.
Amateur wrestling in Britain is governed by the British Amateur Wrestling
Association, which is affiliated to the International Amateur Wrestling
Federation, under the rules of which all wrestling is conducted. Professional

BRITAIN 1970: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
wrestling is usually in the ‘all-in’ or ‘free’ style, which is not the same as the
free style used in amateur wrestling.
Judo, an Olympic sport originating in Japan, has a large and growing follow¬
ing. In Britain it is governed by the British Judo Association, which is affiliated
to the International Judo Federation under the rules of which judo competi¬
tions are conducted. There are some 580 clubs in the Association, which has
coaching schemes assisted by the Department of Education and Science for
some 15,000 registered individual members.
Fencing as a sport has made considerable progress throughout Britain during
the past 20 years. The Amateur Fencing Association (founded 1902) has nearly
600 clubs, and many classes are organised and financed by local authorities.
Fencing is also practised in many schools, and among the annual champion¬
ships held under the auspices of the Association are the National Schoolboys’
and Schoolgirls’ Championships, organised on a regional basis and attracting
a large number of entrants.
Motor racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in Britain; more
racing and sports cars have been built in Britain than in any other country;
and British drivers (including women drivers) have an international reputation
second to none.
British cars and British drivers take part in the international rallies and
world classic races which are the main features of the sport. They include the
British classic races—the British Grand Prix and the Tourist Trophy for
sports cars. There are also many other British race meetings and rallies, as
well as several thousand day and night rallies and trials, endurance tests, hill
climbs and other events, arranged by various driving clubs, of which there
are over 800 in Great Britain.
The best-known motor racing circuits are those at Silverstone, Northamp¬
tonshire; Crystal Palace, London; Brands Hatch, Kent; Snetterton, Norfolk;
Mallory Park, Leicestershire; Oulton Park, Cheshire; Thruxton, Hampshire;
CadwellPark near Louth, Lincolnshire; Croft near Darlington, Co. Durham;
and Ingliston near Edinburgh, Scotland. The controlling body of motor
racing in Britain is the Royal Automobile Club (RAC), founded in 1897; the
RAC is represented on the Federation Internationale de I’Automobile, which
draws up the regulations for international motor racing. Go-kart racing also
comes under the jurisdiction of the RAC.
In addition to motor car racing, there are motor cycle races—the most
important contest of the year is for the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy—and
motor cycle speedway racing, introduced into Britain in 1928, and governed
by the Speedway Control Board.
The internationally recognised body for cycle racing in the United Kingdom
is the British Cycling Federation. It controls track and massed start road
racing in Britain, and is concerned with the cycling events in the Olympic
and Commonwealth Games and the annual world championship. Time trials
are organised by the Road Time Trials Council. The British Cycling
Federation is organising the 1970 World Cycling Championships, to be
held in Leicester.
Touring by bicycle is catered for by both the British Cycling Federation
and the Cyclists’ Touring Club (CTC). The CTC is the oldest touring club
in the world and has a membership of some 22,000. Its representatives in all

parts of the United Kingdom give advice and practical help to touring
cyclists; its 50 district associations arrange holiday and week-end tours and
competitions, rallies and rides of all kinds; and its travel department gives
CTC members every facility, both at home and abroad, including the pro¬
vision of itineraries. Other benefits provided are a touring magazine, legal
aid and third party insurance.
Full-bore (7-62 mm and -303 in) rifle and pistol shooting is organised by the
National Rifle Association (NRA), founded in i860. The Imperial Meeting
held annually at Bisley Camp, Surrey, is open to subjects of the Queen, and,
for certain competitions, to all-comers. The meeting, which is attended by
some 2,500 competitors from Britain and other Commonwealth countries,
including cadets from schools, lasts for just over a fortnight: the first week
consists of team and individual competitions for members of the armed forces,
and there are three days for schools only. The premier award of the meeting
is the Queen’s Prize, which attracts about 1,000 entries. The NRA also
organises postal matches for British and overseas teams, and periodically
sends rifle teams to shoot in overseas countries of the Commonwealth.
Small-bore (-22) rifle and pistol shooting—carried out either on indoor
ranges of 15 to 25 yards in length or on open ranges up to 200 yards—is also
widely practised in Britain. Some 4,000 clubs throughout the country are
affiliated to county rifle associations and the National Small-bore Rifle
Association (NSRA), which arranges inter-club and inter-county competitions
of various kinds for teams and individuals. The NSRA also organises a
National Bisley Meeting (usually attended by about 2,000 competitors), a
Scottish meeting (some 600 competitors), and the British Pistol Champion¬
ships (some 400 competitors) at Bisley. International small-bore rifle and
pistol matches are fired against teams from overseas countries, and British
teams are entered for the world championships and the competitions in the
Olympic Games.
Indoor games played in Britain include billiards, table tennis, and badminton,
which are enjoyed by large numbers of people, and for which facilities are
provided in social clubs of every kind, including youth clubs; and games
such as real tennis (a game which originated in thirteenth-century France),
squash rackets, rackets and fives, which are less national games than games of
the schools, universities and specialised clubs. Annual championships are
held in all these games, the controlling bodies of which are: the Billiards
Association and Control Council; the Badminton Association of England and
the Scottish Badminton Union; the Tennis, Rackets and Fives Association
and the Squash Rackets Association. Basket-ball, an indoor variant of netball
which originated in the United States of America, is also played in Britain
primarily by men. Matches in the game are included among the Olympic
events. The controlling body in Britain is the Amateur Basket Ball Association.
APPENDIX
CURRENCY
The unit of currency is the pound sterling (£), which is divided into 20 shillings
(s.). The shilling is divided into 12 pennies or pence (d.). Prices are sometimes
quoted in guineas, the guinea (an old coin no longer in circulation) being £1 Is.
Coins in common use are: penny, threepenny piece, sixpence, shilling,
two shilling piece (florin) and half-crown (2s. 6d.). Silver and cupro-nickel
coins (3d., 6d., Is., 2s., 2s. 6d., 5s.) are legal tender for payments up to £2;
nickel-brass threepenny pieces up to 2s.; and bronze (Id.) up to 12d. The
id. was demonetised from 1st August 1969 and the half-crown will be
demonetised on 1st January 1970.
Bank of England notes are issued in denominations of 10s., £1, £5, and £10.
Scottish banks issue £1, £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100 notes which are generally
accepted in Scotland and in some other parts of the United Kingdom. Northern
Ireland banks issue £1, £5, £10, £50 and £100 notes.
Decimal
Coinage
A decimal currency system is to be introduced in Britain on the 15th February
1971. It will be based on the pound sterling divided into 100 new pence. There
will be six denominations. Three coins will be in cupro-nickel: the 50 new pence
(a seven-sided coin) replacing the ten shilling note, and the 10 and 5 new pence
(equivalent to 2s. and Is. respectively); and three will be in bronze: the 2, 1 and
i new pence (equivalent to 4-8d., 2-4d. and l-2d. respectively). The 5 and
10 new penny coins, identical in value and general specification with the shilling
and florin, were brought into circulation in 1968. The introduction of decimal
currency is being supervised by a statutory body, the Decimal Currency Board.

records of the previous season and future prospects ; many weekly or monthly periodicals
on sport are also published. In addition some newspapers issue annual surveys of sport.
INDEX
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references.
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter rather than
under Association of, British, National, Royal, etc. (that is, Accidents, Royal Society for
the Prevention of; Archives, National Register of). In cases where the first word is not
separable, however (for example, Royal Air Force, Royal Society), entries will be found
appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only where
they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed under the
relevant subject headings.

BRITAIN 1970- published by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office - is the twenty-first official
handbook in the series prepared and revised each year by the Reference Division of the Central
Office of Information with the co-operation of other government departments and of many
national organisations. It is designed to answer questions about Britain which are continually
being asked both abroad and at home. This edition covers events up to September 1969.
