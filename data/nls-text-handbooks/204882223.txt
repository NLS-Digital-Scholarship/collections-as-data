Preface
Transport and travel is the theme running through
UK 2005, as well as being the subject of chapter 21.
Although this theme was inspired by a number of
notable events, records and anniversaries, the
movement of people and goods occurs on such a
scale it has profound consequences for every aspect
of life, including the environment, work and
leisure, as well as the economy.
The majority of people in employment travel to
work by car or van (62 per cent in England and
Wales in 2001). Far fewer commuters use public
transport (14 per cent) and 13 per cent either walk
or cycle. Over half of workers (58 per cent) travel
less than 10 kilometres to their place of work, and
only 5 per cent travel 40 kilometres or more.
Chapter 11 provides an overview of the labour
market.
The way children travel to school has changed
greatly over the past decade, with fewer walking
and more being driven. The average length of the
school journey has also increased from the early
1990s, from 2.0 to 2.6 kilometres for primary
schoolchildren, and from 4.5 to 4.8 kilometres for
children at secondary schools. Education and
training are key areas of government policy, which
are outlined in chapter 10.
More generally, travel by car, van or taxi is by far
the most common means of transport in the
United Kingdom, accounting for 85 per cent of
passenger mileage in Great Britain. In 2003, nearly
three quarters of households in the United
Kingdom had access to at least one car, while over
a quarter had access to two or more.
The first toll motorway, the M6 Toll, opened in
December 2003 to ease motorway congestion in
the West Midlands. The 43-kilometre expressway
cuts journey times around Birmingham by an
estimated 45 minutes. By August 2004 it had
reached its landmark 10 millionth customer,
triggering the end to introductory discounted
toll rates.
Vehicle-related thefts have fallen in recent years,
partly because of the more sophisticated security
measures now fitted to new cars. Vehicles aged
between 11 and 15 years are more likely to be
stolen than cars aged 3 years or less. Crime and
justice is covered in more depth in chapter 14.
In January 1904 the Motor Car Act brought in
the registration of vehicles, the number plate and
the driving licence. A hundred years later, the
Government introduced a ban on the use of
mobile phones while driving.
The rapid increase in the use of mobile phones was
one of the reasons why the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution (RNLI) had its busiest year in 2003.
Lifeboats were launched a record 8,901 times and
7,987 people were rescued. The increase is also a
result of changing patterns of sea use by the public
and improved search and rescue techniques. In
addition, the long hot summer of 2003 was the
fifth warmest in much of the United Kingdom
since records began in 1659. The climate and
physical geography of the United Kingdom is
covered in chapter 1 , while the work of charities
and volunteers are two of the many issues covered
in chapter 9.
Transport contributes about 25 per cent of carbon
dioxide (C02) emissions in the United Kingdom,
with road transport accounting for 85 per cent
of this. Cars are responsible for about half of all
transport emissions. Between 1970 and 2002
road traffic increased by 142 per cent and CO,
emissions attributable to road transport were 130
per cent higher in 2001 than in 1970. Chapter 19
looks at the UK environment and covers issues
concerning land and water, as well as air quality
and the atmosphere.
In the 2004 Public Spending Review the
Government introduced a number of measures
aimed at improving the efficiency of the transport
system while safeguarding the environment (see
chapter 23). Alternative forms of transport are also
being explored and the first UK fuel cell bus began
service in 2004. It runs on hydrogen and its only
emission is water vapour.
The first century of powered flight was celebrated
at the Royal Air Force Museum in Hendon with the
Milestones of Flight exhibition. Among the exhibits
were a Hawker Tempest V from the 1940s, a
Harrier GR3 from the 1960s, and a Eurofighter
Typhoon, which came into service in 2003.
v
Passenger-kilometres flown from UK airports have
more than doubled in recent years. The
Department for Transport forecasts that over the
next decade the number of air passengers will grow
by around 4 per cent a year and that freight will
grow by 7 per cent a year. UK airports handled
2.2 million tonnes of freight in 2003, over half
of which went through Heathrow.
The fastest commercial passenger aircraft,
Concorde, made its last passenger flight in
November 2003. Meanwhile, the longest
established air route in the United Kingdom,
between Southampton and Jersey, celebrated its
70th year in 2004. Southampton was also the site
of the launch of Queen Mary 2, the world’s biggest
and most expensive cruise liner, which set sail
on her maiden voyage to Fort Lauderdale in the
United States in January 2004. With 14 decks,
1,310 cabins, 14, bars and a brewery, she can carry
2,620 passengers.
Several railway anniversaries were celebrated
during 2004, the centrepiece being Railfest, a nine-
day festival at the National Railway Museum in
York. Pride of place was taken by the Flying
Scotsman, the first steam engine to achieve 100
mph (161 km/h), which the Railway Museum had
bought earlier in the year.
Many transport companies offer online booking
services and in 2002-03 over half of people
shopping online brought goods and services
connected with travel, accommodation or holidays.
Chapter 17 gives more information on the
Internet, communications and the media.
Mobile libraries are being upgraded to provide
computer and Internet access. Many people
without easy access to transport, especially in
isolated rural communities, rely on these to borrow
books and obtain information. There are over 660
mobile libraries in the United Kingdom, each
serving many local communities on a weekly,
fortnightly or monthly basis. A mobile library
carries about 3,500 items, including books and
videos for loan. Chapter 16 gives information
on libraries and archives, as well as some of the
cultural highlights of the past year.
In April 2004 The Queen made her fourth state
visit to France to mark the centenary of the signing
of the Entente Cordiale, which settled historic
disputes and paved the way for diplomatic and
military co-operation between the United
Kingdom and France at the beginning of the 20th
century. The Queen returned to France in June, to
join world leaders and thousands of veterans in
commemorating the 60th anniversary of D-Day,
when allied troops landed in France to start the
successful liberation of Europe. Chapter 7 covers
international relations, while chapter 8 looks at
defence.
Members of the Royal Family carry out about
3,000 official engagements a year in the United
Kingdom and overseas. Their expenditure on travel
in 2003/04 was £4.7 million. In the same period,
the Royal Train made 18 journeys, while RAF
aircraft were used for 334 hours for Royal flying
and helicopters for 389 hours. Chapter 6 gives
information on the UK Government and the
Monarchy, while the devolved administrations are
outlined in chapters 2 to 5.
A special form of travel associated with religion
(covered in chapter 15) is the pilgrimage. Each year
about 20,000 British Muslims travel to Makka
(Mecca) to perform the Hajj. Since 2000 a British
Hajj Delegation has travelled with them to provide
consular, pastoral and medical assistance. Back in
the United Kingdom, Walsingham, a place of
pilgrimage for both Anglicans and Catholics, was
voted the nation’s most spiritual place in 2003.
During 2003-04 several transport records were
broken. Balloonist David Hempleman-Adams, who
was partly the inspiration for our front cover, he
soared to over 40,000 feet (12,192 metres),
breaking the existing record of 35,626 feet (10,859
metres). Richard Branson broke the record for
crossing the English Channel in an amphibious
vehicle, reaching Calais in 1 hour 40 minutes and 6
seconds. The UK rail speed record was broken in
July 2003 when Eurostar reached 208 mph (335
km/h).
As well as transport, UK 2005 outlines government
policy and provides facts and figures on all aspects
of life in the United Kingdom, from the economy
(chapters 22 to 29) to social and cultural affairs;
and from housing, planning and regeneration
(chapter 20) to science and technology (chapter
25) and sport (chapter 18). UK2005 is also
available on www.statistics.gov.uk/yearbook.

Physical features 1 History of government 4
Climate 2 Channel Islands and Isle of Man 7
Population 3
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland (UK) was created by the Act of
Union 1800 and constitutes the greater part of the
British Isles, a group of islands lying off the north¬
west coast of Europe. The largest of the islands is
Great Britain, which comprises England, Wales
and Scotland. The next largest is Ireland,
comprising Northern Ireland, which is part of the
United Kingdom, and, in the south, the Republic
of Ireland.
North-west Scotland is fringed by two large island
chains, the Inner and Outer Hebrides. To the
north of the Scottish mainland are the Orkney and
Shetland Islands. These, along with the Isle of
Wight, Anglesey and the Isles of Scilly, have
administrative ties with the mainland. The Isle of
Man and the Channel Islands are not part of the
United Kingdom (see page 7).
Physical features
The oldest rocks, dating back 2.6 billion years,
are found in the Scottish Highlands and Outer
Hebrides. Metamorphic and igneous rocks are
widespread in Wales, the Lake District and
southern Scotland.
Devonian and Carboniferous strata in south-west
England have been intruded by granite. The largest
granite area is Dartmoor. Carboniferous limestone
forms the Mendip Hills, and part of the Pennine
chain in the Peak District and around Malham
Tarn in North Yorkshire. Deep valleys, such as the
Avon gorge, have cut into the limestone and rivers
commonly disappear underground where cave
networks have developed. The overlying millstone
grit of the Upper Carboniferous age makes up
much of the Pennines, with coal measures forming
the lower ground flanking the Pennine Hills. Coal
seams are also widespread in the Midlands, South
Wales and around Bristol.
Permian and Triassic rocks stretch from Devon
to north-west and north-east England, but are at
their widest across the Midlands, where the
sandstones are a major aquifer.1 Jurassic rocks are
dominated by limestone layers, extending from the
World Heritage coastline in Dorset, through the
Cotswolds and Northamptonshire into
Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. Many prominent
buildings in London, such as those in Whitehall,
are constructed from Jurassic limestone quarried
in Dorset.
Cretaceous chalk strata cover wide areas of
southern England, such as the South Downs,
where they are exposed in white cliffs at Beachy
Head and Dover. Younger strata, mainly soft
sandstones and clays, are found in east and south¬
east England and are associated with fertile
farmland.
On the Antrim coast in Northern Ireland is the
Giants Causeway. At this World Heritage site there
are almost 40,000 massive polygonal basalt
columns, formed around 60 million years ago
from slowly cooling volcanic rock intruded into
the surrounding chalk.
About 2 million years ago, ice sheets covered much
of the United Kingdom north of a line roughly
between the Bristol Channel and London. Glacial
erosion shaped landscapes in North Wales,
Cumbria, and much of upland Scotland. As the
glaciers melted, extensive areas of clay, sand and
gravel were deposited, almost entirely obscuring
the underlying bedrock of much of East Anglia.
England
England covers about two-thirds of the island
of Great Britain. It is mostly low hills and plains,
forming meadowlands and pastures. Uplands

of water.

include the Pennine chain, known as the ‘backbone
of England’, which splits northern England into
western and eastern sectors. The highest point is
Scafell Pike (977 metres) in the north west. The
north east includes the rugged landscape of the
Yorkshire moors, while the south west has the
upland moors of Dartmoor and Exmoor.
Wales
Wales is on the western side of Great Britain. It is
mountainous - around one-quarter is above 305
metres and in the north its highest peak, Snowdon
(Yr Wyddfa), rises to 1,085 metres. The Cambrian
Mountains run from north to south and to the
south are the Brecon Beacons, with flat, grassy
summits, and the steep-sided South Wales Valleys.
The Welsh coastline varies from estuaries to
sheltered bays, high cliffs, peninsulas, and marsh
and low-tide sandbanks.
Scotland
Scotland is located in the north of Great Britain.
The Scottish Lowlands and Borders are largely
areas of gentle hills and woodland, contrasting
dramatically with the rugged landscape of the
Highlands to the north. A striking physical feature
is the Great Glen, a geological fault, which cuts
across the central Highlands from Fort William on
the west coast for 97 kilometres north-east to
Inverness on the east coast. A string of lochs in
deep narrow basins is set between steep-sided
mountains that rise past forested foothills to high
moors and remote rocky mountains. Ben Nevis,
at 1,343 metres, is the highest point in the United
Kingdom. Scotland has about 790 islands, of
which some 130 are inhabited.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland’s north-east coast is separated
from Scotland by a stretch of water - the North
Channel - only 21 kilometres wide at its nearest
point. It has a 488-kilometre border with the
Republic of Ireland, forming the only UK land
boundary with another Member State of the
European Union. The landscape is mainly low hill
country. There are three mountainous areas: the
Mournes in the south east with Northern Ireland’s
highest point, Slieve Donard (852 metres); the
Sperrins in the north west; and the Antrim
Plateau, parallel to the north-east coast. Lough
Neagh is the largest freshwater lake in the United
Kingdom and one of the largest in Europe.

Climate
The climate is generally mild and temperate.
Prevailing weather systems move in from the
Atlantic, and the weather is mainly influenced by
depressions and their associated fronts moving
eastwards, punctuated by fine, settled, anticyclonic
periods lasting from a few days to several weeks.
The temperature rarely rises above 32°C or falls
below -10°C. The hottest day in 2003 was
10 August, with temperatures at Brogdale, near
Faversham, Kent, reaching a record 38.5°C. The
coldest night in 2003 was on 7/8 January, when
Aviemore in the Scottish Highlands recorded
a minimum of-18.6°C. There are four distinct
seasons: spring (roughly March to May); summer
(June to August); autumn (September to
November) and winter (December to February).
Rainfall is greatest in western and upland areas,
where the annual average exceeds 1,100
millimetres; the highest mountain areas receive

1 The United Kingdom
150th anniversary of the Met Office
The Met Office was set up in June 1854 to
provide information about the weather and sea
currents to the Royal Navy and the UK maritime
community. From its origins as a small
department in the former Board of Trade, it has
grown into a government agency employing
1,800 staff at over 40 UK locations and overseas.
It is also one of two World Area Forecast Centres,
providing weather information for all
international flights from the eastern North
Atlantic area to central Australia.
In 2004 the Met Office completed its move to
new headquarters in Exeter. The £80 million
building won Major Project of the Year and Best
Office Building of the Year in awards organised by
Building Services Journal and the Electrical and
Mechanical Contractor \n June 2004.
more than 2,000 millimetres. Over much of
lowland central England, annual rainfall ranges
from 700 to 850 millimetres. Parts of East Anglia
and the south east have the lowest rainfall, just
550 millimetres. Rain is fairly well distributed
throughout the year.
The length of the day varies throughout the year.
The relatively high latitude of Scotland means that
winter days there are very short, while summer
days are long, with an extended twilight. On the
longest day, 21 June, there is no complete darkness
in the north of Scotland and Lerwick, Shetland,
has about four hours more daylight (including
twilight) than London.
During May, June and July (the months of longest
daylight) the mean daily duration of sunshine
varies from five hours in northern Scotland to
eight hours in the Isle of Wight. During the
months of shortest daylight (November, December
and January) sunshine is at a minimum, with an
average of an hour a day in northern Scotland and
two hours a day on the south coast of England.
Population
The population of the United Kingdom at
mid-2003 was 59.6 million (Table 1.1). Official
projections, based on 2002 population estimates,
suggest that the population will reach 64.8 million
by 2031. Longer term projections suggest that the
population will peak around 2050 at over 65
million and then begin to fall (see page 100).
The population grew by 5.7 per cent between 1991
and 2003, partly a result of a greater number of
births than deaths, with migration an increasing
factor from the late 1990s (see page 103).
There are more people in the United Kingdom
aged over 60 (12.4 million) than there are children
under 16 (11.7 million). Northern Ireland has the
youngest population, with children under 16

History of government
Major events in the development of government in
the United Kingdom, together with a brief review of
early history, are described below. There is a list of
significant dates in appendix B (page 496).
‘Britain’ derives from Greek and Latin words that
probably stem from a Celtic original. Although in
the prehistoric timescale the Celts were relatively
late arrivals in the British Isles, UK recorded
history began with them. The term ‘Celtic’ is often
used rather generally to distinguish the early
inhabitants of the British Isles from the later
Anglo-Saxon invaders.
After two expeditions by Julius Caesar in 55 and
54 bc, contact between Great Britain and the
Roman world grew, culminating in the Roman
invasion of ad 43. Roman rule, which lasted until
about 409, gradually extended from south-east
England to Wales and, for a time, the lowlands of
Scotland.
England
When the Romans withdrew from Great Britain,
the lowland regions were invaded and settled by
Angles, Saxons and Jutes (tribes from what is now
north-western Germany). England takes its name
from the Angles. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were
small and numerous, but in time fewer, larger areas
of control developed. Eventually the southern
kingdom of Wessex became dominant, mainly
because of its leading role in resisting the Viking
invasions in the ninth century. Athelstan (reigned
924-39) used the title ‘King of all Britain’, and from
954 there was a single kingdom of England.
The last successful invasion of England took place
in 1066. Duke William of Normandy defeated the
English at the Battle of Hastings and became King
William I, known as ‘William the Conqueror’.
Many Normans and others from France came to
settle; French became the language of the ruling
classes for the next three centuries; and the legal
and social structures were influenced by those
across the Channel.
When Henry II, originally from Anjou, was king
(1154-89), his ‘Angevin empire’ stretched from the
river Tweed on the Scottish border, through much
of France to the Pyrenees. However, almost all of
the English Crown’s possessions in France were
lost during the late Middle Ages (c.1300-1400).
In 1215 a group of barons demanded a charter of
liberties as a safeguard against the arbitrary
behaviour of King John. The rebels captured
London and the King eventually agreed to their
demands. The resulting royal grant was the Magna
Carta. Among other things, the charter promised
that ‘To no one will we sell, to no one deny or
delay right or justice’. It established the important
constitutional principle that the power of the king
could be limited.
The Hundred Years War between England and
France began in 1337, leading to a period of high
taxation. In 1381 the introduction of a poll tax led
to the Peasants’ Revolt, the most significant
popular revolt in English history. The peasants
marched on London, executed ministers and won
promises of concessions, including the abolition of
serfdom, although Richard II went back on these
promises once the peasants had dispersed.
In 1485 Henry Tudor defeated Richard III at the
Battle of Bosworth Field and became Henry VII.
His son, Henry VIII, broke away from the Catholic
Church and founded the Church of England.
During his reign England and Wales were united.
The last of the Tudors, Elizabeth I, was childless.
She named James VI of Scotland as her successor,
thus uniting the monarchies of Scotland, England
and Wales when she died in 1603.
Civil War broke out in 1642. The capture and
execution of Charles I in 1649 changed the balance
of power between Monarch and Parliament. A
leading parliamentarian in the civil war was Oliver
Cromwell. He declared England a republic in 1649.
Appointed Lord Protector of the Commonwealth
from late 1653 until his death in 1658, Cromwell
had supreme legislative and executive power in
association with Parliament and the Council of
State; he was the only non-royal to hold this
position. The Monarchy was restored when
Charles II ascended the throne in 1660. In 1707
the Acts of Union united the English and Scottish
Parliaments and the Act of Union 1800 united
4
UK 2005
1 The United Kingdom
Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Parliamentary
reform was a recurrent issue in the 18th and 19th
centuries. The 1832 Reform Act began dismantling
the old parliamentary system and extending the
franchise. The Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884 gave
the vote to a gradually wider section of the
population. During the 20th century, the
Representation of the People Acts took the process
further. In 1918, women aged 30 or over who were
householders, householders’ wives or graduates
were enfranchised and in 1928 the Equal Franchise
Act extended the franchise to women aged 21 or
over, giving them the same voting rights as men.
Universal suffrage for all eligible people over 18
was granted in 1969 (see page 40).
Wales
Wales was a Celtic stronghold ruled by sovereign
princes under the influence of England after the
Romans left around 409. In 1282 Edward I
brought Wales under English rule; the castles he
built in the north remain among the finest UK
historic monuments. Edward Ts eldest son - later
Edward II - was born at Caernarvon in 1284 and
became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301.
The eldest son of the reigning monarch continues
to bear this title; Prince Charles was made Prince
of Wales in 1969.
At the beginning of the 15th century Welsh
resentment of unjust English laws and
administration, and widespread economic
discontent, resulted in the nationalist leader
Owain Glyndwr leading an unsuccessful revolt
against the English (see page 20). The Tudor
dynasty, which was of Welsh ancestry, ruled
England from 1485 to 1603 and during this period
the Acts of Union (1536 and 1542) united England
and Wales administratively, politically and legally.
This situation prevailed until July 1999, when
devolution created a National Assembly for Wales
with specific powers to make secondary legislation
to meet distinctive Welsh needs (see page 18).
Scotland
Evidence of human settlement in what is now
Scotland dates from about the third millennium
BC. By the time the Romans invaded Britain, many
tribes were living in the region and despite a
number of attempts to control them, Roman
rule never permanently extended to most of
Scotland.
Great Black Britons
Mary Seacole, a veteran nurse in the Crimean War
(see page 92), came first in an Internet poll of the
100 Great Black Britons. The poll highlighted the
contribution that Black people have made to UK
society since Roman times. The website for the
poll received more than 1 million hits and 10,000
people voted.
Born in 1805 in Jamaica to a Scottish father and
Jamaican mother, Mary Seacole came to England
in the 1850s. As a nurse, she volunteered to help
in the Crimean war. She was turned down, but
went to the Crimea independently and was
awarded a Crimean medal for her work.
Wilfred Wood, the first Black bishop, came
second in the poll. He was followed by Mary
Prince, the first Black female author to be
published; Olaudah Equiano, a former slave and
political activist; and Queen Philippa, the wife of
Edward III. George of Lydda, who became St
George, the patron saint of England, came 24th.
By the fifth century ad, the Scots, a Celtic people
from Ireland, had settled on the north-west coast
of Great Britain and a century later had formed
the kingdom of Dalriada. The political connection
with Ireland remained until the Battle of Mag
Rath in 637. The kingdom of Dalriada lasted until
the ninth century when Kenneth Mac Alpin
imposed authority over the Scots and their
neighbours and rivals, the Piets, to form a single
kingdom. He and his successors expanded into
traditionally independent territories and the
kingdom of Scotland was formed during the ninth
and tenth centuries.
The kingdoms of England and Scotland were
frequently at war during the Middle Ages
(c. 1000-1400). When Edward I tried to impose
direct English rule over Scotland in 1296, a revolt
for independence broke out, which ended in 1328
when Edward III recognised its leader, Robert the
Bruce, as King Robert I of Scotland.
The English and Scottish crowns were united in
1603 when James VI of Scotland succeeded
Elizabeth I. He became James I of England and
5
1 The United Kingdom
UK 2005
was the first of the Stuart kings. In 1745 Charles
Edward Stuart (also known as ‘Bonnie Prince
Charlie’ or ‘The Young Pretender’) attempted to
retake the throne for the Stuarts (it had passed to
the House of Hanover in 1714). He was eventually
defeated at the Battle of Culloden, north-east of
Inverness, in April 1746.
Politically, England and Scotland remained
separate during the 17th century, apart from a
period of union forced on them by Oliver
Cromwell in the 1650s. It was not until 1707 that
the English and Scottish Parliaments agreed on a
single Parliament for Great Britain to sit at
Westminster in London. Nearly 300 years later, in
July 1999, devolution meant that power to
administer Scottish affairs was returned to a new
Scottish Parliament (see page 25).
Northern Ireland
Henry II of England invaded Ireland in 1169. He
had been made overlord of Ireland by the English
Pope Adrian IV. Although Anglo-Norman
noblemen controlled part of the country during
the Middle Ages (c. 1000-1400), little direct
authority came from England.
During the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603)
there were several rebellions, particularly in the
northern province of Ulster. In 1607, after the
rebel leaders had been defeated, Protestant
immigrants from Scotland and England settled
there.
The English civil war (1642-51) coincided with
uprisings in Ireland, which Oliver Cromwell
suppressed. More fighting took place after the
overthrow of James II, a Roman Catholic, in 1688.
At the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, the Protestant
William of Orange (later William III) defeated
James II, who was trying to regain the English
throne from his base in Ireland.
In 1782 the Government in London gave the Irish
Parliament power to legislate on Irish affairs. Only
the Anglo-Irish minority were represented in this
Parliament. Following the unsuccessful rebellion of
Wolfe Tone’s United Irishmen movement in 1798,
Great Britain took back control of Ireland under
the Act of Union 1800. The Irish Parliament was
abolished in 1801; Irish interests were represented
by members sitting in both Houses of the
Westminster Parliament.
The question of ‘Home Rule’ for Ireland remained
one of the major issues of British politics. By 1910
the Liberal Government in London depended for
its political survival on support from the Irish
Parliamentary Party. The conflict deepened as
some unionists and nationalists in Ireland formed
private armies. In 1914 Home Rule was approved
in the Government of Ireland Act but
implementation was suspended because of the
First World War.
In 1916 a nationalist uprising in Dublin was put
down and its leaders executed. Two years later the
nationalist Sinn Fein party won a large majority
of the Irish seats in the General Election to the
Westminster Parliament. Its members refused to
attend the House of Commons and instead
formed their own assembly - the Dail Eireann - in
Dublin. In 1919 the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
began operations against the UK administration.
In 1920 a new Government of Ireland Act provided
for separate Parliaments in Northern and
Southern Ireland, subordinate to Westminster. The
Act was implemented in Northern Ireland in 1921,
giving six of the nine counties of the province of
Ulster their own Parliament with powers to
manage internal affairs. However, the Act was not
accepted in the South and the 26 counties of
Southern Ireland left the United Kingdom in 1922.
From 1921 until 1972 Northern Ireland had its
own Parliament. The unionists, primarily
representing the Protestant community, held
a permanent majority and formed the regional
government. The nationalist minority was
effectively excluded from political office and
influence. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the
civil rights movement and reactions to it resulted
in serious inter-communal rioting. The UK Army
was sent in to help the police keep law and order
in 1969.
Terrorism and violence continued to increase. In
1972, the UK Government decided to take back
direct responsibility for law and order. The
Northern Ireland Unionist Government resigned
in protest, the regional government was abolished
and direct rule from Westminster began; this was
to last until devolved powers were given back to a
Northern Ireland Assembly in December 1999 (see
page 32). The Northern Ireland Assembly and the
Executive has been suspended on a number of
occasions since 1999. The latest suspension was in
October 2002, because the UK Government
6
UK 2005
1 The United Kingdom
considered that it was not possible to hold
together an inclusive power-sharing Executive,
since the confidence within the community
necessary to underpin it had broken down.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
The Channel Islands (Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney and
Sark being the largest in the group) were part of the
Duchy of Normandy in the 10th and 11th centuries
and remained subject to the English Crown after the
loss of mainland Normandy to the French in 1204.
The Isle of Man was under the nominal sovereignty
of Norway until 1266, and eventually came under
the direct administration of the British Crown in
1765, when it was bought for £70,000.
Today these territories each have their own
legislative assemblies and systems of law, and their
own taxation systems. The UK Government is
responsible for their international relations and
external defence. The Isle of Man Parliament,
Tynwald, was established more than 1,000 years
ago and is the oldest legislature in continuous
existence in the world. It also has the distinction
of having three chambers: the House of Keys; the
Legislative Council; and the Tynwald Court, when
the House of Keys and the Legislative Council sit
together as a single chamber.
The United Kingdom is a member of the
European Union (EU - see page 67) but the
Channel Islands and Isle of Man are neither EU
Member States in their own right nor part of the
UK Member State. EU rules on the free movement
of goods and the Common Agricultural Policy
broadly apply to the Islands, but not those on the
free movement of services or persons. Islanders
benefit from the latter only if they have close ties
with the United Kingdom.

Population
England’s population in 2003 was 49.9 million
(Table 2.1), about 84 per cent of the population
of the United Kingdom. The most densely
populated areas are the major cities and
metropolitan areas of London and the South
East, South and West Yorkshire, Greater
Manchester and Merseyside, the West Midlands,
and the conurbations on the rivers Tyne, Wear
and Tees. London has the highest population
density with 4,699 people per square kilometre,
and the South West the lowest (210 people per
square kilometre).
Between 1991 and 2003 the population grew by
4.1 per cent. There were big variations between the
regions; the population in the North East fell by
1.8 per cent between 1991 and 2003, while the
population in London rose by 8.2 per cent during
the same period.

Representation at Westminster
and in Europe
There are 529 English parliamentary
constituencies represented in the Elouse of
Commons (Table 2.2). The Labour Party holds the
majority of seats and forms the Government. Its
traditional support comes mainly from the big
cities and areas associated with heavy industry,
but it also holds many seats that were once ‘safe’
Conservative constituencies. The Conservative
Party holds the second largest number of seats and
is the official Opposition. Conservative support is
traditionally strong in suburban and rural areas,
and the party has a large number of seats in
southern England. The Liberal Democrats,
traditionally strong in the South West, now have
over a third of their English seats in Greater
London and the South East.
In contrast to Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland (see chapters 3, 4 and 5), England has no
separate elected national body exclusively
responsible for its central administration. Instead
a number of government departments look after

England’s day-to-day administrative affairs (see
appendix A, page 481) and there is a network of
nine Government Offices for the Regions (GOs,
see page 12). However, in the longer term, the
Government is committed to providing for
directly elected regional assemblies in those
regions that want them (see page 13).
The House of Commons has a Standing
Committee1 on Regional Affairs, consisting of
13 Members of Parliament (MPs) from English
constituencies, reflecting party representation in
the House. Any other MP representing an English
constituency may take part in its proceedings, but
they may not make a motion, vote or be counted
in the quorum.
European Parliament elections
England is represented by 64 Members of the
European Parliament (MEPs), seven fewer MEPs
than before the enlargement of the European
Union in May 2004. In the European
parliamentary elections held in June 2004,
14.5 million people in England, 39 per cent of
the electorate, voted for an MEP (see Table 2.2).
All-postal voting was piloted in four of the English
regions: North East; North West; Yorkshire and
the Humber; and East Midlands (see page 41).
Turnout in all four regions was over 40 per cent,
the highest being the East Midlands (43.9 per
cent) and the lowest the West Midlands (36.6 per
cent). Voting is by the d'Hondt system of
proportional representation (see glossary).
Local government
The structure of local government in England
includes shire areas, which have a two-tier council
system, and metropolitan districts, unitary
authorities and London boroughs, which all have
a single-tier system (see map on page 10). London
boroughs, shire district councils, unitary
authorities and metropolitan districts are broken
down into electoral wards.
1 See page 49 for an explanation of Standing Committees.
Shire counties
Most of England is organised into shire areas with
two main tiers of local authority - 34 shire county
councils and 238 shire district councils covering
272 out of the 389 elected authorities. The county
councils are responsible for large-scale services in
their areas including education, strategic planning,
transport, highways, social services, fire services,
libraries and waste disposal. Each county council
area is subdivided into a number of district
councils, which are responsible for more local
matters including environmental health, housing,
local planning applications, local taxation, waste
collection, and leisure. Both tiers have powers to
provide facilities such as museums, art galleries
and parks; these arrangements depend on local
agreement. Shire areas also have a police authority,
made up of local councillors, magistrates and
independent members. Police authorities may
cover one or more counties.
Metropolitan district councils
The six metropolitan county areas in England -
Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire,
Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire
- have 36 district councils2 but no county councils.
The district councils are responsible for all services
in their areas apart from those that have a
statutory authority over areas wider than the
individual district. For example, the fire and police
services, public transport, and in some areas, waste
disposal services, are run by joint authorities that
include elected councillors nominated by each
district council.
Unitary authorities
There are 47 unitary authorities where the county
and district responsibilities are carried out by
a single tier of government. Unitary authorities
include some of the larger cities, the County of
Herefordshire, the Isle of Wight and the Isles of
Scilly. Unitary authorities do not have
responsibility for the police or the fire and rescue
services. These are administered by a police
authority and a fire authority usually made up of
local councillors, magistrates and independent
members, and covering a larger area than the
unitary authority.

boroughs or city councils.

Greater London
Greater London is made up of 32 boroughs and
the City of London, each with a council
responsible for most services in its area. The
strategic government of London is the
responsibility of the Greater London Authority
(GLA). This is made up of a directly elected Mayor
of London,3 a separately elected London
Assembly, and four functional bodies: the
Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA); the London
Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA);
Transport for London (TfL); and the London
Development Agency (LDA). In 2004/05 the
budget for the GLA and its four functional bodies
was £8.8 billion: £5.1 billion for TfL; £2.9 billion
for the MPA; £442 million for the LFEPA; £343
million for the LDA; and £73 million for the GLA.
3 Not to be confused with the Lord Mayor of London, who is the
head of the Corporation of London, the local authority for the
'City', also known as the 'Square Mile’.
10
UK 2005
2 England
The Mayor of London sets key strategies on a
range of London-wide issues, such as transport,
economic development, strategic and spatial
development and the environment. The London
Assembly scrutinises both the activities of the
Mayor and issues of concern to Londoners.
The first elections for the Mayor and the London
Assembly were held in May 2000. Subsequent
elections take place every four years (see box). If
there are three or more candidates, the Mayor is
elected using a system called Supplementary Vote
where voters can cast a first and second choice vote.
If there are two candidates, the Mayor is elected by
the first past the post system. There are 25 members
of the London Assembly: the London boroughs are
divided into 14 constituencies and each elects a
Member on a first past the post basis. A further
11 London-wide Members are elected using the
Additional Member System (see glossary).
Greater London elections
The second elections for the London Assembly
and the Mayor of London were held on 10 June
2004. Turnout was 36 per cent in both the
Assembly and the Mayoral elections. The Mayor
of London (Labour) was re-elected on a slightly
reduced share of the vote. In the Assembly, the
Conservative Party became the largest party,
winning nine seats.
Electoral wards/divisions
Metropolitan and shire districts, unitary
authorities and the London boroughs are divided
into electoral wards (or divisions in the Isle of
Wight), each having an average 23 wards/divisions.
These are the areas represented in local
government by the locally elected councillors, with
two or three councillors representing each ward.
The exception is the Isles of Scilly, which has its
own council but no electoral zoning. The shire
county councils use larger units, called electoral
divisions, to elect councillors.
Parishes
The smallest type of administrative area in
England is the parish. Parishes are confined within
local authority boundaries but are not contiguous

2004. The paper sets out four broad themes for
debate: leadership; citizen engagement; service
delivery; and the relationship between central,
regional and local government. As part of the
ten-year strategy, the Government published
Local Area Agreements: A Prospectus in July,
which sets out proposals to pilot local area
agreements. These include simplifying funding,
coordinating public services, devolving
decision-making, and reducing bureaucracy.
with electoral wards. In April 2003 there were
10,397 parishes in England.
Parish councils (sometimes called town councils)
represent community views and deliver local
services. They can provide facilities such as village
halls, war memorials, cemeteries, leisure facilities
and playgrounds. They maintain public footpaths
and may also spend money on cultural projects,
community transport initiatives and crime
prevention equipment. In addition they must be
notified of all planning applications and consulted
on the making of certain by-laws.
Not all parishes have a council - if there are fewer
than 200 parishioners, or if the parishioners do
not want one, decisions can instead be taken at
parish meetings. In some cases small parishes may
come together to elect a joint council.
Elections
Councillors are elected for four-year terms.
Whole council elections are held every four
years in all shire county councils in England,
borough councils in London, parish and town
councils, and the majority of shire district councils
and unitary authorities. The different categories
of councils hold these elections in different years
of the four-year cycle. Most of the remaining local
authorities, including the metropolitan districts,
elect one-third of their councillors in each of the
three years when county council elections are not
held. However, a few shire district councils and
metropolitan districts have started to hold biennial
elections with half of the councillors elected every
two years.

Local government elections
In June 2004, local elections were held in 144
local authorities in England with 59 being for
whole council, 79 being for one-third of the
council, and 6 for half the council. The Labour
Party won 1,773 seats, a net loss of 412 seats.
The Conservative Party won 1,605 seats, making
net gains of 248 seats, and the Liberal Democrats
won 1,131 seats, a net gain of 98 seats. Other
parties won 301 seats, a net gain of 15. All¬
postal voting was piloted (see page 41) in
four English regions: North East; North West;
Yorkshire and the Humber; and East Midlands.
Turnout in these regions was higher than at
previous local elections.
Finance
Local authorities spent £98 billion in 2001/02.
About 65 per cent of their income came from
central government and the remainder from
local sources, see page 61. Both revenue and
capital expenditure per head were highest in
the north and lowest in the south, with the
exception of London. Much of the variation in
revenue expenditure is due to different levels
of spending on social services and police.
London spent 53 per cent above the average for
social services and 79 per cent above the average
for police.
The regions of England
Nine Government Offices (GOs) are responsible
for coordinating central government programmes
at a regional level. They bring together the English
regional services for ten government departments:
the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM);
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI);
Department for Education and Skills (DIES);
Department for Work and Pensions; Department
of Health; Department for Transport; Home
Office; Department for Culture, Media and Sport
(DCMS); the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs (Defra); and the Cabinet Office.
The GOs also work with regional partners,
including local authorities and Regional
Development Agencies (RDAs - see page 13).
Distinctive facts about England

English law comprises 'common law' (ancient
custom and previous rulings in similar cases),
'statute law' (parliamentary and EC legislation)
and 'equity' (general principles of justice
correcting or adding to common or statute law).
The Church of England broke away from the
Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century.
There are some 500,000 listed buildings,
11 World Heritage Sites, 17,700 scheduled
monuments and 8,500 conservation areas in
England.
England has seven National Parks plus the
Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, which have
equivalent status. There are also 37 Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty covering some
15 per cent of England (see chapter 19).
The GOs directly manage spending programmes on
behalf of these departments. In 2002/03 they were
responsible for spending around £9 billion. They
oversee budgets and contracts delegated to regional
organisations, carry out regulatory functions and
sponsor the RDAs. The Regional Coordination Unit
manages the network of GOs and represents them
in Whitehall, ensuring that regional interests are
taken into account in the development and
evaluation of policy in central government.
Voluntary, multiparty regional chambers have
been established in each of the eight English
regions outside London. All of the chambers have
adopted the title ‘assembly’, although their
constitutions vary. They are primarily responsible
for scrutinising the work of the RDAs and, as the
designated regional planning bodies, for drawing
up regional spatial strategies.
Representatives of local authorities constitute up
to 70 per cent of the members of each regional
chamber. The remainder are people who work in
higher and further education, and representatives
from the Confederation of British Industry, the
12
UK 2005

Trades Union Congress, Chambers of Commerce,
small business, parish and town councils, the
National Health Service, rural and environment
groups, and other regional stakeholders.
Map 2.4 The regions of England
covered by the GOs and RDAs
Regional Development Agencies
There are nine RDAs in England - one for each
government region. They are accountable to the
Government, and are monitored by the GOs
and the voluntary regional chamber. Each RDA
has five statutory purposes:
■ to further economic development and
regeneration;
■ to promote business efficiency, investment
and competitiveness;
■ to promote employment;
■ to enhance the development and application
of skills relevant to employment; and
■ to contribute to sustainable development.
RDAs are financed by money from five
contributing departments - DTI (the lead
sponsoring department), ODPM, DfES, Defra and
DCMS. This money is available to spend as the
RDAs see fit, to achieve the regional priorities in
their economic strategies and the targets in their
corporate plans. RDA funding is tied to a
framework of targets and the GO monitors
progress every six months.
Funding is through a single funding programme,
known as the ‘single pot’. In 2004/05 the pot was
£1.8 billion. In the 2004 Spending Review, the
Government announced a package of measures
to promote economic development in the English
regions. Additional funds will be transferred to
the pot from the contributing government
departments and the RDAs’ budget will reach
£2.3 billion in 2007/08.
The increased funding will enable RDAs to take on
additional functions, including responsibility for
delivering Business Link services (see page 355)
from April 2005, and new responsibilities for
awarding research and development grants, and
promoting inward investment and collaborative
research between business and universities.
Proposals for devolution to the
English regions
The Government’s proposals for elected regional
assemblies for all English regions outside London
were set out in the White Paper, Your Region, Your
Choice: Revitalising the English Regions, published
in 2002. Elected assemblies would be broadly
similar to the Greater London Authority (see page
10) and would carry out functions largely drawn
Sustainable communities
In July 2003 the Government announced the first
of a series of updates to the Sustainable
Communities: Building for the Future plan that
was launched in February 2003. Making it
Happen - Thames Gateway and the Growth
Areas set out proposals for sustainable growth
and housing supply in the wider South East over
the next 15 years. The Thames Gateway is one of
four priority areas for the development of new
residential communities to help relieve housing
shortages in the South East.
In February 2004 the Government announced
proposals to improve infrastructure and
regenerate city areas to create jobs and economic
growth across the North of England and to
reduce disparities between the North and South.
Making it Happen - The Northern Way plans to
work with RDAs and regional planning bodies to
open up a 'Northern Growth Corridor' that will
include cities like Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester,
Newcastle and Sheffield.

Proposed responsibilities of elected
regional assemblies
A draft bill on the proposed powers and
responsibilities of regional assemblies was
published in July 2004. These included:
■ taking charge of the RDAs (see page 13);
■ working with local training organisations;
■ taking over much of the housing and
planning work carried out by the Housing
Corporation and the voluntary regional
chamber, and ensuring this was coordinated
with economic development and regeneration
strategies;
■ advising the Government on funding needed
for local transport, so that it can be integrated
with housing and planning developments;
■ setting the agenda for cultural activities by
taking charge of the regional cultural
consortium; and
■ promoting improved public health and
agreeing long-term action for sustainable
development in the region.
The assemblies would also take responsibility for
new regional fire authorities that are intended to
be large enough to deal with large-scale terrorist
incidents and environmental disasters.
from central government bodies such as the GOs,
and a number of public bodies that are already
operating in the regions.
The assemblies would represent geographical areas
based on the existing administrative boundaries
used by the GOs and RDAs. Assemblies would
have a membership of between 25 and 35,
depending on the size of the region. The assembly
members would appoint a leader and an executive.
Elections to the assembly would take place on a
proportional representation basis using the
Additional Member System (see glossary). This
should ensure that the overall composition broadly
reflects the votes cast for the different parties.
Most of each assembly’s money would come
through a single block grant from central
government, with the assembly deciding how it
should be spent to address regional priorities.
The English language
Modern English derives primarily from one of the
dialects of Old English (or Anglo-Saxon), itself
made up of several Western Germanic dialects
brought to Britain in the early fifth century. It
has been greatly influenced by other languages,
particularly Latin and, following the Norman
conquest, by French. It has also borrowed much
from other English-speaking countries, particularly
the United States and the Commonwealth
countries (see page 71). The 14th century saw
the first major English literature since Anglo-
Saxon days, with works such as Piers Plowman
by William Langland and the Canterbury Tales by
Geoffrey Chaucer.
There are about 375 million people speaking
English as their first language, with a similar
number speaking it as a second language. It is
the official language of air traffic control and
maritime communications; the leading language
of science, technology, commerce and computing
(the British Council estimate that 80 per cent of
the world's electronically stored information is in
English); and a major medium of education,
international negotiation, publishing, pop music
and advertising.
An elected assembly can only be established if a
majority of people in a region vote for one in a
referendum. The Regional Assemblies (Preparations)
Act 2003 gave the Government the power to hold
referendums in regions that register sufficient
interest. Following the first soundings exercise held
between December 2002 and June 2003, sufficient
interest was registered in three regions: North East;
North West; and Yorkshire and the Humber.
The Government directed the Boundary
Commission for England to carry out local
government reviews in these three regions. The
two-tier local authorities in regions that vote for
a regional assembly must be restructured into
unitary authorities to simplify relationships between
government at the local and regional level. People in
two-tier areas will be able to vote on which option
of unitary local government they prefer.
The reviews were completed by the end of May
2004. Once at least one region has voted for an
14
UK 2005
2 England
elected assembly, further legislation will be
introduced to provide for an assembly to be set up.
The first referendum is planned for the North East
in autumn 2004 and will be an all-postal ballot.
Economy
Some 25.0 million people were economically active
in England in spring 2004 of whom 23.9 million
were in employment. The unemployment rate for
England was 4.7 per cent, varying from 3.3 per
cent in the South West to 6.8 per cent in London.

Estimates of gross value added (GVA, see glossary,
Table 2.5, and Table 22.12, page 357 for UK GVA) at
current prices in 2002 increased in all English
regions. The rate of increase varied from the South
West, where GVA was 6.0 per cent higher than in
2001, to London, where it was 4.4 per cent higher.
Overall GVA growth in 2002 was 5.1 per cent in
England, the same as for the United Kingdom as a
whole. London had the highest GVA per head in
2002, at £20,000, while the North East had the lowest
at £11,800.
The North East has the smallest population of
the English regions. Over half the area is rural.
Economic activity is centred on the estuaries of
three rivers, the Tyne, the Wear and the Tees, and
was traditionally based on coal, steel and
shipbuilding. Manufacturing remains important
and accounted for 22 per cent of GVA in 2001.
The regional economy has diversified into
microelectronics, biotechnology and the automotive
industry, and there is a growing service sector,
which accounted for 67 per cent of GVA in 2001.
The North West has the largest production centre
for film and television outside London. Traditional
economic activities include shipping, textiles and
engineering, with manufacturing accounting for
22 per cent of GVA in 2001. New sectors include
biotechnology, chemicals, aerospace and information
and communications technology. The service
sector accounted for 69 per cent of GVA in 2001.
Yorkshire and the Humber’s traditional industries
of coal mining, steel, engineering and textiles have
generally declined, although manufacturing
accounted for 22 per cent of GVA in 2001. This
decline has been partly offset by a growth in
financial, legal and telephone-based services.
Service industries accounted for 68 per cent of
GVA in 2001.
Over 90 per cent rural, the East Midlands is the
second smallest region by population. Agriculture
and food processing remain important in the local
economy, while the manufacturing industries in
the former coalfield areas to the north of the
region are in decline. In 2001, manufacturing
accounted for 24 per cent of GVA. Areas of growth
include a diverse and growing service sector that
accounted for 65 per cent of GVA in 2001.
The West Midlands has large conurbations in
Birmingham, Solihull, Coventry and Stoke-on-
Trent, although about 80 per cent of the region is
rural. The service sector is growing, and accounted
for 67 per cent of GVA in 2001. Manufacturing
accounted for 23 per cent of GVA in 2001.
The East of England region’s businesses include food
and drink, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and the
film industry. The region has the leading UK science
parks in and around Cambridge, with many
businesses engaged in high-technology
manufacturing and computer-aided design. Service
industries accounted for 75 per cent of GVA in 2001,
while manufacturing accounted for 15 per cent.
In many ways, London is the most successful
region. It is the capital city and a major economy,
and its GVA per head in 2002 was almost 31 per
cent higher than the UK average. However, London
is also a city divided between extremes of wealth
and deprivation, with 20 per cent of its wards
among the 10 per cent most deprived in England.
15
2 England
UK 2005
Economic activity in the South East is closely
linked with London and the region’s proximity to
mainland Europe. At £148 billion, it had the
largest GVA in England in 2002. There is a strong
service sector, accounting for 78 per cent of the
region’s GVA in 2001, 30 per cent of which came
from real estate, renting and business activities.
Manufacturing accounted for 14 per cent of GVA.
The South West’s economy is varied. Alongside the
traditional areas of agriculture and fishing, food
and drink, and tourism, has been a growth in the
financial and business services sectors and
multimedia. Many manufacturing,
telecommunications and electronics industries are
situated in the M4/M5 corridor, the area around
two motorways linking the South West with
London/Birmingham and the North. The service
sector accounted for 71 per cent of the region’s
GVA in 2001, while manufacturing accounted for
18 per cent.
Between 2000 and 2006 three areas of England
qualified for EU Objective 1 funding (see page
358). Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly qualified for
£321 million, Merseyside £860 million and South
Yorkshire £757 million. All of the English regions
benefited from Objective 2 funding, totalling over
£2 billion. After 2006, Cornwall and the Isles of
Scilly will be the only part of England that
qualifies for Objective 1 funding.

International trade in goods
In 2003 exports of goods from England were £141
billion, while imports were £199 billion, giving an
international trade deficit in goods of £58 billion.
The largest overseas trade partner group was the
EU for both imports and exports (Figure 2.6),
with North America the second largest destination
for exports, and Asia and Oceania the second
largest source of imports. The largest sector was
machinery and transport (45 per cent of exports
and 42 per cent of imports), followed by chemicals
(19 per cent of exports and 12 per cent of
imports), and miscellaneous manufactures
(13 per cent and 18 per cent respectively).

Population
Wales (Cymru in Welsh) had a population of just
over 2.9 million in 2003 (Table 3.1), 4.9 per cent
of the total for the United Kingdom. The
population increased by 2.3 per cent between 1991
and 2003 with the Ceredigion local authority area
having the greatest increase (17 per cent). Merthyr
Tydfil had the largest population fall, losing 7 per
cent.
About two-thirds of the population live in the
southern valleys and the lower-lying coastal areas.
The highest population density was in Cardiff, the
capital, with 2,269 people per square kilometre.
Cardiff grew in the 19th century as a coal
exporting port. The two other large ports, Swansea
and Newport, also depended for their prosperity
on the surrounding mining and metal production
during the Industrial Revolution (1760s to 1830s).
They are still among the most densely populated
areas today. The least densely populated area in
2003 was Powys, with 25 people per square
kilometre.
An increasing proportion of residents in Wales
comes from outside its borders (a quarter in
2001), while 22 per cent of the 2.8 million people
in the United Kingdom who were born in Wales
were living in other parts of the United Kingdom
in 2001.
Representation at Westminster

Wales returns 40 Members of Parliament (MPs) to
the House of Commons at Westminster (see Table

are members of the House of Commons Welsh
Grand Committee. Its role is to consider Bills
referred to it at second reading stage, questions
tabled for oral answer, ministerial statements, and
other matters relating exclusively to Wales.
Following devolution in 1998, the UK
Government retains responsibility for certain
matters in Wales, including foreign affairs, defence,
the Constitution and overall economic policy (for
more details see appendix A, page 481).
Welsh interests are represented in the UK Cabinet
and the House of Commons by the Secretary of
State for Wales, who currently combines this role
with that of Leader of the House of Commons.
The Secretary of State for Wales also represents the
UK Government in Wales.
The Secretary of State ensures that the devolution
settlement operates in the best interests of Wales,
and brings forward primary legislation, deals with
constitutional issues, bids for the Assembly’s
budget and liaises with the Assembly. The Welsh
Budget is voted for by the UK Parliament and for
2004/05 is £11.9 billion, an increase of 6 per cent on
the previous year.
Ministers in the Wales Office sit on 27 Cabinet
committees and on the Joint Ministerial Committee,
allowing Welsh interests to be represented at a
detailed level within Government. They also liaise
regularly with members of the Assembly Cabinet.
The Wales Office is situated in the Department for
Constitutional Affairs.
The Public Audit (Wales) Bill, introduced in
November 2003, proposed to devolve powers to
scrutinise public spending in Wales. This was the
third all-Wales Bill since the establishment of the
National Assembly.
European Parliament elections
Wales forms a single constituency in the
European Parliament (see page 65). Following the
enlargement of the European Union (EU, see
page 71) in 2004, the number of Members of the
European Parliament (MEPs) representing Wales
was reduced from five to four.
In the European parliamentary elections on 10 June
2004, 928,775 people, 41.9 per cent of the
electorate in Wales, voted for an MEP (Table 3.2).
The Labour Party won two seats, and Plaid Cymru
- the Party of Wales and the Conservative Party
won one seat each. Voting is by the d'Hondt
system of proportional representation (see glossary).
National Assembly for Wales and
Welsh Assembly Government
Proposals to devolve certain powers and
responsibilities to a National Assembly were
narrowly endorsed by the Welsh people in 1997; of
those who voted, 50.3 per cent were in favour. First
elections for the National Assembly for Wales were
held in May 1999 and it began functioning as a
devolved administration two months later.
The National Assembly for Wales has powers to
make secondary legislation (see page 51) to meet
distinctive Welsh needs on issues that have been
devolved (see appendix A, page 491). Primary
legislation on Welsh affairs continues to be made in
the UK Parliament at Westminster (see page 48).
The National Assembly for Wales debates and
approves legislation. Its debating chamber and
18
UK 2005
3 Wales
members are located at Cardiff Bay. The Assembly
is also responsible for over 50 public bodies. The
Welsh Assembly Government develops and
implements policy. It is accountable to the
National Assembly and is primarily located in
Cathays Park, Cardiff.
There are plans to move a number of Assembly jobs
out of Cardiff to spread the economic benefits of
working for the Assembly across Wales. The
location strategy will be put in place over a number
of years. The first new offices are planned for
Merthyr Tydfil, to be opened in early 2006.
The North Wales Office should be opened in spring
2007 and the Mid Wales Office by the end of 2007.
The Assembly sits for a four-year term and elections
for the second term were held in May 2003. The
Labour Party again secured the highest share of
the vote and the highest number of seats. As a
result, it abandoned the coalition with the Liberal
Democrats that had been in place since 2000.
The overall turnout across regions and
constituencies in 2003 was 38.2 per cent, down
8 percentage points compared with the 1999
elections. Turnout was generally higher in Mid and
West Wales than in South Wales. Following the
2003 elections, the National Assembly is believed
to be the first legislative body in the world where
there are an equal number of male and female
members.
2004 Spending Review - Wales
In the 2004 Spending Review announced in July
2004, spending in Wales is set to grow by an
average annual rate of over 4 per cent in real
terms over the next three years. In 2004/05 the
Welsh departmental expenditure limit (DEL, see
page 366) was £11.0 billion, rising to
£11.8 billion in 2005/06, £12.8 billion in
2006/07 and £13.6 billion in 2007/08. There is
also £106 million for Objective 1 funding (see
pages 22 and 358) in 2004/05 and 2005/06.
There are 60 elected Assembly Members (AMs):
40 from local constituencies (with the same
boundaries as those for Welsh seats in the House
of Commons) and 20 regional members. The
Assembly is elected by the Additional Member
System of proportional representation. Under this
system, electors have two votes: one for a
constituency AM elected by the traditional first-
past-the-post system, and one to elect four AMs for
each of the five electoral regions using the d’Hondt
system (see glossary).
The Assembly Members delegate their executive
powers to the First Minister, who is elected by the
whole Assembly. The First Minister in turn delegates
responsibility for delivering executive functions to a
The Richard Commission
The Richard Commission was set up in 2002
to look at whether the Assembly has sufficient
powers to operate effectively and if its method of
election was suitable to the task. The main
recommendations of the Commission's report,
published in March 2004, were that:
■ the Assembly be given primary law-making
powers in devolved areas such as education and
health, along the lines of the powers of the
Scottish Parliament (see pages 25-27);
■ if these law-making powers were granted, the
number of AMs should be increased from 60
to 80;
■ powers should continue to be devolved from
Westminster; and
■ the existing closed party list system for selecting
AMs needed to be reformed.
The Assembly was considering these
recommendations and consulting with political
parties and the general public before holding
a debate at the start of the autumn 2004 session.
If the recommendations are accepted a new draft
Government of Wales Bill would need to be
introduced to the UK Parliament. Once this was
passed a referendum would have to be held before
the extra law-making powers could be granted.
If there was a yes vote in the referendum, the
Boundary Commission would need to carry out
constituency reviews for the new AMs. The earliest
the new system could be put in place would be in
time for the 2011 Assembly elections.

A long tradition
The first Welsh Parliament was held by Owain
Glyndwr in Machynlleth 600 years ago in 1404.
Glyndwr was the first Welsh leader to unite the
people of Wales to oppose the harsh English rule
of the time. By the end of 1403 he controlled
most of Wales. However, the English fought back
and by 1409 Harlech Castle, home to Glyndwr's
family, surrendered. Glyndwr remained elusive,
retreating into his heartland in central Wales. He
was never captured.
Cabinet of eight ministers, also Assembly Members.
The Ministers have responsibility for: finance, local
government and public services; government
business; social justice and regeneration; health
and social services; economic development and
transport; education and lifelong learning;
environment, planning and the countryside; and
culture, the Welsh language and sport. In autumn
2004, the Assembly will gain increased powers over
animal health and welfare. A new Veterinary Policy
Unit will be based in the Environment, Planning
and the Countryside Department.
Local government
The 22 Welsh unitary (single-tier) authorities
(see map below) had collective responsibility for
spending £3.4 billion, 31 per cent of the National
Assembly’s DEL (see Spending Review box on page
19) in 2004/05. The Assembly sets the policy
framework and makes the secondary legislation
within which local government operates. The
Assembly also has a responsibility to ensure that
local decision-making reflects the requirements of
the law and, where appropriate, priorities fixed by

the Assembly. Whole council elections are held
every fourth year, with the next due in 2008.
In 2003/04 local government was broadly financed
by government grants (53 per cent), a share of
non-domestic rates (14 per cent), rents and
charges (13 per cent), council tax (10 per cent),
and borrowing (8 per cent). Under the provisions
of the Local Government Act 2003 local authorities
will have greater freedom over the management of
their finances. The Act applies to Wales, as well as
to England, and the National Assembly was closely
involved with its drafting.
Local authorities spend about 40 per cent of
resources on education; 20 per cent on housing;
15 per cent on social services; 9 per cent on the
police; and 5 per cent on transport. The remaining
11 per cent of resources are spent on waste
management; the fire services; libraries and
archives, museums and art galleries; consumer
protection; environmental health; planning and
economic development; leisure and parks; and
environmental services.
As required by the Government of Wales Act, the
Assembly has set up a Partnership Council to
advise it on the exercise of any of its functions and
to make representations on matters affecting, or of
Local government elections 2004
Local councillors in Wales normally hold office for
four years and all unitary authorities elect their
members at the same time. However, local
government elections were put back a year from
May 2003 to May 2004 so that local government
elections and National Assembly elections were
not held at the same time. The National Assembly
later moved the revised date from May to June
2004 so that local government elections were
held on the same day as the European
parliamentary elections.
In the June 2004 elections the Labour Party won
478 seats, suffering a net loss of 64 seats. Plaid
Cymru - The Party of Wales won 172 seats, a net
loss of 28, while the Liberal Democrats and the
Conservative Party won 148 and 109 seats
respectively, making net gains of 37 and 40 seats.
The net gains and losses do not take into account
boundary changes.

The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff has a seating
capacity of 72,500 and a roof that can be fully
opened or closed within 20 minutes, making it an
all-weather venue for a variety of premier
sporting events, concerts, shows and exhibitions.
Rugby union is regarded as the Welsh national
game, although football has more participants
and a similarly high profile. Wales is well known
for its music, particularly choral singing, and has
a long tradition of literature. Special festivals,
known as eisteddfodau, encourage both literature
and music (see chapter 16).
The National Museum & Galleries (NMGW) claims
the finest collection of Impressionist and Post-
Impressionist paintings outside France. The six
NMGW sites across Wales attracted over
1.2 million visitors in 2003-04.
About 25 per cent of the land in Wales is in one of

Communities and community councils
Welsh unitary authorities are subdivided into

The Welsh language
Welsh is a Celtic language closely related to
Cornish and Breton. The language spoken today
comes from Early Welsh, which emerged as a
distinct tongue around the sixth century. The
National Assembly is committed to revitalising the
Welsh language and creating a bilingual Wales.
The 2001 Census revealed that 21 per cent of the
population of Wales aged three or over said they
could speak at least some Welsh, with similar
proportions able to read (20 per cent) and write
(18 per cent) Welsh, and 16 per cent revealing
that they had all these skills. For the first time,
the Census asked respondents about
understanding spoken Welsh; 24 per cent said
they could. The proportion of people with Welsh
language skills varied greatly by age, with the
highest proportions in the young (aged under 20)
and the old (aged over 75).
Welsh is a compulsory subject for all pupils
between the ages of 5 and 16 in mainstream
schools in Wales (see chapter 10) and 41 per cent
of children aged 5-15 years are able to speak
Welsh. Around 20 per cent of primary pupils and
14 per cent of secondary pupils are taught in
classes where Welsh is the medium of instruction
for all or part of the day. BBC Wales' Welsh
language website encourages learning Welsh
through a combination of soap episodes from
BBC Radio Wales, videos of the week's news, and
online lessons and help with grammar. In spring
2004, a computer magazine named it the best
online language teaching site on the Internet.
One of the best known Welsh language novelists,
Islwyn Ffowc Elis, died in Carmarthen in January
2004. Flis novels included Cysgod Y Cryman
{Shadow of the Sickle), published in 1953, which
was chosen as Welsh-language book of the 20th
century by the Arts Council of Wales.
themselves town councils. Community councillors
are unpaid. They have no statutory duties or
powers, but they have the statutory right to be
consulted on local planning issues and on council
decentralisation schemes.
Economy
The Welsh economy, which traditionally relied on
coal and steel, experienced major changes during
the 20th century. In recent years, Wales has
attracted a range of manufacturing industries,
with a significant number of investments by
overseas companies including many at the
forefront of technology.
There were 1.4 million people economically active
in Wales in spring 2004, of whom 1.3 million were
in employment. Unemployment, at 4.6 per cent,
was just below the UK rate of 4.8 per cent.
Gross value added (GVA, see glossary and
Table 22.12, page 357 for UK GVA) at current
prices in Wales was £35.1 billion in 2002,
3.9 per cent of UK GVA. GVA per head was
£12,000, lower than the UK GVA per head of
£15,300. Manufacturing accounted for 23 per cent
of Welsh GVA in 2001, while the service sector
accounted for 67 per cent.
The Welsh Assembly Government’s national
economic development strategy, A Winning Wales,
is a ten-year agenda to increase prosperity in Wales
so that it matches that of the United Kingdom as a
whole, and is evenly spread and sustainable. The
strategy is coordinated by the Economic
Development and Transport Department (EDT).
EDT administers schemes giving grants direct to
business in the form of Regional Selective
Assistance (see page 357) and the Assembly
Investment Grant, which both offer small grants to
small and medium-sized enterprises. It also
provides international trade support and advice
through WalesTrade International, which was
established in 2000. EDT works closely with the
Welsh Development Agency (WDA), the Wales
Tourist Board (WTB), and other public and
voluntary bodies.
The WDA was set up in 1976 to promote
economic development in Wales. In July 2004 it
was announced that the WDA is to be abolished
and its functions absorbed into those of the Welsh
Assembly Government. It has offices around the
world, and aims to attract companies to invest in
Wales. It also works with local communities to
encourage prosperity and is accountable to the
Welsh Assembly Government.

3 Wales
Wales has been allocated almost £1.5 billion of
funding from the EU for the period 2000-2006.
With matched funding from a range of public,
private and voluntary sources, the Structural
Funds Programmes are worth over £3.2 billion.
The largest of the programmes in Wales is the
£1.3 billion Objective 1 programme (see page 358)
covering West Wales, the south Wales valleys and
parts of north west Wales. This funding is
designed to promote growth in regions where
GDP is less than 75 per cent of the EU average.
In East Wales, Objective 2 funding aims to lift the
economy of rural areas and those hit by industrial
decline, and Objective 3 funding operates in all
areas outside of Objective 1, and aims to improve
systems for training and employment. By
December 2003, some 1,700 projects had been
approved.
The WTB was set up under the Development of
Tourism Act 1969 to promote Wales as a tourist
destination and to encourage and support the
development of tourist facilities and amenities. It
markets Wales throughout the United Kingdom
and in key overseas markets such as France,
Germany, The Netherlands, the Republic of
Ireland and the United States. Like the WDA, it is
accountable to the Welsh Assembly Government.
The WTB also provides business support services
and grant assistance for tourism businesses,
utilising EU Objective 1 funding in eligible areas.
During 2003/04, 279 projects received
£15.6 million in grants across Wales from various
WTB schemes. A further £3 million of Objective 1
funds have been approved for 2004-06. In
addition, the WTB received Objective 1 funds
worth £9 million for marketing projects, and
further funding worth £11 million has been
approved for 2004-06.
International trade in goods
In 2003, exports from Wales totalled £7.2 billion
and imports £5.5 billion. The largest overseas
trading partner was the EU (Figure 3.4). The three
largest sectors were machinery and transport (42
per cent of exports and 43 per cent of imports),
chemicals (20 per cent of exports and 12 per cent
of imports), and manufactured goods (19 per cent
and 21 per cent respectively).

Population
In mid-2003 the population of Scotland was
5.1 million, 8.5 per cent of the population of the
United Kingdom. The population density in
Scotland is the lowest in the United Kingdom,
averaging 65 people per square kilometre in 2003.
There is a wide difference between Scotland’s area
of highest population density, Glasgow City at 3,288
people per square kilometre, and the lowest in the
Eilean Siar and Highland council areas at 8 people
per square kilometre. Three-quarters of Scotland’s
population live in the central lowlands, where the
two largest cities are situated: the capital, Edinburgh
(population 448,000) in the east, and Glasgow
(population 577,000) in the west.
There has been a 0.5 per cent decline in population
over the past 12 years (Table 4.1), although there
was a slight rise in 2003. This was a result of more
people migrating to Scotland than moving away.
West Lothian had the largest proportional increase,
at 11.0 per cent, while Eilean Siar had the largest
decrease, falling by 11.0 per cent. In February 2004
the Scottish Executive launched the Fresh Talent
strategy (Scotlandistheplace.com) to reverse the
population decline by retaining native Scots and
attracting fresh talent from overseas. This includes:
■ granting visa extensions for overseas students
wishing to stay in Scotland after graduation;
■ prioritising work permit requests from
Scottish firms;
■ supporting universities to coordinate
recruitment of overseas students;
■ granting scholarships to combine
postgraduate study with work experience for
overseas students; and
■ a Relocation Advice Service to be operational
from October 2004.

Representation at Westminster
and in Europe
Scottish constituencies are represented by 72 of the
659 seats in the House of Commons at Westminster.
However, the Scotland Act 1998, which established
the Scottish Parliament and Executive (see below),
removed the statutory minimum of 71 Scottish
seats at Westminster and required the Boundary
Commission for Scotland to determine the level
of Scottish representation by applying the same
electoral quota as in England. Currently, there are
about 55,000 electors in a constituency in Scotland
and about 70,000 in England.
The Commission began its review of constituencies
in Scotland in 2001. Following consultation and
public inquiries, it published its recommendations
in December 2003 to reduce the number of Scottish
parliamentary constituencies to 59. The
Commission is required to make its final report
by December 2006. The Scottish Parliament
(Constituencies) Act 2004 was passed in July. This
removes the link between the constituencies for
the Scottish Parliament and those for the House of
Commons and allows the existing constituencies
to be retained for the Scottish Parliament when
the number of Scottish seats at Westminster is cut.
Following devolution the UK Parliament retained
exclusive jurisdiction over a number of issues as
‘reserved matters’ under the Scotland Act 1998.
These include foreign affairs, defence, the
Constitution and economic policy (for a more
detailed list see appendix A, page 481).
Scottish interests are represented in the UK
Cabinet and the House of Commons by the
Secretary of State for Scotland, who currently
combines this role with that of Secretary of State
for Transport. The Secretary of State is supported
by the Scotland Office, a distinct entity within the
Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). The
DCA also includes the Offices of the Advocate
General, who exercises statutory functions under
the Scotland Act 1998 and is the principal legal
adviser to the UK Government on Scots Law.
Scotland Office ministers are questioned regularly
in the House of Commons by Members of
Parliament (MPs) at Scottish questions.
The Scottish Affairs Committee1 is appointed by
the House of Commons to examine the

expenditure, administration and policy of the
Scotland Office, including relations with the
Scottish Parliament. Its 11 members come from all
the parties that have Members in the House of
Commons representing Scottish constituencies.
All MPs for Scottish constituencies are members
of the House of Commons Scottish Grand
Committee, which may be convened in Scotland
as well as at Westminster. Its business includes
questions tabled for oral answer, ministerial
statements, and debates that are referred to it.
European Parliament elections
Scotland forms a single constituency in the
European Parliament (see page 65). Following the
enlargement of the European Union (EU, see
page 71) in 2004, the number of Members of the
European Parliament (MEPs) representing
Scotland was reduced from eight to seven. In the
European parliamentary elections in June 2004,
1.18 million people, 31 per cent of the electorate
in Scotland, voted for an MEP (see Table 4.2)
using the d'Hondt system of proportional
representation (see glossary). The Scottish Labour
Party gained 26 per cent of the votes cast, the
Scottish National Party 20 per cent, the Scottish
Conservative and Unionist Party 18 per cent and
the Scottish Liberal Democrats 13 per cent.
The Scottish Executive has an office in Brussels
that helps to promote Scotland’s interests within
the EU.
The Scottish Parliament and
Scottish Executive
The first Scottish Parliament since 1707 was
elected in 1999. This followed a referendum in
1997, in which 74 per cent of those who voted
endorsed the UK Government’s proposals to
establish a Scottish Parliament and Executive to
administer Scottish affairs in areas to be devolved
to it. On a second question - whether to give the
new Parliament limited tax-varying powers -
64 per cent of those who voted were in favour. The
following November the Scotland Act 1998 passed
into law. The first Scottish Parliamentary elections
were held in May 1999 and the Parliament and
Executive took up their full powers on 1 July 1999.

The Scottish Parliament was initially based at the
Church of Scotland Assembly Hall in Edinburgh
while a new Parliament building, designed by
Enric Miralles, was built. This is based at
Holyrood, in the Royal Mile, where the Scottish
Parliament met from 1640 to 1707. Staff started
moving into the new building in August 2004 and
were joined by Members of the Scottish
Parliament (MSPs) in September, after the
summer recess. The Queen is due to perform the
official opening of the new building in October.
The Holyrood building was some three-and-a-half
years behind schedule and its estimated final cost
was £431 million, more then £320 million over
budget. An independent inquiry into the delays
and the cost, held under Lord Fraser of Carmyllie,
reported in September 2004. The Executive
accepted all the recommendations in the report.
The Scotland Act 1998 devolves to the Scottish
Parliament and ministers any matter not reserved
to the UK Parliament under Schedule 5 of the Act.
The Scottish Parliament can legislate in areas that
include: education, most health issues and most
aspects of home affairs, (see appendix A, page
491). In all devolved areas the Scottish Parliament
can amend or repeal existing Acts of the UK
Parliament as they apply in Scotland and pass new
legislation. During the 1999-2003 session, 62 Acts
were passed by the Scottish Parliament.
Unlike the Westminster Parliament, the Scottish
Parliament does not have a second chamber to
revise legislation that comes before it. Detailed
scrutiny of Bills is carried out in committees,
which take evidence from a variety of outside
sources, including interest groups and experts.
The Scottish Parliament’s 129 members (MSPs) are
elected for a fixed four-year term. The 73 single¬
member constituency seats are elected under the
first-past-the-post system. A further seven MSPs are
returned for each of eight Scottish Parliament
regions using the Additional Member System, a
type of proportional representation (see glossary).
Elections for the second Scottish Parliament were
held in May 2003. The turnout across regions and
constituencies was 49 per cent, compared with
59 per cent in the 1999 elections. The Scottish
Labour Party was again the largest single party in
the Scottish Parliament (Table 4.2).
As no party has an overall majority, the Scottish
Executive is formed by a coalition between the
Scottish Labour Party and the Scottish Liberal
Democrats. The latter has three ministers in the
Cabinet, including the position of Deputy First
Minister.
The Scottish Executive is the executive branch of
the devolved institutions and is accountable to the
Scottish Parliament. The devolved government is
led by the First Minister, an MSP who is nominated
by the Parliament. The First Minister appoints the
11 Cabinet Ministers (see appendix A).
Finance
Most of the funding for the Scottish Parliament
comes from the UK Parliament’s block grant.

The Scots Makar
Scotland's first national poet, Professor Edwin
Morgan, was appointed in February 2004 by
Scottish ministers. The national poet will be known
as the Scots Makar, a term dating back to Scottish
poets in the 15th century, and will represent and
promote Scots poetry. The 83-year-old writer was
appointed for a three-year period. Future Makars
will be selected by an independent committee.
Other sources of revenue include income from
business rates. The Scottish Parliament is solely
responsible for the allocation of the total Scottish
budget.
Under the Spending Review announced by the UK
Government in July 2004, the Scottish Executive’s
departmental expenditure limit (DEL, see page
366) is set to rise from £21.3 billion in 2004/05 to
£22.7 billion in 2005/06, and to £25.5 billion in
2007/08. The increases ensure that Scotland
receives a population-based share of changes in
comparable spending in England. Detailed
spending proposals for 2005/06 will be announced
in autumn 2004.
The Scottish Parliament has the power to increase
or decrease the basic rate of income tax in Scotland
- 22 pence in the pound - by a maximum of
3 pence. The Parliament did not exercise its right to
vary income tax in its first session.
Local government
Scotland’s 32 unitary (single-tier) authorities (see
map on page 28) are responsible for the full range
of local government services, including education,
social work, police and fire services, roads, public
transport, local planning, urban development,
housing, libraries, leisure and recreation. They can
either provide these services themselves or buy
them in. The planned budget for local government
for 2004/05 is £8 billion.
Although local authorities are independent and
manage their own day-to-day business, Scotland’s
First Minister has powers to oversee their work in
areas such as finance, town and country planning,
transport and housing.
Gaelic language and culture
Scottish Gaelic, a Celtic language related to Irish,
was introduced into Scotland in about ad 500.
According to the 2001 Census 1.2 per cent of the
population spoke Gaelic. In the Eilean Siar Council
Area, the number was as high as 60 per cent.
The Royal National Mod, Scotland's premier Gaelic
festival, is held each October, attracting visitors and
participants from around the world. The Feisean nan
Gaidhealalso celebrates Gaelic culture. Feis,
pronounced faysh (plural Feisean), is Gaelic for a
festival or feast. The Feis movement started in 1981
on Barra. By 2004 there were 37 Feisean in which
almost 4,000 young people participate. The
Hebridean Celtic Festival, staged in the grounds of
Lews Castle, Stornoway in mid-July, promotes Gaelic
language and culture within an international music
programme. With Glasgow's Celtic Connections, the
festival brings Gaelic music to a wider audience.
Stornoway is also home to Proiseact Nan Ealan
(www.gaelic-arts.com), a development agency for the
Gaelic arts in Scotland. Gaelic festivals and cultural
events contributed more than £40 million to the
economy in 2003.
Local councillors in Scotland hold office for four
years. Whole council elections in all 32 unitary
authorities are held at the same time. The last local
elections were held in May 2003 when 49 per cent of
the electorate voted. Local elections have
traditionally used the first-past-the-post system.
However, under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act
2004 the single transferable vote system (see
glossary) of proportional representation will be used
in future local government elections. The Act also
lowers the age at which people can stand as a
councillor from 21 to 18; removes some of the
political restrictions on council employees standing
for local authority elections; and establishes an
independent remuneration committee to advise on
a new system for allowances paid to councillors.
There are eight police authorities and eight fire
brigades. In both cases six of these cover more
than one local authority and are administered by
joint boards appointed by the authorities in their
areas. These boards appoint their own chief

Communities and community councils
Scotland is divided into about 1,350 communities,
which fit into and change in line with council
areas. Some 1,150 of these have community
councils, run by volunteers. Many receive local
authority funding for running costs, but they are
not always regarded as a tier of local government,
even though legally they can have that role.
Community councils act as a channel through which
communities can speak and act on issues they have
identified locally. Although they have no statutory
powers, they do have a right to be consulted on local
planning issues. The Local Government in Scotland
Act 2003 provides a framework for community
planning to ensure effective partnership between
communities and local authorities and other public
and private bodies to improve service delivery and
link national and local priorities.
Economy
The service sector and high-technology industries,
particularly electronics, have largely taken the place
of the traditional Scottish industries of coal mining,
steel production and shipbuilding. In 2001 the
service sector accounted for 70 per cent of Scotland’
gross value added (GVA, see glossary), while
manufacturing accounted for 18 per cent.

Fair Isle
In 2004 the National Trust for Scotland celebrated
the 50th anniversary of its purchase of Fair Isle
from Dr George Waterston. The island, lying
halfway between Orkney and Shetland, is one of
the most isolated inhabited islands in the United
Kingdom. It is 5 kilometres long and 3 kilometres
wide. The population of about 70 people are
involved in projects on wildlife tourism, wind
power, and sustainable management of the
environment. Fair Isle is home to large sea bird
colonies and its bird observatory is a centre of
ornithology. Fair Isle's intricate, colourful knitwear
takes its name from the island and is sold
worldwide.
In 2002, GVA at current prices in Scotland was
£73 billion, 8.1 per cent of the UK total (see Table
22.12, page 357 for UK GVA). GVA per head was
£14,400, compared with £15,300 for the United
Kingdom as a whole. There were 2.57 million
economically active people in Scotland in spring
2004, of whom 2.41 million were in employment.
Unemployment, at 6.1 per cent, was above the UK
rate of 4.8 per cent.
According to the Scottish Economic Report
published in March 2004, Scotland is the sixth
largest equity management centre in Europe and
15th in the world. Banking accounted for nearly
half of all financial service activity, with output in
banking rising by about 6 per cent in 2003.
Offshore oil and gas has made a significant
contribution to the UK economy since the first full
year of production in 1976. Many of the offshore
oilfields are to the east of the Shetland and Orkney
Islands or off the east coast of mainland Scotland.
The oilfields are expected to remain productive
until at least 2020 (see also chapter 28).
Scotland’s software sector has nearly 1,400
companies specialising in software design for
engineering and manufacturing, science, neural
networks, telecommunications and multimedia.
Companies involved in developing computer
games had an estimated turnover of £20 million in
2003 and there is an annual Edinburgh
International Games Festival. The Scottish

Scotland has distinctive educational and legal
systems compared with other parts of the United
Kingdom (see chapters 10 and 14).
Scotland has several major collections of the fine and
applied arts. These include the National Galleries of
Scotland, which have five Edinburgh-based galleries
and two outstations, one in the north and the other
in the south of Scotland, and the Glasgow Museums,
which include the Burrell Collection and the
Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.
The annual Edinburgh Festival is the largest arts
event in the United Kingdom and brings an
estimated £100 million into the local economy and
a further £76 million into the Scottish economy.
aims to assist collaboration between companies,
linking the expertise of small software companies
with the strength of multinationals.
Rural areas are under-represented in the growth
areas of the Scottish economy: banking and finance,
high-technology manufacturing, information and
communication technology (ICT) services, and
research and development. A New Approach: The
Way Forward for Rural Scotland was unveiled by the
Scottish Executive in May 2004. This was backed by
£780,000 from the European Commission to
improve rural transport.
The Scottish Executive’s second progress report on
the three-year Scottish Tourism Framework for
Action was published in June 2004. It estimates
that tourists spent £4.5 billion in Scotland in
2002/03 and that tourism accounts for 215,000 Jobs.
Forests cover 16 per cent of Scotland’s land area
(see page 420). Scotland accounts for around
60 per cent of the British conifer harvest and
Scottish sawmills produce 42 per cent of lumber
production in Great Britain. New markets are
developing with biomass power generation using
sawmill residues.

The Scottish Executive’s Enterprise, Transport and
Lifelong Learning Department provides direct
grant assistance to a wide range of businesses. Its
objectives are promoted in collaboration with
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, the lead economic development
agencies in lowland and highland Scotland
respectively, which manage domestic support for
industry and commerce. Scottish Development
International encourages inward investment.
The Highlands and Islands qualified for EU
regeneration funding between 2000 and 2006
under a special transitional programme worth
around £200 million as the region is below average
EU development. It was negotiated following the
loss of the region’s former Objective 1 status (see
page 358). The funding is managed by the
Highlands and Islands Partnership Programme.
International trade in goods
In 2003, exports from Scotland were worth £13.2
billion and imports £8.2 billion. The EU was the
largest partner group (Figure 4.4). North America
was the second largest export market, while Asia
and Oceania were the second largest source of
imports. The three largest sectors were machinery
and transport, accounting for 43 per cent of
exports and 55 per cent of imports; beverages and
tobacco, 13 per cent of exports although only 3 per
cent of imports; and manufactured goods, 11 per
cent of both exports and imports. The second
largest import sector was miscellaneous
manufactures, accounting for 15 per cent.
Natural attractions
Scotland has 40 National Scenic Areas that are
conserved as part of the natural heritage, four
World Heritage Sites and two National Parks,
Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, and the
Cairngorms. As well as Ben Nevis, at 1,343
metres the highest mountain in the United
Kingdom, Scotland has the Munros (284 summits
over 914 metres), and the Corbetts (221 hills
between 762 and 914 metres).
Scotland's longest walk, the Southern Upland
Way, celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2004.
The walk stretches about 340 kilometres
coast to coast from Cockburnspath in the east to
Portpatrick in the west.

Population
Northern Ireland’s population in mid-2003 was
1.7 million (Table 5.1), 2.9 per cent of the
population of the United Kingdom. The population
increased by 5.9 per cent between 1991 and 2003.
About 39 per cent lived in the area covered by the
Eastern Health and Social Services Board, at the
centre of which is the capital, Belfast. Population
density in 2003 was highest in the district council
area of Belfast (at 2,500 people per square
kilometre) and lowest in Moyle (at only 33 people
per square kilometre). Just under 36 per cent of
the population was aged under 25 in 2003, a higher
proportion than England, Wales or Scotland.
In the 2001 Census, 40 per cent of the Northern
Ireland population said that their religion was
Catholic; 21 per cent were Presbyterian; 15 per
cent Church of Ireland; 4 per cent Methodist; 6
per cent belonged to other Christian religions; and
0.3 per cent of the population belonged to other
(non-Christian) religions. The remainder either
had no religion, or did not state their religion.
Representation at Westminster
and in Europe
For UK Parliament general elections (see page 39),
Northern Ireland is divided into 18 single-seat
constituencies. Members of Parliament (MPs) are
elected by the ‘first-past-the-post’ electoral system
(see Table 5.2). The four MPs from Sinn Fein
would not take the oath of allegiance to The
Queen and have therefore not taken their seats in
the House of Commons. However, since January
2002 they have had access to facilities there.
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is

Ireland Office (NIO), whose main function is to

ensure that the devolution settlement in Northern
Ireland works satisfactorily. Following the decision
to suspend devolved government in Northern
Ireland in October 2002, the Secretary of State has
overall responsibility for the government of
Northern Ireland (see appendix A, page 493).
The NIO has policy responsibility for matters not
devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. These
include upholding law, order and security, and
running the criminal justice system.
In the 2004 Spending Review announced by the
UK Government in July, spending plans for the
Northern Ireland Office are set to rise from
£1.16 billion in 2004/05 to £1.21 billion in 2005/06
before falling to £1.16 billion in 2006/07 and
£1.15 billion in 2007/08. The settlement will
support the delivery of the Patten police reforms
(see page 34), the modernisation of the criminal
justice system (see page 225) and investment in
the prison service.
The UK Parliament has a Northern Ireland Grand
Committee to consider matters relating to Northern
Ireland. It also provides for oral questions to NIO
ministers and ministerial statements. The Grand
Committee includes all sitting Northern Ireland
MPs and up to 25 other MPs.
There is also a Northern Ireland Affairs Select
Committee,1 made up of 13 MPs from around the

United Kingdom. This examines the expenditure,
policy and administration of the NIO. A sub¬
committee was set up in January 2004 to scrutinise
devolved issues that would have come under the
remit of the Northern Ireland Assembly when it is
sitting. All members of the Northern Ireland
Affairs Select Committee are eligible to participate
in the sub-committee’s inquiries, the first being an
investigation into housing in Northern Ireland
that started in February 2004.
Northern Ireland Assembly
and Executive
Northern Ireland was governed by direct rule from
Westminster between 1972 and 1999 (see page 6)
but this was never intended to be permanent. Over
the years, successive UK and Irish Governments
worked closely to try to bring lasting peace to
Northern Ireland, recognising the need for new
political arrangements that were acceptable to
both sides of the community.
In April 1998 multiparty talks concluded with the
Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. Referendums
were held in both parts of Ireland in May 1998
and the Agreement received a clear endorsement.
Northern Ireland voted 71 per cent in favour and
29 per cent against, while in the Republic of
Ireland the result was 94 per cent and 6 per cent
respectively. The new Northern Ireland Assembly
was elected in June 1998.

European Parliament elections
Northern Ireland forms a single constituency in
the European Parliament (see page 65) and is
represented by three Members of the European
Parliament (MEPs, Table 5.2). As with local and
Assembly elections, the single transferable vote
form of proportional representation is used. In
the European parliamentary elections held on 10
June 2004, 554,744 people, 52 per cent of the
electorate, voted for an MEP. There were seven
candidates for the three seats. Sinn Fein won a
seat for the first time, at the expense of the
Social Democratic and Labour Party.
At the end of 1999 power to run most domestic
affairs was devolved to the Assembly and its
Executive Committee of Ministers under the
Northern Ireland Act 1998 (see appendix A, page
494 for details about devolved powers). When
in session, the Northern Ireland Assembly meets
in Parliament Buildings at Stormont, Belfast.
Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly use
the single transferable vote system of proportional
representation (see glossary). The 18 constituencies
are the same as those for the UK Parliament, but
each returns six Members of the Legislative
Assembly (MLAs), giving a total of 108 Members.
One of the first actions of a new Assembly is to
elect a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister
on a cross-community basis. It must also appoint
ministers for the ten Northern Ireland
departments (see appendix A); this is done using
the d’Hondt system (see glossary) and is in
proportion to each party’s size in the Assembly.
These 12 ministers form the Executive.
The Northern Ireland Assembly has ten statutory
committees, each of which shadows a department
in the devolved administration. Membership of
committees is in broad proportion to party
strength. Each statutory committee has a scrutiny,
policy development and consultation role in
relation to its department, and a role in the
initiation of legislation. The Committee of the
Centre, a standing committee, fulfils a similar role
with respect to the Office of the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister.
Suspension of the devolved
administration
The Northern Ireland Assembly and the Executive
has been suspended on a number of occasions
since 1999. The latest suspension was in October
2002. The UK Government considered that it was
not for the time being possible to hold together
an inclusive power-sharing Executive, since the
confidence within the community necessary to
underpin it had broken down.
The Northern Ireland Assembly (Elections and
Periods of Suspension) Act 2003 postponed the
Assembly elections from May until November
2003. In the November elections, the Democratic
Unionist Party (DUP) gained 25.6 per cent of the
vote share (Table 5.2). Sinn Fein came second in
terms of votes, with 23.5 per cent of the vote.
The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), gained 22.7 per
cent of the vote. Three of the MLAs elected for
the UUP subsequently defected to the DUP,
increasing DUP seats to 33 and decreasing UUP
seats to 24. The Social Democratic and Labour
Party got 17.0 per cent of the vote share and 18
seats, losing five.
Following the November 2003 elections, power
was not immediately restored to the Assembly;
the UK Government considered that there was
still not enough confidence and trust necessary
for the formation of a new Executive. A review
into the workings of the Belfast (Good Friday)
Agreement began in February 2004.
A programme of government is decided on each
year within an agreed budget. This programme is
subject to approval by the Assembly on a cross¬
community basis. While the Assembly is suspended,
the Northern Ireland departments work directly to
the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (see
page 31).
North/South Ministerial Council
The North/South Ministerial Council was
established in December 1999 following the
Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. It seeks to
develop consultation, co-operation and action
within the island of Ireland. It directs the work of

2004 Spending Review - devolved
responsibilities
Spending plans for Northern Ireland in areas of
devolved responsibility, announced by the UK
Government in July, are set to rise by an annual
average rate of about 3 per cent in real terms
over the next three years. In 2007/08 the
departmental expenditure limit (DEL, see page
366) will be £1.3 billion higher than in 2004/05
with the budget rising from £7.0 billion to
£8.3 billion.
the North/South Implementation Bodies that were
set up under the Agreement to deal with special
EU programmes, food safety, inland waterways,
language, marine matters, and trade and business
development. It also oversees cross-border
co-operation in agriculture, education,
environment, health, tourism, and transport.
The North/South Ministerial Council is unable to
meet during suspension. In devolution it meets in
plenary format once a year, with Northern Ireland
representation led by the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister. Sectoral meetings are held
on a more frequent basis.
The British-lrish Council
The British-lrish Council was set up under the
Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in 1998 to
‘promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial
development of the totality of relationships among
the peoples of these islands’. It has representatives
from the UK and Irish Governments, the devolved
institutions in Northern Ireland, Scotland and
Wales, as well as from Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle
of Man. Summit meetings normally take place
twice a year. Northern Ireland interests are
represented by the First Minister and the Deputy
First Minister. The Council also meets regularly in
sectoral format. During the suspension of
devolution NIO Ministers represent Northern
Ireland interests.
Security policy
The UK Government seeks to secure lasting peace
based on the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement
1998 in which the rights and identities of all
traditions in Northern Ireland are respected and
safeguarded. The Police Service of Northern
Ireland (PSNI, see below) takes primary
responsibility for the prevention and investigation
of all crime, including terrorism. The Armed
Forces support the PSNI, but only when the
security situation makes this necessary.
In Responding to a Changing Security Situation:
The Government’s Approach, updated in October
2003, the UK Government confirmed its aim to
return to normal security arrangements in
Northern Ireland as soon as possible, with the
Armed Forces resuming a peacetime role. Troop
levels in Northern Ireland have decreased year on
year since 1992, with fewer than 13,000 remaining.
Since the ceasefire in 1997, over half the military
bases and installations have been closed,
demolished or vacated and 102 cross-border roads
have been reopened.
Reform of policing
A review of policing by an independent
commission was set up under the chairmanship of
Chris Patten. Its report was published in 1999 and
its proposals are being implemented.
The Police Service (Northern Ireland) Acts 2000 and
2003 contained measures to set up a new and
more accountable police service and to redress the
religious imbalance between Catholics and
Protestants. The first group of recruits trained
specifically for the new police service graduated in
Irish language
The 2001 Census found that 167,490 people
(10 per cent of the population) in Northern
Ireland had some knowledge of the Irish
language. Irish is one of the Celtic languages:
others include Cornish and Welsh.
In April 2004 the Government set up a fund to
support Irish language film and television
production in Northern Ireland. The fund will
provide £12 million over three years, to deliver at
least 90 hours of Irish language broadcasting
each year by 2007/08. It will also help at least
15 people to be trained in production and
broadcasting skills each year.

2002. In June 2004, 14.9 per cent of regular
officers in the police service were Catholic,
compared with 7.6 per cent in March 2001. The
Government aims to increase Catholic
representation in the police service to 30 per cent
by 2011.
In September 2003 the Police (Northern Ireland) Act
1998 was amended to support fixed-term
appointments of officers from the Garda Siochana
(the Republic of Ireland’s police force) to the PSNI.
A review of the Police and Criminal Evidence Order
1989, which provides the legislative framework for
the operation of non-terrorist police powers in
Northern Ireland, was announced in February 2004.
Human rights and equality
Human rights and equality were central to the
Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. The subsequent
Northern Ireland Act 1998 placed a statutory duty
of equality on all public authorities and
established the following bodies:
The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission -
to advise the Government on human rights issues.
In 2003 the Commission published its second
Strategic Plan covering the period 2003-06. The
Plan identifies four goals: delivering a Bill of Rights
for Northern Ireland; identifying and addressing
human rights violations; promoting awareness and
understanding of human rights; and increasing the
effectiveness of the Commission.
The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland
- to be responsible for fair employment, equal
opportunities, racial equality, disability issues and
enforcing the statutory duty of equality.
The Parades Commission - to help implement the
Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998,
which regulates public processions in Northern
Ireland. The majority of parades are organised by
the Protestant/Unionist community and take place
from around Easter to the end of September.
The Victims Commission - to support victims of
inter-community unrest in Northern Ireland.
Local government
Northern Ireland is divided into 26 local
government districts (see map on page 36), each
Public administration review
A review of public administration, started by the
Northern Ireland Assembly in 2002, published
preliminary findings in May 2004. The main
recommendations included:
■ a significant reduction in the number of public
bodies, including Health Service bodies;
■ the number of local councils being reduced
from 26 to 10, but having more powers; and
■ aligning local council boundaries with those
of other service providers in the locality.
Final proposals were expected to be published for
consultation in autumn 2004.
The NIO has continued with the review while the
Assembly has been suspended. It considers that
the Executive should make the final decision,

forming a single-tier (unitary) district council.
They are mainly responsible for environmental
health; refuse collection and disposal; leisure and
recreation facilities; tourist amenities; building
control and cemeteries. This is a narrower range
of functions than local authorities elsewhere in the
United Kingdom. However, the district councils
nominate locally elected representatives to sit as
members of the various statutory bodies dealing
with other issues of local interest, for example,
education, libraries and healthcare. They also have
a consultative role in matters such as planning,
roads and housing; and offer leadership and
support in local economic development.
Local council elections are usually held every four
years. All councils elect their members at the same
time. The next elections will be held in 2005.
Finance
Unlike the other parts of the United Kingdom,
local authorities in Northern Ireland are not
financed through a council tax. Instead they raise
revenue to help fund the services they provide by
levying a domestic rate on homes and a business
rate on commercial property. The district rate is
fixed annually by each district council, and varies
from district to district. Other public services are
financed by the regional rate, which is set by the

Northern Ireland Assembly (or by the NIO when

comes from the general grant and reserves.
The rates system is being reviewed and in April
2004 the rating of vacant non-domestic property
was introduced. A new domestic rating system
is planned to come into effect from April 2007,
which changes the basis of valuation from rental
to assessed capital values. Regular revaluations will
be carried out to ensure the new system reflects
changes in the property market. The domestic
sector was last revalued nearly 30 years ago.
In 2003/04 net revenue expenditure for local
authorities in Northern Ireland was estimated at
£338 million: £283 million financed from district
rates, £50 million by general grant and £5 million
from reserves.

19 per cent of gross value added (GVA, see glossary
and Table 22.12, page 357) in Northern Ireland
while the service sector accounted for 68 per cent.
GVA at current prices was £20.5 billion in 2002,
2.3 per cent of the UK total. GVA increased by
5.6 per cent between 2001 and 2002, a bigger
increase than in England, Scotland and Wales, and
above overall UK growth of 5.1 per cent. However,
GVA per head was £12,100, below the UK average
of £15,300.
There were 750,000 people economically active in
Northern Ireland in spring 2004, of whom
712,000 were in employment. Unemployment, at
5.0 per cent, was just above the UK rate of 4.8 per
cent. Around 32 per cent of jobs are in the public
sector, compared with 20 per cent of jobs in the
United Kingdom overall.

Distinctive facts about Northern Ireland
National day: 17 March, St Patrick's Day
National emblem: A number of emblems are used.
The shamrock is associated with St Patrick and is
used widely on St Patrick's Day. The Red Hand of
Ulster is one of the few emblems used by both sides
of the community in Northern Ireland, although it is
more associated with the Unionist community.
National flag: The official flag is the Union flag,
commonly called the Union Jack, the national
flag of the United Kingdom. It is made up of the flag
of St Patrick (a red diagonal cross on a white
background) and the national flags of England and
Scotland (see pages 12 and 29).
Agriculture and forestry account for almost 90 per
cent of Northern Ireland's land area. There are 48
National Nature Reserves and 9 Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs).
In April 2002 Invest Northern Ireland (Invest NI)
was established to promote economic development.
It is funded by the Northern Ireland Executive
through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
Investment. As a direct result of Invest NI
activities, total commitments to invest
£410 million were made in 2003/04. When added
to commitments secured in the previous year, this
brings Invest Nl-supported investment in the
Northern Ireland economy to some £1 billion.
During 2003/04, over 2,750 new businesses were
established with support from Invest NI.
The Economic Development Forum (EDF)
provides a mechanism through which
organisations can advise Northern Ireland
ministers on issues relating to the development
and future competitiveness of the economy.
Membership includes representatives from
central and local government, business
organisations, trade unions, the education and
agriculture sectors, and the voluntary and
community sectors.
The EDF published Working Together for a Stronger
Economy in 2002. It sets out seven strategic
priorities to be addressed if the Northern Ireland
economy is to be significantly strengthened by the
year 2010. In March 2003 it published an Action
Plan outlining 58 specific actions to improve the
likelihood of achieving these priorities.
Northern Ireland receives around € 1 billion from
the EU Structural Funds allocation 2000-06 (see
page 357). Discussions on further EU funding
beyond 2006 are under way. However, there is
acknowledgement that post-2006 support will focus
on the accession members of the EU that joined in
2004 (see page 71).
Funding from the EU Programme for Peace and
Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border
Region of the Republic of Ireland (PEACE II)
provides a further €531 million (£375 million).
This is supporting continued efforts to create a
peaceful and stable society and to promote
reconciliation. PEACE II has assisted more than
3,200 projects across all parts of Northern Ireland
and the Border Region, covering one of the
following priorities:
■ economic renewal;
■ social integration, inclusion and
reconciliation;
■ locally-based regeneration and development;
■ cross-border co-operation; and
■ technical assistance.
Although PEACE II was originally scheduled to
run until 2004, the EU is developing proposals to
extend it until 2006. The 2004 Spending Review
provided £62 million for PEACE II in 2004/05 and
£80 million in 2005/06.
International trade in goods
In 2003 exports of goods from Northern Ireland
totalled £4.0 billion and imports of goods,
£3.7 billion (Figure 5.4). The largest international
trading partner was the EU, accounting for 58 per
cent of both exports and imports. Machinery and
transport accounted for 43 per cent of exports and
30 per cent of imports, while manufactured goods
totalled 18 per cent of exports and 19 per cent of
imports. Food and live animals accounted for 15
per cent of imports and 10 per cent of exports.

The Monarchy 51
The United Kingdom is a parliamentary
democracy, based on universal suffrage. It is also a
constitutional monarchy in which ministers of the
Crown govern in the name of the Sovereign, who
is Head of State and Head of the Government.
There is no single document that forms the UK
constitution; instead, the relationship between the
State and the people relies on statute law, common
law and conventions.1
The UK Parliament (the legislature) makes
primary legislation, although it has devolved
a range of issues to the Scottish Parliament,
the National Assembly for Wales and, when it
is sitting, the Northern Ireland Assembly
(see chapters 3 to 5). Under the constitution,
Parliament is supreme and has authority over
government and law-making in the United
Kingdom as a whole (see page 43). The executive
comprises the Government (members of the
Cabinet and other ministers responsible for
policies); government departments and agencies;
local authorities; public corporations; independent
regulatory bodies; and certain other organisations
subject to ministerial control. The Government
derives its authority and membership from
Parliament and can only stay in office if it is able
to command a majority in the House of
Commons. The judiciary (see chapter 14)
determines common law and interprets legislation.
As Monarch, The Queen is head of the executive
and plays an integral part in the legislature (see
page 51). She heads the judiciary and is both the
commander-in-chief of all the Armed Forces of

the Crown and ‘supreme governor’ of the
established Church of England. In practice, the
Monarch acts on the advice of her ministers.
In June 2003 the Government announced a series
of constitutional changes designed to put the
relationship between the executive, legislature and
judiciary on a modern footing (see page 46).
Parliamentary electoral system
The United Kingdom is divided into 659
constituencies, each of which returns one Member
of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons.
Constituencies vary in size and area; the average
electorate is around 67,300. The largest electorate
in December 2003 was the Isle of Wight (with
106,600 registered voters) and the smallest the
sparsely populated Eilean Siar (21,300).
There are four Parliamentary Boundary
Commissions - one each for England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland - that review
constituency size to ensure that constituencies
have broadly similar numbers of electors. When
the reviews for 2003 to 2007 have been completed,
the four Commissions will become part of the
Electoral Commission.
The Electoral Commission is an independent body
set up under the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000 to oversee controls on
donations to and campaign spending by political
parties and others (see page 42). It also aims to
ensure public confidence and participation in the
democratic process in the United Kingdom, for
example by recommending modernisation of the
electoral process and promoting public awareness
of electoral matters.

Voters
UK citizens, and citizens of other Commonwealth
countries and the Republic of Ireland resident in
the United Kingdom, may vote in elections to the
UK Parliament provided that they are aged 18 or
over; included in the register of electors for the
constituency; and not subject to any legal
incapacity to vote.
Members of the Armed Forces, Crown servants
and staff of the British Council employed overseas
(together with their wives or husbands if
accompanying them) may be registered as ‘service
voters’ or at an address in the constituency where
they would live if not serving abroad. British
citizens living overseas are entitled to register at
their last UK constituency and to vote for up to
15 years after moving abroad.
People not entitled to vote include members of
the House of Lords, foreign nationals (other than
qualifying Commonwealth citizens or citizens of
the Republic of Ireland) resident in the United
Kingdom, some patients detained under mental
health legislation, convicted prisoners detained in
a penal institution, and people convicted within
the previous five years of corrupt or illegal
election practices.
Members of the House of Lords and EU citizens
resident in the United Kingdom are eligible to vote
in elections for local authorities, the National
Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Parliament, the
Northern Ireland Assembly, and the European
Parliament.
Voting procedures
Voting is not compulsory in the United Kingdom
and the simple majority system is used for
Westminster elections. The Additional Member
System and the d’Hondt system of proportional
representation (see glossary) is used in the
elections to the National Assembly for Wales, the
Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland
Assembly (see chapters 3 to 5) and to the
European Parliament (see page 65). As in other EU
countries, participation in voting at General
Elections has declined, and the turnout in the 2001
General Election was 59 per cent, the lowest since
the First World War.

UK 2005
6 Government
At Westminster elections each elector may cast
one vote and usually does so in person at a polling
station. As part of its plans to modernise the
electoral system, the Government has taken a
number of measures designed to make voting
more accessible for the electorate and allow people
more flexibility in where and when they vote.
These include the introduction in 2000 of postal
voting on demand and the possibility of voting
in a number of other ways in General Elections
sometime after 2006.
In January 2004 the Government announced plans
to improve electoral registers. The first phase will
standardise local electronic electoral registers. The
second phase will allow authorised users to access
local registration data centrally and will support
an e-enabled election in the future.
New voting methods have been tested at recent
elections. In the May 2003 local elections, 59 pilot
schemes took place in 61 local authorities in
England, involving 6.4 million electors. There were
32 all-postal pilot schemes, while 17 multi-channel
pilots included interactive digital television, touch-
tone telephone, mobile phone text messaging and
the Internet.
Local elections and elections to the European
Parliament were held on the same day in June
2004. All-postal voting was piloted in four regions
of England: North East, North West, Yorkshire and
the Humber, and East Midlands. Turnout in the
four pilot regions was 42.4 per cent, more than
double that of the 1999 elections. Turnout was
also higher in the local elections in the pilot
regions than in the previous local elections.
In August 2004 the Electoral Commission
published a report drawing on its evaluation of
the all-postal voting pilot schemes in the 2004
elections. It recommended that postal voting
should remain part of the UK electoral system, but
noted that effectively swapping postal voting on
demand with all-postal voting did not offer voters
a choice of voting methods and recommended
that all-postal pilot voting schemes should not
continue.2 Instead it recommended the
development of a new foundation model of voting
to enhance the degree of choice available to voters
and to produce a more robust legal framework. It
2 The Electoral Commission has recommended that the regional
referendum in the North East in November 2004 should proceed
as an all-postal ballot, as the process is already under way.
plans to produce a report by 31 March 2005
on a new model for statutory elections and
referendums, which will include provision for the
introduction of additional voting channels,
including the electronic channels that have been
tested in the pilot schemes. The Government has
welcomed the report and is considering the
recommendations. It will look at how to
strengthen and improve safeguards and at
measures to prevent fraud.
Candidates
British citizens, and resident citizens of other
Commonwealth countries and the Republic of
Ireland, may be elected as MPs provided that
they are aged 21 or over and are not disqualified.
Disqualified people include members of the House
of Lords; and holders of certain offices listed in the
House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975.
Each candidate’s nomination must be proposed
and seconded by two electors registered in the
constituency and signed by eight others.
Candidates do not have to be backed by a political
party. A candidate must deposit £500, which is
returned if he or she receives 5 per cent or more
of the votes cast.
Review of voting and candidacy age
In April 2004 the Electoral Commission published
a review of voting and candidacy age, in response
to growing concern about declining electoral
participation among young people. Its main
recommendations, which are being considered by
the Government, were:
■ the minimum voting age should remain at 18,
in line with that in most other countries; and
■ the age of candidacy should be reduced to
18, in line with the age of voting.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend on a
General Election campaign is currently £5,483 plus
4.6 pence for each elector in a borough or district
constituency, or 6.2 pence for each elector in a
county constituency. A higher limit of £100,000
has been set for by-elections as they are often seen
as tests of national opinion in the period between
General Elections. All election expenses, apart
from the candidate’s personal expenses, are subject
to these statutory rules. A candidate is also entitled
41
6 Government
UK 2005
to send one election communication to each voter
free of postal charges. The cost of free postage is
met by central government.
The party political system
The party system, which has existed in one form
or another since the 18th century, depends upon
there being organised political groups, each of
which presents its policies to the electorate for
approval. In practice, most candidates in elections,
and almost all winning candidates, belong to one
of the main parties.
The origins of the Conservative Party go back to
the 18th century, while the Labour Party emerged
in the last decade of the 19th century. The Liberal
Democrats were formed in 1988 when the Liberal
Party, which also traced its origins to the 18th
century, merged with the Social Democratic Party,
formed in 1981. Other parties include two
nationalist parties, Plaid Cymru - The Party of
Wales (founded in 1925) and the Scottish National
Party (founded in 1934). Northern Ireland has
a number of parties. They include the Ulster
Unionists, formed in the early part of the 20th
century; the Democratic Unionists, founded in
1971 by a group that broke away from the Ulster
Unionists; the Social Democratic and Labour
Party, founded in 1970; and Sinn Fein, which is the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
The party that wins most seats (although not
necessarily the most votes) at a General Election,
or that has the support of a majority of MPs in the
Commons, usually becomes the Government. By
tradition, the Sovereign invites the leader of that
party to form a government. The largest minority
party becomes the official Opposition, with its own
leader and ‘shadow cabinet’.
Since 1945 the traditional two-party system of
government in the UK Parliament has been
maintained, with power being held by either the
Conservative Party or the Labour Party. Each has
won eight General Elections in this period, the
Labour Party being successful in the most recent
General Election in 2001 (see Table 6.1 on page 40).
Financial controls over parties
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act
2000 contained provisions to make party funding
more open and transparent, by restricting the
sources of political donations, controlling
spending on elections and regulating the finances
of organisations campaigning at referendums.
Campaign expenditure
Campaign expenditure is regulated at elections to
the UK and European Parliaments and to the
Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales
and, when it is sitting, the Northern Ireland
Assembly. During a General Election campaign
a party is subject to limits which are calculated
according to the number of seats it is contesting in
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; this
excludes spending by candidates, for which there
are separate limits (see page 41). Lower limits apply
for elections to the other bodies. Third parties
campaigning at elections (such as trade unions) are
also subject to limits on expenditure incurred on
election materials. There are separate rules
governing expenditure on referendum campaigns.
Donations
Political parties in Great Britain are required to
abide by regulations on accepting and reporting
donations: these requirements have been disapplied
to parties registered in Northern Ireland until
February 2005. Parties may only accept donations
of over £200 from ‘permissible donors’ - individuals
on the UK electoral register and organisations (such
as companies, trade unions and political parties)
that are registered and do business in the United
Kingdom. All donations of over £5,000 to a political
party’s central organisation must be reported to the
Electoral Commission (see page 39) on a quarterly
basis, and on a weekly basis during a General
Election campaign. Parties must also report
donations of over £1,000 made to party accounting
units. Donations of more than £1,000 to holders of
elective office and to members of registered parties
must be reported by the individual, and ‘members
associations’ (groups whose membership consists
mainly or wholly of members of a particular
registered party) must also report donations of
over £5,000. Similar controls on donations apply
to other organisations and individuals campaigning
at elections and referendums.
Parliament
The UK Parliament is one of the oldest
representative assemblies in the world, with its
origins in the 13th century. During the 14th
century two distinct Houses of Parliament began
to emerge, with the ‘Commons’ sitting apart from
42
UK 2005
6 Government
the ‘Upper House’ from 1341. It was also accepted
that there should be no taxation without
parliamentary consent, which remains a
fundamental principle.
Powers
There are three parts of Parliament - the elected
House of Commons, the appointed House of
Lords and the Sovereign. The agreement of all
three is normally needed to pass laws, but that of
the Sovereign is given as a matter of course.
Parliament at Westminster can legislate for the
United Kingdom as a whole and has powers to
legislate for any parts of it separately. However,
by convention it will not normally legislate on
devolved matters in Scotland or Northern Ireland
without the agreement of the Scottish Parliament
or, when it is sitting, the Northern Ireland
Assembly. Under the Acts of Parliament that set up
these administrations, the Westminster Parliament
still has UK-wide responsibility in a number of
areas (see appendix A, page 481).
As there are no legal restraints imposed by a
written constitution, Parliament may legislate as it
pleases, as long as the United Kingdom meets its
obligations as a member of the European Union
(see page 67). It can make or change law, and
overturn established conventions or turn them
into law. It can even legislate to prolong its own
life beyond the normal period of five years
without consulting the electorate.
In practice, Parliament does not assert itself in this
way. Its members work within the common law
and normally act according to precedent. The
House of Commons is directly responsible to the
electorate, and, during the 20th century, the House
of Lords increasingly recognised the supremacy of
the elected chamber.
Functions
The main functions of Parliament are:
■ to pass laws;
■ to provide (by voting for taxation) the means
of carrying on the work of government;
■ to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
■ to debate the major issues of the day.
In performing these functions, Parliament helps to
bring the relevant facts and issues to the attention
of the electorate. By custom, Parliament is also
informed before important international treaties
and agreements are ratified. The making of treaties
is, however, a royal prerogative carried out on the
advice of the Government and does not need
parliamentary approval.
Meetings
A Parliament has a maximum life of five years, but
not all Parliaments serve their full term. The
maximum life has been prolonged by legislation in
rare circumstances, such as the two World Wars of
the last century. The Sovereign dissolves Parliament
and calls for a General Election on the advice of the
Prime Minister.
The life of a Westminster Parliament is divided
into sessions. Each usually lasts a year - normally
beginning in November and ending in October
or November - although a session may be longer
if there has been a General Election. The two
Houses do not normally sit at weekends, at
Christmas, Easter and the late Spring Bank
Holiday. There is also a recess in the summer from
late July to October, but since 2003 both Houses
return for about two weeks in September before
a break that coincides with the political party
conferences.
At the start of each session the Sovereign’s speech
to Parliament outlines the Government’s policies
and proposed legislative programme. Each session
is ended by the Sovereign dismissing it - called
‘prorogation’. Parliament then ‘stands prorogued’
for a few days until the new session begins.
Prorogation brings to an end nearly all
parliamentary business.
In the 2002/03 session the House of Commons
sat on 162 days and the House of Lords on 174.
New working hours were adopted in the
House of Commons in January 2003 for an
experimental period until the end of the current
Parliament. They are designed to make it easier
for MPs with families and those with provincial
constituencies. The main changes involve earlier
sitting days on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and
Thursdays and fewer Friday sessions. The Select
Committee on the Modernisation of the House
of Commons is considering arrangements for the
next Parliament.

UK 2005
The party system in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition, with
members of the Cabinet and shadow Cabinet
respectively, sit opposite one another on the front
benches in the debating chamber of the House of
Commons. Their supporters, ‘the backbenchers’, sit
behind them. Benches to the right of the Speaker
are used by the Government and its supporters;
those to the left are occupied by the Opposition
and members of the other parties. There are
similar seating arrangements for the parties in the
House of Lords, but many peers do not wish to be
associated with a political party, and choose to sit
on the ‘crossbenches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament
relies to a large extent on the relationship between
the Government and the Opposition parties.
Depending on the relative strengths of the parties
in the House of Commons, the Opposition may
try to overthrow the Government by defeating it
on a ‘matter of confidence’ vote. In general,
however, the Opposition contributes to the
formulation of policy and legislation by
constructive criticism; opposes government
proposals with which it disagrees; tables
amendments to Government Bills; and puts
forward its own policies in order to improve its
chances of winning the next General Election.
The Government Chief Whips in the Commons
and the Lords, in consultation with their
Opposition counterparts, arrange the scheduling
of government business under the direction of the
Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two Houses.
The Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
usually chosen by the party leaders, manage their
parliamentary parties. Their duties include
keeping members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the party’s
voting strength by ensuring members attend
important debates, and passing on to the party
leadership the opinions of backbench members.
The term ‘whip’ also applies to the weekly circular
sent out by each Chief Whip to all their MPs or
peers notifying them of parliamentary business.
The degree of importance is indicated by the
number of times that the debate or division is
underlined. Items underlined once are routine and
attendance is optional, while those underlined
twice are more important and attendance is
required unless - in the Commons - a ‘pair’ has
been arranged with an Opposition MP who also
intends to be absent. A ‘three-line whip’, when an
item is underlined three times, indicates that
attendance is required and pairing is not normally
allowed. This is imposed on important occasions,
such as second readings of major Bills and
motions of no confidence.
House of Commons
The House of Commons consists of 659 elected
MPs (see Table 6.1), of whom 529 represent
constituencies in England, 40 in Wales, 72 in
Scotland and 18 in Northern Ireland. In luly 2004
there were 119 women MPs and 13 MPs who had
declared that they were of minority ethnic origin.
After a Parliament has been dissolved, and a
General Election has been held, the Sovereign
summons a new Parliament. When an MP dies,
resigns3 or is made a member of the House of
Lords, a by-election takes place.
MPs are paid an annual salary of £57,485 (from
April 2004) and provided with between £66,458
and £77,534 for staff salaries and £19,325 for
incidental expenses involved in running an office
(excluding certain IT equipment which is provided
centrally). For ministers’ salaries see page 55. All
MPs are entitled to travel allowances and to free
stationery, inland telephone calls and postage from
Parliament. There are various other allowances,
such as a supplementary allowance payable to MPs
for Inner London and certain other seats to reflect
the higher cost of living in the capital.
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the
Speaker (see page 46), an MP elected by other MPs
to preside over the House. Other officers include
the Chairman of Ways and Means and two deputy
chairmen, who are also MPs and may act as
Deputy Speakers. They are elected by the House as
nominees of the Government, but may come from
the Opposition as well as the Government party.
The House of Commons Commission,
a statutory body chaired by the Speaker, is
responsible for the administration of the House.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs) include the
Clerk of the House of Commons - the principal
3 By tradition, an MP who wishes to resign from the House can do
so only by applying for office as Crown Steward or Bailiff of the
Chiltern Hundreds, or Steward of the Manor of Northstead. These
positions disqualify the holder from membership of the House of
Commons.

adviser to the Speaker on the House’s privileges
and procedures. The Clerk’s other responsibilities
relate to the conduct of the business of the House
and its committees. The Clerk is also accounting
officer for the House. The Serjeant at Arms, who
waits upon the Speaker, carries out certain orders
of the House. He is also the official housekeeper of
the Commons’ part of the Palace of Westminster
and is responsible for security.
House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of:
■ hereditary peers;
■ life peers created to help carry out the judicial
duties of the House (up to 12 Lords of Appeal
in Ordinary or ‘Law Lords’ and a number of
other Lords of Appeal);4
■ all other life peers; and
■ the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the
Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester,
and the 21 next most senior bishops of the
Church of England.
The number of peers eligible to sit is shown in
Table 6.2, which also shows the representation
of the main political parties. Crossbenchers, many
of whom have specialist knowledge and expertise,
do not vote with a political party. There were 125
women peers in July 2004.
Members of the House of Lords do not receive a
salary for their parliamentary work, but they can
claim for expenses incurred in attending the
House and for certain travelling expenses.
The Government wants the House of Lords to be
more representative of UK society. As a first step,
under the House of Lords Act 1999, the number of
hereditary peers entitled to sit in Parliament was
reduced from over 750 to 92. The Government
also set up a non-statutory independent House of
Lords Appointments Commission to take over the
Prime Minister’s role in nominating non-political
members of the House. In 2001 the Commission
made its first appointments of 15 non-political life
peers selected from a total of 3,166 public
nominees. In September 2003 a consultation paper
was issued containing the Government’s proposals
4 The House of Lords is the final court of appeal for civil cases in the
United Kingdom and for criminal cases in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. In June 2003 the Government announced its
intention to create a new Supreme Court.

on the next stage of House of Lords reform,
including proposals for removing the remaining
hereditary peers. However, the Government has
deferred a proposed Bill for the time being as it
considers that it would be unable to secure the
approval of the House of Lords for the Bill.
In June 2003 the Government announced a
number of major constitutional changes, including
the creation of the Department for Constitutional
Affairs, which replaced the Lord Chancellor’s
Department (see page 46).
Officers of the House of Lords
The Speaker in the Lords, traditionally the Lord
Chancellor, has limited powers compared with
those of the Speaker of the House of Commons
(see page 46). The Lords themselves control the
proceedings with advice from the Leader of the
House, who leads the governing party in the
House and is a member of the Cabinet. Under the
Government’s proposed constitutional changes,
the role of Speaker would no longer be fulfilled by
the Lord Chancellor. In the light of this, the House
of Lords set up a select committee to look at the
Speakership of the House, and in November 2003
it recommended that the Speaker should be
known as Lord Speaker.
As Clerk of the House of Lords, the Clerk of the
Parliaments is responsible for the records of
proceedings of the House of Lords and for the text
of Acts of the UK Parliament. The Clerk is the
accounting officer for the House, and is in charge
of its administrative staff, known as the Parliament

The Constitutional Reform Bill
The Constitutional Reform Bill, as introduced,
provided for the abolition of the office of Lord
Chancellor, who participates in all three branches
of government: as head of the judiciary; as a
Cabinet minister, with ministerial responsibility for
much of the administration of justice; and as
Speaker of the House of Lords. One of the aims of
the Bill is to clarify the relationship between the
judiciary and Parliament and the Government.
Under the Bill, statutory responsibilities relating
to the judiciary would mostly be transferred to
the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or
to the Lord Chief Justice, or shared between
them. A new Supreme Court of the United
Kingdom would replace the existing system of
Law Lords operating as a Committee of the
House of Lords.
The Bill received its second reading in the House
of Lords in March 2004, where it was then
considered by a special select committee. The Bill
will be carried forward to the next parliamentary
session if it does not complete all its stages in the
current session.
Office. The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,
known as ‘Black Rod’, is responsible for security,
accommodation and services in the House of
Lords’ part of the Palace of Westminster.
Parliamentary privilege
To ensure that Parliament can carry out its duties
without hindrance, certain rights and immunities
apply collectively to each House and its staff, and
individually to each member. These include:
■ freedom of speech;
■ first call on the attendance of Members,
which means that members are free from
arrest in civil actions and excused from
serving on juries, or being forced to attend
court as witnesses; and
■ the right of access to the Crown, which is
a collective privilege of the House.
Further privileges include the rights of the House:
■ to control its own proceedings (so that it is
able, for instance, to keep out ‘strangers’5 if it
wishes);
■ to decide upon legal disqualifications for
membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and
■ to punish for contempt.
Parliament has the right to punish anybody, inside
or outside the House, who commits a breach of
privilege - that is, offends against the rights of the
House.
Parliamentary procedure
Parliamentary procedure is largely based on
precedent and is set down by each House in a code
of practice known as its ‘Standing Orders’. The
debating system is similar in both Houses. Every
subject starts off as a proposal or ‘motion’ by a
member. After debate, in which each member
(except the person putting forward the motion)
may speak only once, the motion may be
withdrawn: if it is not, the Speaker or Chairman
‘puts the question’ whether to agree to the motion
or not. The question may be decided without
voting, or by a simple majority vote. The main
difference between the two Houses is that in the
House of Lords the Lord Chancellor, or the
deputising Chairman, does not control procedure;
instead such matters are decided by the general
feeling of the House, which is sometimes
interpreted by its Leader or a Government Whip.
In the Commons the Speaker has full authority to
enforce the rules of the House and must uphold
procedure and protect the rights of minorities in
the House. The Speaker may or may not allow a
motion to end discussion so that a matter may be
put to the vote, and has powers to stop irrelevant
and repetitious contributions in debate. In cases of
serious disorder the Speaker can adjourn or
suspend the sitting. The Speaker may order MPs
who have broken the rules of behaviour of the
House to leave the Chamber, or may suspend them
for a number of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the Commons
and announces the final result. If there is a tie, the
Speaker gives a casting vote (usually to keep the
situation as it is), without expressing an opinion.
Voting procedure in the House of Lords is broadly
similar, except the Lord Chancellor can vote, but
does not have a casting vote.

Public access to parliamentary proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally public
and are broadcast on television and radio, either
live or, more usually, in recorded or edited form.
Broadcasting on the Internet began on a pilot basis
in 2002 and was made permanent in October
2003. Live coverage of both Houses and sittings in
Westminster Hall is on www.parliamentlive.tv. The
proceedings of both Houses, including speeches
and parliamentary questions, are transcribed in
the Official Report, Hansard, which is published
the following morning, both in hard copy form
and on www.parliament.uk/hansard/hansard.cfm.
Select committees
Select committees are appointed for a particular
task, generally one of inquiry, investigation and
scrutiny. They report to the House as a whole;
in many cases they invite a response from the
Government, which is also reported to the House.
A select committee may be appointed for a
Parliament, or for a session, or for as long as it takes
to complete its task. Each committee is constituted
on a basis that is in approximate proportion to
party strength in the House, but the chairman is
not necessarily drawn from the governing party.
Members are normally backbenchers.
Select committees may question ministers, civil
servants, interested bodies and individuals.
Through hearings and published reports, they
bring before Parliament and the public an
extensive amount of fact and informed opinion,
and build up considerable expertise in their
subjects of inquiry.
The House of Commons has set up 15 committees
to examine aspects of public policy, expenditure
and administration across the main government
departments and their associated public bodies.
There are also regular Commons select
committees, including the Public Accounts
Committee and ‘domestic’ select committees
covering the internal workings of Parliament.
The chairmen of the select committees form the
Liaison Committee.
Both Houses have a select committee to keep them
informed of European Union (EU) developments,
and to enable them to scrutinise and debate EU
policies and proposals, while three Commons
standing committees debate specific European
legislative proposals.
In the House of Lords there are four major select
committees on the European Communities;
Science and Technology; Economic Affairs; and
the Constitution. There are also select committees
on aspects of public and private legislation, and on
the internal workings of the House, while ad hoc
committees are appointed to examine issues
outside the remit of the main committees. The
Lords’ judicial work is conducted in the Appellate
Committee.
Examination of government policy
The parliamentary system contains a number
of checks to ensure that a government remains
accountable. Through raising Parliamentary
Questions, MPs seek information about the
Government’s intentions and can raise issues and
grievances, including complaints brought to their
notice by constituents. In the 2002-03 session
nearly 59,600 questions were tabled: 4,100 oral
questions and over 55,400 written questions. Oral
statements are made by government ministers,
when announcing a statement of government
policy, such as the publication of a White Paper
(see page 48), or in response to a significant event.
The parliamentary convention is that Parliament
should be first to hear a major announcement.
In addition to the scrutiny by select committees,
both Houses offer opportunities for backbenchers
to examine policy. In the House of Commons,
these include:
■ Question Time: for about an hour on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
when the House is sitting, ministers answer
MPs’ oral questions. Ministers are questioned
on a rota agreed by the Government and
Opposition parties. Prime Minister’s Question
Time takes place for 30 minutes every
Wednesday.
■ Adjournment debates: MPs use motions
for the adjournment of the House to raise
constituency cases or matters of public
concern. There is a half-hour adjournment
period at the end of the business of the day,
and opportunities for private Members
adjournment debates in Westminster Hall on
Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
■ Emergency debates: an MP wishing to discuss
a ‘specific and important matter that should
have urgent consideration’ may, at the end of
Question Time, ask for an adjournment of
the House. On the few occasions when this is
47
6 Government
UK 2005
successful, the matter is debated for three
hours in what is known as an emergency
debate, usually on the following day.
Early day motions (EDMs): backbench MPs
may express their views on particular issues in
this way. A number of EDMs are tabled each
sitting day; they are very rarely debated but
can be useful in measuring the amount of
support for the topic by the number of MPs
who add their signatures to the EDM.
■ Opposition days: on 20 days in each session
opposition parties choose the business to be
discussed. Of these days, 17 are allocated to
the Leader of the Opposition and three to the
second largest opposition party.
■ Estimates days: the details of proposed
government expenditure are debated on three
days in each session.
■ Procedural opportunities: criticism of the
Government may also occur during the
debate on the Queen’s Speech at the
beginning of each session, on motions of
censure for which the Government provides
time, and in debates on the Government’s
legislative and other proposals.
■ Motions of no confidence: as a final act
of parliamentary control, the House of
Commons may force the Government to
resign by passing a resolution of‘no
confidence’. The Government must also resign
if the House rejects a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy
that it has declared it a ‘matter of confidence’
or if the House refuses to vote the money
required for the public service. Motions of no
confidence are relatively infrequent and the
last successful one was in 1979.
Control of finances
The UK Parliament (and in particular the House
of Commons) is responsible for overseeing
revenue generation and public expenditure. No
payment out of the central government’s public
funds can be made, and no taxation or loans
authorised, except by Act of Parliament. However,
limited interim payments can be made from the
Contingencies Fund.
The Finance Act is the most important piece of
annual legislation. It authorises the raising of
revenue and is based on the Chancellor of the
Exchequer’s Budget statement (see page 371).
Scrutiny of public expenditure is carried out by
House of Commons select committees.
The law-making process in the
UK Parliament
Statute law consists of Acts of Parliament (primary
legislation) and delegated or secondary legislation
(see page 51) made by ministers under powers
given to them by an Act. While the interpretation
of the law is refined constantly in the courts (see
chapter 14), changes to statute law can only be
made by Parliament. Since devolution, the Scottish
Parliament and, when it is sitting, the Northern
Ireland Assembly can also make primary or
secondary legislation on devolved matters - see
pages 33 and 494. Draft laws take the form of
parliamentary Bills.
Public Bills
Bills that change the general law are called Public
Bills and make up the major part of the
parliamentary legislative process. They can be
introduced into either House, by a government
minister or any MP or peer. In the 2002-03
parliamentary session 138 Public Bills were
introduced into Parliament and 46 became Acts
of Parliament. Most Public Bills that become Acts
of Parliament are introduced by a government
minister and are known as ‘Government Bills’.
A Government Bill is generally accompanied by
Explanatory Notes, which are designed to provide
background information on the Bill and what it is
seeking to achieve.
The main Bills forming the Government’s
legislative programme are announced in the
Queen’s Speech at the State Opening of
Parliament. The Bills are introduced into one or
other of the Houses over the following weeks.
Before a Government Bill is drafted, there may be
consultation with professional bodies, voluntary
organisations and others with an interest, including
pressure groups (see page 51) looking to promote
specific causes. The Government may publish a
consultation paper, sometimes called a ‘Green
Paper’, setting out proposals that are still taking
shape and inviting comments from the public.
‘White Papers’, which are government statements of
policy, often contain specific proposals for changes
in the law. These may be debated in Parliament
before a Bill is introduced.
As part of the process of modernising
parliamentary procedures, more Bills are
published in draft for pre-legislative scrutiny. The
48
UK 2005
6 Government
aim is to allow an input from backbenchers and
other interested parties at an early stage, helping
to save time and reducing the number of
amendments made during the legislative process.
Other Bills
Bills introduced by other MPs or peers are known
as ‘Private Members’ Bills. Early in each session
backbench MPs ballot for the chance to introduce
a Bill on one of the Fridays when such Bills have
precedence over government business, and the first
20 MPs whose names are drawn win this privilege.
There are also other opportunities for MPs to
present a Bill, while peers may introduce Private
Members’ Bills in the House of Lords at any time.
However, these Bills rarely become law - 13 were
enacted in the 2002-03 session.
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers.
They go through a similar process to Public Bills,
but most of the work is done in committee, where
procedures follow a semi-judicial pattern. Five
Private Bills were enacted in the 2002-03 session.
Passage of Government Bills
Public Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Government Bills likely to raise political
controversy usually start in the House of
Commons, while those of a technical nature but
that are less likely to be politically controversial
often start in the House of Lords. Government
Bills involving new taxation or public expenditure
are always introduced in the Commons. The
process for a Commons Bill is shown in Figure 6.3.
Standing committees
House of Commons standing committees debate
and consider Public Bills at the committee stage.
The committee examines a Bill clause by clause
and may amend it before reporting back to the
House. Ordinary standing committees do not have
names but are designated by letters, such as
Standing Committee A. Each committee generally
has around 18 members, with a party balance
reflecting as far as possible that in the House as a
whole. Committees for larger or more contentious
Bills may have more members, up to a maximum
of 50. In some cases a Committee of the Whole
House may be established. This usually occurs for
Bills of major constitutional importance, Bills that
need to be passed very quickly, and Bills that are
considered uncontroversial.
In the House of Lords, Bills normally go through
their committee stage in a Committee of the
Whole House. However, other committees may be
used, such as a Grand Committee (a Committee
of the Whole House in which no votes are taken
and that takes place away from the chamber of the
House), which is regularly used for less
contentious Bills.
Final stages
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to The Queen for
Royal Assent, after which it becomes an Act of
Parliament. The Royal Assent has not been refused
since 1707.
Public Bills that have not been enacted by the end
of the parliamentary session are usually lost.
However, changes implemented in the 2002-03
parliamentary session allow for more Public Bills
to be carried over to the next parliamentary
session, particularly those that have undergone
pre-legislative scrutiny in either House.
Limitations on the power of the Lords
The main legislative function of the House of
Lords is to act as a revising chamber,
complementing but not rivalling the elected House
of Commons. As a result, there are some
limitations on its powers. Under the Parliament
Acts 1911 and 1949, the powers of the Lords in
relation to ‘money Bills’ are very restricted. Bills
authorising taxation or national expenditure are
passed without amendment as a formality. A Bill
dealing only with taxation or expenditure must
become law within one month of being sent to the
Lords, even if the Lords has not passed it.
The Parliament Acts also make it possible for a Bill
to be passed by the Commons without the consent
of the Lords in certain circumstances. This
procedure has been used on only three occasions
since 1949. The House of Lords does not usually
prevent Bills from being enacted that the
Commons is keen to pass, although the Lords will
often amend and return them for further
consideration. If no agreement is reached between
the two Houses on a non-financial Commons Bill,
the Lords can delay the Bill for a period that, in
practice, is about a year. Following this, the Bill
may be presented to The Queen for Royal Assent,

UK 2005
6 Government
provided the Commons has passed it in the current
session and previous session. There is one
important exception: any Bill to lengthen the life of
a Parliament needs the full assent of both Houses.
Secondary legislation
To reduce unnecessary pressure on parliamentary
time, primary legislation often gives ministers or
other authorities the power to make detailed rules
and regulations under an Act by means of
secondary or ‘delegated’ legislation (usually in the
form of‘statutory instruments’ or ‘Sis’). Such
powers are normally delegated only to authorities
directly accountable to Parliament or to the
devolved legislatures, to minimise the risk of
undermining the authority of the UK Parliament.
The number of Sis has been increasing, and in
2003 was nearly 3,400.6 7
To save time on the floor of the House, the
Commons uses standing committees to debate Sis,
unless they are simply laid before the House or
subject to negative resolution; actual decisions are
taken by the House as a whole. In the Lords,
debates on Sis take place on the floor of the
House. In contrast to primary legislation, the
Lords has the power of veto on non-fmancial Sis.
Joint committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn from
both Houses, are appointed in each session to deal
with Consolidation Bills' and Sis. The two Houses
may also agree to set up other joint committees.
With the increase in pre-legislative scrutiny (see
page 48), there has been a tendency for more draft
Bills to be considered by a joint committee.
Pressure groups
Pressure groups are informal organisations that
aim to influence Parliament and Government.
They campaign on a wide range of issues, such
as animal welfare, consumer and welfare rights,
education, the environment, health and rural
affairs. Some, like a number of trade unions,
charities and professional associations, have large
memberships. Others only have a few members.
The Government consults with appropriate
pressure groups on most major policy initiatives.
6 In addition, over 600 Sis concerning Scotland were issued by the
Scottish administration.
7 A Consolidation Bill brings together several existing Acts into one,
with the aim of simplifying the statutes.
A common tactic of pressure groups is to ask
members of the public to write to their MP about
an issue, in order to raise awareness and, in the
long term, to persuade the MP to support their
cause, to raise the issue in the House of Commons
and perhaps even effect a change in legislation.
Many pressure groups employ full-time
parliamentary workers or liaison officers, whose
job is to develop contacts with MPs and peers
sympathetic to their cause and to brief them on
the issues. Occasionally pressure groups may
organise a lobby of Parliament to express their
concerns, with sometimes large numbers of people
gathering outside or near Parliament.
The Monarchy
The Monarchy is the oldest institution of
government. The Queen’s full title is ‘Elizabeth
the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen,
Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the
Faith’.
In addition to being the Sovereign of the United
Kingdom, The Queen is Head of State of 15 other
realms" and Head of the Commonwealth (see page
71). In each country where she is Head of State,
Her Majesty is represented by a Governor-General,
appointed by her on the advice of the ministers of
the country concerned and independent of the UK
Government. In the Isle of Man, Jersey and the
Bailiwick of Guernsey Her Majesty is represented
by a Lieutenant-Governor. In the Overseas
Territories (see page 78) The Queen is usually
represented by a Governor who is a member of
the Diplomatic Service (see pages 59 and 80)
responsible to the UK Government.
Succession
The title to the Crown derives partly from statute
and partly from common law rules of descent.
Despite interruptions in the direct line of
succession, inheritance has always been how the
Monarchy has passed down the generations, with
sons of the Sovereign coming before daughters in
succeeding to the throne. When a daughter does

Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia, the
Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of James I
of England and VI of Scotland), are eligible to

Family in order of succession to the Throne are:
The Prince of Wales, Prince William of Wales,
Prince Henry of Wales, The Duke of York, Princess
Beatrice of York, Princess Eugenie of York and The
Earl of Wessex. Lady Louise Windsor, the daughter
of The Earl and Countess of Wessex, became
an Accession Council, to which all members of the
Privy Council (see page 53) are called. Members of
the House of Lords, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen
and other leading citizens of the City of London
are also invited.
Royal income, expenditure and
business activity
Public funds (known as the ‘Civil List’) and
government departments together meet the costs
52
UK 2005
6 Government
of The Queen’s official duties. In 2000 a Royal
Trustees’ Report recommended that Civil List
payments should remain at the 1991 level of
£7.9 million a year for a further ten years from
2001. About 70 per cent of The Queen’s Civil List
provision is needed to meet the cost of staff.
Under the Civil List, the Duke of Edinburgh
receives an annual parliamentary allowance of
£359,000 to enable him to carry out his public
duties. Parliamentary annuities paid to other
members of the Royal Family to carry out royal
duties are reimbursed by The Queen. In return
for the Civil List and other financial support. The
Queen surrenders the income from the Crown
Estate (£171 million in 2002/03) and other
hereditary revenues to the nation. The Prince of
Wales does not receive a parliamentary allowance
since he is entitled to the annual net revenues of
the Duchy of Cornwall.
According to the annual report of Civil List
expenditure, issued in June 2004, The Queen’s
total expenditure as Head of State in 2003/04 was
£36.8 million, of which £16.5 million was spent on
the upkeep of the royal palaces and £4.7 million
on royal travel (see box).
The Queen’s private expenditure as Sovereign
comes from the Privy Purse, which is financed
mainly from the revenues of the Duchy of
Lancaster;9 her expenditure as a private individual
is met from her own personal resources. Since
1993 The Queen has paid income tax on all
personal and Privy Purse income. She also pays tax
on realised capital gains on private investments
and on assets in the Privy Purse. The Prince of
Wales pays tax on the income from the Duchy of
Cornwall that is used for private purposes.
The Monarch's role in government
Over time the Monarchy’s power has been
gradually reduced. The Queen’s influence is mainly
informal and, having expressed her views, she
abides by the advice of her ministers. The Queen
continues to perform a range of duties, such as
summoning and dissolving Parliament, and giving
Royal Assent to legislation passed by the UK or
Scottish Parliament or, when it is sitting, by the
Northern Ireland Assembly. She formally appoints
9 The Duchy of Lancaster is a landed estate that has been held in
trust for the Sovereign since 1399. It is kept quite apart from his or
her other possessions and is separately administered by the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
Royal travel
Members of the Royal Family carry out about
3,000 official engagements a year, both in the
United Kingdom and overseas. Official
engagements involve a significant amount of
travel. The grant in aid for Royal travel was
£5.7 million in 2003/04 and actual expenditure
totalled £4.7 million.
In 2003/04 the Royal Train made 18 journeys,
with an average distance of 1,184 kilometres
per journey. Official flying for members of the
Royal Family is provided by jet aircraft of The
Royal Squadron, based at RAF Northolt, and a
helicopter operated from Blackbushe in
Hampshire. During 2003/04 the aircraft were
used for Royal flying for 334 hours and the
helicopter for 389 hours.
important office holders, including the Prime
Minister and other government ministers (see
page 54), the First Minister in Scotland, judges,
officers in the Armed Forces, governors, diplomats,
bishops and some other senior clergy of the
Church of England. The Queen confers peerages,
knighthoods and other honours.10 In international
affairs, as Head of State, she has the power to
declare war and make peace, to recognise foreign
states and conclude treaties.
The Queen holds Privy Council meetings, gives
audiences to her ministers and officials in the
United Kingdom and overseas, receives accounts of
Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs State
papers. She is consulted on many aspects of
national life, and must show complete impartiality.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was once the chief source of
executive power in the State, but as the system
of Cabinet government developed in the 18th
century, the Cabinet took on much of its role. The
Privy Council remains the main way in which

advice of the Prime Minister, a few - the Order of the Garter, the
Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian
Order - are granted by her personally.

Review of the honours system
A review of the honours system was set up under
Sir Hayden Phillips. Its recommendations
submitted in July 2004, included:
■ setting up public networks to stimulate
involvement so that nominations reflect the
diversity of society and achievements of
individuals;
■ ensuring that the specialist committees that
advise on honours are chaired by people
independent of the Government and the civil
service, and that non-civil service experts form
a majority of the committee members; and
■ reducing the number of public servants
(members of the civil service, Diplomatic
Service and the military) who receive awards
from 27 per cent to 20 per cent within the
next three to five years.
The Phillips Review recommendations will be
considered alongside the Fifth Report to the
House of Commons Public Administration Select
Committee, which also proposes reforms to the
honours system.
ministers advise The Queen on the approval of
Orders in Council (such as those granting Royal
Charters or enacting subordinate legislation) or
on the issue of royal proclamations (such as the
summoning or dissolving of Parliament).
The Privy Council consists of all members of the
Cabinet, other senior politicians, senior judges
and some individuals from the Commonwealth.
Appointment is for life but only members of the
Government participate in its policy work. The
Prime Minister recommends membership of the
Privy Council to the Sovereign. In August 2004
there were some 530 members.
Privy Council Office
The secretariat of the Privy Council is the Privy
Council Office (PCO), the smallest autonomous
government department. This is headed at
ministerial level by the Lord President of the
Council, a post that is usually combined with
another senior post, currently that of Leader of
the House of Lords. Much of the work of the PCO
is concerned with the affairs of about 400
institutions, charities and companies incorporated
by Royal Charter, together with responsibilities in
connection with higher education and with certain
statutory regulatory bodies covering a number of
the professions.
Committees of the Privy Council
Privy Council committees (of which the Cabinet
is technically one) are normally made up of
ministers with the relevant policy interest. The
Judicial Committee, whose members have held
high judicial office, is the final court of appeal
from courts in UK Overseas Territories, those
Commonwealth countries that have retained this
method of appeal after independence, and in the
Isle of Man, Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey.
The Committee also considers devolution issues
concerning the powers and functions of the
executive and legislative authorities in Scotland
and Northern Ireland, and the competence and
functions of the National Assembly for Wales.
Her Majesty's Government
The Government consists of ministers
responsible for the conduct of national affairs.
After a General Election, The Queen appoints the
leader of the party that won the most seats in
the House of Commons as Prime Minister. She
appoints all other ministers on the Prime
Minister’s recommendation. About 100 members
of the governing party receive ministerial
appointments. Most ministers are MPs; the
remainder sit in the Lords.
The composition of governments varies both in
the number of ministers and in the titles of some
offices. New ministerial offices may be created,
others may be abolished, and functions may be
transferred from one minister to another.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is head of the UK Government
and is ultimately responsible for the policy and
decisions of government. By tradition, the Prime
Minister is also First Lord of the Treasury and
Minister for the Civil Service. By modern
convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the
Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the Cabinet and
is responsible for allocating functions among
54
UK 2005
6 Government
ministers, has regular meetings with The Queen to
inform her of the general business of the
Government, and recommends a number of
appointments to The Queen (including senior
clergy). The Prime Minister represents the United
Kingdom at major international events, such as
the annual meeting of the Group of Eight leading
industrialised countries (see page 72).
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is the supreme decision-making body
in the UK Government. The Prime Minister chairs
meetings of the Cabinet and appoints its
members, normally about 20. In September 2004
there were 22 Cabinet ministers - 20 MPs and two
peers - while a third peer, the Government Chief
Whip in the House of Lords, also usually attends
Cabinet meetings.
The Cabinet usually meets weekly, normally on
a Thursday morning. It meets in private and its
business is confidential, although after 30 years
Cabinet papers usually become available for
inspection in the National Archives.
Much of the work of the Cabinet is delegated to
Cabinet committees. They provide a framework
for collective consideration of, and decisions on,
major policy issues and matters of significant
public interest, and ensure that the views of all
relevant ministers are considered. Some of the
committees have subcommittees, which focus on
a narrower range of issues. Cabinet committees
include those dealing with defence and overseas
policy; economic affairs, productivity and
competitiveness; public services and public
expenditure; the environment; and constitutional
reform policy.
Ministerial responsibility
The Cabinet balances ministers’ individual duties
with their collective responsibility as members of
the Government and takes the final decisions on
all government policy. The convention of collective
responsibility means that all ministers
unanimously support government policy once
it has been settled. The policy of departmental
ministers must agree with the policy of the
Government as a whole. Once the Government
has decided its policy on a particular matter, each
minister is expected to support it or resign. On
rare occasions, ministers are allowed free votes in
Parliament on important issues of principle or
conscience. Ministers are individually accountable
for the work of their departments and agencies,
and have a duty to Parliament to answer for their
policies, decisions and actions.
On taking up office ministers resign directorships
in private and public companies, and must ensure
that there is no conflict between their public duties
and private interests. Detailed guidance on
handling ministers’ financial interests is set out in
the Ministerial Code.
Cabinet and other ministers
The Deputy Prime Minister is First Secretary
of State, deputising for the Prime Minister in
the United Kingdom and abroad and chairing
a number of Cabinet committees and
subcommittees. The Office of the Deputy Prime
Minister (ODPM) has responsibilities for regional
policy; local government (including finance); and
planning, housing and regeneration. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer manages the business
of HM Treasury and is responsible for presenting
annually to Parliament the Budget and the Pre-
Budget Report (see page 347).
Ministers in charge of the other main government
departments are usually members of the Cabinet.
Most have the title ‘Secretary of State’.
Holders of various traditional offices, namely the
Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, the Lord Privy Seal, the
Paymaster General and Ministers without Portfolio,
may have few or no departmental duties. They are
therefore available to carry out any duties the Prime
Minister may wish to give them.
Ministers of state are middle-ranking ministers
and are not usually in the Cabinet. They normally
have specific responsibilities, usually reflected in
their titles, for example, ‘Minister for Lifelong
Learning, Further and Higher Education’. The
most junior ministers are parliamentary under¬
secretaries of state (or, where the senior minister
is not a secretary of state, simply parliamentary
secretaries).
Ministerial salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons (from April 2004) start at £86,173 a
year for a parliamentary under-secretary, rising
to £95,281 for a minister of state, £130,347 for a
55
6 Government
UK 2005
Cabinet minister and £178,922 for the Prime
Minister (inclusive of the parliamentary salary).
In the House of Lords the Lord Chancellor is
entitled to a salary of £207,736 and the Attorney
General £103,461. Other ministerial salaries in the
Lords range from £67,255 for a parliamentary
under-secretary to £77,220 for a minister of state
and to £98,899 for a Cabinet minister.
Prime Minister's Office
The Prime Minister’s Office, No 10 (so called after
the Prime Minister’s official residence at 10
Downing Street), supports him in his role as head
of government. It works with the Cabinet Office
to provide central direction for the development,
implementation and presentation of government
policy. No 10 is staffed by a mixture of civil
servants and special advisers (see page 57) and is
headed by a chief of staff.
A number of units within the Cabinet Office assist
the Prime Minister including:
■ the Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit, which
works in partnership with other departments
to assess delivery and provide performance
management for key priority areas;
■ the Strategy Unit, which carries out long-term
strategic reviews and policy analysis;
■ the e-Government Unit (see page 63); and
■ the Office of Public Services Reform, which is
taking forward the Government’s principles
of public service reform.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office aims to make government
more effective by providing a strong centre. It
works to four objectives:
■ supporting the Prime Minister in leading the
Government;
■ coordinating activity across government;
■ improving delivery by building capacity in
departments and the public services; and
■ promoting standards that ensure good
governance, including adherence to the
Ministerial and Civil Service Codes.

Government Car and Despatch Agency
The Government Car and Despatch Agency
(GCDA), an executive agency of the Cabinet
Office. Its three main operations are the
Government Car Service, which provides driver
and car hire, a taxi booking service, protected
security cars and specially trained drivers; the
InterDespatch Service, which runs secure mail
services within government and the wider public
sector; and the Government Mail Service, which
offers a range of mailroom, messenger and
reprographic services, and secure mail screening.
In 2004 the GCDA used 207 cars and 59 vans
and other vehicles.
I  ^
Government departments
The main role of government departments and
their agencies is to implement government policy
and advise ministers. They are staffed by politically
impartial civil servants and generally receive their
funding from money provided by Parliament.
They often work alongside local authorities,
non-departmental public bodies, and other
government-sponsored organisations. The
structure and functions of departments are
sometimes reorganised if there are major changes
in government policy or to improve efficiency. The
Government has announced that the Inland
Revenue and HM Customs and Excise will merge
to form Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (see
page 371).
Most departments are headed by secretaries of
state, supported by ministers. However, some
are non-ministerial departments headed by a
permanent office holder and secretaries of state
with other duties are accountable for them to
Parliament. Non-ministerial departments include
the Food Standards Agency.
The functions and geographic remit of the main
government departments and agencies are set out
in appendix A, pages 481-95.
Non-departmental public bodies
A non-departmental public body (NDPB,
sometimes known as a ‘quango’) is a national or
regional public body, working independently of
56
UK 2005
6 Government
ministers to whom it is accountable. There are two
main types of NDPB:
■ Executive NDPBs have executive,
administrative, commercial or regulatory
functions. They work within a government
framework and the degree of operational
independence varies. Examples include the
seven Research Councils.
■ Advisory NDPBs provide independent
and expert advice to ministers and their
departments on particular matters. An
examples is the Medicines Commission.
Some Royal Commissions are also classified
as advisory NDPBs.
Over 800 NDPBs are sponsored by UK
government departments. The annual Cabinet
Office directory Public Bodies is available
electronically via the Cabinet Office website.
The Civil Service
The constitutional and practical role of the Civil
Service in Great Britain is to help the Government
of the United Kingdom and the devolved
administrations formulate their policies, carry out
decisions and administer public services for which
they are responsible. There is a separate Northern
Ireland Civil Service (see page 59).
Civil servants are servants of the Crown; in effect
this means the Government of the United
Kingdom and the devolved administrations.
Ministers, who are answerable to the appropriate
Parliament or Assembly, generally exercise
executive powers. The duty of the individual civil
servant is first and foremost to the minister in
charge of the department or body in which he or
she is serving, although a civil servant must
remain politically impartial. A change of minister,
for whatever reason, does not involve a change of
staff.
With the exception of the Prime Minister, Cabinet
ministers may each appoint up to two special
advisers. The Prime Minister may also authorise
the appointment of one or two special advisers by
ministers who regularly attend Cabinet. The Prime
Minister approves all appointments and they are
paid for from public funds. In July 2004 there were
84 special advisers, including 28 in the Prime
Minister’s Office. Their appointments end when
the Government’s term of office finishes, or when
the appointing minister leaves the Government or
moves to another appointment.
Civil servants
During the last ten years the number of civil
servants in Great Britain declined up to 1999, but
since then the number has risen (Table 6.5). In
the year to October 2003 the number of permanent
civil servants (on a full-time equivalent basis) rose
by 3.5 per cent to 516,990. After taking account of
the fall of 8.2 per cent in the number of casual staff,
total staff rose by 3.2 per cent to 527,650. There has
been a large increase in part-time working over
the last ten years: in 2003, on a headcount basis,
16.4 per cent of permanent civil servants worked
part time, compared with 9.2 per cent in 1993.

UK 2005
In April 2003 about half of all civil servants
(full-time equivalent) provided services direct to
the public. These included paying benefits and
pensions, running employment services, staffing
prisons, issuing driving licences, and providing
services to industry and agriculture. The rest were
divided between central administrative and policy
duties; support services; and services that were
largely financially self-supporting.
Equality and diversity
The Civil Service aims to create a culture in which
the skills, experience and expertise that individuals
bring are valued and used. In October 2003, on a
headcount basis, some 52.4 per cent of civil servants
were female; minority ethnic representation was
8.1 per cent; and about 4.3 per cent of staff
employed were known to have a disability.
One of the Cabinet Office’s targets is to ensure
that the Civil Service becomes more open and
diverse. In particular, there are targets that by
2004/05, 35 per cent of the Senior Civil Service
(SCS) should be women, and 25 per cent of the top
management posts should be filled by women. The
figures in October 2003 were 27.5 per cent of SCS
members and 23.9 per cent of those in the top
management posts (including three at Permanent
Secretary level). The 2004/05 target that 3.2 per cent
of the SCS should be from declared minority ethnic
backgrounds was met in October 2003, while the
1.7 per cent of the SCS with declared disabilities
compared with a 2004/05 target of 3.0 per cent.

independent of government, are responsible for
ensuring that recruitment to the Civil Service is
made on merit on the basis of fair and open
competition. The Commissioners produce a
recruitment code, monitor the recruitment
policies and practices of departments and
agencies, and participate in recruitment to the
most senior posts. They also promote the Civil
Service Code, which sets out the constitutional
framework within which all civil servants work
and the values they are expected to uphold.
Central management
As Minister for the Civil Service, the Prime
Minister is responsible for the central coordination
and management of the Civil Service. He is
Public sector efficiency and relocation
In the 2004 Budget the Government announced
plans to cut its administration costs in real terms
and to achieve efficiency gains across the public
sector of 2.5 per cent a year over the three years
of the 2004 Spending Review. The Spending
Review (see page 368) included agreed
departmental targets for achieving annual
efficiencies of over £20 billion a year by 2007/08.
It took account of an independent review of
public sector efficiency by Sir Peter Gershon.
Efficiency programmes include plans to achieve
a gross reduction in Civil Service and military
posts in administrative and support functions of
84,150 by 2007/08. Some 13,550 posts will be
redeployed to support key front-line activities,
leading to a net reduction in posts of 70,600.
The Government has accepted all the
recommendations of an independent review of
public sector relocation, the Lyons Review, which
was published in March 2004. This found that the
concentration of activity in and around London
was inconsistent with government objectives for
efficiency and regional development. Measures
being taken include:
■ relocation of staff - departments have
confirmed 20,000 jobs for dispersal from
London and the South East, which should be
completed by 2010;
■ slimming down of Whitehall headquarters,
with departments reviewing the size and
functions of their London offices; and
■ a presumption against locating government
functions in London and the South East, other
than 'face-to-face' services.
supported by the Head of the Home Civil Service
(whose function is combined with that of the
Cabinet Secretary), who is responsible for leading
the programme of Civil Service reform and for the
most senior appointments in the Civil Service. The
Cabinet Office oversees the central framework for
management of the Civil Service. Responsibility
for a range of terms and conditions has been
delegated to departments and agencies, and to the
devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales.

Executive agencies
Executive agencies were introduced to deliver
government services more efficiently and
effectively within available resources and to
become more responsive to their customers. They
are part of the Civil Service but have delegated
authority to employ their own staff and organise
service provision. Agencies are headed by chief
executives who are personally responsible for day-
to-day operations. They are normally directly
accountable to the responsible minister, who in
turn is accountable to Parliament.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service of some 6,000 people
provides staff for the Foreign & Commonwealth
Office (ECO, see page 80) in London and at UK
diplomatic missions abroad. Terms and conditions
of service are comparable with the rest of the Civil
Service, but take into account the special demands
of the Diplomatic Service, particularly the
requirement to serve abroad. UK civil servants,
members of the Armed Forces and individuals
from the private sector may serve in the ECO and
at overseas posts on loan or attachment.
Northern Ireland Civil Service
The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) is
modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, and
has its own Civil Service Commission. Its role is
to support the Northern Ireland Executive in
the administration of public services for which it
has responsibility. During the suspension of
devolution (see page 33), the NICS reports to the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. There
were about 27,000 permanent non-industrial civil
servants in the NICS at 31 March 2004, on a
full-time equivalent basis.
Local government
The structure of local government in each part of
the United Kingdom is given in chapters 2 to 5. In
July 2004 the Government announced a debate on
what local government in England should look
like in ten years’ time (see chapter 2).
Elections
Local authorities in Great Britain consist of over
22,000 elected councillors. The procedure for local
government voting is broadly similar to that for
elections to the UK Parliament, except that
proportional representation is used in Northern
Ireland, and has been introduced in Scotland in
time for the next local government elections in
2007. Eligibility rules for voters are also similar to
those for UK parliamentary elections (see page 40),
except that citizens of other EU Member States and
Members of the House of Lords may vote. To stand
for election, candidates must either be registered as
an elector or have some other close connection
within the electoral area of their candidature, such
as their principal place of employment.
Powers
Local authorities work within the powers laid
down under various Acts of Parliament. Their
functions are far-reaching. Some are mandatory,
which means that the authority must do what is
required by law, while others are discretionary,
allowing an authority to provide services if it
wishes. In certain cases, ministers have powers to
secure uniformity in standards to safeguard public
health or to protect the rights of individual
citizens. Where local authorities exceed their
statutory powers, they are regarded as acting
outside the law and can be challenged in court.
Local councils’ annual accounts must be audited
by independent auditors appointed by the
appropriate audit body.
The main link between local authorities and
central government in England is the ODPM.
However, the Departments for Education
and Skills; Work and Pensions; Health; and
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; and the
Home Office are also concerned with various local
government functions.
As their work is largely in devolved areas, local
authorities in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland now deal mainly with the devolved
Parliament and Assemblies (see chapters 3 to 5).
Provision of local services
Many of the provisions of the Local Government
Act 2003, which is designed to give greater freedom
and flexibility to local authorities in England
and Wales, took effect in November 2003. Local
authorities have been given new powers intended
to increase diversity and choice in public services.
All local authorities can conduct advisory polls to
help them engage with the wider community and
59
6 Government
UK 2005
business. Powers for the payment of government
grants to authorities now have fewer restrictions
on how the grants can be used.
In April 2004 a new regime for local government
borrowing came into force under the Act. Local
authorities no longer have to seek government
permission for borrowing for capital investment,
providing that they can afford to service the debt.
Local authorities can also introduce Business
Improvement Districts from October 2004 to
enhance town centres and other areas.
Efficiency
The Government has introduced measures designed
to improve the delivery and value for money of
local services. The Comprehensive Performance
Assessment (CPA) framework was introduced in
2002 and brings together assessments of individual
local services and an assessment of the corporate
capacity of each authority, to give an overall view
of how each authority is performing and how well
it is placed to deliver improvements. CPA has been
introduced for all single-tier and county councils in
England and is gradually being introduced for
district councils. The Audit Commission is
consulting on a revised CPA from 2005 onwards,
which will provide a stronger focus on the
importance of delivering value for money as well
as looking at local government’s community
leadership role.
The duty of Best Value requires local authorities to
deliver services by the most economic, efficient and
effective means available to meet the requirements
of their communities. Best Value Performance
Indicators (BVPIs) were introduced in 2000/01.
The ODPM and the Local Government
Association jointly launched the National
Procurement Strategy for Local Government in
October 2003. The three-year strategy includes
a range of policies and programmes targeting
improvements in procurement practices; local
authorities spend around £40 billion a year. Nine
new regional Centres of Procurement Excellence
were announced in February 2004 to provide
expertise to local authorities and to build on
existing good practice.
Local Public Service Agreements (PSAs) are
voluntary agreements negotiated between
individual local authorities and the Government,
under which an authority is rewarded by a grant if
it achieves a demanding performance target. The
Government has concluded agreements with 135
local authorities in England eligible for a local PSA.
A second generation of local PSAs is being
introduced, with the first agreements running from
April 2004. The new PSAs focus on local priorities
and building more effective local partnerships,
both within and outside local government.
Employees
About 2.8 million people were employed by local
authorities in the United Kingdom in June 2003.
These include school teachers, the police,
firefighters, and other non-manual and manual
workers. Education is the largest service, with
about 1.4 million jobs.
Internal organisation
Some districts have the ceremonial title of borough,
or city, both granted by royal authority.
Traditionally, their councillors choose a mayor (a
provost in Scotland) to act as presiding officer and
perform ceremonial duties. In certain large cities, he
or she is known as the Lord Mayor. In Scotland the
presiding officer of the council of the four longest
The Fire and Rescue Service
The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 replaces
the Fire Services Act 1947 with a new framework
designed to reflect a modern and efficient Fire
and Rescue Service. Promoting fire safety has
become a statutory duty for all fire and rescue
authorities. The Act also places on a statutory
footing the other activities now undertaken,
including rescue from road traffic accidents
and the Service's role in dealing with other
emergencies, such as serious flooding and
responding to the threat of terrorism.
The Act gives statutory effect to the Fire and
Rescue National Framework, which sets out the
strategic priorities of the Fire and Rescue Service.
It also provides for the devolution of the
remaining responsibilities for fire and rescue
authorities in Wales to the National Assembly for
Wales. Responsibility for the Service is already
devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

established cities - Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh
and Glasgow - is called the Lord Provost.
The Local Government Act 2000 required local
authorities in England and Wales to implement
new decision-taking structures, including the
option of a directly elected mayor. In most
authorities the arrangements are based on one of
three executive frameworks: a mayor and cabinet;
a council leader and cabinet; or a mayor and
council manager. Within these options local
authorities have considerable flexibility to work
under a constitution that reflects local
circumstances. All local authorities have
introduced new constitutions, with the majority
opting for a style of executive where the leader of
the cabinet is chosen by other councillors. By June
2004 there had been 30 referendums on mayors,
leaders and cabinets, and 11 had voted in favour
of a directly elected mayor.
Councillors are paid a basic allowance but may also
be entitled to allowances and expenses for attending
meetings or taking on special responsibilities.
Decision-making and scrutiny
All new decision-making structures are required
to incorporate rigorous arrangements for review
and scrutiny of councils’ policies and the decisions
they make. Some decisions, such as the acceptance
of policies and the budget, are reserved for the full
council, but most of those relating to the
implementation of policy are for the executive.
The executive is also responsible for preparing the
policies and budget to propose to the council.
The public (including the press) is admitted to
meetings of the executive when key decisions are
being discussed. They also have access to agendas,
reports and minutes of meetings and certain
background papers. In addition, local authorities
must publish a forward plan setting out the
decisions that will be taken over the coming
months. Local authorities may exclude the public
from meetings and withhold papers only in
limited circumstances. Provisions of the Freedom
of Information Act 2000 (see page 63) with regard
to publication schemes apply to local authorities
as public bodies, as will full implementation of the
Act from January 2005.
Local authority finance
Local government expenditure accounts for about
a quarter of public spending in the United
Kingdom. In 2003/04 expenditure by UK local
authorities was an estimated £119.5 billion: £108.7
billion on current expenditure and £10.9 billion
on net capital expenditure (Table 6.6).
Local authorities in Great Britain raise revenue
through the council tax (see chapter 23); in England
this meets about 25 per cent of their revenue
expenditure. Their spending is, however, financed
primarily by grants from central government or the
devolved administrations and by the redistribution
of revenue from national non-domestic rates, a
property tax levied on businesses and other non¬
domestic properties. Capital expenditure is financed
from several sources: central government capital
grant; capital receipts from the disposal of land and
buildings; and borrowing (including borrowing
supported by the Government, and borrowing that
is locally financed). The Government has powers to
ensure that increases in local authority budgets and
council tax are not excessive, and in April 2004 the
Deputy Prime Minister announced that the 2004/05
budgets of 14 local authorities in England that set
excessive increases for 2004/05 would be capped.
Poliowing a review of local government funding in
England, published in July 2004, the Government
has agreed that council tax should be retained, but
that there is a case for reform. It has therefore set

up an independent inquiry to advise on how to
take forward the review’s findings. District
councils in Northern Ireland continue to raise
revenue through the levying of a domestic rate
and a business rate (see page 35).
Standards and accountability
A number of safeguards are in place to ensure the
probity of individuals in carrying out their public
duties.
Committee on Standards in Public Life
The Committee on Standards in Public Life is an
independent body reporting to the Prime Minister.
It has responsibility for examining concerns about
the standards of conduct of all holders of public
office and making recommendations for changes to
ensure the highest standards of propriety in public
life.
Since its establishment in 1994 the Committee
has produced nine reports. These have resulted in
a number of changes, including a new regulatory
regime for political party funding, overseen by the
Electoral Commission (see page 39); and changes
in the ethical framework for local government.
The Committee is conducting its tenth inquiry,
and aims to report by the end of 2004. It is looking
at the processes for maintaining high standards of
conduct in public bodies, local government and
the National Health Service.
Parliamentary standards
Arrangements governing parliamentary standards
have been adopted following recommendations of
the Committee on Standards in Public Life. These
included:
■ a new code of conduct for MPs;
■ an improved Register of Members’ Interests
(MPs with a financial interest must declare it
when speaking in the House or in
Committee); and
■ a new independent Parliamentary
Commissioner for Standards, reporting to a
strengthened House of Commons Select
Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Code of Conduct, revised in 2002, requires
MPs, among other things, to uphold the law and
the constitution, always act in the public interest,
not bring the House of Commons into disrepute,
observe the main principles of public life as set out
by the Committee, and observe the House’s rules
such as on registering and declaring interests.
Responsibilities of the Parliamentary
Commissioner for Standards include overseeing
the maintenance of the Register, monitoring the
operation of the Code of Conduct, and advising
the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges
on interpretation of the Code.
The House of Lords has its own register on similar
lines to that for MPs, based on a separate Code of
Conduct that came into force in 2002.
Commissioner for Public Appointments
The Commissioner for Public Appointments is
independent of government and is responsible for
regulating, monitoring and reporting on
ministerial appointments to the boards of a range
of public bodies - in 2002/03 ministers made
nearly 3,500 appointments and reappointments to
the boards of public bodies. The aim is to
ensure that government departments have
appointments systems that are visible, fair and
open, and that all board appointments are made
on merit. Departments are required to follow the
Commissioner’s Code of Practice; a new Code was
issued in February 2004.
Complaints
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration
The Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration - more usually known as the
Parliamentary Ombudsman - investigates
complaints from members of the public (that have
been referred by MPs) alleging that they have been
unfairly treated through maladministration. The
Ombudsman is independent of government and
reports to a select committee of the House of
Commons. The Ombudsman’s area of authority
covers maladministration by government
departments and certain other public bodies, but
excludes complaints about government policy, the
content of legislation and certain other matters.
When a complaint is upheld, the Ombudsman
normally recommends that the department or
other body makes some kind of redress (which
might be financial in appropriate cases). There is
62
UK 2005
6 Government
no appeal against the Ombudsman’s decision. The
Ombudsman received 1,981 new complaints in
2003/04, an increase of 0.4 per cent on 2002/03.
Separate arrangements apply for complaints about
the devolved administrations and devolved public
bodies. In Wales complaints can be made directly
to the Welsh Administration Ombudsman (from
November 2004 the Welsh Public Services
Ombudsman), in Scotland to the Scottish Public
Services Ombudsman and in Northern Ireland to
the Northern Ireland Ombudsman.
Local government
Complaints of maladministration by local
authorities or by certain local bodies are
investigated by independent Commissions for
Local Administration, often known as ‘the
Local Ombudsman service’. There are Local
Government Ombudsmen in England and Wales.
In Scotland responsibility rests with the Scottish
Public Services Ombudsman and in Northern
Ireland there is a Commissioner for Complaints.
Modernising government
The Government has set out four principles of
public service reform:
■ high national standards designed to ensure
that citizens have the right to high-quality
services wherever they live;
■ devolving decision-making, so that local
leaders have responsibility and accountability
for delivery;
■ greater flexibility in the delivery of public
services; and
■ more choice for the customers of public
services, including greater choice of service
provider.
The Government has taken a number of measures
to modernise and improve public services. PSAs
set out each government department’s plans to
deliver results in return for the investment being
made and include the department’s aims,
objectives and performance targets.
Electronic services in central and local
government
The Government has set a target that all its
services will be available electronically by the end
of 2005. The Office of the e-Envoy (OeE), which
had been helping to ensure that departments meet
Freedom of information
The Freedom of Information Act 2000 mW be
brought fully into force on 1 January 2005. The
Act will affect over 100,000 organisations,
including central and local government, Parliament,
the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern
Ireland Assembly (when it is sitting), the Armed
Forces, the police, hospitals, GPs and dentists,
schools and publicly funded museums. The Act
and associated environmental information
regulations will apply in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The Scottish Parliament has
enacted separate legislation, which will also be
fully operative from 1 January 2005.
The Act establishes a general statutory right of
access so that a person who contacts a public
authority seeking information will have the right
to be told whether or not the authority has the
information and, if so, to be sent it. There are
exemptions specified under the Act, many of
which are subject to a 'public interest' test: the
authority will be required to disclose the
information unless it can demonstrate that the
public interest in withholding the information
outweighs that in releasing it. Any decision not to
disclose the information may be subject to appeal
to the independent Information Commissioner.
this target, was reorganised in 2004 as the e-
Government Unit. One of the key responsibilities
of the new unit will be to help implement the
efficiency decisions that were announced in the
2004 Spending Review (see page 368). By the end
of March 2004, 74 per cent of central government
services were available electronically.
There is a similar target for the electronic
availability of local government services in
England; in particular, local government is
committed to making all its priority services
electronically available by 2005.
In March 2004 the OeE launched ‘Directgov’
(www.direct.gov.uk), a new online service which
is also available through digital TV. Directgov is
designed to make it easier to find and access
government services on the Internet. Over time it
aims to become the first destination for people
63

UK 2005
seeking information about public services. There
are plans to offer information from up to 100 local
authorities by the end of 2004.
The Government Gateway {www.gateway.gov.uk)
acts as an ‘intelligent hub’ - verifying transactions
from citizens and businesses, and routeing them to
and from appropriate government departments.
Examples of services that were on the Gateway
by August 2004 included Export Licence
Applications, electronic VAT returns and income
tax self-assessment.
Government communications
Following an independent review published in
January 2004, the Government has appointed a
new Permanent Secretary for Government
Communications, responsible for the strategy,
coordination and effectiveness of government
communications across Whitehall. He is taking
forward, in consultation with departments, the
review's recommendations concerning a
redefinition of the overall role of government
communications; the structures necessary to
deliver this activity, some of which are run by the
Government Information and Communications
Service; and improved training and development
of all communications specialists.
The UK in the European Union
As a Member State of the European Union (EU),
the United Kingdom is bound by European
Community (EC) legislation and agreements
under EU law based on a series of treaties since
the 1950s (see pages 67-69). Almost all UK
government departments are involved in EU-wide
business, and European legislation is an
increasingly important element of government.
The EC enacts legislation that is binding in its
entirety or its intention on the national
governments of the Member States or, in certain
circumstances, on individuals and companies
within those states. UK government ministers take
part in the discussions and decision-making, and
all the Member States take the final decision
collectively.
A constitutional treaty for the enlarged EU (see
page 69) was finalised by the EU Heads of State
and Government in June 2004.
The Office of the UK Permanent Representative to
the European Union (UKREP), based in Brussels,
participates in the negotiations on behalf of the UK
Government, alongside Whitehall-based officials as
necessary. Following UK devolution, the devolved
administrations are consulted when the UK
Government line on EU issues is developed.
Council of Ministers
This is the main decision-making body. Member
States are represented by the ministers appropriate
to the subject under discussion. When, for
instance, health matters are being discussed, the
UK Secretary of State for Health attends with his
or her European counterparts. Ministers from the
devolved administrations can also attend these
meetings and, at the appropriate UK minister’s
request, devolved administration ministers can
represent the United Kingdom. The Presidency of
the Council changes at six-monthly intervals and
rotates in turn among the Member States.
In some cases Council decisions must be
unanimous; but in most cases they are taken by
qualified majority voting where, until 31 October
2004, a proposal is adopted if it gets 88 or more of
the total of 124 votes. Votes are weighted according
to a country’s population, and the United
Kingdom has ten votes. The system will be adapted
with effect from 1 November 2004 when the
United Kingdom will have 29 out of 345 votes.
European Council
This usually meets four times a year, twice under
each six-monthly Presidency, and comprises the
Heads of State or Government (accompanied by
their foreign ministers) and the President of the
European Commission. The Council defines
strategy and general political guidelines. At its
meetings (referred to as European Summits), the
Council will signal its commitment to particular
courses of action.
European Commission
The European Commission is the EU’s executive
body and guardian of the treaties. It implements the
decisions of the Council of Ministers as well as
certain executive decisions under its own authority,

initiates legislation and ensures that Member States
put it into effect. Each Commissioner is responsible
for a specific policy area. The Commissioners are
entirely independent of their countries, and serve
the EU as a whole. From November 2004 the
number of Commissioners will be set at 25, one for
each Member State.
European Parliament
The number of directly elected Members of the
European Parliament (MEPs) increased from 626
in 1999 to 732 in 2004, to take account of the
increased membership of the EU (see page 71).
The Parliament is consulted about major decisions
and has shared power with the Council of
Ministers over the EU budget (see page 69). In
areas of legislation, its role varies between
consultation, where it can influence but does not
have the final say in the content of legislation;
co-operation and assent procedures, where its
influence is greater; and co-decision, where a
proposal requires the agreement of both the
Council and the European Parliament. The
Parliament meets in full session in Strasbourg for
about one week every month. Its committee work
normally takes place in Brussels. Successive treaties
have increased the Parliament’s role in scrutinising
the activities of the Commission and have
extended its legislative and budgetary powers.
Elections to the European Parliament take place
every five years. For the June 2004 election the
number of MEPs in most existing Member States
were reduced to accommodate representatives
from the ten states that joined the EU in May
2004. The European Parliament (Representation)
Act 2003 made provision for the number of UK
MEPs to be reduced from 87 to 78.
European legislation
Some European legislation is adopted jointly by
the Council of Ministers and the European
Parliament, some by the Council and some by the
Commission under delegated powers. European
laws can be split into four main types:
■ regulations, which are directly applicable in
all Member States, and have the force of law
without the need for implementing further
measures;
■ directives, which are equally binding as to the
result to be achieved but allow each Member
State to choose the form and method of
implementation;
European elections
As in the rest of the EU, the elections in the
United Kingdom in June 2004 were conducted
using a system of proportional representation: in
Great Britain a vote for a 'closed' party list
counted using the d'Hondt system (see glossary)
and in Northern Ireland the single transferable
vote system. The 78 seats were divided into 12
electoral regions: England, with 64 seats (split
into nine regions, each returning between three
and ten MEPs); Scotland (with seven seats);
Wales (four seats) and Northern Ireland (three
seats). The main features of the vote in the
United Kingdom were a decline in the proportion
of votes won by the Conservative Party and the
Labour Party, both of which won fewer seats than
in the 1999 election, and a rise in the proportion
of votes gained by other parties. Both the UK
Independence Party and the Liberal Democrats
increased their number of seats, from 3 and 10
respectively in 1999, to 12 each in 2004. Turnout
was significantly higher than in 1999, reaching
38.8 per cent.

Other EU institutions
The European Court of Justice, which comprises
judges from the Member States, is the final
authority on all aspects of Community law.
It rules on questions relating to interpretation of
the EU treaties, on secondary legislation in direct
actions, and on cases referred to it by national
courts. There is a Court of First Instance to deal
with certain specified issues brought by
individuals and companies. The United Kingdom
is also represented on the European Court of
Auditors, which is responsible for ensuring that
the EU spends its money according to its
budgetary rules and for the purposes for which
it is intended.
The United Kingdom is represented on the
Committee of the Regions by elected members
from devolved administrations and local
authorities. In addition, it is represented on the
European Economic and Social Committee by
appointees from employer and employee
organisations, and producer and consumer
groups.

The United Kingdom has global foreign policy
interests. It belongs to more international
organisations than any other country except
France, and is a member of the European Union
(EU), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO, see page 91), the Group of Eight (G8, see
page 72), the Commonwealth (see page 71) the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (OSCE, see page 72), as well as being a
permanent member of the United Nations (UN)
Security Council (see page 71).
In December 2003, the UK Government outlined
priorities for UK foreign policy over the next five
to ten years. They are:
■ a world that is safer from global terrorism
and weapons of mass destruction;
■ the protection of the United Kingdom from
illegal immigration, drug trafficking and
other international crime;
■ an international system based on the rule of
law that is able to resolve disputes and prevent
conflicts;
■ an effective EU in a secure neighbourhood;
■ the promotion of UK economic interests in
an open and expanding global economy;
■ sustainable development, underpinned by
democracy, good governance and human
rights;
■ the security of UK and global energy supplies;
and
■ the security and good governance of the UK
Overseas Territories.
The UK Government believes that no country can
tackle these issues alone. The most important UK
partnerships will remain within the EU and with
the United States. The United Kingdom will also
seek to develop stronger strategic relationships
with states such as China, India, Japan and Russia,
and will engage constructively with Islamic
countries.
European Union
The United Kingdom joined the EU in 1973. The
EU promotes coordinated social and economic
progress and common foreign and security
positions among its Member States, and has
established a single market and an economic and
monetary union. Principal EU institutions and its
legislative processes are described on pages 64-66.
The Government published a White Paper, Prospects
for the EU, in April 2004. This will form part of a
regular series that sets out the forthcoming
programmes of the Council of Ministers and the
European Commission.
Treaties
A series of treaties created by Intergovernmental
Conferences (IGCs) govern the structure and
operation of the EU. Any amendments to the
treaties must be agreed unanimously and must
then be ratified by each Member State according
to its own constitutional procedures. In the United
Kingdom, Parliament must scrutinise and where
necessary provide legislative powers to implement
new EU treaties before they can be ratified.
Treaties of Rome
The 1957 Treaties of Rome established the
European Community (EC) and the European
Atomic Energy Agency (Euratom). The EC set out
to create a common market encompassing the
67
7 International relations
UK 2005
elimination of customs duties between Member
States, free movement of goods, people, services
and capital, and the removal of distortions in
competition within this market. It also aimed to
coordinate transport and establish common
agricultural and economic policies. Euratom was
set up to develop a common market in the
peaceful uses of atomic energy. Under the Treaties
of Rome, the Member States granted the European
Commission a mandate to negotiate international
trade agreements on their behalf.
The 1986 Single European Act, which incorporated
measures to complete the single market,
reaffirmed these aims. It also provided, for the first
time, a formal treaty basis for European political
co-operation, the precursor to the common
foreign and security policy (CFSP, see page 70);
increased economic and social cohesion; and
further developed the European monetary system.
Maastricht Treaty
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty, in force since 1993,
established the European Union (EU), based on
three ‘pillars’:
■ pillar I - the EC;
■ pillar II - new intergovernmental
arrangements for a CFSP; and
■ pillar III - increased co-operation on justice
and home affairs (see page 71).
It amended the Treaties of Rome and encompassed
moves towards economic and monetary union
(see page 70) and a Cohesion Fund (see page 70).
The Treaty also enshrined the principle of
subsidiarity, under which action in areas where
the EC and Member States share competence
should be taken at European level only if
objectives cannot be achieved by Member States
acting alone, and can be better achieved by the EC.
In addition, it introduced the concept of EU
citizenship as a supplement to national citizenship.
Qualified majority voting (see page 64) was
extended and the Treaty introduced the co¬
decision procedure, which reinforced the role
of the European Parliament in the legislative
process.
Amsterdam Treaty
The 1997 Amsterdam Treaty, in force since 1999,
further protected and extended citizens’ rights by
means of a new anti-discrimination clause. It
integrated the ‘social chapter’ (previously a separate
protocol to the Maastricht Treaty) into the treaty
framework following its adoption by the United
Kingdom, and adopted new mechanisms to
improve the operation of the CFSP. The
immigration, asylum and civil judicial co-operation
provisions of pillar III were brought in, while
provisions for police and judicial co-operation in
criminal matters were reinforced. The Treaty also
introduced the possibility for groups representing
a majority of Member States to co-operate and
integrate more closely. Qualified majority voting
was further extended, the number of areas subject
to co-decision between the Council of Ministers
and the European Parliament was increased, and
the co-decision procedure was simplified.
Treaty of Nice
The Treaty of Nice was signed in 2001 and entered
into force in 2003. It introduced changes to the EU
institutional machinery in preparation for
enlargement (see page 71). From 1 January 2005,
the number of votes allocated to each Member
State in the European Council changes to take
account of prospective new members. The total
rises from the 87 votes held by the 15 Member
States until June 2004 to up to 345 votes held by
a potential 27 Member States. France, Germany,
Italy and the United Kingdom will each have
29 votes. Assuming 27 Member States, the total
required for a qualified majority (see page 64)
will increase from 62 to 255, and for a blocking
minority from 26 to 91.
From 2005, the European Commission will
comprise one member from each country,
although when the EU reaches 27 members, the
number of commissioners will be capped at a
figure less than the total number of Member
States. However, provisions in the Constitutional
Treaty, if adopted, will supersede some of the
Treaty of Nice provisions (see page 69).
Treaty of Accession
The Treaty of Accession, signed by 25 heads of
state in Athens in April 2003, provided for the
accession to the EU of ten members on 1 May
2004. Under the Treaty, nationals of the ten new
Member States (see page 71) have the right to
move freely within the EU from that date for all
purposes except for work. The Treaty allows for
the imposition of transitional work restrictions on
nationals of the new Member States, except
Cyprus and Malta, until 30 April 2011.
68
UK 2005
7 International relations
The United Kingdom has waived its right to
impose these transitional work restrictions, subject
to certain safeguards (see page 175).
EU Constitutional Treaty
In 2002, the Convention on the Future of Europe
- under the presidency of former French President
Valery Giscard D’Estaing - began a fundamental
review of EU institutions to consider how to make
the expanded EU more democratic, effective and
transparent.
In June 2003, the Convention’s findings were
presented in the form of a draft Constitutional
Treaty at the Thessaloniki European Council.1
Under the Constitutional Treaty:
■ Member States will confer competences on
the EU;
■ national parliaments will have a role in
monitoring and enforcing subsidiarity (see
page 68);
■ a full-time president of the European Council
will work alongside the existing presidents of
the European Commission and the European
Parliament;
■ an EU foreign minister will bring together the
roles of external relations commissioner and
council high representative;
■ a legally binding charter of rights will be
introduced;
■ the EU will become a single legal ‘personality’
(until the Treaty is ratified by all Members the
EC and the EU have separate legal personalities);
■ there will be greater co-operation on social
security, justice and home affairs; and
■ a simpler voting system will be introduced
where decisions would pass if supported by
at least 55 per cent of Member States,
representing at least 65 per cent of the EU.
The UK Parliament will debate the Treaty in the
autumn 2004. If it votes in favour of the proposed
EU constitution, the UK Government will then
hold a referendum.
1 The draft treaty was debated in an IGC of EU leaders between
October 2003 and June 2004, and was agreed unanimously. It will
be signed in autumn 2004. Before coming into force, it must be
ratified by all 25 Member States.
Policies
The EC budget and broader EU policies are
described below. Policies affecting specific UK
sectors - for example, the Common Agricultural
Policy - are covered in the appropriate chapters.
European Community budget
The EC’s revenue consists of levies on agricultural
imports from non-member countries, customs
duties, a proportion of value added tax (VAT)
receipts, and contributions from Member States
based on gross national income (GNI). Increasingly,
more revenue is being raised from contributions
linked to GNI and less from VAT receipts and
customs payments. The United Kingdom
receives an annual budget rebate because of its
disproportionately low share of receipts (notably
agricultural funds) and higher than average
contributions. The rebate has been in place since
1984 and is guaranteed until at least 2006.
Single market
The single European market, providing for the free
movement of people, goods, services and capital
within the EU, came into effect in 1993. Its
benefits include the removal of customs barriers,
the liberalisation of capital movements, the
opening of public procurement markets and the
mutual recognition of professional qualifications.
Under the European Economic Area (EEA)
Agreement that came into force in 1994, most of
the EU single market measures also apply to
Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
Economic and monetary union
The Maastricht Treaty (see page 68) provided for
the establishment of a European economic and
monetary union in stages, culminating in the
establishment on 1 January 1999 of a single
currency, the euro, by the participating EU
Member States.2 Thirteen EU Member States are
outside the euro area. These are Denmark, Sweden
and the United Kingdom, and the ten new
Member States that joined in May 2004: Cyprus,
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.
The UK Government has set out five economic
tests that must be met before any decision to join
can be made (see page 346).
2 The rate for Greece became fixed when it joined the euro on
1 January 2001.

Ma Jt
Entente Cordiale
In April 2004, The Queen made a state visit to
France to mark the centenary of the the Entente
Cordiale. The Entente was signed in London on
8 April 1904 to settle long-standing colonial
disputes between France and the United
Kingdom. It also ended hundreds of years of
rivalry and paved the way for Franco-British
diplomatic and military co-operation in the
lead-up to the First World War (1914-18).
V d
Conversion rates between the national currencies
of the 12 participating Member States and the
euro were fixed on 1 January 1999. The euro is the
legal currency in the euro area and the European
Central Bank has responsibility for formulating
monetary policy for these countries.
Regional and infrastructure development
There are significant economic and social
disparities between Member States. The EU
implements a European regional policy financed
by the European Funds - the Structural Funds and
the Cohesion Fund.
The four Structural Funds are:
■ the European Regional Development Fund,
which finances infrastructure projects and
schemes to promote development and
diversification of industry;
■ the European Social Fund, which supports
human resource and equal opportunities
schemes, and training measures for the
unemployed and young people;
■ the Guidance Section of the European
Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund,
which supports agricultural restructuring and
some rural development activities; and
■ the Financial Instrument for Fisheries
Guidance, which promotes the modernisation
of the fishing industry.
The United Kingdom will receive €15.5 billion
(over £10 billion) from the Structural Funds
in 2000-06. In addition, a Cohesion Fund, set
up under the Maastricht Treaty, provides
direct finance for specific projects relating to
environmental and transport infrastructure in
Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
In the run up to enlargement (see page 71), the
EU prepared financial programmes for the period
2000-06 to help the candidate countries prepare
for membership. These include the Instrument for
Structural Policies for Pre-accession (ISPA), which
finances environment and transport projects with
a budget of €7.28 billion (just under £5 billion),
and the Special Accession Programme for
Agriculture and Rural Development (Sapard),
which supports agricultural development with a
€3.64 billion (just under £2.5 billion) budget. They
join the Phare programme (the main channel for
EU financial and technical co-operation with
Central and Eastern Europe), with a €10.92 billion
(over £7 billion) budget, which aims to strengthen
the administrative and institutional capacity of
accession countries and to finance investment
projects. The latter account for 30 per cent and
70 per cent of Phare’s budget respectively.
After accession, the Structural Funds and the
Cohesion Fund replace such assistance. The
European Council meeting in Brussels in October
2002 set aside an additional €23 billion (over
£15 billion) for structural spending in the new
Member States for the period 2004-06.
Common foreign and security policy
The CFSP, introduced under the Maastricht Treaty
(see page 68), provides for unanimous agreement
among Member States on common policies and/or
joint action on international issues, in the belief
that Member States carry more weight when able
to speak with one voice on international affairs
than any single Member State alone. The
Amsterdam Treaty (see page 68) preserves the
principle of unanimity in all policy decisions but
states that those decisions concerning common
strategies, which are themselves unanimously
agreed, will be by qualified majority voting. A
Member State may prevent a vote being taken by
qualified majority voting for ‘important and stated
reasons of national policy’. In addition, qualified
majority voting does not apply to decisions having
military or defence implications. A Member State
may abstain and stand aside from an EU decision.
In 1998, the United Kingdom and France
proposed the European security and defence
policy (ESDP) with the aim of strengthening EU
capacity to respond to crises, on the premise
that the Union could play a coherent and effective
political role only if this was backed up by a
credible military capability. ESDP is designed to
take on the Petersberg Tasks, established at the
70
UK 2005
7 International relations
Ministerial Council of the Western European
Union in 1992. These were humanitarian and
rescue tasks; peacekeeping tasks; and tasks of
combat forces in crisis management, including
peacemaking.
In 2003, the EU announced it was operational
across the full range of these tasks, although it
accepted that its capabilities were constrained by
recognised shortfalls. During 2003, it successfully
completed two military crisis management
operations (in the Democratic Republic of Congo
and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Three civilian ESDP crisis management operations
have also been launched - policing missions in
Bosnia and the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, and a rule of law mission in Georgia.
Justice and home affairs
The Maastricht Treaty established arrangements
for increased co-operation among EU states on
justice and home affairs issues. These include visa,
asylum, immigration and other policies related to
free movement of people; and police, customs and
judicial co-operation in criminal matters
(including co-operation through Europol).
This is a growing aspect of EU work and, since the
Amsterdam Treaty came into force, includes both
Community-based and intergovernmental areas
of co-operation. A protocol annexed to the
Amsterdam Treaty recognises the right of the
United Kingdom to exercise its own frontier
controls.
Enlargement
A key EU policy objective is to enlarge the Union
to include those European nations that share its
democratic values and aims, and that are
functioning market economies, able to compete
in the EU and to take on the obligations of
membership. Ten new members - Cyprus, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia
- joined the EU on 1 May 2004, in time to
participate in the June elections to the European
Parliament (see page 65).
The new Member States increased the population
of the EU by around 75 million. Of the new
members, Poland is the largest, accounting for
around 8.5 per cent of both the population and
the area of the enlarged EU. Malta has the smallest
area, but is by far the most densely populated. At
the European Council in December 2003, Bulgaria
and Romania were given a target date of January
2007 for joining the EU. Accession negotiations
with Turkey may be opened following the
European Council meeting in December 2004,
providing the Council decides that Turkey has
fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria relating
to democracy, the rule of law, and respect for
human rights and minorities.
Other international
organisations
United Nations
The United Kingdom is a founder member of the
UN and one of the five permanent members of the
Security Council, along with China, France, Russia
and the United States. It supports the purposes
and principles of the UN Charter, including the
maintenance of international peace and security,
the development of friendly relations among
nations, the achievement of international
co-operation on economic, social, cultural and
humanitarian issues, and the protection of human
rights and fundamental freedoms.
The United Kingdom is the fourth largest
contributor both to the UN regular budget -
paying just over £48 million in 2003 - and to UN
peacekeeping budgets, and is one of the largest
voluntary contributors to UN funds, programmes
and specialised agencies. In 2003, the total UK
contribution to the UN exceeded £549 million. The
UK Government advocates modernising the UN
to enhance its effectiveness, including reforming
the Security Council’s composition. It is committed
to reinforcing the UN’s role in preventing and
resolving conflicts around the world.
The Commonwealth
The Commonwealth has 53 members3 including
the United Kingdom (see map on page 73). It is a
voluntary association of independent states, nearly
all of which were once British territories. It promotes
international peace and order, democracy, the rule
of law, good governance, freedom of expression
and human rights, as well as economic and social
development. The Commonwealth Secretary-
General has a role in conflict prevention and
resolution, and the organisation provides election
observer missions and democracy advisory
services. The Commonwealth represents a
combined population of 1.8 billion people.

The Queen is Head of the Commonwealth. The
Commonwealth Secretariat, based in London,
helps host governments to organise
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings
(CHOGMs - these take place in a different
Commonwealth country every two years),
ministerial meetings and other conferences. It
administers assistance programmes agreed at these
meetings, including the Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Co-operation, which provides expertise,
advisory services and training to developing
countries in the Commonwealth. The next
CHOGM is planned to be held in Valletta, Malta
in November 2005, while Uganda will host the
2007 CHOGM.
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
Membership of NATO is central to UK defence
policy (see chapter 8). The main decision-making
body is the North Atlantic Council. It meets at
least twice a year at foreign minister level, and
once a week at permanent representative level.
Group of Eight
The United Kingdom is one of the G8 leading
industrialised countries. The other members are
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia
(included as a full member from 1998, although
the other countries continue to function as the
G7 for some discussions) and the United States.
The G8 is an informal group with no secretariat.
Its presidency rotates each year among the
members, the key meeting being the annual
summit of Heads of Government. Originally
formed in 1975 (as the G7) to discuss economic
issues, the G8 agenda now includes a wide range
of foreign affairs and international issues.
The United States hosted the 2004 G8 summit in
Georgia, in June. Topics discussed included famine
and food security, peacekeeping, development,
HIV/AIDS and corruption. The United Kingdom
is to host the 2005 G8 summit.
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The United Kingdom is a member of the OSCE,
a regional security organisation of 55 states from
Europe, Central Asia and North America. All
decisions are taken by consensus. The OSCE is
based in Vienna, where the United Kingdom has
a permanent delegation. The main areas of work
are:
■ early warning and prevention of conflicts;
■ observing elections and advising on human
rights, democracy and law, and the media;
■ post-conflict rehabilitation; and
■ promoting security through arms control and
military confidence-building.
The United Kingdom contributed around
£21.3 million in 2003/04 to the OSCE.
Council of Europe
The United Kingdom is a founding member of the
Council of Europe, which is open to any European
state accepting parliamentary democracy, the rule
of law and fundamental human rights. There are
45 full Member States. One of the Council’s main
achievements is the European Convention on
Human Rights (see page 82). The United Kingdom
is one of the major financial contributors to the
Council of Europe, paying
12.4 per cent of the Council’s budget, around
£17.5 million in 2004/05.
Other international bodies
The United Kingdom is a member of many other
international bodies. These include:
■ the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
which regulates the international financial
system;
■ the World Bank, which provides loans to
developing countries;
■ the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), which promotes
economic growth, support for less developed
countries and trade expansion; and
■ the World Trade Organisation (see page
383).
Other organisations to which the United Kingdom
belongs or extends support include the Regional
Development Banks for Africa, the Caribbean,
Latin America and Asia, and the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development.

Regional relations
North America
The UK Government regards close transatlantic
links between the United Kingdom, the United
States and Canada as essential to security and
prosperity in both Europe and North America.
The United Kingdom and the United States
co-operate closely on nuclear, defence and
intelligence issues. As founding members of NATO
(see chapter 8), both states are deeply involved in
Western defence arrangements and, as permanent
members of the UN Security Council (see page
71), work closely together on major international
issues. In addition, they have important economic
links. More than 5,000 US companies have
operations in the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom maintains strong political
and economic links with Canada, which like
the United Kingdom is a member of the
Commonwealth. A Joint UK-Canada Declaration
in June 1997 and again in 2001 shows a
commitment by both countries to greater
co-operation on multilateral and global issues.
Middle East
Iraq
The United Kingdom was a key member of
the US-led coalition that took part in the 2003
military campaign that removed Saddam Hussein
from power (see page 95). UK forces, both civilian
and military, are working to establish peace and
lay the foundations for a return to democratic
government in Iraq.
In March 2003, the UN designated the Coalition
Provisional Authority (CPA) as the lawful
government of Iraq until Iraq was sufficiently
politically and socially stable to re-assume its
sovereignty. A US diplomat was the Administrator
of the CPA. The Governing Council of Iraq was
formed in July as the principal body of the interim
administration, representing the interests of the
Iraqi people to the CPA. The CPA was required to
consult the Governing Council on all major
decisions and questions of policy.
In March 2004, the Governing Council drew up an
interim constitution (also known as a fundamental
law) to cover the period after the departure of the
CPA and prior to the introduction of a permanent
constitution. The CPA transferred power to an
interim Iraqi government on 28 June 2004.
Elections for a transitional assembly are due to
take place by January 2005 and the transitional
assembly will draw up a permanent constitution
by July 2005. A referendum will then be held on
this constitution before full elections for a new
internationally recognised representative Iraqi
government take place at the end of 2005.
Improving security in Iraq is a priority. UK police
trainers are involved in Basra, Baghdad and a
training centre established in Jordan. In addition,
the Coalition is developing the New Iraqi Army,
the Civil Defence Corps, the border police and the
Facilities Protection Service.
Arab-lsraeli peace process
The UK Government fully supports the US
initiative to give renewed momentum to the peace
process. In April 2003 the Quartet (the EU, Russia,
UN and United States) presented their ‘roadmap’
for a permanent two-state solution by 2005. Phase
One stipulates an end to Palestinian violence,
Palestinian political reform, a freeze on Israeli
settlement expansion, and the withdrawal from
Palestinian areas occupied from 28 September
2000. Phase Two involves the creation of a
provisional Palestinian state and the holding of an
international conference. Phase Three calls for
a second international conference, a permanent
status agreement on borders, and the end of
conflict. The UK Government continues to press
for an end to the violence and for a resumption of
political engagement: it believes there can be no
military solution to the conflict. A lasting solution
must protect Israel’s security, provide a just
settlement for the Palestinians, and provide a
comprehensive resolution of the dispute, including
the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
Europe and Central Asia
The EU Phare scheme primarily aids Central
European countries in the process of reform and
development of their infrastructure. Countries of
the former Soviet Union (excluding Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania) and Mongolia receive help through a
parallel programme (Tacis), which concentrates on
democratisation, financial services, transport, energy
(including nuclear safety) and the reform of public

administration. The Community Assistance for
Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation
(CARDS) programme focuses on countries in the
Western Balkans.
The EU has strengthened relations with various
countries in Eastern Europe through the
conclusion of Europe (Association) Agreements.
These agreements provide an institutional
framework for supporting the process of
integration ahead of the accession of these
countries to the EU. There are Europe Agreements
in force with Bulgaria and Romania. The EU also
has an Association Agreement with Turkey. This
agreement covers trade-related issues and other
areas of co-operation.
EU Partnership and Co-operation Agreements are
in force with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine
and Uzbekistan. There are also Trade and Co¬
operation Agreements with Albania, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Mongolia.
The purpose of these agreements is to reduce trade
barriers, promote wide-ranging co-operation and
increase political dialogue.
Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAA)
also offer the prospect of ultimate EU membership
and closer links to states in south-eastern Europe,
provided that these countries meet EU conditions
on democracy, electoral and media freedoms,
economic reform, and respect for human rights
and the rule of law. The EU signed its first SAA,
with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
in April 2001. It concluded an SAA with Croatia in
October 2001, and opened negotiations with
Albania in January 2003, and with Bosnia and
Herzegovina in November 2003.
Mediterranean
The United Kingdom and other EU Member
States have developed closer links with 12
Mediterranean partners (Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt,
Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, the
Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey)
on the basis of the 1995 Barcelona Declaration,
which promotes peace and prosperity in the
region. The EU also has Euro-Mediterranean
Association Agreements covering political dialogue,
free trade and co-operation in a number of areas
with Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon,
Morocco, the Palestinian Authority and Tunisia.
UK relations with Libya have improved following
Libya’s renunciation of Weapons of Mass
Destruction in December 2003. The Prime
Minister visited Libya in March 2004, the first UK
Prime Minister to visit the country since 1943.
In February 2004, the United Kingdom welcomed
the resumption of talks designed to reunify Cyprus
(see page 84). In referendums held in April, Greek
Cypriots overwhelmingly rejected the UN
proposals, while Turkish Cypriots voted in favour.
As a result, when Cyprus joined the EU in May,
EU laws and benefits applied only to the Greek
Cypriot community. The EU is seeking ways to end
the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot state.
Africa
The UK Government has declared African
development a policy priority. It supports efforts
in the following areas:
■ to prevent or end African conflicts;
■ to promote trade, reduce debt and develop
lasting prosperity; and
■ to support African governments,
organisations and individuals espousing the
principles of democracy, accountability, the
rule of law and human rights.
The UK Government supports the New
Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD),
an African-led strategy for sustainable growth and
development, and plans to increase bilateral aid to
Africa to £1 billion a year by 2005/06. The United
Kingdom is working to reduce conflict in sub-
Saharan Africa through the Africa Conflict
Prevention Pool (see page 84).
With the EU and the Commonwealth, the UK
Government has continued to protest at the
violation of human rights in Zimbabwe, and has
called for inter-party dialogue leading to free and
fair elections. The United Kingdom has continued
its programme of humanitarian assistance in
response to the serious food shortage in Zimbabwe.
Since the abolition of apartheid and the election
of the first African National Congress government
in 1994, UK relations with South Africa have
broadened into areas ranging from development
assistance to military co-operation, and from
sporting links to scientific partnerships. The EU
and South Africa signed a trade, development and
co-operation agreement in 1999, providing for the
75
7 International relations
UK 2005
creation of a free trade area and for further
substantial development assistance from the EU.
The UK Government welcomed South Africa’s
contribution to resolving conflicts in Burundi and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and its
efforts to deal with the problems of Zimbabwe. In
2004, the United Kingdom contributed £2 million
to the African Union (AU) administered Trust
Fund to help sustain the AU-led African Mission
peacekeeping force in Burundi, which was
successfully incorporated into the UN Mission in
Burundi in June 2004. The United Kingdom also
welcomed the August 2003 signing of a peace deal
designed to end the civil war in Liberia. In
February 2004, the UK Government announced
it was contributing a further £9 million for
reconstruction projects in Liberia. This
commitment is in addition to £7.6 million
contributions to support humanitarian agencies,
£1 million to support West African peacekeepers,
a £6 million contribution to EU efforts in Liberia,
and £34.6 million to support the UN Mission in
Liberia.
In July 2003, the United Kingdom contributed
troops to a UN-mandated EU crisis management
operation under the ESDP (see page 93) to
stabilise Bunia in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, pending deployment of UN
reinforcements. The mission was successful and
ended in September when the UN peacekeeping
force resumed its operations. In 2004, UK military
personnel continued to participate in the UN
peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo and Sierra Leone.
Asia-Pacific region
The United Kingdom has well-established
relations with Australia, China, Japan, the Republic
of Korea, New Zealand and many South East Asian
nations, and has defence links with most countries
in the region. In 1997, the United Kingdom
returned Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty under
the provisions of the 1984 Sino-British Joint
Declaration. It continues to have responsibilities
towards Hong Kong and the 3.6 million UK
passport holders living there.
The United Kingdom is a member, with Australia,
Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore, of the Five
Power Defence Arrangements, which was set up in
1971 and remains the only multinational defensive
structure in the region. The United Kingdom is
also involved in English language teaching,
co-operation in science and technology, and
educational exchanges in the region.
The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process was
inaugurated in 1996. ASEM’s aim is to foster closer
economic and political ties between EU countries
and Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic
of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam. The fifth ASEM is planned
to take place in Hanoi in October 2004.
The United Kingdom has long-standing and
Commonwealth ties with the island countries of
the Pacific. It is a dialogue partner of the Pacific
Islands Forum, which works in support of
member governments to enhance the social and
economic well-being of the people of the South
Pacific.
In October 2003, the UK Government pledged
continued support for the Democratic Republic
of Timor-Leste. The United Kingdom has pledged
£12 million in the period 2002-05. It is one of six
countries that are members of the core group’ on
East Timor at the UN.
Afghanistan
The United Kingdom made a major contribution
to the military action leading to the defeat of the
Taliban regime by a US-led coalition between
October and December 2001. The Taliban had
close links with the Al Qaida terrorist network,
responsible for the attacks on the United States
on 11 September 2001. An emergency Loya Jirga
(Grand Council) met in Kabul in June 2002 to
elect the President of the country, and approve
a transitional administration.
In January 2004, the Loya Jirga agreed a new
Constitution. The first post-Taliban presidential
election is due to be held on 9 October, with
elections for the legislative assembly to follow
in spring 2005.
The UK Government is committed to the
reconstruction of Afghanistan and has spent more
than £300 million since September 2001 on
humanitarian and reconstruction needs. The
United Kingdom leads international assistance
on counter-narcotics and has pledged £70 million
(see page 87). It will also contribute 19 per cent of
the European Commission’s pledge of €1 billion
(£0.67 billion) over five years.

UK 2005
7 International relations
In July 2003, the United Kingdom deployed a joint
military-civilian Provincial Reconstruction Team
(PRT) to Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan.
PRTs aim to help with the reform and
reconstruction of security arrangements and to
extend the authority of the central government,
leading to improved security in the regions. In
June 2004, the United Kingdom deployed a second
PRT in northern Afghanistan and a Forward
Supporting Base coordinating support for other
PRTs in the north. The UK PRTs are now part of
the NATO-led International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF), to which the United Kingdom also
contributed troops in Kabul.
Latin America and the Caribbean
Links with Latin America date from the early 19th
century. The rise of democracy and increasingly
free market economies have enabled the United
Kingdom to strengthen its ties with the region,
and it is one of the largest investors after the
United States.
Links with the countries of the Caribbean go back
centuries, and there are about 570,000 British
citizens of Caribbean origin resident in the United
Kingdom. The First UK/Caribbean Forum, held in
1998 in the Bahamas, marked a new longer-term
process of co-operation between the United
Kingdom and the region. The Forum is a biennial
event, hosted alternately by the United Kingdom
and a Caribbean country. The fourth meeting took
place in the United Kingdom in May 2004.
The EU plays an increasingly important role in the
UK’s relationship with Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC). The first summit of EU, Latin
American and Caribbean Heads of State and
Government took place in 1999. A second meeting
was held in May 2002, when the EU and Chile
concluded negotiations on a trade association
agreement. The EU has a similar agreement with
Mexico, and is negotiating one with the Mercosur
bloc, which comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay. In May 2004, the third EU-LAC
summit took place in Mexico.
Overseas Territories
UK Overseas Territories (OTs) have a combined
population of about 198,000 (see page 78).
Governors are appointed by The Queen and are
responsible for external affairs, internal security,
defence and, in some OTs, international financial
services. Most domestic matters are delegated to
locally elected governments and legislatures. The
British Indian Ocean Territory, the British
Antarctic Territory, and South Georgia and the
South Sandwich Islands have non-resident
Commissioners, rather than Governors. None of
the Territories has expressed a desire for
independence.
The United Kingdom aims to provide the OTs
with security and political stability, to ensure
efficient and honest government, and to support
their economic and social advancement. The
Foreign 8c Commonwealth Office (ECO) and
Department for International Development
(DFID) support OTs that qualify to access finance
from European Development Fund (EDF) and
other benefits under the 2001 EU/Overseas
Countries and Territories Overseas Association
Decision. EDF funding is used to improve local
transport infrastructure, and to promote trade
development and diversification, inward
investment and regional co-operation.
The ECO Overseas Territories Economic
Diversification Programme Budget was established
in 2001 to help the OTs develop a sustainable
economic future by diversifying their economies.
In 2003/04, £500,000 was available. The FCO
Good Government Fund for the OTs allocated
over £3 million in 2003/04 to activities promoting
good governance, law enforcement and human
rights. Offshore financial service industries are
important in several of the OTs. The UK
Government’s policy is to ensure that these meet
international standards of regulation and that
effective steps are taken to combat financial crime
and regulatory abuse.
Under the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 all
existing OT citizens (with the exception of those
deriving their citizenship solely from a connection
with the UK Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus) are
automatically British citizens, with the right of
abode in the United Kingdom. By the end of 2003,
some 18,000 British OT citizens had applied for
British Citizens passports. A constitutional review,
designed to bring the Territory constitutions up
to date to reflect a more modern relationship
between the UK and OT Governments, is being
carried out. An OT Consultative Council, which
brings together UK Ministers and the Chief
Ministers or their equivalents from each territory,
meets in London annually.

New laboratory in Antarctica
A £3 million laboratory opened at the British
Antarctic Survey's Rothera Research Station,
Adelaide Island, in January 2004. The Bonner
Laboratory replaces a research facility destroyed
by fire in 2001 and is made of fire-retardant
materials. It is equipped with laboratories, offices,
an aquarium and a dive facility complete with
recompression chamber. Rothera is a centre for
biology, geoscience and atmospheric science
programmes. Its work includes long-term
biological monitoring that contributes to
understanding global climate change.
Falkland Islands
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a territorial
claim by Argentina. The UK Government does not
accept the Argentine claim and is committed to
defending the Islanders’ right to live under a
government of their own choosing. This right of
self-determination is enshrined in the UN Charter
and is embodied in the 1985 Falkland Islands
Constitution.
The United Kingdom and Argentina seek to
co-operate on issues of common interest affecting
the South Atlantic, such as conservation of fish
stocks and surveying the continental shelf.
However, difficulties remain. In 2003 Argentina
imposed restrictions on charter flights through
its airspace, threatening tourism in the Falklands.
Efforts to resolve the matter were continuing in
2004.
Gibraltar
British and Dutch forces captured Gibraltar
in 1704 and Spain ceded the island to Britain
in perpetuity under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.
However, Spain has long sought its return. In July
2002, the UK Government indicated that although
a number of issues remained to be resolved, the
United Kingdom and Spain had reached a broad
measure of agreement on the principles that
should underpin a lasting settlement:
■ that the United Kingdom and Spain should
share sovereignty over Gibraltar;
■ that there should be more internal self-
government;
■ the retention of UK traditions, customs and
way of life;
■ the retention of the right to UK nationality
for Gibraltarians, who should also gain the
right to Spanish nationality;
■ the retention of Gibraltar’s own institutions;
and
■ that Gibraltar could, if it chose, participate
fully in the EU single market and other EU
arrangements.
The Government of Gibraltar organised a
referendum on the question of joint sovereignty
with Spain in November 2002 and of those
participating, almost 99 per cent voted against the
principle. The UK Government stressed that the
principle of Gibraltarian consent, as set out in
Gibraltar’s 1969 Constitution, remained central
to its approach. The UK Government continues
to believe that dialogue with both Spain and
Gibraltar is the best way to secure a permanent
settlement to the dispute.
Gibraltar has an elected House of Assembly.
Responsibility for ‘defined domestic matters’ is
devolved to elected local ministers. The Territory
is within the EU, as part of the United Kingdom
Member State, although it is outside the common
customs system and does not participate in the
Common Agricultural or Fisheries Policies or
the EU VAT arrangements. The people of
Gibraltar have been declared UK nationals for
EU purposes.
The European Parliament (Representation) Act
2003 allows the people of Gibraltar to vote in
elections to the European Parliament. Gibraltar
forms part of the English South West electoral
region, which returns seven Members of the
European Parliament (MEPs). In the European
parliamentary elections in June 2004, 57.5 per
cent of the electorate in Gibraltar voted.
Overseas Territories Environment
Programme
In December 2003, the United Kingdom launched
the Overseas Territories Environment Programme
(OTEP), a joint initiative between the ECO and
DFID, which doubles the amount of money
available to the OTs for sustainable environment
work. The £3 million fund is designed to save
precious eco-systems from destruction.

7 International relations
UK 2005
A review of the Financial Services Commission,
which regulates Gibraltar’s financial services, took
place in 2004. The review evaluated the extent to
which the regulation of financial services in
Gibraltar matches relevant UK and EU standards.
Its report should be published in autumn 2004.
300th anniversary celebrations
The Gibraltar Government arranged a number of
events in 2004 to celebrate the 300th anniversary
of the capture of the Rock of Gibraltar by British
and Dutch forces. It invited 500 UK war veterans
to visit Gibraltar to commemorate all UK
servicemen who have given their lives in defence
of Gibraltar during the last 300 years, and to
mark the special relationship that exists between
Gibraltar and the UK Armed Forces.
Administration of foreign policy
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
The FCO is headed by the Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, a cabinet
minister (see page 55) who is also responsible for
the Diplomatic Service (see page 59). The FCO
maintains diplomatic, consular and commercial
relations with about 190 countries, and the United
Kingdom has 233 diplomatic posts worldwide. As
well as about 2,000 diplomats from the United
Kingdom, the diplomatic missions overseas
employ 9,860 locally engaged staff. Staff in the
diplomatic missions deal with political,
commercial and economic work, entry clearance
to the United Kingdom, and consular work, aid
administration, information and other activities.
The Global Opportunities Fund was set up to fund
projects around the world relating to UK foreign
policy priorities (see page 67). The projects are
coordinated through six themes: counter¬
terrorism; climate change and energy; engaging
with the Islamic world; re-uniting Europe;
strengthening relations with emerging markets;
and human rights, democracy and good
governance.
Under the 2004 Spending Review announced in
July 2004, the FCO budget will increase from
£1.5 billion in 2004/05 to £1.7 billion in 2007/08.
The extra funds will help to improve the security
of diplomatic posts, following the bomb attacks on
the British Consulate and the HSBC bank
headquarters in Istanbul in November 2003 in
which several people were killed, and help the
FCO to continue to meet its international
priorities. The Global Opportunities Fund was
allocated £60 million a year for the period 2005/06
to 2007/08.
f   
Consular services
In 2003, UK residents made 61.5 million trips
abroad, a figure that has tripled over the past 20
years. Most enjoy a trouble-free trip, although
FCO consular staff helped well over 85,000 UK
nationals in 2003/04. Consular staff typically
offer help and advice to: those who have been
the victims of crime; those who find themselves
injured or sick overseas; and the friends and
families of UK citizens who die while overseas.
They also replace lost or stolen passports, assist
in emergencies, natural disasters and major
incidents, and act as a point of contact between
UK citizens who have been imprisoned overseas
and their families in the United Kingdom.
v   J
The Public Diplomacy Strategy Board was
established in 2002 to improve government efforts
to promote the image of the United Kingdom
overseas. The Board meets three times a year, and
includes senior personnel from other government
departments (including the devolved
administrations, see chapters 3 to 5), non¬
governmental organisations, the British Council,
BBC World Service (see page 261), VisitBritain
(see page 478) and the private sector. A £2 million
Public Diplomacy Campaign Fund supports up to
two major campaigns each year.
The FCO Public Diplomacy Challenge Fund
(PDCF) was launched in early 2003 with an
annual budget of about £2.5 million. It supports
public diplomacy projects generated by Embassies
and High Commissions.
The main elements of FCO-funded public
diplomacy work are:

■ the FCO website and the www.i-uk.com portal
site, launched in 2002, which provides

foreign visitors;
■ the BBC World Service;
■ the British Council;
■ British Satellite News, used extensively by
overseas radio and television broadcasters
to supplement their news coverage. BSN has
a bilingual website; and
■ the London Press Service, a UK-based online
news and information service supplying
material for publication overseas.
The FCO executive agency, Wilton Park in
Steyning, West Sussex, organises conferences in the
United Kingdom that are attended by politicians,
business people, academics and other professionals
from all over the world. It aims to organise
a minimum of 40 conferences a year and
contributes to the analysis and discussion of key
international policy challenges and issues.
British Council
The British Council is the principal UK agency for
educational and cultural relations overseas.
Operating in 110 countries, its work includes
teaching English, promoting UK education and
training, running information centres, supporting
good governance and human rights, and
encouraging appreciation of UK science, arts,
literature and design.
In 2003-04, the British Council employed 1,700
teachers in 126 teaching centres overseas and
administered over 1 million professional and
academic examinations. Other activities during the
period included:
■ collaborating in 1,950 arts events around the
world;
■ issuing 7.5 million books and videos to
300,000 British Council library members;
■ dealing with 2.3 million enquiries; and
■ helping over 15,000 UK people aged between
15 and 25 to meet and work with overseas
partners in more than 600 projects.
The Council is financed partly by a grant from the
FCO and partly by income from revenue-earning
activities such as English language teaching and
the administration of examinations. Some of the
programmes organised by the Council as part of
the UK aid programme receive funding from
DFID (see page 82). Under the 2004 Spending
Review, its budget is set to rise from £173 million
in 2004/05 to £197 million in 2007/08.
Educational exchanges
The British Council recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short overseas visits by UK
experts, encourages cultural exchange visits, and
organises academic interchange between UK
universities and colleges and those in other
countries. In 2003-04 the Council arranged nearly
2,500 work placements and more than 200 study
visits in 31 countries across Europe.
Human rights
The UK Government has stated its commitment to
work for improvements in human rights standards
around the world. In September 2004, it published
the seventh Annual Report on Human Rights.
International conventions
United Nations
Universal respect for human rights is an obligation
under the UN Charter. Expressions of concern
about human rights do not, therefore, constitute
interference in the internal affairs of another state.
The UK Government supports the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which the UN
General Assembly adopted in 1948. Since this is
not a legally binding document, the General
Assembly in 1966 adopted two international
covenants on human rights, imposing legal
obligations on those states ratifying or acceding to
them. The United Kingdom ratified both in 1976.
One deals with economic, social and cultural
rights and the other with civil and political rights.
Other international instruments that the United
Kingdom accedes to include those on:
■ the elimination of racial discrimination;
■ the elimination of all forms of discrimination

Council of Europe
Official development assistance (ODA) is set to rise
from 0.26 per cent of gross national income (GNI)
in 1997 to 0.47 per cent by 2007/08. At this rate of
progress, the Government anticipates that it will
meet the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNI by 2013.
Most of the ODA is channelled through DFID.
The United Kingdom is also bound by the Council
of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
(ECHR), which covers areas such as:
■ the right to life, liberty and a fair trial;
■ the right to marry and have a family;
■ freedom of thought, conscience and religion;
■ freedom of expression;
■ freedom of peaceful assembly and association;
■ the right to have a sentence reviewed by a
higher tribunal; and
■ the prohibition of torture and inhuman or
degrading treatment.
The rights and obligations of the ECHR are
enshrined in UK law by the Human Rights Act
1998. In October 2003, the United Kingdom
ratified Protocol 13 to the ECHR banning the
death penalty in all circumstances.
International Criminal Court
The United Kingdom supported the establishment
of an International Criminal Court to try cases of
genocide, crimes against humanity and war
crimes. Ratification took place in 2001. Over 90
other states have ratified the Statute (although not
the United States, which does not recognise its
jurisdiction) and the Court came into existence in
July 2002. The Court is based in The Hague in The
Netherlands and its powers are not retrospective.
Development co-operation
UK development aid policy is linked to
internationally agreed development targets,
the Millennium Development Goals. The UK
Government is shifting its assistance from
individual projects to direct support to
governments that are implementing agreed
poverty reduction strategies and better financial
management. The International Development Act
2002 outlaws the use of UK aid for any other
purpose than poverty reduction. DFID plans to
spend 90 per cent of its bilateral aid budget in the
poorest countries by 2005/06.
In 2003/04, DFID’s expenditure was £3.9 billion
(Figures 7.2 and 7.3). Almost £2 billion was spent
bilaterally, of which 48 per cent went to Asia, and
43 per cent to Africa, and £1.8 billion went to
multilateral agencies.
Under the 2004 Spending Review DFID’s budget
is planned to rise to £4.5 billion in 2005/06,
£5.0 billion in 2006/07, and £5.3 billion in 2007/08.
From these resources, UK bilateral aid to Africa
will increase to at least £1.25 billion a year by 2008.
Millennium Development Goals
All members of the UN made a commitment in
2000 to meet the Millennium Development Goals
by 2015:
■ reduce extreme poverty and hunger by
halving the proportion of people whose
income is less than $1 a day and the
proportion of people who suffer from
hunger;
■ achieve universal primary education;

■ develop a global partnership for development.
In 2003, the UK Government announced a
proposal for an International Finance Facility
(IFF) to help meet these goals by 2015. Its
founding principle is long-term but conditional
funding guaranteed to the poorest countries by the
richest. The IFF would be a temporary financing
mechanism that would ‘frontload’ donor
commitments made at the UN International
Conference on Financing in Monterrey in 2002 -
resources promised in the long-term would be
invested in tackling the causes rather than the
symptoms of poverty in the short term. It would
gain additional money from the international
capital markets by issuing bonds, and aims to
double levels of international aid for the world’s
poorest countries, from just over $50 billion a year
in 2003 to $100 billion a year in the years to 2015.
The IMF and the World Bank have carried out an
in-depth study of the IFF proposal and a report
will be published in autumn 2004.
Debt relief
The UK Government is pressing for continued
progress on implementation of the revised 1999
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt
initiative, which is designed to deliver broader and
faster relief to countries committed to poverty
reduction. The United Kingdom is the second
largest bilateral contributor to the HIPC Trust
Fund. It has cancelled the aid debts for all the
poorest countries, not just HIPC countries,
affecting debt of around £1.2 billion.
Health
Three of the eight Millennium Development Goals
involve health. The United Kingdom was an
advocate for the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and
Malaria (GFATM) to increase access to effective
treatments against these diseases. Launched in
January 2002, the Fund has attracted $5 billion in
pledges over eight years from 43 countries as well
as major foundations and private donors. At least
£1.5 billion of UK aid is planned for HIV/AIDs
related work between 2005/06 and 2007/08.
Good governance and human rights
The UK Government believes the quality of
governance has a major impact on economic
growth and the effectiveness of services. It focuses
on issues such as:
■ democratic accountability (bringing poor
people into the democratic process);
■ fundamental freedoms (including rights to
education, health and an adequate
livelihood);
■ combating child labour;
■ tackling corruption and money laundering;
■ better revenue and public finance
management;
■ access to basic services; and
■ personal safety and security in the
community, with access to justice.

Conflict and natural disasters
Many of the 40 poorest countries are either
engaged in armed conflict or have only recently
emerged from such conflict. UK objectives are to
reduce the tensions that lead to conflict, limit the
means of waging warfare, and provide timely and
effective humanitarian assistance and support
needed for long-term reconstruction.
The United Kingdom seeks to improve the quality
and speed of response to a disaster; promote early
transition from emergency assistance to
rehabilitation and reconstruction; and help
countries to reduce their vulnerability to natural,
environmental and industrial disasters. It is also
committed to strengthening the response of
multilateral institutions to humanitarian relief and
crisis management.
In 2001, two conflict prevention pools were set up
to bring together FCO, MoD and DFID skills and
resources in conflict prevention activity. The
Global Conflict Prevention Pool has carried out
conflict prevention and peacebuilding activities in,
among other areas, the Balkans, India, the Middle
East, Nepal, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union and
Sri Lanka. The budget for the Global Conflict
Prevention Pool will be maintained at £74 million
a year between 2005 and 2008. The United
Kingdom worked through the Africa Conflict
Prevention Pool to underpin African (and
subsequently UN) peace support operations in
Burundi, Cote d’Ivoire and Liberia in 2003/04.
It also played a role in the peace processes in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia,
Sudan and Uganda, as well as continuing its peace¬
building programmes in Angola, Rwanda and
Sierra Leone. The budget for the Africa Conflict
Prevention Pool is £60 million in 2004/05.
By early June 2004, the United Kingdom had
earmarked £18 million in response to the
humanitarian crisis in Darfur in western Sudan.
The United Kingdom has committed £544 million
to humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in
Iraq for the period April 2003 to March 2006.
In June 2003, the 18 leading humanitarian donor
governments agreed in Stockholm to pursue
a series of measures, known as the Good
FFumanitarian Donorship initiative, to improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of international
humanitarian action. The UK Government is
a strong supporter of this initiative, which seeks
to promote more equitable resource allocation,
more robust needs assessment and stronger
coordination and strategic prioritisation.
In November 2003, the National Audit Office
published a report Department for International
Development: Responding to Humanitarian
Emergencies that concluded that DLID responded
quickly and flexibly to humanitarian emergencies,
particularly when dealing with sudden disasters,
and that it had contributed to the saving of lives.
Peacekeeping and security
The UN is the principal body responsible for the
maintenance of international peace and security.
In April 2004, it was maintaining 14 peacekeeping
operations around the world involving about
53,000 military personnel and civilian police from
96 countries. The United Kingdom contributes
military personnel to UN operations around the
world (see also page 94).
The United Kingdom has a contingent of 410 troops
in the UN Lorce in Cyprus, established in 1964 to
help prevent the recurrence of fighting between
Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Since the hostilities of
1974, when Turkish forces occupied the northern
part of the island, the Lorce has been responsible for
monitoring the ceasefire and for control of a buffer
zone between the two communities.
The United Kingdom helps to fund the
International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague,
established to bring to trial those indicted for war
crimes in the former Yugoslavia, and provides
staff, information and forensic science expertise.
UK forces have been at the forefront of SLOR’s
efforts to detain war crimes suspects.
The United Kingdom provides about 110 civilian
police, along with specialist officers, local
government administrators and judicial experts
to the UN interim civilian administration, which
is helping to establish self-government in the
province. The United Kingdom maintains its
commitment to the Kosovo Lorce, contributing
around 220 personnel.
Arms control

destruction and promoting international control,
given the global reach of modern weapons.
The terrorist attacks in the United States of
11 September 2001 highlighted the need to
prevent terrorists from obtaining such weapons.
Weapons of mass destruction
Proliferation Security Initiative
The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) was
launched by the United States in May 2003. Under
PSI, nations are trying to establish a coordinated
and effective basis to prevent states and others
from trafficking in weapons of mass destruction
and delivery systems. The United Kingdom has
taken a leading role in the development of PSI.
Nuclear weapons
The UK Government remains committed to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT), which entered into force in 1970.
The United Kingdom is recognised as a nuclear
weapons state under the NPT (see also page 94).
The United Kingdom has ratified the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The
CTBT, with its permanent verification system, will
come into force upon ratification by the remaining
Butler Inquiry into Weapons of Mass Destruction
In February 2004, the Government established a
committee of inquiry to review the intelligence on
weapons of mass destruction (WMD), chaired by
Lord Butler of Brockwell. The committee's terms of
reference were:
■ to investigate the intelligence coverage available
in respect of WMD;
■ to investigate the accuracy of the intelligence on
Iraqi WMD up to March 2003; and
■ to make recommendations on gathering,
evaluation and use of intelligence on WMD.
The Butler Inquiry reported its findings in July 2004.
Its conclusions included the following:
■ The importance of co-operation with
international agencies such as the UN Special
Commission and the International Atomic Energy
Agency, supported by the contribution of
intelligence from national agencies.
■ Further steps are needed to integrate the
relevant work of the Defence Intelligence Staff
(DIS) with the rest of the intelligence community.
■ The Security and Intelligence Coordinator should
review the size and resources of the Assessments
Staff (who make objective assessments of the
intelligence reports).
■ The 'informality' of government procedures in
the context of policy-making towards Iraq risks
reducing the scope for informed collective
political judgement.
■ Part of the reason for doubt over a high
proportion of human intelligence sources arose
from weaknesses in the effective application by
Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) of its validation
procedures and in their proper resourcing.
■ In general the intelligence material was correctly
reported and the intelligence community made
good use of the technical expertise available to
the Government. The Committee found no
evidence of deliberate distortion or judgements
being altered to meet the policy concerns of
senior officials.
■ The claim that Iraq could use weapons of mass
destruction within 45 minutes should not have
been made in the Government's weapons dossier
without explaining what the claim referred to.
■ There is a strong case for the chairperson of the
Joint Intelligence Committee to be someone with
experience of dealing with Ministers in a senior
role and who is demonstrably beyond influence.
■ It would be helpful to bring together more closely
counter-proliferation expertise by creation of a
'virtual' network across government.
These and other conclusions and recommendations
have implications for the way in which intelligence
business will be conducted in the future. This is being
taken forward by the Cabinet Office in consultation
with Departments and the Intelligence Agencies.

12 of 44 named states (in Annex 2 of the Treaty)
that participated in the 1996 Conference on
Disarmament and that possessed nuclear power or
research reactors at that time. The UK Government
has also participated in efforts to start negotiations
on a treaty banning the future production of fissile
material for use in nuclear weapons.
The United Kingdom welcomed the Treaty of
Moscow (Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty)
between Russia and the United States. This came
into force in 2003 and aims to reduce the strategic
nuclear warheads that are deployed by these two
countries by two-thirds by 2012.
Biological weapons
The 1972 Biological and Toxic Weapons
Convention (BTWC) provides for a worldwide
ban on such weapons, but there are no effective
compliance mechanisms. The United Kingdom
continues to look for ways of strengthening the
Convention.
The BTWC Fifth Review Conference in 2002
unanimously agreed a programme for 2002-05
that includes national implementation of the
Convention; capabilities for investigating cases
of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons
or suspicious outbreaks of disease; sharing best
practice on disease surveillance; and developing
a code of conduct for scientists. The UK
Government strongly supports and continues to
participate in this programme of follow-up work.
Chemical weapons
The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which
came into force in 1997, provides for a worldwide
ban on these weapons. The Organisation for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which
is responsible for verification, held its first Review
Conference in May 2003.
The United Kingdom is committed to providing
assistance to Russia for the destruction of its huge
chemical weapons stockpile. UK assistance is
focused on Shchuch’ye in the Urals, Russia’s main
chemical weapon destruction facility. Following
completion of a first project in 2003 (construction
of the water supply), the United Kingdom is
procuring equipment for the electricity substation
that directly supports the destruction facility. The
United Kingdom is contributing some £4.5 million
and the Czech Republic, the EU and Norway are
also contributing through the UK programme.
The United Kingdom plans to continue working
closely with other donors, including Canada, in
implementing further projects at Shchuch’ye.
Conventional Armed Forces
The UK Government continues to work with its
NATO and OSCE partners to develop and improve
agreements on enhancing stability in the
Atlantic-Eurasia region. The main agreements
reached are:
■ the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(CEE) Treaty (entered into force in 1992 and
adopted in 1999), is widely regarded as a
linchpin of European security;
■ the Vienna Document, developed under the
auspices of the OSCE, is a politically binding
agreement concerning the promotion of
stability by building transparency, confidence
and trust across the OSCE area; and
■ the 1992 Open Skies Treaty permits overflight
and photographing of the entire territory of
the 30 participating states to monitor their
military capabilities and activities. The Treaty
entered into force on 1 January 2002.
The UN Register of Conventional Arms, which
came into effect in 1992, is intended to allow
greater transparency in international transfers of
conventional arms and to help identify excessive
arms build-up in any one country or region.
Countries are requested on a voluntary basis to
report imports and exports of seven categories of
major conventional weapons that have been
assessed as having the greatest potential to be
destabilising. Participation in the Register has
grown since its inception; by the end of July 2003,
165 Member States had participated at least once,
while almost all the major producers, exporters
and importers of conventional arms were
reporting regularly to the Register.
Landmines
The United Kingdom signed the Ottawa
Convention banning the use, production, trade,
transfer and stockpiling of anti-personnel
landmines in 1997, and destroyed its stockpile
after the Convention entered into force in 1999.
The United Kingdom has a programme to support
humanitarian demining activities. This aims to
help affected countries develop the capacity to
clear landmines and to improve the coordination
of international demining resources.
86
UK 2005
7 International relations
Export controls
The United Kingdom is committed to maintaining
one of the most rigorous and transparent arms
export control systems in the world. It is a
founding member of all the international regimes
that control the export of conventional arms, and
of dual-use technologies with both civilian and
military applications, particularly those that might
also contribute to the development of weapons
of mass destruction, and missiles capable of
delivering such weapons.
In 1997, the UK Government issued new criteria
for assessing licence applications for arms exports
that, among other things, prohibit the granting of
licences where there is a clear risk that these
exports might be used for internal repression or
international aggression. At the same time, it
banned the export of certain items for use in
torture. It is committed to preventing UK
companies from manufacturing, selling or
procuring such equipment, and is seeking a
global ban.
In 1998, EU Member States agreed on a Code
of Conduct on Arms Exports, setting common
standards to which all EU members would adhere.
In 2003 the United Kingdom also supported an
EU common position on trafficking and
brokering.
Export Control Act
Under the Export Control Act 2002, which came
into force in May 2004, a licence is required for all
trafficking and brokering activities in military
equipment that take place wholly or partly in the
United Kingdom. Extraterritorial controls have
been introduced on trafficking and brokering of
military equipment to embargoed destinations,
and the export of torture equipment or long-range
missiles to any destination by UK persons
anywhere in the world. The Act has also
introduced new controls on the transfer abroad of
military technology by electronic means.
International terrorism
The UK Government regards acts of terrorism as
unacceptable in all circumstances and opposes
concessions to any terrorist demands. It wishes to
eliminate terrorism as a force in international
affairs.Working bilaterally with other like-minded
governments, and multilaterally through the UN,
EU, G8 and other international and regional
organisations, it aims to promote effective and
sustained action against terrorist groups and to
foster closer international coordination of the fight
against terrorism. The United Kingdom has been
at the forefront of international efforts to increase
controls on the transfer of man-portable air
defence systems (MANPADS), which pose a
significant threat to civilian aircraft. This work
includes co-operative action to collect, secure and,
wherever possible, destroy MANPADS.
The UK Government has stepped up assistance to
countries that lack the means to tackle terrorism,
and is committed to challenging the political,
social and economic conditions that terrorists
exploit. It has allocated £60 million a year for the
period 2005/06 to 2007/08 to the ECO Global
Opportunities Fund (see page 80), which includes
a counter-terrorism programme. The United
Kingdom has ratified all 12 UN terrorism
conventions.
International crime
The UK Government strongly supports
international efforts to combat illegal drugs,
working with producer and transit countries.
Working with international partners, the UK
Government helps Latin American, Caribbean and
Central Asian states to stem the transit of drugs
from and across their territories. The United
Kingdom is one of the biggest contributors to the
UN Office on Drugs and Crime. The United
Kingdom plays a role in coordinating international
anti-narcotics assistance to support Afghanistan’s
fight against drugs under the Afghanistan National
Drug Control Strategy, which came into effect in
May 2003. To support implementation of the
Strategy, the United Kingdom has committed
£70 million.
With its EU partners, the United Kingdom is
confronting serious and organised international
crime through Europol, which supports
investigations and operations conducted by
national law enforcement agencies. EU Member
States also belong to the International Criminal
Police Organisation (Interpol). The National
Criminal Intelligence Service UK (see page 205)
provides liaison with Interpol. Over 100 law
enforcement liaison officers are stationed in UK

missions in key countries, in co-operation with the
host governments.
The United Kingdom supports international
efforts to counter financial crime, through its
membership of the Financial Action Task Force
against money laundering, and by backing
regional anti-money laundering groups.

Defence policy
The United Kingdom contributes to international
peace and security through membership of a
variety of international organisations (see chapter
7) and is a permanent member of the United
Nations (UN) Security Council. It is a leading
military contributor to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO) alliance (see page 91) and
operations involving the European Union (EU, see
page 93). The security and stability of Europe and
the maintenance of the transatlantic relationship
with the United States are fundamental to UK
security and defence policy.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is responsible for
implementing defence policy and is also the
headquarters of UK military services. Its primary
objective is to deliver security for the people of the
United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories (OTs,
see page 77) by defending them, including against
terrorism, and to act as a force for good by
strengthening international peace and stability.
In December 2003 the MoD published a White
Paper, Delivering Security in a Changing World. It
gives an assessment of the security environment,
and is a policy baseline for the MoD to make
decisions to provide the Armed Forces with the
structures and capabilities they need to carry out
the operations they can expect to undertake in the
future. The main conclusions of the White Paper
were:
■ There are no major conventional military
threats to the United Kingdom or to other
members of NATO. The three challenges to
peace and security are those posed by
international terrorism; the threat associated
with weapons of mass destruction; and the
consequences of failed and failing states.
■ The United Kingdom will remain engaged in
potential areas of instability in and around
Europe, the Near East, North Africa and the
Gulf. But it must improve its ability to carry
out military activities further afield than
envisaged in the 1998 Strategic Defence
Review (SDR), to encompass sub-Saharan
Africa and South Asia, and to meet the wider
threat from international terrorism.
■ There is a need to strike the right balance of
capabilities to meet the demands of the eight
strategic military effects - prevent, stabilise,
contain, deter, coerce, disrupt, defeat and
destroy.
■ The structure of the Armed Forces needs to
be optimised to be able to support three
concurrent small and medium scale
operations, where at least one is an enduring
peace support operation, including the ability
to act as lead or framework nation for
coalition operations.
■ The United Kingdom will retain the ability to
prepare at longer notice for the less frequent,
but more demanding, large scale operations,
while concurrently conducting a small scale
operation. The full spectrum of military
capabilities is not required at large scale, as
the most demanding operations could only
conceivably be undertaken alongside the
United States, either as part of NATO or
leading a coalition. The United Kingdom
would choose what capabilities to contribute.
■ Modernising the UK Armed Forces will
continue, concentrating on speed, precision,
agility, deployability, reach and sustainability.
Key to this will be the ability to exploit the
benefits of advancing technology.
■ The MoD will support the Home Office and
other civil authorities charged with the safety
and security of the United Kingdom, through
routine military activities and being prepared
to provide support in a crisis.

UK security
The Armed Forces are responsible for safeguarding
UK territory, airspace and territorial waters. They
also operate around the world to protect UK
interests and are responsible for the defence of the
UK OTs. In addition, they assist the civil authorities
in both the United Kingdom and the OTs.
Maritime defence
The Royal Navy is responsible for the delivery of the
UK Strategic Nuclear Deterrent (see page 94). Ships
of the Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary patrol, police
and defend UK territorial waters and protect UK
rights and interests (including offshore oil and gas
reserves) in the surrounding seas and around the
world. The maintenance of a 24-hour, year-round
presence in the waters around the British Isles, in
conjunction with the RAF’s maritime patrol
aircraft, upholds the security of the seas and
reassures merchant and other types of shipping.
Threats to UK-flagged ships overseas, particularly in
view of the continuing global terrorist threat, also
remain a national responsibility. The United
Kingdom maintains a worldwide expeditionary
capability based around aircraft carriers that
operate RAF Joint Force Harriers.
Land defence
The Army aims to have the capability to defend
the United Kingdom and its OTs. It is also
committed to such tasks as offering military aid
to peacekeeping and humanitarian operations,
responding to regional conflicts outside the NATO
area, and contributing forces to counter a strategic
attack on NATO. It works closely with the other
Services and is geared towards rapid reaction and
mobility, pre-empting a crisis if possible. It usually
acts with its allies but can act alone.
Air defence
A system of layered defences maintains the air
defence of the United Kingdom and the
surrounding seas. The Air Surveillance and
Control System (ASACS), supplemented by the
NATO Airborne Early Warning Force to which the
RAF contributes six aircraft, provides continuous
radar cover. The RAF contributes four squadrons
of Tornado F3 air defence aircraft, supported by
tanker aircraft, and in wartime, an additional F3
squadron. Royal Navy air defence destroyers may
also be linked to the ASACS, providing radar and
electronic warfare coverage, and surface-to-air
missiles. Ground-launched Rapier missiles defend
the main RAF bases. Naval aircraft also contribute
to UK air defence.
Northern Ireland
The Armed Forces support the police in Northern
Ireland in maintaining law and order and
countering terrorism (see page 34). The number of
units deployed depends on the prevailing security
situation. In May 2004 there were 12,000 military
personnel deployed in Northern Ireland.
Overseas garrisons
The United Kingdom maintains garrisons or
detachments in Ascension Island, Belize, Brunei,
the Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus, Diego Garcia,
the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar. Gibraltar
contains support, logistics, communications and
training facilities in the western Mediterranean,
while Cyprus provides base facilities in the eastern
Mediterranean. The garrison on the Falkland
Islands reflects the Government’s commitment to
uphold the islanders’ right to determine their own
future (see page 79). The garrison in Brunei is
maintained at the request of the Brunei
Government and the unit in Belize is for jungle
warfare-training.
UK intelligence and security services
The United Kingdom has three intelligence and
security services:
■ the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), also known
as MI6, is responsible for obtaining information
and conducting operations in support of UK
foreign policy objectives, and seeks to counter
threats to UK interests worldwide;
■ the Security Service (also known as MI5) is
responsible for protection against threats to
national security, primarily from terrorism
and espionage. In February 2004, the
Government announced plans to expand MI5
from about 2,100 employees to 3,000 by 2008;
■ the Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ) carries out signals
intelligence supporting national security,
military operations and law enforcement, and
also helps to secure government
communications and key systems supporting
UK infrastructure.

UK 2005
8 Defence
The SIS and GCHQ are responsible to the Foreign
and Commonwealth Secretary, while the Security
Service is responsible to the Home Secretary. The
planned budget for these agencies in 2004/05 is
£1.2 billion. The MoD has its own defence
intelligence staff, which provides intelligence
analyses, assessments, advice and strategic
warnings.
Other tasks
Other activities include the provision of military
aid to the civil authorities, such as:
■ emergency cover during the firemen’s strike
of 2003;
■ assisting the police in response to terrorist
threats and helping in the fight against drugs;
■ assistance in dealing with terrorist devices
and bombs left over from both world wars;
■ fishery protection duties;
■ military search and rescue; and
■ other support to the civil community, for
example during floods.
In January 2004 the Government published the
Civil Contingencies Bill, aimed at modernising
and improving the way the United Kingdom deals
with potential threats from terrorist incidents or
other civil emergencies. The Bill would allow the
Government to restrict public access to ‘sensitive
sites’, evacuate affected areas, deploy the Armed
Forces, requisition property, ban public gatherings
and set up a special court to deal with a disaster.
International security
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
The defence of the United Kingdom and its
economic and wider interests is linked to the
security of the Euro-Atlantic area. NATO is the
primary means of guaranteeing that security and
embodies a unique defence and security
partnership between North America and Europe.
Membership of NATO is a cornerstone of UK
defence policy. The United Kingdom is a founder
member and most of its forces are assigned to the
organisation.
NATO formally admitted seven new members in
March 2004: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. The expansion
was the biggest in the history of NATO and brings
NATO’s membership to 26. Further rounds of
enlargement may take place in the future with
Albania, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia.
NATO was created in 1949 in response to the
ideological, political and military threat from
communism and the former USSR. It has adapted
to changes in the security environment in Europe,
which have involved a fundamental transformation
in the alliance’s relationship with Russia after the
terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001. In
2002 the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) replaced
the NATO Russia Permanent Joint Council. The
NRC provides NATO allies and Russia with a
mechanism for consultation, consensus-building,
co-operation and joint action on security issues of
common interest, including terrorism, crisis
management and non-proliferation. Work has been
progressing well, with NATO and Russia working as
equal partners.
NATO’s security tasks are:
■ to provide a firm basis for stability and
security in the European and Atlantic areas;
■ to serve as a transatlantic forum for any
issues that affect Allied interests;
■ to deter and defend against any threat of
aggression directed towards any NATO
Member State wherever that threat may arise
- an attack on one member is treated as an
attack on all;
■ to contribute to effective conflict prevention
and crisis management; and
■ to promote partnership, co-operation and
dialogue with other countries in the Euro-
Atlantic area, including Russia.
NATO reassessed its defence policy after
11 September 2001. NATO foreign ministers
agreed in 2002 that alliance forces could be used
wherever they were needed to counter the new
threats of terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction. Subsequent decisions were that
NATO should take the lead role on the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)
in Afghanistan, and offer assistance to Poland in
its operation in Iraq.
Heads of State and Government of NATO
members also adopted measures in 2002 aimed at
strengthening the alliance’s preparedness and
ability to manage the full spectrum of security
challenges, including terrorism and the spread of
91

weapons of mass destruction. The transformation
of NATO will involve:
■ a new command structure and headquarters
to meet the new security climate;
■ a NATO Response Force (NRF);
■ the development of new capabilities to fill
critical combat shortfalls; and
■ reform of NATOs administration.
In August 2003, NATO’s international staff was
re-organised into six main divisions. The NRF
was inaugurated in October 2003. It is expected to
achieve initial operational capability within one
year and to reach full operational capability by
the end of 2006.
NATO’s multinational Chemical, Biological,
Radiological and Nuclear Defence Battalion
achieved initial operational capability in
December 2003. It is designed to provide a
response and defence against the use of weapons
of mass destruction both inside and beyond
NATO’s area of responsibility.
At the 2004 NATO Summit held in Istanbul, one
of the key themes was strengthening NATO’s
partnerships. NATO was looking in particular to
increase co-operation with the Caucasus and Central
Asia, and to reinforce links in the Mediterranean.
NATO also remains committed to developing its
relationship with Ukraine, through the
NATO-Ukraine Commission. In 2002, NATO and
Ukraine launched an action plan to develop closer
political and practical co-operation.
Anniversary of the Crimean War
The year 2004 marked the 150th anniversary
of UK involvement in the Crimean War. On 20
September 1854 a joint invasion force of more
than 60,000 British, French and Turkish troops
went into battle against Russia in the Crimea.
Florence Nightingale is famous for the help she
gave to the sick and wounded during the
Crimean War. That she was described as a
'passionate statistician' is less well known. She
compiled quantities of statistics in her drive for
hospital reform and standardised the reporting
of deaths using Miss Nightingale's scheme for
Uniform Hospital Statistics.
The UK in NATO
Maritime forces
Most Royal Navy ships are available to NATO, with
a continued commitment declared to two of its
standing naval forces, the provision of a High
Readiness Force Maritime Headquarters and
contributions to the NATO Response Forces. The
United Kingdom also contributes to NATO’s
maritime augmentation forces, which are held at the
lowest state of readiness and, in peacetime, comprise
ships mainly in routine refit or maintenance.
The main components of the UK fleet available to
NATO are:
■ Invincible class aircraft carriers operating
Joint Force Harrier aircraft and Sea King
or Merlin anti-submarine helicopters;
■ destroyers and frigates and mine counter¬
measure vessels;
■ nuclear-powered attack submarines for long-
range, stealth operations and precision land
attack with Tomahawk missiles;
■ amphibious forces, including a commando
brigade of the Royal Marines, and specialist
amphibious shipping providing a self-
contained expeditionary capability; and
■ survey vessels and a collection of logistic
support ships.
Land forces
The key land component of NATO’s Rapid
Reaction Forces is the multinational HQ of the
Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps
(ARRC) and its supporting forces. The HQ ARRC
is capable of deploying at short notice up to four
NATO divisions, and is commanded by a UK
General. The United Kingdom provides two of the
ten divisions available to the Corps. Up to 55,000
UK troops may be assigned to HQ ARRC for
operations. An air-mobile brigade, assigned to one
of the Corps’ multinational divisions, is also based
in the United Kingdom.
Air forces
The RAF contributes its full range of air capability
to NATO’s Graduated Readiness Forces, allocating
around 120 aircraft and 40 helicopters. The RAF
maintains an airlift capability, both strategic and
tactical, that can contribute to supply and troop
airlift facilities for deployed forces, including the
ARRC. It also provides Nimrod maritime patrol
92
UK 2005
8 Defence
aircraft and search and rescue helicopters. In
addition, it is the main European provider of
air-to-air refuelling, and normally contributes
25 per cent of the NATO airborne early warning
and control component.
The RAF has offered air force elements, including
the UK Joint Force Air Component Command
Headquarters, for the initial rotations of the NATO
Response Force (NRF), a joint force held at high
readiness for a variety of missions. The RAF also
provides elements to the Joint Nuclear, Biological
and Chemical (NBC) Regiment (in co-operation
with the Army) that provides a range of specialist
capabilities. Both the NRF and the NBC are to be
operational by the end of 2006.
European security and defence policy
NATO remains the cornerstone of European
territorial defence for its members and the natural
choice for an operation involving European and
American Allies. However, in 1998, it was agreed
that the European countries needed to improve
their ability to implement their common foreign
and security policy objectives in circumstances
where NATO is not involved. The EU needed the
ability to use military and police forces in addition
to the other economic, humanitarian and judicial
responses available.
In 1999 the EU launched its European security
and defence policy (ESDP), with the aims of
strengthening European military capabilities (to
benefit NATO, the EU and Member States) and of
enabling the EU to undertake crisis management
operations where NATO was not involved
militarily. Later that year the EU set itself the goal
of being able to deploy 60,000 troops capable of
conducting crisis management tasks within
60 days and to sustain them for a year.
By May 2003 more than 100,000 troops had been
pledged and the goal achieved, although it was
limited by recognised shortfalls in certain
capabilities. The UK contribution to forces
available to the EU involves around 12,500 ground
troops, 18 warships and 72 combat aircraft.
However, as with NATO and UN operations,
national forces are offered to EU operations on a
case-by-case basis, dependent on national decisions,
and working to national rules of engagement.
The UK Government has ensured ESDP develops
alongside NATO. The EU has a strategic
partnership with NATO in crisis management, and
in December 2002 the two organisations signed a
joint agreement ensuring that the EU could have
access to NATO planning in order to run its own
military operations. The EU’s first military peace
support operation drawing on NATO capabilities
started in March 2003, to help build peace and
security in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia. This concluded successfully in
December 2003. In June 2003, the EU began its
first operation without recourse to NATO, rapidly
deploying over 2,000 troops to stabilise the
security environment in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. The EU also has two police missions
in Bosnia and the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia.
The EU is planning its third military operation, in
close consultation with NATO, to deploy some
7,000 troops in a stabilisation mission to Bosnia,
following on from the conclusion of NATO’s
SFOR operation in December 2004. This will be
the largest ESDP operation yet, and the first since
the EU enlarged to 25 countries in May 2004 (see
page 71). The EU will be leading the military
operation for the first year.
A new civil/military unit is planned that will
improve EU coordination of civil and military
responses. This will have the capacity to set up
an operations centre to run a joint civil/military
operation in certain circumstances.
European military capability will continue to be
strengthened. Member States have agreed to make
available to the EU by 2007 ‘battlegroups’ of
around 1,500 troops capable of rapid deployment
within 15 days and of being sustained for an initial
period of 30 days. These groups would be
provided either by one nation or multinationally,
and would be deployed primarily in support of the
UN. In June 2004 a new goal was agreed for the
year 2010 that focuses on the speed of response
and quality of European capability, such as
improving inter-operability and how well forces
can be deployed and sustained.
In June 2004 the EU agreed to set up a European
Defence Agency by the end of 2004. This will:
■ promote and facilitate the development of
new European capabilities;
■ evaluate the capabilities offered by EU
Member States;
93
8 Defence
UK 2005
■ foster defence research and development; and
■ work with the Commission to develop a more
open and internationally competitive defence
market in Europe.
Wider security interests
UK forces working within NATO, assisting the
UN, operating in coalition with allies, or acting
alone may undertake military tasks to promote
wider UK security interests. Since the attacks in
the United States on 11 September 2001, UK
Armed Forces have taken a prominent role in the
fight against terrorism. The United Kingdom, for
example, contributed considerable forces in the
Iraq conflict in the early part of 2003 (see page
95), and maintained a large force in Iraq in 2004.
United Nations
As a permanent member of the Security Council
the United Kingdom has particular responsibility
to ensure the success of the UN. It supports the
UN by offering forces for selective operations and
providing officers to key posts in UN missions.
The United Kingdom is actively training
peacekeeping troops from third party countries,
particularly in Africa. This will give the UN a pool
of quality manpower to call upon, and will enable
African states to do more of their own
peacekeeping. The United Kingdom is also
working with EU partners on the ‘battlegroup’
concept (see page 93) to offer rapid deployment
capacity for temporary and focused support of
UN operations. A large proportion of the newly
formed Joint Rapid Reaction Forces could be
made available for future UN peacekeeping
operations, although the decision to deploy these
forces rests with the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom contributes some 7.4 per
cent of the costs of UN peacekeeping and in 2004
had 22 military observers and 434 troops deployed
on UN operations worldwide, including in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus,
Ethiopia-Eritrea, Georgia, Liberia and Sierra
Leone. Over 2,500 troops are deployed with NATO
on UN-mandated operations in Bosnia-
Herzegovina and Kosovo, including experienced
specialist personnel in the UN humanitarian mine
action programme. In March 2004, following
violent clashes in Kosovo, a further 750 UK
personnel were temporarily deployed in Kosovo.
Other activities
UK forces are involved in operations against
traffickers in illicit drugs. In the Caribbean, for
example, a Royal Navy destroyer or frigate works
closely with the United States, the OTs in the area,
and the regional authorities to combat such
trafficking.
UK forces have also participated in international
evacuation or humanitarian relief operations in
Angola, the Caribbean and Central America, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, East Timor,
Eritrea, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and
Somalia.
In recognition of the changed post-Cold War
strategic environment, a new defence mission,
‘defence diplomacy’, was created to give greater
priority, impetus and coherence to various
activities designed to prevent conflicts and
promote peacetime diplomacy.
Three military tasks contribute to the defence
diplomacy mission:
■ arms control, non-proliferation, and
confidence and security building measures;
■ outreach activities designed to contribute to
security and stability in Central and Eastern
Europe, particularly in Russia but also
extending to the Trans-Caucasus and Central
Asia, through bilateral assistance and co¬
operation programmes; and
■ military assistance programmes with overseas
forces and defence communities not covered
by outreach.
Nuclear forces
The United Kingdom, along with other members
of NATO, has radically reduced its reliance on
nuclear weapons, although it retains four Trident
submarines as the ultimate guarantee of national
security.
The United Kingdom maintains one Trident
submarine on patrol throughout the year. It
carries a load of 48 warheads. The submarine’s
missiles are not targeted and it is normally on
several days’ ‘notice to fire’. Trident submarines on
patrol also carry out a variety of secondary tasks
without compromising their security. These
include hydrographic data collection, equipment
trials and exercises with other vessels.
94
UK 2005
8 Defence
The Trident Strategic Weapon System has three
component parts:
■ four Vanguard-class ballistic missile
submarines - HMS Vanguard, Vigilant,
Victorious and Vengeance. The four
submarines enable the United Kingdom to
maintain a continuous deterrent patrol at sea
over the life of the Trident force;
■ 58 Trident D-5 long-range ballistic missiles
carried and launched by the Vanguard-class
submarines; and
■ fewer than 200 operationally available UK-
designed and built nuclear warheads with
which to equip the D-5 missiles.
The United Kingdom is the only nuclear power
that has reduced its nuclear capability to a single
system. It continues to support mutual, balanced
and verifiable reductions in the number of nuclear
weapons worldwide (see page 85). The
Government will include UK nuclear weapons in
any multilateral negotiations when it is satisfied
that sufficient progress has been made to do so
without endangering UK security interests.
The Defence White Paper published in December
2003 (see page 89) confirmed that the
Government’s nuclear policy set out in the 1998
SDR remained unchanged. Decisions on whether
to replace Trident are likely to be needed within
the next few years.
Defence equipment
Modern equipment is an essential part of the UK
restructuring programme to increase the flexibility
and mobility of the Armed Forces. A range of
equipment and systems will enter service with the
Armed Forces over the next few years.
Improvements in the Royal Navy equipment
programme include the introduction of:
■ the Astute-class attack submarines;
■ two new aircraft carriers, which will deploy
the new jointly operated RN/RAF F35 Joint
Combat Aircraft;
■ the Type 45 destroyer, which will deploy an
anti-air missile system developed with France
and Italy;
■ two new landing platform dock ships, Albion
and Bulwark. These operate with high-speed
landing craft, enabling the swift insertion or
Iraq
UK forces played a pivotal role in the US-led
coalition assault on Iraq, which began on 20
March 2003 and ended the following month on
14 April. On 22 May 2003 the UN Security
Council approved Resolution 1483 lifting
economic sanctions against Iraq and recognising
the status of the United States and the United
Kingdom as occupying powers. The United
Kingdom continued to command multinational
divisions in the south of the country during 2003
and 2004. UK forces will remain in Iraq with the
consent of the Iraqi government for as long as
they are needed, with the scale of UK
commitment dependent on the security situation
and progress in handing over responsibility to
Iraqi security forces.
In December 2003, the MoD published a report,
Operations in Iraq: Lessons for the Future. The
key points in the report included:
■ the rapid deployment of a balanced joint force
of 46,000 personnel was an exceptional
achievement and the operation demonstrated
the extent to which the UK Armed Forces can
deliver the expeditionary capabilities
envisaged in the 1998 Strategic Defence
Review (SDR) and the 2002 SDR New
Chapter;
■ the operation confirmed the need for highly
versatile UK forces that are able to mount
small and medium-sized operations on a
routine basis, while also being capable of
meeting less frequent but larger and more
demanding commitments.
withdrawal of vehicles, troops, refugees or
evacuees. They will be supported by the new
Royal Fleet Auxiliary Bay Class amphibious
shipping component;
■ updates to the Swiftsure and Trafalgar
submarines to provide enhanced capabilities,
including the ability to launch Tomahawk
Land Attack Missiles; and
■ six new roll-on/roll-off ferries, providing
significant strategic lift capability.

8 Defence
UK 2005
The Army needs a balanced structure of light,
medium and heavy forces. A new light brigade
will be established and the number of armoured
brigades will be reduced from three to two. The
Army front line is being strengthened through the
introduction of:
■ the Bowman communications system;
■ Apache attack helicopters equipped with new
anti-tank missiles;
■ improved Rapier and new Starstreak air
defence missiles; and
■ the Mobile Artillery Monitoring Battlefield
Radar (MAMBA), which can accurately detect
enemy artillery positions and can be deployed
almost anywhere.
Improvements within the RAF include the
introduction of:
■ the Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft and
new Nimrod maritime patrol and attack
aircraft;
■ EH 101 and Chinook support helicopters;
■ the C-17, C-130J, A400M transport aircraft
and new air-to-air refuelling aircraft to
replace VC 10 and TriStar aircraft; and
■ significant new weapons systems including
the Storm Shadow Stand-Off Missile, the
ASRAAM and Meteor air-to-air missiles and
a new precision guided bomb.
In addition, the Joint Force Harrier force will be
replaced with the F35 Joint Combat Aircraft
operating from aircraft carriers and from land.
The Armed Forces
The Service Personnel Plan of April 2004 set out
a strategy for recruiting, training and retaining
Armed Forces personnel and for responding to
social and demographic trends. Table 8.1 shows
the rank structure of the UK Armed Forces.
Commissioned ranks
Commissions are granted either by promotion
from the ranks or by direct entry based on
educational and other qualifications. All three
Services have school, college and university
sponsorship schemes.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training,
dependent on their Service, at the Britannia Royal
Naval College, Dartmouth; the Commando
Training Centre, Lympstone, Devon; the Royal
Military Academy, Sandhurst; or the Royal Air
Force College, Cranwell. Specialist training follows
and may include degree courses at Service
establishments or universities. The Joint Services
Command and Staff College at Shrivenham
(Wiltshire) provides courses of higher training for
officers, designed to emphasise the joint approach
to tactical and operational levels of conflict.
Non-commissioned ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks vary
widely in length and terms of service. Subject to
a minimum period, entrants may leave at any
time if they give 18 months’ notice (12 months’
for certain engagements). Discharge may also
be granted on compassionate or medical
grounds.
After basic training, non-commissioned personnel
receive supplementary specialist training
throughout their careers. Study for educational
qualifications is encouraged. The MoD, with
Department for Education and Skills assistance,
has started screening new entrants to identify
those with literacy or numeracy needs. A network
of tutors, teaching assistants and computer
hardware and software will be used to support the
development of these basic skills. Beyond this,
Service trade and technical training is wherever
possible accredited to nationally recognised
qualifications ranging from National Vocational
Qualifications to postgraduate degrees. For young
people wishing to join the Armed Forces the Army
Foundation College offers a 42-week course
combining military training and the opportunity
to acquire national qualifications. The course aims
to attract high-quality recruits who will go on to
fill senior posts in front-line roles.
Work is under way to rationalise specialist training
across the three Services and an increasing emphasis
is placed on technology in training delivery. The
MoD has recently introduced the Defence e-learning
Delivery and Management Capability, designed to
allow training to be provided to the student at the
point of need, be that in the front line or a
headquarters environment.
Defence Medical Services
The Defence Medical Services (DMS) provides
primary care for all three Services, involving the
provision of an occupational, environmental and

traditional general practice. Secondary health care
is principally provided through the NHS with six
Military Hospital Units based in NHS Trusts

hospitals in Cyprus and Gibraltar. In January 2003
there were nearly 350 more fully trained medical
personnel than in January 1999 and over 500 more

Reserve forces
The United Kingdom relies heavily on the reserve
forces that support UK regular forces by serving
both at home and overseas. The reserves also
play a crucial role in responding to natural
disasters within the United Kingdom, such as
flooding.
Over 6,000 reservists were called up for the
conflict in Iraq, and reserves are also serving in
peacekeeping and humanitarian operations in
Bosnia, Kosovo and Sierra Leone. There are two
types of reserves:
■ regular reserves, who are former members of
the regular Armed Forces liable for service in
an emergency; and
■ volunteer reserves, who are recruited directly
from the civilian community. They may join
the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines
Reserve, the Territorial Army or the Reserve Air
Forces (which comprise the Royal Auxiliary Air
Force and the Royal Air Force Reserve).

PDSA Dickin Medal 60th anniversary
In December 2003 Buster, a Royal Army
Veterinary Corps search dog, was awarded a
PDSA Dickin Medal for outstanding devotion to
duty during the conflict in Iraq. Buster discovered
an arsenal of weapons and explosives hidden in a
house in Safwan.
Maria Dickin founded The People's Dispensary for
Sick Animals, better known as PDSA, in 1917.
She instigated the PDSA Dickin Medal in 1943.
It is known as 'the animals' Victoria Cross'. One
of the early recipients was Gustav, the pigeon
that flew from Normandy to Thorney Island in
1944 bringing first news of how the D-Day
landings were progressing.
The reserves - both individuals and formed units
- need to be fully integrated with regular
formations. They need to be readily available for
service, where necessary through selective
compulsory call-out, in situations short of a direct
threat to the United Kingdom. Reserves are also
liable for service in peace support operations.
Training for this role takes place at the Reserve
Training Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell. Royal
Navy and RAF volunteer reserve numbers have
increased and, while the Territorial Army has
fallen to about 41,000, it is more closely integrated
with the regular Army, with an emphasis on
combat support.
Administration
Defence management
The Secretary of State for Defence is the cabinet
minister charged with making defence policy and
providing the means by which it is conducted. The
Secretary of State is supported by three Ministers
and is also the Chairman of the Defence Council
and of the three Service Boards: the Admiralty
Board, the Army Board and the Air Force Board.
The Permanent Secretary at the MoD is the
Government’s principal civilian adviser on defence
and has primary responsibility for policy, finance
and administration of the Department. The Chief of
the Defence Staff (CDS) is the professional head of
the Armed Forces and the principal military adviser
to the Secretary of State and the Government.
The defence budget
The defence budget for 2004/05 is expected to be
£29.7 billion. Under the 2004 Spending Review,
the budget will increase from £30.9 billion in
2005/06 to £32.1 billion in 2006/07. This growth
aims to provide the necessary investment in the
Armed Forces’ capabilities and structures to deal
with extra priorities outlined in the 2003 Defence
White Paper (see page 89).
Defence procurement
The largest element of the defence budget is
expenditure on equipment and spares. The
Defence Procurement Agency buys weaponry
and equipment for the Armed Forces. The Defence
Logistics Organisation purchases spares and stores
to support equipment in service.
The 1998 SDR aimed to provide better, cheaper
equipment more quickly resulting in ‘Smart
Acquisition’. Smart Acquisition applies to the
procurement of new equipment and to its support
in service, as well as stores and supplies. It is being
extended to non-equipment areas, such as
infrastructure and services of the defence estate.
A National Audit Office report on major MoD
projects published in January 2004 found that in¬
year costs rose by over £3 billion in 2003 and were
6.1 per cent above the approved level. Nearly 90
per cent of the cost overrun was caused by four
delayed major projects that pre-dated the
introduction of Smart Acquisition: the Eurofighter
Typhoon warplane; Nimrod reconnaissance
planes; Astute submarines; and Brimstone
air-launched anti-tank missiles.
International defence equipment
co-operation
The United Kingdom is a founder member of
OCCAR, an armament co-operation organisation
formed with France, Germany, Italy and now
Belgium, for managing joint procurement
activities. It also participates in NATO’s
Conference of National Armaments Directors, has
significant co-operative efforts with the United
States, and is a member of the six (European)
nation Letter of Intent Framework Agreement,
aimed, among other things, at reducing

expects that the new European Defence Agency
(see page 93) will contribute significantly towards
improving the coordination of armaments
procurement within the EU. Significant
co-operative programmes in which the United
Kingdom participates include:
■ production of the Eurofighter Typhoon (with
Germany, Italy and Spain);
■ the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (with
France and Italy) for use by the Type 45
destroyer;
■ a ‘Beyond Visual’ Anti-Air Missile System
(with France, Germany, Italy, Spain and
Sweden) to arm Typhoon, Rafale and Gripen;
■ the EH 101 helicopter (with Italy);
■ the Airbus A400M military transport aircraft
(with Belgium, France, Germany, Spain and
Turkey);
■ a guided missile for use with the Army’s
Multiple Launch Rocket System; and
■ a replacement aircraft, the Joint Strike
Fighter, to replace the Harrier and Sea
Harrier.

The population of the United Kingdom has grown
and changed significantly over the last half
century. Increased life expectancy and lower
fertility rates have led to an ageing population,
while immigration has led to ethnic diversity.
Living arrangements and relationship patterns
have changed; more people are living alone,
cohabitation before marriage is increasingly
common and there has been a rise in births
outside marriage. Many more women now
participate in the labour market, although they
still earn less than men and are under-represented
in senior management. The standard of living has
risen, but some people and communities are still
affected by poverty and social exclusion.
Population
The UK population was estimated to be
59.6 million in mid-2003, an increase of
0.2 million on the previous year. Projections based
on the 2002 mid-year estimates suggest that the
population will continue to increase and peak at
around 65 million in 2050 before beginning a
gradual decline.
Age and gender
The United Kingdom has an ageing population.
Between 1971 and 2003 there was an 18 per cent
decrease in the number of children aged under 16.
In contrast there was a 28 per cent increase in the
number of people aged 65 and over, and a 128 per
cent increase in those aged 85 and over.
Projections suggest that this ageing trend will
continue and that the number of people aged 65
and over will exceed those aged under 16 by 2013
(Figure 9.1). Even allowing for the increase in state
pension age for women from 60 to 65 between
2010 and 2020, there could be fewer than
2.2 people of working age for every person of
pensionable age in the 2050s, compared with
3.35 in 2002. The mean age of the population is
projected to rise from 39.3 years in 2002 to 43.6
years in 2031. Longer-term projections suggest it
will reach 45 years by about 2050, but will only
rise slightly thereafter.

Ireland Statistics and Research Agency
Lower fertility rates (see page 103) and lower
mortality rates have both contributed to the
ageing trend. Latest estimates of life expectancy
at birth (2000-02) in the United Kingdom were
75.7 years for males and 80.4 years for females.
This represents an increase over the last 30 years of
around 7 years for men and 5 years for women.
More boys than girls are born each year, but there
are more females than males in the overall

population - 30.4 million females compared with
29.1 million males in 2003, with women beginning
to outnumber men from the age of 22. Among
those aged 90 and over, women outnumber men
by more than three to one.
Births and deaths
There were 695,600 live births in the United
Kingdom in 2003, a live birth rate of 11.7 per
1,000 population. Projections suggest that the
number will remain relatively constant at around
680,000 over the next 40 years.
Some 611,800 deaths were registered in the United
Kingdom in 2003, a crude rate of 10.3 per 1,000
population. The number of deaths each year has
remained relatively constant over the last century,
Modernisation of registration services
The registration service for England and Wales
was established in 1837 and provides a national
system for the registration of births, deaths and
marriages. There have been relatively few
changes over the years and the law still requires
that every birth and death must be registered in
person in the area where it occurred. The registrar
uses pen and ink to enter the information onto a
paper register, and issues a certificate.
In July 2004 a draft Order was presented to
Parliament which would enable members of the
public to register births and deaths on-line, by
telephone, or in person at any register office. New
records of births and deaths would be kept in a
central database, to which existing records could
be added over time. This should make it easier for
people to apply for a passport or driving licence
or to deal with a relative's estate using
information held electronically, without having
to provide a paper certificate.
The Order is expected to take about a year to
complete its passage through Parliament. The
Government is also considering proposals to
modernise the procedures governing how people
give notice to marry.
in spite of population growth. They are projected
to decrease slightly over the next decade. However,
as the ageing of the population continues, deaths
are then projected to increase, and are expected to
exceed births from 2031.
A rising standard of living, and developments in
medical technology and practice, have contributed
to large declines in mortality rates over the last
hundred years. Death rates are higher for males
than females in almost all age groups, but the gap
between the sexes has narrowed in recent decades.
Households and families
There were 24.1 million private households in Great
Britain in spring 2004, an increase of 30 per cent
since 1971. Household growth has outpaced the
population (which only grew by 6 per cent to 2003)
because of the trend towards smaller households.
By spring 2004, 29 per cent of households in Great
Britain consisted of one person (Figure 9.2),
compared with 18 per cent in 1971.

Marriage, cohabitation and divorce
The majority of men and women marry at some
stage of their lives, but the proportion of the
population who are married has decreased. In
101
9 The social framework
UK 2005
1971, 71 per cent of men and 65 per cent of
women aged 16 and over in England and Wales
were married; in 2002 this was 54 per cent of men
and 50 per cent of women. Over the same period,
the proportion of the population who were single
or divorced increased, while the proportion who
were widowed remained fairly constant. First
marriages accounted for 83 per cent of all
marriages in 1970 but for only 59 per cent in 2002
(Figure 9.3).
Results from the General Household Survey
suggest that 12 per cent of 16- to 59-year-olds in
Great Britain were cohabiting in 2002/03. For the
non-married population in this age group the
figure was one in four (Figure 9.4).
About 160,700 divorces were granted in the United
Kingdom in 2002, 2.5 per cent more than 2001
(Figure 9.3). The median length of marriage for
couples divorcing in England and Wales in 2002
was 11.1 years. There has been little change in this
duration since data first became available in 1963,
when it was 11.5 years. Divorce rates are affected
by religious, social, cultural and legal differences,
resulting in wide variation between EU Member
States. The UK divorce rate was 2.7 per 1,000
population in 2002, higher than the EU-25 (see
glossary) average of 2.0.

Family formation
More than three quarters of conceptions in 2001
led to a maternity (a live or stillbirth). This
proportion has fallen steadily from 91 per cent in
1970. Conceptions to teenage women are more
likely to lead to an abortion - 40 per cent of such
conceptions were terminated by a legal abortion in

9 The social framework
Parenting after separation
The majority of children with separated parents
are in touch with both parents, although the
nature and frequency of this contact varies
widely. Approximately 10 per cent of parents
whose relationships end in separation make
applications to the courts for orders concerning
the future contact and residence arrangements
for their children. Whether or not they obtain a
court order, some parents lose touch with their
children and are unhappy with this outcome.
The Government published a consultation
document in July 2004 with proposals for
improving the outcome for children when their
parents separate. Parental Separation: Children's
Needs and Parents' Responsibilities (which
applies to England and Wales) emphasises the
provision of better information and advice, the
avoidance, where possible, of contested court
hearings, and new measures to ensure that
agreements and court orders are followed. It
rejects any automatic 50:50 division of the child's
time between the two parents on the grounds
that a 'one size fits all' formula would not be in
the best interests of most children.
2001, compared with 15 per cent of conceptions
to women aged 30 to 34. Since the 1970s fertility
rates in the United Kingdom have been below the
level needed for the long-term natural replacement
of the population. This reflects a trend towards
later childbearing, smaller families and a rise in
childlessness. Fertility rates for women under 30
years are far lower than 30 years ago, while in the
last two decades fertility rates at 30 years and over
have risen (Table 9.5). However, the data for 2003
indicate that fertility in each age group except the
under 20s was higher than in 2001.
In England and Wales, the mean age1 of women at
the birth of their first child was 26.7 years in 2002
- six years older than in 1971. Fifteen per cent of
women born in 1955 were still childless at the age
of 45, compared with 9 per cent of those born in
1945.
1 This figure has been standardised to allow for changes in the age
structure of the population.
Most children are born to married couples, but an
increasing proportion of births occur outside
marriage - 41 per cent in England and Wales in
2003, compared with 8 per cent in 1971. Most
of this growth is accounted for by the increase in
births to cohabiting couples. Of all births outside
marriage in 2003 in England and Wales, 64 per
cent were jointly registered births by parents living
at the same address.
The EU-25 (see glossary) average for births
outside marriage in 2002 was 29 per cent, ranging
from 3.5 per cent in Cyprus to 56 per cent in
Estonia and Sweden.
Migration
Population movements occur both within the
United Kingdom and internationally. During
the second half of the 20th century there was an
internal movement of people from the coal,
shipbuilding and steel industry areas in the north
of England, Wales and Scotland to the south of
England and the Midlands. Over the same period
there was immigration from Commonwealth
countries, followed more recently by an increase in
the number of people seeking asylum in the
United Kingdom.
Internal migration
In 2002, it is estimated that Wales gained 14,300
people from migration within the United
Kingdom, Scotland gained 4,300 people, and
Northern Ireland lost around 300 people. England
experienced a net loss of 18,400 people. At a
regional level, the greatest net loss due to internal
migration occurred in London, where 107,800
more people moved from the capital to other
regions of the country than moved into London.
International migration
Although the United Kingdom experienced a net
loss of people due to migration during the 1970s
and early 1980s, the position has reversed and
since the late 1990s net migration into the United
Kingdom has increasingly been a factor in
population growth. A migrant is defined as
someone who changes his or her country of usual
residence for at least a year, so that the country of
destination becomes the country of usual residence.
It is estimated that 153,400 more people migrated
to, rather than from, the United Kingdom in 2002,

a decrease of 11 per cent on the 2001 level. The
number of in-migrants to the United Kingdom
increased from 479,600 in 2001 to 512,800 in 2002.
There were 359,400 out-migrants in 2002, 51,700
more than in 2001.
Immigration law
Immigration into the United Kingdom is largely
governed by the Immigration Act 1971. Rules
made under this Act set out the requirements to
be met by those who are subject to immigration
control and seek entry to, or leave to remain in,
the United Kingdom. The 1971 Act has been
amended by subsequent legislation, including
the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
and the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of
Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.
Nationals of the European Economic Area (EEA) -
EU Member States and Iceland, Liechtenstein and
Norway - are not subject to substantive
immigration control. They may work in the
United Kingdom without restriction and, provided
they are working or able to support themselves
financially, have the right to reside in the United
Kingdom. Slightly different arrangements have
been introduced for most of the countries that
joined the EU in 2004 (see pages 71 and 175).
Visas
Under the Immigration Rules, nationals of certain
countries must obtain a visa before they can visit
the United Kingdom. Nationals from other
countries subject to immigration control must
obtain entry clearance when coming to work or
settle. Visas and other entry clearances are
normally obtained from the nearest UK
diplomatic post in a person’s home country. In
2002 there were around 2 million applications
for visas or other entry clearance, with around
1.7 million being successful.
Settlement in the United Kingdom
In 2003, 143,000 people were granted permanent
settlement in the United Kingdom, 21 per cent
more than in 2002 (Table 9.6). Of these grants,
38 per cent were to Asian nationals, and a further
31 per cent to African nationals.
Managed migration
The Government believes that managed migration
can help overcome recruitment difficulties, bring
innovation and capital into the country and
counteract the effects of the ageing population. It
has taken a number of steps to encourage people
with skills and expertise to come and work in the
United Kingdom, by overhauling the work permit2
system and by introducing special schemes for
certain categories of migrant, including
entrepreneurs, temporary workers in hotels and
catering, and overseas nurses, doctors and dentists
who graduate in this country and wish to switch

demonstrate they cannot fill the post with a domestic worker.

to work permit employment. Around 136,000
work permits were granted in 2002.
Under the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme,
skilled individuals who are not EEA nationals
(see page 104) can apply to come to the United
Kingdom to seek work or self-employment
opportunities. They do not need to find a specific
job before applying. Applications are assessed on a
points-based system in the following areas:
■ educational qualifications;
■ work experience;
■ past earnings;
■ achievement in a chosen field; and
■ achievements of spouse or partner.
There is also a special category for overseas
doctors wishing to become self-employed GPs.
Successful applicants are granted leave to enter
the United Kingdom for one year, following which
further leave may be granted depending on the
individual’s employment status.
Asylum
The United Kingdom has a tradition of giving
asylum to those in need of protection, and is a
signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention
and its 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of
Refugees. These provide that lawful residents, who
have been granted refugee status, should enjoy
treatment at least as favourable as that accorded to

In the late 1980s applications to the United
Kingdom for asylum started to rise sharply, from
around 4,000 a year in the period from 1985 to
1988, to a record 84,130 in 2002.3 In 2003 the
number of applications fell to 49,405, a decrease
of 41 per cent on the previous year. In the first six
months of 2004 applications for asylum averaged
2,810 a month. This was 37 per cent lower than in
the same period a year earlier. Reforms to the
asylum system and measures to secure the
Channel Tunnel and move UK border controls to
France are thought to have contributed to this
overall decline.
The main nationalities applying for asylum in
the United Kingdom in 2003 were: Somali (5,090
applicants); Iraqi (4,015 applicants); Chinese
(3,450 applicants); Zimbabwean (3,295
applicants); and Iranian (2,875 applicants).
Around 64,940 initial asylum decisions were made
in 2003. Of these decisions, 6 per cent were grants
of asylum, compared with 10 per cent in 2002. A
further 11 per cent of decisions in 2003 were grants
of exceptional leave to remain,4 humanitarian
protection or discretionary leave and 83 per cent
were refusals. Many failed asylum seekers appeal
against refusal: of the 81,725 appeals determined
by adjudicators in 2003, 16,070 (20 per cent) were
successful. The backlog of cases awaiting an initial
decision was 23,900 at the end of 2003, compared
with 41,300 a year earlier.
The 41 per cent fall in applications to the United
Kingdom during 2003 compared with a 19 per
cent drop across the EU-25 as a whole. When the

relative size of each country is taken into account,
applications to the United Kingdom equalled the
EU average (1.0 applicants - including dependants
- per 1,000 population). Austria had the highest
rate at 4.0 per 1,000 population, while Portugal
had the lowest (fewer than 0.01 per 1,000
population).
Support for asylum seekers
The National Asylum Support Service (NASS)
provides support to qualifying asylum seekers
until a decision is made on their claim. The
support is in the form of cash benefits: a single
adult aged 25 or over receives approximately £39
a week. NASS also provides short-term emergency
accommodation and longer-term accommodation,
on a ‘no choice’ basis, placing applicants at a
number of dispersal areas across the United
Kingdom. Children of compulsory school age in
families seeking asylum must attend school, and
asylum seekers and their dependants are eligible to
receive free healthcare. Support for living costs and
help with housing is no longer available to those
who do not claim asylum when they arrive at a
port, or as soon as possible thereafter, and who
cannot give a satisfactory explanation. Once
people are granted refugee status or humanitarian
protection they are entitled to claim public funds.
Assistance with legal costs is available in some
cases, through the Legal Services Commission in
England and Wales, the Scottish Legal Aid Board
and the Law Society of Northern Ireland. Unless
exempted by the Immigration and Asylum Act
1999, immigration advisers who do not belong to
designated professional bodies must register with
the Office of the Immigration Services
Commissioner, who is responsible for ensuring
that they meet good practice requirements.
Recent reforms to asylum and
immigration law
The Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of
Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 unifies the immigration
and asylum appeals system into a single tier of
appeal with limited onward review or appeal.
The Act includes measures to:
■ make it an offence to arrive in the United
Kingdom without a valid immigration
document when the person cannot show they
have a reasonable excuse;
■ deal with situations where it is deemed that
a country other than the United Kingdom
is best placed to consider someone’s asylum
or human rights claim substantively;
■ withdraw family support after appeal from
those who are in a position to leave the
United Kingdom;
■ make community work an obligation for
failed asylum seekers who receive support
because they cannot return home;
■ require non-EEA foreign nationals to
demonstrate they have entered the United
Kingdom lawfully before giving notice of an
intended marriage at a designated registry
office; and
■ enhance the powers of the Office of the
Immigration Services Commissioner.
Citizenship
Under the British Nationality Act 1981, there are
several forms of British nationality:
■ British citizenship generally applies to those
with a close connection with the United
Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of
Man;
■ British Overseas Territories citizenship applies
to people with a close connection with one of
the Overseas Territories (see page 77);
■ British National (Overseas) Status, for people
who, before July 1997, were connected with
Hong Kong; and
■ for those connected with a former British
colony, Ireland (before 1949), or former
British India, or a territory that was formerly
under British protection, there are categories
such as British Overseas citizenship, British
subject, and British protected person.
British citizens have the right to live permanently
in the United Kingdom and are free to leave and
re-enter the country at any time. British citizenship
is acquired automatically at birth by a child born
in the United Kingdom or a ‘qualifying territory’
(if born on or after 21 May 2002) if his or her
mother (or father, if the child is legitimate) is:
■ a British citizen; or
■ settled in the United Kingdom; or
■ settled in that ‘qualifying territory’ (if
appropriate).
106
UK 2005
9 The social framework
British citizenship may also be acquired by
registration or naturalisation, and in some
circumstances by children who have been adopted.
Among those entitled to apply for registration are
British nationals, children born in the United
Kingdom who did not automatically acquire
British citizenship at birth, and stateless people.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion and there are a number of residential
and other requirements.
In 2003, 124,315 people (Figure 9.7) were granted
British Citizenship in the United Kingdom (3 per
cent more than in 2002) and 10,680 were refused
or withdrew their application. Residence in the
United Kingdom continued to be the most
frequent basis on which people were granted
British citizenship, amounting to 44 per cent of
grants in 2003, while marriage to a British citizen
accounted for nearly 30 per cent.

The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
2002 introduced a citizenship ceremony, including
a citizenship oath and pledge (see box), and
a requirement that naturalisation applicants
demonstrate knowledge about life in the United
Kingdom. The Prince of Wales and the Home
Secretary attended the first ceremony in the
London Borough of Brent in February 2004.
Ceremony of naturalisation
Oath of allegiance:
I, (name), (swear by almighty God/do solemnly
and truly declare and affirm) that, on becoming a
British citizen, I will be faithful and bear true
allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Her
Heirs and Successors according to law.
Pledge
I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and
respect its rights and freedoms. I will uphold its
democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully
and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British
citizen.
Identity cards
The United Kingdom (along with Denmark, the
Republic of Ireland, and Latvia) is one of four
countries in the EU where people do not carry
identity cards, either compulsorily or voluntarily.
In April 2004 the Home Office consulted on a
draft Identity Cards Bill that would establish a
legislative framework for the gradual introduction
of a national scheme.
The Government hopes that the introduction
of identity cards will help to prevent identity
fraud, counter the threat of global terrorism
and ensure that free public services are only
accessed by those entitled to them. It intends
in the first instance to build on documents such
as passports and driving licences. Although
eventually it may be compulsory to register and
hold an identity card, the Government is not
proposing to make it compulsory to carry such
a card or to produce it without good reason.
However, in time it may be necessary to produce
a card in order to access public services.
The draft Bill covers everyone aged 16 or over who
is legally resident in the United Kingdom for three
or more months.
Ethnicity and identity
For centuries people from overseas have settled
in the United Kingdom, either to escape
political or religious persecution or in search
of better economic opportunities. Irish people
have a long history of migration to the United

Kingdom, and many Jewish refugees arrived
towards the end of the 19th century and in
the 1930s. Substantial immigration from the
Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent dates
principally from the 1950s and 1960s, when the
Government encouraged immigration from
these areas to tackle labour shortages. Many
people of south Asian descent also entered the
United Kingdom from Kenya, Malawi and
Uganda in the 1960s and 1970s. Recent trends
in asylum applications have also added to the
cultural and religious diversity of the UK
population (see page 105).
In the 2001 Census, 4.6 million people (8 per cent
of the UK population) described themselves as
belonging to a minority ethnic5 group. These
groups have a younger age profile than the White

population, reflecting past immigration and
fertility patterns. In Great Britain, 691,000 people
identified themselves as White Irish and 1.4
million people as ‘Other White’.
People from minority ethnic groups were more
likely to live in England than in the rest of the
United Kingdom. They made up 9 per cent of
the population of England in 2001 compared with
2 per cent of the population of both Wales and
Scotland and 1 per cent of the population of
Northern Ireland. Nearly half (45 per cent) of the
total minority ethnic population lived in London,
where they comprised 29 per cent of all residents.
However, the extent to which individual ethnic
groups were concentrated in London varied
considerably; for example, 78 per cent of Black
Africans lived in London compared with just
19 per cent of Pakistanis.
Equal opportunities
Race equality
People from certain ethnic groups are more likely
to experience poverty and social exclusion. The
Households Below Average Income Series
published by the Department of Work and
Pensions (DWP) shows that the percentage of
people living in low-income households in
2002/03 was higher when the household reference
person (HRP - see glossary) belonged to a
minority ethnic group, particularly when the
HRP was of Pakistani/Bangladeshi descent.
In areas such as education, health, housing and the
labour market, there are considerable variations
between minority ethnic groups and within the
White group. Lor example, Indian, White Irish,
Chinese and Black African, were more likely to
be working in a professional occupation in Great
Britain in 2001/02 than people who described
themselves as White British.
Race relations policy and legislation
The Home Office has overall responsibility for
policy and legislation on racial equality. The
equality unit in the Scottish Executive is also
responsible for work in this area. In Great Britain,
the Race Relations Act 1976 makes it unlawful
to discriminate on grounds of race, colour,
nationality (including citizenship), or ethnic or
national origins (referred to as ‘racial grounds’).
108
UK 2005
9 The social framework
The Act applies to employment, training,
education and the provision of goods and services.
Legislation along similar lines was introduced in
Northern Ireland in 1977.
Amendments introduced under the Race Relations
Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003 also
ensure that Great Britain meets the standards
of protection from racial discrimination and
harassment required by the EC Article 13 Race
Discrimination Directive of 2000.
The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000
extended the scope of the 1976 Act to cover the
way most public authorities carry out their public
functions. Public authorities listed under the Act
have a statutory general duty to work to eliminate
unlawful racial discrimination and promote equal
opportunities and good relations between people
from different racial groups. Certain listed public
bodies also have specific duties to fulfil. These
include producing and publishing a race equality
scheme to explain how they will meet these
general duties, and monitoring the ethnic origin of
staff and applicants for jobs, promotion and
training. The Commission for Racial Equality
(CRE, see below) has published a statutory code of
practice to provide guidance to public bodies on
how to meet these duties. In May 2004 the CRE
also released a draff employment code to update
and replace the statutory code issued in 1984.
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 created racially
aggravated versions of a number of existing
offences in England and Wales, including assault,
criminal damage and harassment. These racially
aggravated offences carry a higher maximum
penalty. Scottish criminal law provides for the
statutory aggravation of any offence on the
grounds of racial (or religious) prejudice and the
specific offence of racially aggravated harassment
or behaviour.
In May 2004 the Government announced a period
of consultation on community cohesion and race
equality, prior to the launch of a new strategy in
autumn 2004. The consultation paper, Strength in
Diversity, covers issues such as citizenship and
identity, eradicating racism and extremism, and
tackling inequality.
Commission for Racial Equality
The CRE was set up under the Race Relations Act
1976, to tackle racial discrimination and promote
equal opportunities and good race relations in
Great Britain. The CRE has the power to investigate
companies and organisations if it has sufficient
evidence that unlawful racial discrimination has
taken place, and it can issue non-discrimination
notices, requiring them to change their policies and
practice. The CRE also provides legal advice to
people who think they have been discriminated
against; in 2003 around 900 people made formal
applications for assistance.
In 2003 the CRE supported the work of 93
organisations in Great Britain. Most of these were
racial equality councils - voluntary bodies jointly
funded by the CRE and local authorities whose job
it is to promote good race relations locally.
In Northern Ireland equivalent responsibilities rest
with the Equality Commission for Northern
Ireland, whose remit also covers other types of
unlawful discrimination.
Gender
The economic and domestic lives of women have
changed considerably over time, and women have
taken an increasingly important role in the labour
market. In 1971, 55 per cent of women of working
age in the United Kingdom were in employment,
compared with 91 per cent of men. By spring 2004,
in Great Britain, the rate for women was 70 per cent
while the rate for men was 79 per cent. The
likelihood of women being in employment,
however, varies considerably according to whether
or not they have dependent children. Employment
rates are lowest for those women with a child under
the age of five (53 per cent in spring 2004).
The pay gap between men and women who work
full-time narrowed between 2002 and 2003, to the
lowest since records began. The average gross
weekly earnings of women working full-time in
April 2003 were 75.4 per cent of those for men
(£396 compared with £525).
Causes of the gender pay gap include the fact that
men and women tend to work in different
occupations and the impact of family
responsibilities, as well as the possibility of pay
discrimination. A much higher proportion of
women than men work in administrative and
secretarial jobs, for example, while a higher
proportion of men work in skilled trades (see
Table 11.3 on page 147).
109
9 The social framework
UK 2005
Equal opportunities policy and legislation
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, women and men in
Great Britain are entitled to equal pay when doing
work that is the same or broadly similar, work that
is rated as equivalent, or work that is of equal
value. The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (as
amended) makes it unlawful in Great Britain to
discriminate between men and women in
employment and vocational training, education,
and the provision and sale of goods, facilities,
services and premises. The Act also outlaws
discrimination in employment and training on
the grounds of gender reassignment and being
married. Similar legislation on sex discrimination
and equal pay applies in Northern Ireland.
There are two Ministers for Women, supported by
the Women and Equality Unit based in the
Department of Trade and Industry. They are
responsible for a range of gender equality issues
in Government and are sponsors of the Equal
Opportunities Commission (EOC). The Equality
Unit in the Scottish Executive and the Gender
Policy Unit in the Northern Ireland Executive are
also responsible for work in this area.
The Civil Partnership Bill, introduced into
Parliament in March 2004, would give same sex
couples in England and Wales the option of
gaining formal legal recognition for their
relationship. A range of rights and responsibilities
would apply to those who choose to register as
civil partners. These include:
■ a duty to provide reasonable maintenance for
the civil partner and for children of the
family;
■ civil partners to be assessed in the same way
as spouses for child support;
■ equitable treatment for the purposes of life
assurance;
■ employment and pension benefits;
■ recognition under intestacy rules;
■ access to fatal accidents compensation;
■ protection from domestic violence; and
■ recognition for immigration and nationality
purposes.
A number of other EU Member States have already
introduced a form of civil partnership registration
- the first to do so was Denmark in 1989.
The Gender Recognition Act 2004 gives transsexual
people the right to seek legal recognition in their
acquired gender. If recognition is granted, they will
be regarded for almost all purposes as being of
their acquired gender. This means that a legally
recognised transsexual person will be able to
marry in their acquired gender, obtain a new birth
certificate, and receive State benefits and pensions.
The Act includes a few exemptions, for example in
respect of sports governing bodies, who may in
some circumstances restrict participation in
competitive events of someone seeking to compete
in their acquired gender. The Act follows two
judgments in the European Court of Human
Rights in 2002, when the United Kingdom was
found to have breached the Convention rights of
transsexual people.
Equal Opportunities Commission
The EOC was established under the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975. It is an independent
statutory body, which has the powers to:
■ work towards the elimination of
discrimination on the grounds of sex or
marital status;
■ promote equality of opportunity between
women and men;
■ review, and propose amendments to, the Sex
Discrimination Act and the Equal Pay Act, and
■ provide legal advice and assistance to
individuals who have been discriminated
against.
Northern Ireland has its own Equality
Commission responsible for tackling
discrimination and promoting gender equality. It
is an independent public body established under
the Northern Ireland Act (1998). The Commission
also promotes equality of opportunity between
persons of different religious beliefs, political
opinions, ethnic groups, age, marital status and
sexual orientation, between those with and
without a disability, and between those with and
without dependants.
Disability
According to the DWP, there were around
10 million disabled adults and 700,000 disabled
children in the United Kingdom in 2002/03, using
the definition of disability in the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 (see below). Despite
significant progress in recent years, disabled
people still do not have the same opportunities to
participate in society. In spring 2004, for example,
50 per cent of the 7 million disabled people of
110

9 The social framework
working age in the United Kingdom were in
employment, compared with 80 per cent of non¬
disabled people. People with learning difficulties
and mental health problems were the least likely
to be in employment.
The unemployment rate for disabled people was
higher than for non-disabled people (7.8 per cent
and 4.6 per cent respectively). The likelihood of
being long-term unemployed was also higher,
at 33 per cent of unemployed disabled people
compared with 18 per cent of non-disabled
people.
Disability rights policy and legislation
The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 protects
disabled people in the United Kingdom against
discrimination in the areas of employment, access
to goods, facilities and services, buying or renting
land or property and education. The Act allows
the Government to set minimum standards so that
disabled people can use public transport more
easily. The definition of disabled under the Act
requires a mental or physical impairment that has
an adverse effect on someone’s ability to carry out
normal day-to-day activities over a period of at
least twelve months. The adverse effect must be
substantial and long-term.
The rights of access afforded to disabled people
under the Act place a duty on businesses to adjust
the way they provide services to the public,
changing their policies, practices and procedures
where reasonable. From October 2004 service
providers will have to take steps to remove, alter or
provide means of avoiding physical features that
make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for
disabled people to use their services. The
Government also intends to introduce a statutory
duty on public bodies to promote equality for
disabled people.
There is a Minister for Disabled People, supported
by the Disability Unit in the DWP. The Unit
provides advice and policy information relating to
disability in the United Kingdom. The Equality
Unit in the Scottish Executive is also responsible
for work in this area.
A draft Disability Discrimination Bill was
published in December 2003. It proposes measures
to extend the scope of existing legislation to cover
most public sector activities and to place a new
duty on public bodies to promote equal
opportunities for disabled people.
Disability Rights Commission
The DRC, established under the Disability Rights
Commission Act 1999, is an independent body,
funded by the Government, that works towards
eliminating discrimination and promoting equal
opportunities for disabled people in Great Britain.
It also promotes good practice with employers and
service providers and advises the Government on
the working of the disability discrimination
legislation. In 2003/04 the DRC received over
120,000 calls to its helpline. It has provided legal
representation and support in 215 legal cases since
2000.
Proposed Commission for Equality and
Human Rights (CEHR)
A White Paper published in May 2004 {Fairness
For All: A New Commission for Equality and
Fluman Rights) contains plans for a new body to
bring together the work of the CRE, EOC and
DRC and to promote human rights. The proposed
CEHR would also take responsibility for new
legislation outlawing workplace discrimination on
grounds of religion or belief and sexual
orientation and, in time, age. Primary legislation
will be required to establish the CEHR. The
Government has also confirmed that it will take
steps to introduce a statutory duty on public
bodies to promote gender equality.
Low-income households
Although there have been substantial long-term
improvements in the standard of living, there
remain concerns about the relative deprivation of
some people and communities. The distribution of
income and wealth is uneven. For example:
■ the average original income6 of the top 20 per
cent of UK households in 2002/03 (£60,300)
was around 15 times greater than for those in
the bottom 20 per cent (£4,000). Benefits and,
to a lesser extent, taxes reduce this inequality
so that the ratio for final income is four to
one;
6 Original income is income before any state intervention in the
form of taxes and benefits.
111
9 The social framework
UK 2005
■ in 2002/03, 17 per cent of the population of
Great Britain lived in households with a low
income (see glossary), before housing costs
are taken into account, although this has
fallen since the peak of 21 per cent in 1992.
Lone parent families, pensioners and children
are more likely to live in a low-income
household than people of working age who
do not have children; and
■ the wealthiest 10 per cent of the UK
population owned 56 per cent of marketable
wealth in 2001, or 72 per cent of marketable
wealth excluding the value of dwellings.
In all, 17 per cent of the UK population was at
risk of poverty (that is living in a low income
household) in 2001, compared with 15 per cent for
the EU-25 (see glossary) as a whole. The variation
between Member States was quite wide, ranging
from 8 per cent in the Czech Republic to 21 per
cent in the Republic of Ireland and Slovakia.
Social exclusion
The term ‘social exclusion’ describes individuals
or areas suffering from a combination of linked
problems, such as unemployment, poor skills, low
incomes, unfair discrimination, poor housing,
high crime, bad health and family breakdown.
The Social Exclusion Unit (SEU), based in the
Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, was set up in
1997 to reduce social exclusion in England. The
Unit liaises with the Welsh, Scottish and Northern
Ireland administrations, which have their own
strategies for tackling social exclusion. Previously
published reports have led to new policies to
tackle, for example, truancy, rough sleeping,
Action on debt
The SEU published Action on Debt, a report and
fact pack, in April 2004 following an
announcement in the Budget that the Government
would work with both the financial services sector
and voluntary and community bodies to improve
the availability of free debt advice for those in
need of it. The report is aimed at managers and
decision makers in several sectors including health,
employment, justice and neighbourhood renewal,
and sets out how they can work together and
individually to help alleviate debt among those
with the lowest incomes.
Joseph Rowntree Foundation
The Joseph Rowntree Foundation celebrated its
centenary in 2004. It was originally set up by
Joseph Rowntree, a Quaker and businessman,
and is one of the largest social policy research
and development charities in the United
Kingdom. Its budget for 2004 is £8.6 million. Of
this, about £5.5 million is used to fund research
and development work that focuses on the
causes of social disadvantage and ways of
overcoming them through improved policy and
practice. The Foundation does not carry out
research in-house, but supports projects carried
out by academic and other institutions. It also
engages in practical housing and care work
through the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust.

Neighbourhood Renewal
In 2001, A New Commitment to Neighbourhood
Renewal: A National Strategy Action Plan set out
the Government’s plans for delivering economic
prosperity, safe communities, high-quality
education, decent housing and better health to the
poorest parts of the country (see page 320). The
plan is implemented by the Neighbourhood
Renewal Unit.
Social participation
Many voluntary and community organisations are
involved in activities that improve the quality of
life in the local community, working in areas as
diverse as social welfare, education, sport, heritage,
the environment and the arts.The National
Council for Voluntary Organisations is the
umbrella body for the voluntary sector in England.
It has a growing membership of over 3,500 in
2004, ranging from large national charities to
small local community groups.
The 2003 Home Office Citizenship Survey found
that in the 12 months prior to interview, 28 per
112
UK 2005
9 The social framework
cent of the population aged 16 and over in
England had been involved at least once a month
in formal volunteering - defined as giving unpaid
help through groups, clubs or organisations in
order to benefit other people or the environment.
Thirty seven per cent of the population had been
involved in informal volunteering at least once a
month, by giving unpaid help to someone who
was not a family member.
The Government encourages links between the
statutory, voluntary and community sectors. The
Active Community Unit at the Home Office aims
to promote and develop the voluntary and
community sector and encourage people to
become actively involved in their communities.
The Government has set a target to increase
voluntary and community sector participation by
5 per cent by 2006.
The Youth Service is a partnership between local
government and voluntary organisations
concerned with the informal personal and social
education of young people aged 11 to 25 (5 to 25
in Northern Ireland). Local authorities manage
their own youth centres and clubs and provide
most of the public support for local and regional
organisations. In England there is also a
nationwide support service for 13- to 19-year-olds
(Connexions - see page 127).
Charities
The Charity Commission is established by law as
the regulator and registrar for charities in England
and Wales. To become a registered charity an
organisation must have purposes that are
exclusively philanthropic, such as:
■ the relief of financial hardship;
■ the advancement of education;
■ the advancement of religion; or
■ other charitable purposes for the benefit of
the community, such as urban and rural
regeneration or the relief of unemployment.
In 2003/04 around 8,300 applications were
received for registration from organisations, of
which more than 6,200 were accepted and placed
on the Public Register of Charities. Around 5,200
charities were removed from the register. There
were approximately 165,000 registered charities in
England and Wales at the end of March 2004.
An organisation based in England and Wales must
register with the Charity Commission if it fulfils
both the requirements for charitable status and the
minimum requirements for registration. Some
charities, called exempt charities, cannot register,
and are not subject to the Commission’s
supervisory powers. These include, among others,
some educational institutions, including most
universities and national museums. Charities
elsewhere in the United Kingdom are not required
to register with a government organisation, but do
need to seek recognition of their charitable status
with the Inland Revenue for tax purposes.
The Charity Commission aims to provide effective
regulation of charities in England and Wales in
order to increase their efficiency and effectiveness
and to promote public confidence and trust. The
Commission has powers to investigate abuse and
mismanagement and, where necessary, will
intervene to protect charities from crime and
remedy problems. Over 400 investigations were
carried out in 2003/04.
The Charities Aid Foundation (CAE) is a
registered charity that works to increase resources
for the voluntary sector in the United Kingdom and
overseas. It provides services that are both charitable
and financial and undertakes a comprehensive
programme of research and is a leading source of
information on the voluntary sector.
Funding
At the end of March 2004, the total annual income
of all registered charities in England and Wales
was estimated at over £32 billion. Approximately
7 per cent of registered charities receive nearly
90 per cent of the total annual income recorded,
while around two-thirds have an income of
£10,000 or less a year and account for under
1 per cent of the annual total.
Voluntary organisations may receive income from
several sources, including:
■ central and local government grants;
■ contributions from individuals, businesses
and trusts;
■ earnings from commercial activities and
investments; and
■ fees from central and local government for
services provided on a contractual basis.

Busy year for RNU
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) had
its busiest year in 2003. Lifeboats were launched
a record 8,901 times and 7,987 people were
rescued.
The number of lifeboats launched has more than
doubled since 1986. This increase is partly a
result of changing patterns of sea use by the
public and improved search and rescue
techniques. The rapid increase in the use of
mobile phones (see page 252) is another factor
and, for 2003, a long hot summer.
The RNLI is a registered charity providing a 24-
hour service to cover search and rescue
requirements up to 50 miles out from the coast.
It depends on voluntary contributions and
legacies. There are more than 4,600 crew
members, most of whom are volunteers,
v   J
Since its introduction in 1994, the National Lottery
(see page 275) has given charities and voluntary
organisations substantial funding for projects across
a range of activities. Another valuable source of
revenue for charities is through tax relief and tax
exemptions. When an individual makes a donation
under the Gift Aid scheme the charity can claim
back the basic rate of tax, increasing the value of the
donation by 28 per cent based on current tax rates.
In addition, gifts of land and property, and gifts of
quoted stocks and shares can be offset against
income. All gifts and bequests to charities are
exempt from inheritance tax.
Under the Payroll Giving scheme, available since
1987, employees can make a tax-deductible gift to
charity on a regular basis from their payroll. It is
open to all employed (and some retired) taxpayers,
provided their employer is registered with a payroll
giving agent. Around 2 per cent of those on PAYE
who have access to such a scheme participate by
making donations through their payroll. The
average donation is around £5 per month, and in
2002/03, over 500,000 PAYE employees gave in this
manner. Payroll giving has more than doubled
between 1999/2000 and 2003/04, from £37 million
to £85 million (Figure 9.9).

Sustainable development
A widely used definition of sustainable
development is ‘development that meets the needs
of the present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs’. The
Government has set out four key objectives that
need to be met simultaneously to achieve this:
■ social progress that recognises the needs of
everyone;
■ effective protection of the environment;
■ prudent use of natural resources; and
■ maintenance of high and stable levels of
economic growth and employment.
The Government’s sustainable development
strategy, A Better Quality of Life, identifies a core
set of around 150 indicators of sustainable
development with a subset of 15 headline
indicators to provide an overview of progress. The
indicators relate, as far as possible, to the United
Kingdom as a whole and cover economic and
social, as well as environmental concerns. The
nine English regions have their own versions of
the 15 headline indicators.
The strategy also sets out a number of guiding
principles - for example the need to take a long¬
term perspective; to support economic growth in
all countries; to combat poverty and social
exclusion; and not to allow a lack of full scientific
knowledge to be used as a reason for postponing
cost-effective measures to prevent environmental

degradation when there are threats of serious or
irreversible damage (the precautionary principle).
The Government reports annually on progress
towards sustainable development. Achieving a
Better Quality of Life: Review of progress towards
sustainable development, covering 2003 as well as
reviewing progress since 1999, was published in
March 2004 along with Quality of Life Counts, an
update of the indicators. This is the last progress
report in this format. The Government plans to
have a new scheme in place early in 2005, and in
April 2004 announced a joint consultation with
the devolved administrations on developing a new
strategy.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Defra) funds the Sustainable Development
Research Network, which was set up to contribute
to sustainable development in the United
Kingdom by facilitating the better use of evidence
and research in policymaking. The Sustainable
Development Commission, an advisory non-
departmental public body reporting to the Prime
Minister and leaders of the devolved
administrations, acts as an advocate and
independent adviser to government on the actions
needed.
The National Assembly for Wales has a legal duty
to promote sustainable development in its
functions. It has adopted a sustainable
development scheme for Wales, Learning to Live
Differently, to provide a framework for this duty.
Its list of headline indicators reflects Welsh
concerns and priorities such as the percentage of
Welsh speakers, the amount of electricity
produced by renewable sources and Wales’ global
ecological footprint. The latest data on the 12
headline indicators for Wales were published in
March 2004.
The Scottish Executive has identified resource use,
energy and travel as priority areas and adopted a
number of sustainable development targets.
Progress is measured via indicators such as the
proportion of household waste recycled and the
total number of households living in fuel
poverty.7 The Scottish Executive published its latest
progress report in February 2004.
7 The need for a household to spend more than 10 per cent of its
income on fuel to maintain a satisfactory heating regime.
The Department of the Environment (DoE) is
developing a sustainable development strategy for
Northern Ireland, together with a set of indicators.
This strategy is linked to the DoE’s efforts to
introduce environmental legislation on air quality
and waste management. It will complement:
■ the Regional Development Strategy for
Northern Ireland 2025, which seeks to provide
a development framework that will work
towards balanced and sustainable
development. The first annual monitoring
report was published in October 2003;
■ the Growing for a Green Economy Strategy,
which seeks to achieve sustainable economic
development through more efficient business
practices; and
■ the Northern Ireland Biodiversity Strategy.
International development and
co-operation
The UK Government has identified four key areas
when considering sustainable development in an
international context:
■ working with others to eliminate global
poverty and raise living standards in
developing countries;
■ working with others to tackle the global
pressures on the environment and resources;
■ promoting a fair and open trade system that
respects the environment; and
■ strengthening the place of sustainable
development in the work of international
organisations.
Overseas aid and trade
In the 2004 Spending Review, the Government
made a commitment to increase its overseas aid
budget (see page 82) to 0.47 per cent of gross
national income (GNI) by 2006/07.
In 2003, the Export Credits Guarantee
Department (see page 386) announced it would
make available at least £50 million of guarantees
each year to help the UK renewable energy sector
assist developing countries to limit greenhouse gas
emissions. It aims to encourage UK companies to
export renewable energy goods and services, by
offering them insurance against the risks of non¬
payment, and to help developing countries meet
their power generation requirements in a
sustainable way.

Fairtrade
Fairtrade is a trading partnership that aims to
achieve greater equity in international trade. It
offers better trading conditions to, and secures
the rights of, marginalised farmers and workers in
the developing world, helping to reduce poverty
and improve living standards. The Fairtrade
Foundation, which certifies and promotes
Fairtrade, was set up by a number of agencies
including the charities Cafod, Christian Aid,
Oxfam, Traidcraft Exchange, and the World
Development Movement.
The year 2004 is the tenth year of the Fairtrade
mark and, in March 2004, announced that sales
of Fairtrade products in the United Kingdom in
2003 totalled an estimated retail value of over
£92 million - 46 per cent higher than in 2002.
By the end of 2003, UK shoppers were spending
over £2 million a week on products with the
Fairtrade Mark compared with £2.7 million spent
in the whole of 1994.

Parents are required by law to ensure that their
children receive full-time education between the
ages of 5 and 16 in Great Britain and between
4 and 16 in Northern Ireland. In 2004, almost
three-quarters of 16-year-olds in the United
Kingdom remained in full-time education after
this age, either in school or further education
colleges. Around 44 per cent of young people in
England entered universities or other institutions
of higher education. However, increasing emphasis
is also placed on lifelong learning as a way of
creating skills and improving employment
prospects in a changing labour market.
Pre-school children
Early or pre-school education is expanding to ensure
that all children begin their compulsory education
with key skills such as listening, concentration and
learning to work with others, and that they have a
basic foundation in literacy and numeracy.
The proportion of three- and four-year-olds
enrolled in schools in the United Kingdom rose
from 29 per cent in 1973/74 to 65 per cent in
2003/04 (see Figure 10.1). In 2003/04, 35 per cent of
children in this age group were enrolled in other
settings offering early education such as playgroups
in the private and voluntary sectors, either instead
of, or in addition to, their school place.
In England, every three- and four-year-old is
entitled to a free, part-time early education place if
their parents want one. Places can be in the state,
private or voluntary sector, as long as the provider
agrees to work to curricular goals.
In Wales free, part-time early years places must be
provided for four-year-olds and a pilot scheme to
implement a foundation phase of education for
three- to seven-year-olds began in September
2004. In Scotland local authorities have a duty to
secure a free pre-school education place for all
three- and four-year-old children whose parents
want one. Children in Northern Ireland are
entitled to one year’s free pre-school education in
the year immediately before they start compulsory
primary education.
Childcare
Affordable and accessible childcare (for pre-school
children or during out-of-school hours when
children are older) helps support parents who want
to work or train, as well as providing development

and social opportunities for children. Provision is
expanding, with places in day nurseries, with
childminders, and in holiday schemes and
out-of-school clubs. Childcare is often privately run
and paid for by parents, but low and middle income
families can receive help with the costs of childcare
through the tax credit system.
Throughout the United Kingdom the Sure Start
programme (see page 167) brings together a range
of initiatives (including early education and
childcare) to improve the health and well-being
of families and children. In England, for example,
there will be up to 2,500 children’s centres by
March 2008. These will offer childcare and early
education, and a range of family and health
services, in the most disadvantaged communities.
In addition, there will be childcare provision in at
least 1,000 primary schools.
Schools
About 94 per cent of pupils in the United
Kingdom receive free education paid for from
public funds, while 6 per cent attend independent
fee-paying schools (see page 121).
State schools
In England and Wales state schools are classified
into three broad categories. Community schools
are mainly schools that were traditionally owned
and funded by Local Education Authorities
(LEAs). Foundation schools include many of the
former grant-maintained schools. Voluntary
schools are divided into controlled and aided, of
which many are connected to a particular religious
faith. LEAs are responsible for employing staff
and for admission arrangements in community
and voluntary controlled schools. The school
governing body performs this role in foundation
and voluntary aided schools.
All state schools in Scotland are directly managed
by local authorities. However, there are also eight
grant-aided schools, seven of which are special
educational needs schools. In Northern Ireland,
although all state schools are open to all religions,
most Protestant children attend one of the
633 controlled schools, managed by education
and library boards, while most Catholic children
attend one of the 545 voluntary-maintained
schools. There are, in addition, 54 voluntary
grammar schools, which tend to be either
Catholic or non-denominational in character.
Integrated schools aim to educate Catholic and
Protestant children together; these schools may
be either controlled or grant-maintained. The
Government has a statutory duty to encourage
integrated education as a way of breaking down
sectarian barriers. Publicly financed schools can
apply to become integrated, following a majority
vote by parents. In 2004, 6 per cent of children
in Northern Ireland attended an integrated
school.

Primary schools
In England and Wales, all children must attend
school no later than the start of the term after
their fifth birthday. Primary schools consist mainly
of infant schools for children aged 5 to 7, junior
schools for those aged 7 to 11, or combined junior
and infant schools for both age groups. However,
first schools in some parts of England cater for
ages 5 to 9 or 10 as the first stage of a three-tier
system: first, middle and upper. Middle schools
cover various age ranges between 8 and 14 and
usually lead on to comprehensive upper schools.
In Scotland, where children start school at the
same age, public primary schools normally lead to
the transfer to secondary school at the age of 12.
In Northern Ireland, primary schools cater for
children aged 4 to 11. Some children are educated
in the fee-charging preparatory departments of
grammar schools.
Secondary schools
In January 2004, 88 per cent of secondary pupils
in the maintained sector in England and all such
pupils in Wales attended comprehensive schools.
These generally take pupils without reference to
ability or aptitude, providing a wide range of
secondary education for all or most of the children
in a district. All Scottish state pupils also attended
non-selective schools.
Secondary education in Northern Ireland is
currently organised largely on selective lines, with
Some education milestones in England

Pre 1870 Education for the poor is provided in a
variety of settings - for example through
charities, voluntary societies, workhouses, dame
schools, and the Ragged School Union. Much of it
is rudimentary.
1870 School Boards are set up to build and
maintain schools out of local rates where existing
provision is insufficient.
1880 Attendance at school is made compulsory
for children up to the age of ten years.
1902 School Boards are abolished and their
duties handed over to local borough or county
councils, who set up new secondary and technical
schools.
1906 Local authorities are allowed to provide
school meals.
1918 The school leaving age is raised to 14.
1944 Education Act provides universal free
education and brings in the 11-plus examination.

‘11-plus’ transfer tests in English, mathematics and
science. In 2003/04, 41 per cent of secondary
pupils attended grammar schools. In January 2004
the Minister with responsibility for education
announced new arrangements for post-primary
education, including the ending of transfer tests in
autumn 2008.

Travel to school
The way children travel to school has changed
greatly over the years, with fewer walking to
school and more travelling in cars. In 1989-91,
27 per cent of trips to school taken by 5- to 10-
year-olds in Great Britain were by car or van; by
1999-2001 this had risen to 39 per cent. The
average length of the school journey has also
increased over the same period - from 2.0 to 2.6
kilometres for children aged 5 to 10 and from 4.5
to 4.8 kilometres for those aged 11 to 16.
v   /
Special educational needs
A child has special educational needs (SEN) if he
or she has significantly greater difficulty in
learning than other children of the same age, or a
disability which makes it difficult to use normal
educational facilities. Approximately 1.5 million
pupils with SEN were identified in the United
Kingdom in 2003/04. Each one has the right to
receive a broad and balanced education and state
schools must publish information for parents
about their SEN policy.
In England, an SEN code of practice came into
force in 2002. It includes rights and duties
introduced by the Special Educational Needs and
Disability Act 2001 and associated regulations. A
new strategy, Removing Barriers to Achievement,
which aims to improve opportunities for children
with SEN, was published in February 2004. It
envisages that more children with SEN will attend
mainstream schools, but there will also be a clear
and continuing role for special schools for those
with the most severe and complex needs.
An SEN code of practice for Wales came into effect
in April 2002 and in Scotland the provisions of the
Education Additional Support for Learning
(Scotland) Act 2004 are expected to commence in
autumn 2005. In Northern Ireland legislation
similar to the 2001 Act will come into force from
September 2005.
Independent schools
Independent schools are not funded by the state
and obtain most of their finances from fees paid
by parents. An independent school is defined as
any school that provides full-time education for
five or more pupils of compulsory school age or
one or more pupils with a statement of special
needs or who is in public care. Independent
schools are required to register with the
appropriate government department and are
subject to inspection.
The Independent Schools Council (ISC) represents
the seven independent schools’ associations in the
United Kingdom and has overall responsibility for
the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI). In
England the ISI inspects schools in the ISC every
six years, using criteria approved by Ofsted (see
page 140) and the Department for Education and
Skills (DfES). In Wales all schools are inspected by
the Office of HM Chief Inspector in Wales (Estyn,
see page 141). Independent schools have to pass an
inspection to qualify for membership of an
association within ISC. All other independent
schools are inspected by the relevant national
inspectorates.
In England, the Independent/State School
Partnership Scheme, set up in 1997, aims to
encourage the sharing of experience and good
practice between the two school sectors. In
2004/05, 46 partnerships received funding of £1.4
million for one- and two-year projects. In 2005/06,
£2 million will be available for new partnerships.
Raising standards
Achievement and attainment tables
Performance tables were introduced for English
schools in 1993, and renamed School and College
Achievement and Attainment Tables in July 2004,
following a number of changes to their contents.
The primary school tables show how much value
each school has added, based on progress made by
individual pupils between the first two Key Stages
(see page 123), together with test results in
English, mathematics and science, and rates of
pupil absence. Secondary school tables provide
similar information, but also include the
examination achievements of pupils reaching
school leaving age. School and college (post-16)
tables show the achievements of students in a
range of intermediate and advanced qualifications.
In Wales and Northern Ireland results are
published by individual schools. Scotland includes
attainment as one of a range of measures used to
monitor progress towards the five national
priorities in education (see page 124).

UK 2005
Specialist schools
The Government intends that 95 per cent of all
secondary schools in England will become
specialist schools or academies by 2008. Specialist
schools receive extra funding to establish
curriculum centres of excellence that support
improvement throughout the school and specialist
work in partner schools and the wider community.
Although they focus on one or two chosen
specialisms, these schools must still meet the full
national curriculum requirements (see page 125).
Any maintained secondary school in England can
apply to be designated as a specialist school in the
following subject areas: arts, business and
enterprise, engineering, humanities, languages,
mathematics and computing, music, science,
sports or technology. There were 1,955 schools in
the specialist schools programme in March 2004,
of which 1,446 were operational. High performing
schools will be able to take on other roles and
responsibilities, such as becoming training schools
or taking on a second specialism.
Academies
Academies are state-funded independent schools
in England. They may be set up:
■ to replace existing schools that have been
facing challenging circumstances;
■ as part of a wider school reorganisation; or
■ where there is an unmet demand for school
places.
Sponsors from the private and voluntary sectors,
church and other faith groups help to set up and
run these schools. They provide free education to
secondary age pupils of all abilities, including
provision for children with SEN. Academies aim to
offer a broad and balanced curriculum, including
a specialism. The first three opened in 2002, with
another nine in 2003.
Under its Five Year Strategy (see page 123) the
Government intends that 200 academies will be
open or under development by 2010.
Other initiatives
The Excellence in Cities programme, which was
developed for disavantaged areas of England, is
delivered locally by schools working in partnership
with their local authorities. The programme
provides additional resources and guidance for
schools in the most disadvantaged communities.
There were 57 whole authority partnerships
involved in the programme in July 2004, and 51
‘excellence clusters’, which focus on smaller
pockets of disadvantage.
In July 2003 the Leading Edge Partnership
programme was established with 103 partnerships
involving two or more secondary schools in
England. Each partnership receives funding of
£60,000 a year for three years for an agreed
programme of activities designed to raise the
performance of schools that are struggling to
improve standards, and to address under¬
achievement among pupils from poorer socio¬
economic backgrounds and certain minority
ethnic groups. The second round of the
programme commenced in September 2004.
The Scottish Executive published a consultation
paper and draft bill, Ensuring Improvement in Our
Schools, in 2003. This included a proposal that
Scottish Ministers, acting on the advice of Her
Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) (see
page 141), should be able to require an education
authority to secure improvement in its schools.
Similar powers would apply in respect of the eight
grant-aided schools. The consultation ended in
January 2004.
Truancy
Unauthorised absences in English primary and
secondary schools accounted for 0.7 per cent of half¬
days in 2002/03, the equivalent of 7.5 million
sessions missed in a year. During the fourth round of
nationally coordinated truancy sweeps, which took
place in March 2004, police and educational welfare
officers across England found 5,000 young people
who did not have a valid reason to be out of school.
Of these, one-third were accompanied by an adult.
In Wales, unauthorised absences accounted for
0.6 per cent of half-days in primary schools and
1.6 per cent of half-days in secondary schools in
2002/03. In Scotland, on average, 5,600 pupils (0.8
per cent) in local authority schools were absent
without authorisation each school day in 2002/03.
The Attendance Strategy, part of the Improving
Behaviour and Attendance Programme, started in
April 2003 in 60 LEAs in England with particularly
high rates of absence. Eight specialist attendance
consultants worked closely with LEA Education
Welfare Services to promote best practice and

Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners
The Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners was
published by the DfES in July 2004, building on the
Education Act 2002 and backed by an increase in
resources in the July 2004 Spending Review (see page
139). The Strategy covers education and learning for
all age groups, including adults, as well as childcare.
For parents with children under five, key points
include:
■ the establishment of children's centres providing
childcare, education, health, employment and
parenting support;
■ support for parents to stay at home with children
from birth until age two, if they want to; and
■ the development of dawn-to-dusk schools with
breakfast, childcare and after-school clubs, to
help working parents.
For primary school children, the strategy includes:
■ more tailored learning in reading, writing and
mathematics;
■ giving every child the opportunity to learn a
foreign language, play music (see box on page
125) and take part in sport; and
■ a closer relationship between parents and
schools to encourage family learning.
Key points at secondary school level include:
■ guaranteed three-year budgets for every school
from 2006;
■ 95 per cent of secondary schools in England to
become specialist schools by 2008;
■ helping popular schools to expand so that there are
more places available where parents want them;
■ providing 200 academies by 2010;
■ continuing the renewal and refurbishment
programme of all secondary schools over the
next 15 years;
■ making it easier for schools to obtain foundation
status and take control of their own land,
buildings and other assets; and
■ setting up 'foundation partnerships' in which
schools group together to raise standards and to
provide places for those with SEN or those pupils
who are hard to place.
Post-secondary school provisions include:
■ free tuition for people learning basic skills;
■ Adult Learning Grants for adults studying for
Level 2 qualifications (the equivalent of five good
GCSEs); and
■ access to university for anyone with the potential
to benefit, grants for students that need them,
and an end to up-front fees.

Curriculum
All state schools in the United Kingdom must
provide religious education, but parents have the
right to withdraw their children from these classes.
In Northern Ireland the main Christian churches
have approved a core syllabus for religious
education, which must be taught in all grant-aided
schools.
Sex and relationship education, including education
about HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted
diseases, is compulsory in UK secondary schools
and voluntary in primary schools.
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
Children follow the National Curriculum in
England, the National Curriculum for Wales in
Wales and the Northern Ireland Curriculum in
Northern Ireland. The curricula contain
programmes of study for age groups split into Key
Stages (Table 10.4). These stages outline what
pupils are entitled to be taught and set out
expected standards of performance. The
programmes of study represent a statutory
minimum - schools have flexibility to add other
elements, to choose how they teach the content of
the curriculum, and to focus more or less time on
particular aspects. Following the Education Act
2002, the early education curriculum for
three- and four-year-olds in the pre-compulsory

Better education for children in care
Fewer than one in ten children in care in England
in 2001 achieved five GCSEs grades A*-C,
compared with half of all young people; and just
1 per cent went on to university. In Scotland in
2003, four out of ten care leavers achieved some
qualifications compared to 95 per cent for
Scotland as a whole, and 6 per cent of care
leavers went to university. The UK Government
and the devolved administrations aim to narrow
the gap between the educational attainment of
children in care and that of their peers by 2006.
In September 2003, to coincide with the
publication of the Green Paper Every Child
Matters, the Social Exclusion Unit published
A Better Education for Children in Care.
Measures to help children in care fulfil their
potential include more books and computers to
improve learning at home, more encouragement
to stay on at school after age 16, and more
joint training for teachers, social workers and
carers.
phase is now part of the National Curriculum in
England. There are four Key Stages covering the
ages of compulsory schooling. Key Stages 1 and 2
are studied in primary schools, and Stages 3 and 4
in secondary school. The National Curriculum
requires all pupils in Wales to study Welsh up to
the age of 16. A major review of the Northern
Ireland Curriculum has taken place and proposals
for a revised curriculum agreed. Legislation will be
in place by September 2006. There will be greater
flexibility to enable schools to provide a
curriculum appropriate to the needs of individual
pupils and greater emphasis on the development
of skills and attributes.
Scotland
There is no statutory national curriculum in
Scotland. There are five national priorities in
education set out under the following headings:
■ achievement and attainment;
■ framework for learning;
■ inclusion and equality;
■ values and citizenship; and
■ learning for life.

Music manifesto
Prominent figures from the music industry,
education and music organisations came together
in July 2004 to promote music education and
launch the music manifesto which aims to put
music at the heart of every school.
The manifesto commits its signatories to five key
priorities to drive improvement:
■ to give every young person access to a range
of music experiences;
■ to provide opportunities for young people to
develop their musical interests and skills;
■ to identify and nurture young musicians with
talent;
■ to develop teachers of music education; and
■ to improve the support provided for music¬
making.
The content and management of the curriculum
are the responsibility of educational authorities
and individual head teachers. National guidelines
for pupils aged 5 to 14 set out the ground to be
covered and the way pupils’ learning should be
assessed and reported.
There are curriculum guidelines for languages,
mathematics, information and communication
technology (ICT), environmental studies,
expressive arts, religious and moral education,
health education, and personal and social
development. Pupils can study a modern
European language during the last two years of
primary education.
There are 58 units in primary schools where
education takes place through the Gaelic language.
In some other schools Gaelic can be learned as a
second language.
Attainment
In England, the attainment of pupils in test and
teacher assessment for core subjects at ages 7 and
11 has remained broadly unchanged since 2002. At
age 14 results in the core subjects of English,
maths, science and ICT have risen every year since

Stage 1, the greatest difference being for writing. At
Key Stage 3 girls continued to out-perform boys in
all core subjects, although the gap narrowed to
three percentage points in 2003. Table 10.6 shows

unlike tests, these are carried out in all three
subjects at each stage.
In Scotland, the upward trend in literacy and

Climbing the languages ladder
A new voluntary recognition assessment scheme
that will allow people of all ages, from
seven-year-olds to adults, to gain credit for their
language skills, was piloted in 2004 in French,
German and Spanish. The National Recognition
Scheme, also known as the Language Ladder, is
being developed by the University of Cambridge
Local Examinations Syndicate with funding from
the DfES.
People at all stages of education are assessed in
listening, speaking, reading and writing in their
chosen language. The scheme will be rolled out
across England from September 2005 in eight
languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian,
Japanese, Chinese, Urdu and Punjabi.
The Language Ladder is part of the Government's
National Languages Strategy for England that
also aims to ensure that by the end of the decade
every pupil from age 7 to 11 will have the
opportunity to study foreign languages and
develop their interest in the cultures of other
nations. Language Pathfinder projects are being
funded in 19 LEAs until July 2005 to support the
introduction of languages in primary schools.

Qualifications
Examinations in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland are typically taken at the following ages:
■ 16 - General Certificate of Secondary
Education (GCSE, graded A* - the highest
grade - to G);
■ 17 - General Certificate of Education
Advanced Subsidiary (AS level, graded A to E)
which is equivalent to 50 per cent of an A
level; and
■ 18 - General Certificate of Education
Advanced (A level, graded A to E).
In Scotland, the National Qualifications (NQ)
Framework covers Standard Grade (usually taken
at age 16 and graded 1 to 7, with grade 1 the
highest); and Access, Intermediate 1 and 2, Higher
and Advanced Higher qualifications (usually taken
at ages 17 and 18 and graded A to C - except for
Access qualifications, which have no external
assessment component).
Specifications and assessment procedures must
comply with national guidelines and be accredited
by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in
England, by its Welsh counterpart. Qualifications,
Curriculum and Assessment Authority for
Wales/Awdurdod Cymwysterau, Cwricwlwm ac
Asesu Cymru, or the Northern Ireland Council for
Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment. These
independent government agencies are responsible
for ensuring that the curriculum and
qualifications are of high quality, coherent and
flexible. NQs in Scotland are managed by the
Scottish Qualifications Authority.
In 2002/03, 53 per cent of pupils in the United
Kingdom gained five or more GCSE grades A* to
C or equivalent, compared with 45 per cent in
1995/96 (Figure 10.8).

How pupils in the United Kingdom are
assessed
England and Wales
Pupils are assessed formally at the ages of 7, 11
and 14 by their teachers and/or by national tests in
the core subjects of English, mathematics and
science and additionally in Id at age 14. At age
14, pupils are also assessed in other subjects. In
Wales there is no statutory national testing at age
7, and the Welsh Minister for Education has
published proposals for alternatives to formal
testing at 11 and 14.
Northern Ireland
Pupils are formally assessed at the age of 14 in
English, mathematics and science. The
requirements are broadly similar to those in
England and Wales. Assessment takes the form of
teacher assessment and tasks or tests.
Scotland
Progression is measured by attainment of six
levels, based on the expectation of the
performance of the majority of pupils at certain
ages between 5 and 14 (see Table 10.4). Pupils
are assessed by their teachers and by tests in
reading, writing and mathematics which are
selected and administered from a national
catalogue. Tests can take place at any time during
the school year and at any age.
In England, GCSEs in vocational subjects were
introduced in 2002, replacing the General National
Vocational Qualification Part One. Northern
Ireland also introduced vocational GCSEs at this
time. They are available in eight subjects: applied
art and design; applied business; engineering;
health and social care; applied ICT; leisure and
tourism; manufacturing; and applied science. In
Scotland the General Scottish Vocational
Qualification is the equivalent.
In Wales, a six-year pilot of a new Baccalaureate
qualification began in 2003. This has a common
core curriculum of key skills, Wales, Europe and
the world (including a language module),
work-related education and personal and social
education. Twenty-four schools and colleges were
involved by September 2004.

In 2002/03, an estimated 39 per cent of young
people in schools and further education in the
United Kingdom achieved two or more GCE A
levels or equivalent (Figure 10.9). The performance
gap between the sexes widened from two percentage
points in 1992/93 to nine in 2002/03.
Careers
All young people in full-time education in the
United Kingdom are entitled to career
information, advice and guidance.
In England, Connexions is the Government’s
support service for all young people aged 13-19.
It provides integrated information, advice and
guidance, and access to personal development
opportunities. These aim to help to remove
barriers to learning and progression and ensure
that young people make a smooth transition to
adulthood and working life. It offers confidential
support on any issue the young person chooses,
including educational and career options. The
service is delivered through 47 local Connexions
Partnerships and a network of personal advisers
based in a variety of settings, including schools,
colleges and community centres. There is also a
confidential telephone helpline and an interactive
online advice service.

Careers Wales works with schools and colleges to
deliver information, advice and guidance to all age
groups. It also facilitates work experience
placements for students in schools and further
education colleges and provides additional help to
those most at risk of failing to realise their
potential. Careers Scotland offers a careers
advisory service to all ages and, like Careers Wales,
provides support to vulnerable young people.
The Scottish Executive’s strategy for Enterprise in
Education, Determined to Succeed, started in 2003.
It focuses on the following key themes:
■ enterprise and entrepreneurial education;
■ work-based vocational learning with a
relevant qualification for those over 14; and
■ appropriately focused careers education.
Under the strategy, Careers Scotland provides a
range of career education for all pupils in
Scotland’s schools.
In Northern Ireland careers guidance is delivered
by the Department for Employment and
Learning’s Careers Service. The Careers Service is
provided to young people in education and
training and to unemployed young people and
adults, with a priority focus on 14- to 19-year-olds
Reforms for 14- to 19-year-olds
The Working Group for 14-19 Reform
(www. 14-19reforms.gov.uk) published its interim
report in February 2004. The Working Group was
particularly concerned with low post-16
participation and achievement, and with
simplifying the curriculum, the assessment system,
and the framework of vocational qualifications.
The report proposed a diploma framework for
14-19 education in England organised around
four levels - entry, foundation, intermediate and
advanced. The diploma would provide a way into
apprenticeships (see page 134), employment, or
further learning. At each level the diploma would
include a common core content covering
mathematical skills, communication and ICT, and
include an extended project or personal
challenge. Young people would be able to choose
from a range of specialised diplomas, suitable for
specific employment sectors or areas of further
learning, and open diplomas, in which they could
pursue a more mixed pattern of subjects.
The interim report was followed by a period of
consultation, with final recommendations
presented to the Government in autumn 2004.
who are vulnerable to social exclusion. It works
closely with the Department for Education and the
Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment
to develop a coherent strategy for
business-education liaison in Northern Ireland.

Further education
After compulsory education is finished, young
people can choose to stay on at school, attend
college or take part in work-based learning.
Three-quarters of 16- to 18-year-olds in the
United Kingdom continue in further education
and training either in school sixth forms, sixth
form colleges or further education colleges, or
with work-based learning providers. The further
education and training sector delivers a broad
range of learning, including:

The National Council for Education and Training
for Wales (ELWa, see page 135) has developed a
bilingual learning strategy. One of the aims is to
encourage increased bilingual and Welsh medium
provision in further education institutions to
complement that in schools. Students can
continue their studies through the medium of
Welsh or bilingually in a number of sixth forms
and further education institutions. ELWa is also
developing a strategy for developing Welsh
medium vocational training, while Welsh for
Adults is a popular programme that allows adult
learners to acquire or improve their Welsh
language skills.

Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs)
CoVEs aim to meet the skill requirements of
employers by providing vocational skills training
across a wide range of occupations, such as
catering, computing and construction. The
Learning and Skills Council (ESC, see page 135)
aims to develop a network of at least 400 CoVEs
across England by the end of March 2006. CoVEs
are mainly based in further education colleges, but
the programme has been extended to develop
centres with work-based learning providers. By
August 2004 there were over 260 CoVEs, 225 of
which were based within colleges.
Networks of Excellence
A Networks of Excellence pilot programme
operates in Wales. It aims to establish networks in
six key economic sectors. Their purpose is to
create and support links between colleges and
industry by involving employers in the design and
delivery of courses, and to ensure that the needs of
business sectors are met.
Student support
Young people aged 16-19 in further education in
England are entitled to free learning and do not
have to pay tuition or other fees. Further
Education Learner Support Funds (£69 million in
2004/05) are available to help students aged 16 to
19 in particular financial difficulty. This funding is
available for course-related costs, including
transport, childcare, residential and other day-to-
day costs, where the Education Maintenance
Allowance (see page 130) is insufficient.
Care to Learn, a new universal childcare scheme,
supports young parents under the age of 19 in
England who want to continue in or enter into
education or training by paying their childcare
and associated travel costs. Since the scheme was
introduced in August 2003, it has supported
almost 2,400 young parents who can claim the cost
of childcare up to £5,125 per child per annum.
Adults on government-funded courses are
expected to make a financial contribution towards
the cost of their tuition fees unless they are on a
low income or studying basic skills. Learner
Support Funds for those aged 19 and over in
2004/05 include Hardship Funds, which can help
towards the cost of books, equipment, transport
and tuition fees (£54 million), Childcare Support
Funds (£40 million) and Residential Bursaries
(£3 million).

UK 2005
Educational Maintenance Allowances
Educational Maintenance Allowances (EMAs)
were introduced across England in September
2004, for young people who continue in further
education at school or college. EMA aims to
reduce the drop-out rate from education at age
16. All young people aged 16 from households
with incomes of £30,000 or less are eligible for
means-tested EMA payments of between £10
and £30 a week in return for strong attendance
and commitment at school or college. Young
people aged 17 and over who live in the 56 EMA
pilot areas can also apply. Payments are made
direct to students. Young people can also receive
up to three annual bonuses of £100 if they
remain on their course and make good progress.
The DfES estimates that the EMA should be
helping an additional 72,000 young people to
stay on in further education by 2006-07. Similar
schemes have also been introduced in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Government is piloting the Adult Learning
Grant in England for people aged 19 and over
studying for their first qualification equivalent to
NVQ level 2 or level 3. The maximum payment is
£30 per week for all adults studying at level 2, but
only for those aged 19 to 30 studying for a level 3
qualification.
ELWa and the Scottish Further Education Funding
Council provide similar help for eligible students
in further education. In 2002/03 the Welsh
Assembly Government introduced Assembly
Learning Grants: eligibility depends upon age,
income and course of study. By the end of
February 2004, over 22,000 students in Wales had
applied for the grants, 90 per cent of whom were
successful.
In Northern Ireland funding and support is
provided through the Further Education Funding
Formula. Funding is also provided to colleges and
students through a number of special budgets,
which are designed to widen access, increase
participation, address skills shortages and enhance
the role of the sector in supporting economic
development.
The Connexions Card
All 16- to 19-year-olds in England qualify for a
free Connexions Card, a smartcard which enables
young people to collect reward points for learning
at school, college, work-based training or
voluntary activities. Points can be exchanged for
various free or discounted goods and services
from businesses taking part in the scheme.
Higher education
Around 40 per cent of young people in Great
Britain take degree and other advanced courses in
universities and other colleges, compared with
around 20 per cent at the beginning of the 1990s.
Universities and higher education colleges
There are 89 university institutions in the United
Kingdom, including the Open University. This
figure does not include the constituent colleges of
the universities of London and Wales, both of
which have a federal structure. UK universities
enjoy academic freedom, appoint their own staff,
admit students and award their own degrees. The
universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from
the 13th century and the Scottish universities of
St Andrews, Glasgow and Aberdeen from the
15th century. The University of Edinburgh was
established in the 16th century.
In addition, there are 60 higher education colleges.
Some are very specialised, such as art and design,
teacher education and agriculture colleges, while
others are multi-disciplinary. Some award their
own degrees and qualifications, while in others
these are validated by a university or national
body. Applications for full-time first degrees and
Higher National Diploma courses are usually
made through the Universities and Colleges
Admission Service (UCAS). Over 374,000
applicants were accepted into higher education
through UCAS in 2003. Around 29,000 students
were accepted as deferred entrants for places after
the following academic year - accounting for
nearly 8 per cent of accepted applications.
Students at university in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland usually spend three years of
study, leading to a bachelor’s degree, such as a
Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science. There are
some four-year courses, especially for those
130
UK 2005
10 Education and training
studying languages, while medical and veterinary
courses normally require five or six years. A
full-time first degree in Scotland (where students
usually start a year earlier) generally takes four
years for Honours and three years for the
broad-based Ordinary degree.
In 2003 some 273,000 students gained a first
degree in the United Kingdom compared with
around 159,000 students in 1992 and 102,000 in
1982. Fifty-six per cent of first degree graduates
were women, and 11 per cent gained their award
through part-time study.
Postgraduate studies in the United Kingdom
usually lead to a taught or research masters degree,
such as a Master of Arts or Master of Science, or
to a research doctorate (PhD). A masters degree
usually lasts one year full-time or two years part-
time. A PhD usually lasts three years full-time or
six years part-time. Applications for postgraduate
study are processed separately by each institution
and are made directly to the university.
A ‘New Route PhD’ was introduced in 2001 as a
response to the changes in knowledge and skills
demanded of PhD graduates in a rapidly
expanding worldwide market. It lasts four years
and combines the traditional PhD research project
with a programme of broader coursework and
professional skills development.
The Open University
Founded in 1969 and copied the world over, the
Open University (OU) is a non-residential
university offering over 420 undergraduate,
postgraduate and other courses for students
wishing to study in their own time. The OU has an
‘open entry’ policy: students do not need any
formal academic qualifications to register for most
courses. There are short residential schools for
some courses and teaching is through a variety of
media, including specially-produced textbooks,
interactive CD-ROMs and audio-visual material.
Many OU learning resources are delivered online;
some 160,000 of the 200,000 students study in this
way. Students can use computer conferencing, the
local tutorial centre network, phone or email to
contact their tutors and fellow students.
Other distance learning
With the growth of the Internet, more UK
universities and colleges now offer study through
distance learning. Courses are available at many
levels, including degree and postgraduate
qualifications. The DflES offers advice on which
institutions are recognised as having degree
awarding powers and recommends that a check is
made before applying for an online course.
Widening access
The Government’s aim is, by 2010, to increase
participation in higher education towards 50 per
cent of those aged 18 to 30, and also to make
significant progress year-on-year towards fair
access and reduce non-completion rates. In
Scotland the Age Participation Index, which
is used to measure participation of those aged
under 21, shows that just over 50 per cent of
young Scots go into higher education.
Programmes being introduced to widen
participation include ‘AimHigher’ (in England,
Scotland and Northern Ireland) and ‘Reaching
Wider’ partnerships in Wales.
Finance
In 2002/03 central government spent £6.3 billion
on higher education in the United Kingdom.
Government finance is distributed to higher
education institutions by Higher Education
Funding Councils in England, Wales and Scotland,
and by the Department for Employment and
Learning in Northern Ireland. The private
University of Buckingham is the only independent
university in the United Kingdom and does not
receive public funds.
In addition to charging tuition fees, institutions
provide paid training, research or consultancy for
commercial firms, and many establishments have
endowments or receive grants from foundations
and benefactors.
Student finance in England and Wales
Eligible full-time students in England and Wales
receive help towards their tuition fees and loans
and grants towards living costs.
Most students do not pay the full fee. How much
help a student gets depends on their own and their
family’s income. Students from low-income
backgrounds do not pay anything. In 2004/05 the
maximum contribution was £1,150 per year.
Low interest student loans provide help with
living costs. The maximum loan available in
131
10 Education and training
UK 2005
2004/05 for eligible full-time students living away
from home is £4,095 (£5,050 for those in
London). All eligible students are entitled to 75 per
cent of this amount, with the remaining 25 per
cent being income based. Loans are only repaid
once the student has left their course, and when
they are earning over £10,000 a year (increasing to
£15,000 in April 2005). In 2004/05 non-repayable
Higher Education Grants of up to £1,000 became
available to students from low-income backgrounds.
Additional non-repayable help is targeted at certain
students, particularly those with disabilities, and
those with children or adult dependants. The
Access to Learning Fund, available through
universities and colleges, helps students on low
incomes who may need extra financial support for
their course and to stay in higher education.
Help is also available for eligible part-time
students. Those on low incomes can obtain a grant
towards tuition fees of up to £575 a year and a
grant of £250 per year to help with course costs.
Scotland
Student loans and supplementary grants are also
the main source of help with living costs in
Scotland. Young students from low-income
families are entitled to have up to £2,150 of their
annual loan entitlement replaced by a non¬
repayable bursary. Since 2000/01 tuition fees have
not been payable by eligible full-time
Scottish-domiciled students or European Union
(EU) students studying in Scotland. Some
graduates who have started courses since 2001/02
are required to make a one-off Graduate
Endowment payment when they complete their
course and start earning over £10,000 a year
(mature students, lone parents and disabled
students are exempt). Graduates liable for this
payment can add the amount to their student loan
account. The payment for students starting their
courses in 2003/04 is £2,092.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland support for higher education
students generally operates on a similar basis to
England and Wales. However, in September 2003
means-tested bursaries of up to £2,000 became
available to low-income families.
Postgraduate support
Most postgraduates have to pay a significant
contribution towards tuition fees. In 2004/05 the
assumed fee for a one-year masters programme in
England is in the region of £3,000, although this
varies with the programme of study and the
institution. Some postgraduates receive an award
from a public body, some support themselves
through a mixture of public and private finance,
and others receive funding through scholarships
and bursaries. Most public funding is provided by
Research Councils (see chapter 25) that operate
throughout the United Kingdom, the Students
Awards Agency for Scotland and the Department
for Employment and Learning in Northern
Ireland. Employers may offer support by paying
for all or part of the tuition fees and/or other costs
such as examination fees and books, and by
allowing paid leave for study.
Adult education
Adult education courses are designed to meet a
range of social and community needs. Subjects
that can be studied include languages,
administration, ICT, sport and fitness, and craft
skills. Education for adults provided by LEAs is
carried out in a wide range of locations, including
LEAs’ own premises, local community centres,
libraries, museums, schools and adult and further
education colleges.
Overall, about half of LEAs provide adult and
community learning through direct delivery; the
other half are through contracts with other
providers, predominately voluntary sector
organisations, community learning centres and
colleges. The duty to secure such education rests
with the ESC in England (see page 135).
Adult education in Scotland is a statutory duty of
education authorities and is generally known as
community learning and development. In
Northern Ireland it is provided by the further
education sector, supplemented by the work of a
range of non-statutory providers.
The Workers’ Educational Association (WEA) is
the largest UK voluntary provider of adult
education. Founded in 1903, it runs over 10,000
courses each year through local and regional
centres, providing learning for more than 110,000
adults. The WEA is a national charity and is
supported by the Government through funding
from the LSC in England, ELWa in Wales, and by
the Scottish Executive and local authorities in
Scotland.

Higher education reforms
The Higher Education Act 2004 aims to widen
access to universities and help them remain
competitive in the world economy. It takes forward
the proposals set out in the White Paper, The Future
of Higher Education. The new legislation covers
higher education in England and Wales but some
provisions will also affect higher education in other
parts of the United Kingdom.
Measures in the Act and associated secondary
legislation include:
■ introducing variable tuition fees: from 2006 until
at least 2010, provided that they have agreed
access plans in place, institutions in England will
be able to charge any amount between zero and
£3,000, payment of which can be deferred until
the graduate's income reaches £15,000 a year.
The National Assembly for Wales has decided
that variable fees will not be introduced in Wales
before 2007, if at all;
■ creating an Office for Fair Access in England,
charged with agreeing the access plans of any
institution wishing to increase fees above the
standard fee of around £1,200;
re-introducing maintenance grants of up to
£2,700 a year to help students from lower
income households. Institutions charging the
maximum £3,000 fee will be required to provide
at least an additional £300 a year for students
who qualify for the full £2,700 grant-
creating a new UK-wide Arts and Humanities
Research Council that will take over the funding
of arts and humanities research;
designating an independent body to review
student complaints that are not related to
matters of academic judgement;
measures to prevent student debt being written
off on discharge of bankruptcy;
powers to help reduce bureaucracy by allowing
data sharing with higher education institutions
and other public bodies; and
measures enabling the transfer of the majority of
student support functions to Wales.
Literacy and numeracy
Skills for Life, the national strategy for improving
adult literacy and numeracy in England, covers the
literacy, language (English for speakers of other
languages) and numeracy needs of all post-16
learners, including those with learning difficulties
or disabilities, from pre-entry level up to and
including level 2 (equivalent to GCSE grades A*-C
- see page 124). All basic skills provision is free to
the learner no matter where or how it is delivered.
The first definitive national profile of adult literacy
and numeracy skills in England was published by
the DfES in October 2003. It revealed that 5 million
adults aged 16 to 65 had literacy skills that mean
they would be unable to pass a GCSE in English;
15 million people had numeracy skills below this
level.
The National Basic Skills Strategy for Wales began
in 2001 and seeks to tackle basic skills deficiencies
in all age groups. It is being implemented by the
Basic Skills Agency.
The Scottish Adult Literacy and Numeracy strategy
was also launched in 2001 with the publication of
the Adult Literacy and Numeracy in Scotland
report, which made 21 recommendations for
developing a world-class service. Since then a
national research and development unit, Learning
Connections, has been established within
Communities Scotland to support the strategy.
In Northern Ireland the Essential Skills for Living
strategy started in October 2002. A common
curriculum has since been established and a series
of essential skills qualifications developed, ranging
from entry level to level 2. Over 240 tutors have
enrolled on level 4 qualifications, increasing tutor
capacity within the sector. Existing tutors have also
benefited from enhanced in-service training.
Work-related training
The Government has several initiatives to help
people train for work and achieve occupationally
specific qualifications such as National Vocational
133
10 Education and training
UK 2005
Qualifications (NVQs, see below). These include
the New Deal (see page 151), Apprenticeships (see
below) and work-based learning for adults - open
to those aged 25 and over who have been
unemployed for six months or longer.
Vocational qualifications
NVQs and the equivalent Scottish Vocational
Qualifications (SVQs) are occupationally specific
qualifications, based on competencies, which are
assessed in the workplace. They cover sectors such
as engineering, construction and health and social
care. They also cover all-sector areas such as
administration, management and customer
services.
The qualifications are derived from national
standards developed by employer-led bodies and
approved across the United Kingdom by the
Qualifications and Curriculum Authority or the
Scottish Qualifications Authority. NVQs or SVQs
are awarded at five levels.
There are also a range of awarding body ‘own
brand’ vocational qualifications accredited into the
National Qualifications Framework (NQF) which
include Business and Technology Council (BTEC)
and City and Guilds Craft awards. NQs in
Scotland also include a range of vocational
subjects.
Vocational GCSEs and Vocational A levels are
an alternative to GCSEs and GCE A levels in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland (see page
126) and are offered at levels 2 and 3 respectively
of the NQF. A revised NQF was introduced in
September 2004.
The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework
brings all mainstream academic and vocational
Scottish qualifications into a single unified
framework, enabling learners, employers and the
public in general to understand better how different
Scottish qualifications relate to each other.
Apprenticeships
Apprenticeships provide structured learning
programmes for young people that combine
work-based training with off-the-job learning.
Apprenticeships offer training to NVQ level 2 and
Advanced Apprenticeships to level 3. More than
80 sectors of business and industry offer
Apprenticeships, ranging from accountancy to
Vocational and academic
comparability
Vocational and academic qualifications are
broadly comparable at the following levels:
■ an NVQ or SVQ level 5 is comparable to a
higher degree;
■ an NVQ or SVQ level 4 is comparable to a first
degree, BTEC Higher National qualifications,
an RSA Higher Diploma, a nursing
qualification or other higher education;
■ an NVQ or SVQ level 3 is comparable to two
GCE A levels, and to vocationally related
qualifications awarded by NQF accredited
bodies. Examples are an RSA Advanced
Diploma, City and Guilds Level 3 Progression
Awards and BTEC National Diplomas; and
■ an NVQ or SVQ level 2 is comparable to five
GCSEs at grades A* to C, an RSA diploma, a
City and Guilds Level 2 or a BTEC First
Diploma.
sport. Each has its own guidance on entry
requirements. The Government’s aim is that more
than a quarter of all young people in England will
start an Apprenticeship before they are 22 years
old. Apprenticeships are also being opened up to
adults so that learners over 25 can capitalise on
their prior learning and experience by achieving
an Apprenticeship qualification. In Scotland,
Modern Apprenticeships are available at level 3
and are broadly equivalent to Advanced
Apprenticeships in England. They combine
work-based training with study for an SVQ at
level 3 or above. They are available in around
80 occupational sectors and are designed by the
Sector Skills Council to ensure that they meet
employers’ needs. People of all ages can benefit
from the programme.
Young Apprenticeships were introduced for 14- to
16-year-olds in England in September 2004,
involving about 1,000 students. They provide
a route for well motivated pupils at Key Stage 4 to
undertake industry specific vocational
qualifications with employers and training
providers. All young people entering the initial
programme must meet minimum achievement
criteria at Key Stages 2 and 3.

England
Entry to Employment (E2E) is an entry to level 1
work-based learning programme for young people
aged 16-18 who are not yet ready to enter an
Apprenticeship, employment or structured
learning at level 2. Each E2E programme is flexible
but all students undertake learning in three core
areas: basic and key skills; vocational development;
and personal and social development.
Programme Led Pathways (PLPs), a route into
Apprenticeships and Advanced Apprenticeships,
were introduced in England in August 2004. PLPs
are for young people aged 16 and over not in
employment or waiting to start employment. The
young person has access to the technical certificate
and key skills part of the Apprenticeship and is
expected to transfer to an employer to complete
the remaining part of the qualification in the
workplace.
Foundation Degrees, a vocational higher education
qualification, were introduced in England in 2001.
They are also available in Wales and Northern
Ireland. They address a skills gap, identified by
employers, at associate professional and higher
technician level. Over 24,000 students were
studying for Foundation Degrees in 2003/04 - an
increase of 100 per cent over the previous year.
Wales
The Welsh Assembly Government, in collaboration
with ELWa (see opposite), has integrated
work-based learning programmes for adults and
young people into a single All Age programme.
The All Age programme is targeted at those people
who have difficulties finding employment and
aims to develop social skills, literacy, numeracy,
ICT and other skills. The Modern and Foundation
Modern Apprenticeship routes are now open to all
and the Modern Skills Diploma for Adults, which
was introduced in 2001, provides high-level (level
3 and above) skills training. All the programmes
are open to those in employment.
Other initiatives in Wales include the development
of the Credit and Qualifications Framework, the
introduction of Individual Learning Accounts
(ILA Wales), and the Learning Worker Project
pilot for those in employment without a level 3
qualification.
Scotland
In Scotland all young people aged between
16 and 18 are entitled to training under the
government-funded Skillseekers scheme. The
emphasis is on training leading to a recognised
qualification, up to SVQ level 3, and provided
through an individual training plan with employer
involvement.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the Jobskills Programme is
available to all 16- to 17-year-olds. It provides
training to NVQ level 2 with progression routes
to NVQ level 3 through Modern Apprenticeship
arrangements. Jobskills also provides Access
training with pre-vocational and vocational strands
for those young people entering training with
physical or learning disabilities or with motivational
problems and who are not immediately capable of
undertaking a level 2 programme.
Learning providers
England
In England, the ESC is the planning and funding
body for all post-16 education and training other
than higher education. With a budget of around
£8.7 billion for 2004/05 its objectives include
maximising the achievement and participation of
young people in education and training, increasing
demand for learning by adults, improving the level
of basic skills in the workplace, increasing employer
engagement and improving the quality of
provision.
Wales
ELWa has a similar remit to the ESC. It is
responsible for post-16 education and training,
with the exception of higher education. From
April 2006, ELWa is being merged into the Welsh
Assembly Government.
There are 21 local voluntary partnerships
(Community Consortia for Education and
Training) linking LEAs, schools, colleges, voluntary
organisations, private training providers,
employers and trade unions. Higher education
remains the responsibility of the Higher Education
Funding Council for Wales.

The Sector Skills Development Agency funds and
supports a new UK-wide network of Sector Skills
Councils (SSC). These have replaced National
Training Organisations. SSCs are independent
organisations developed by groups of employers in
industry and business sectors. They bring together
employers, trade unions and professional bodies,
working with the Government to develop the skills
needed by UK businesses.
New Technology Institutes
New Technology Institutes (NTIs) are formed
through partnerships between higher education
institutions, further education colleges, and private
sector partners; 18 have been set up in England.
NTIs advise and support small and medium sized
enterprises (SMEs) on the effective adoption of
new technology and business practices. They
collaborate with local employers and regional and
national organisations, such as the Small Business
Service (see page 355) and Regional Development
Agencies (see page 357), to identify skills gaps and
to tailor NTI activity to local needs.
Learndirect
Learndirect is a network of online learning and
information services provided by Ufi Ltd.
Learndirect’s services are being developed to meet
the skills needs of businesses, and to widen the
participation in learning of adults who are poorly
qualified or who may have had negative
experiences of learning in more formal
environments. In October 2003 there were more
than 2,000 learndirect centres across England,
Wales and Northern Ireland, including more than
50 learndirect premier business centres providing
services for SMEs. There is also a network of 460
learndirect Scotland learning centres. Following a
review of learndirect in Wales, a distinct Ufi Cymru
organisation was set up in 2004.
Financial support
Career development loans are designed to help
people pay for vocational education or learning in
Great Britain. Loans of between £300 and £8,000
are provided through three major banks. Interest
payments during training and for one month after
are funded by the Government. The loans help to
pay for courses lasting up to two years and, if
relevant, for up to one year’s practical work
experience where it forms part of the course.
Around 17,300 loans were taken out in 2003/04,
totalling nearly £74 million. Over 200,000 loans have
been taken out since the scheme began in 1988.
Teaching and other staff
Since 1997/98 the decline in the overall number of
teachers in the United Kingdom has reversed
(Figure 10.11). However, the number of male
teachers has continued to fall. In 2001/02 women
made up 68 per cent of full-time teachers in UK
schools.
England and Wales
New teachers in state primary and secondary
schools must be graduates and hold Qualified
Teacher Status (QTS). In independent schools it is
strongly recommended that new teachers obtain
QTS. It can be achieved in a number of ways,
including a one-year Post Graduate Certificate in
Education (PGCE) course or a three- or four-year
Bachelor of Education degree (BEd).
Graduate and Registered Teacher Programmes
offer the opportunity for trainees to earn a salary
while following a teacher training programme in
a school. These schemes are particularly suitable
for mature career changers, school support staff,
people who have had previous teaching experience
and overseas-trained teachers who do not hold
QTS (who can make use of the Overseas Trained
Teacher Programme - available in England only).
All teachers working in state schools must be
registered with the General Teaching Council for
England or for Wales. These are teachers’
professional bodies which, among other things,
have the power to strike a teacher from the register
on grounds of professional misconduct or
incompetence. As a result of a National Agreement
on Raising Standards and Tackling Workloads
signed in 2003, teachers in England and Wales are

Department of Education
no longer required to undertake administrative and
clerical tasks on a routine basis and the number of
hours that a teacher can be required to cover for
absent colleagues is limited to 38 hours a year.
From September 2005 all teachers will be given
guaranteed time within the school day - equal to at
least 10 per cent of their timetabled teaching time -
for planning, preparation and assessment.
Scotland
All teachers in education authority schools must
be registered with the General Teaching Council
for Scotland. The Council gives advice to the
Scottish Executive on teacher supply and the
professional suitability of teacher training courses.
It is also responsible for disciplinary procedures
under which a teacher guilty of professional
misconduct may be removed temporarily or
permanently from the register.
Teacher qualification procedures are similar to
those in England and Wales, including the BEd
degree and the PGCE. There is also a combined
degree, sometimes known as a concurrent degree.
All pre-service courses are validated by a higher
education institution accredited by the Council
and approved by the Scottish Executive. The
Education Inspectorate has powers to inspect
teacher education and training.
Northern Ireland
All entrants to teaching in grant-aided schools are
graduates and hold an approved teaching
qualification. Initial teacher training is integrated
with induction and early in-service training, the
latter covering a period of three years. The General
Teaching Council in Northern Ireland has similar
duties to those in England and Wales. As with the
rest of the United Kingdom, the main teacher
training courses are the BEd degree and the PGCE.
The education and library boards have a statutory
duty to provide curricular support services and
in-service training.
Teaching assistants
The term teaching assistant refers to a person
whose primary role is either to assist the teacher in
the classroom, or to provide support for individual
pupils. There are no obligatory qualifications for
this role, although some local authorities have
their own requirements. However, National
Occupational Standards for teaching assistants and
NVQs (levels 2 and 3) based on these standards
are available. The role of teaching assistants is
expanding with new higher level teaching
assistants.
Teachers' TV
In 2003 the DfES proposed a new, editorially
independent, digital television channel dedicated
to teachers and all those who work in schools.
The channel launch is planned for early 2005 and
will deliver three types of programming:
■ classroom resources (ideas, lesson plans,
reviews and teaching tips);
■ training and development materials (for
improving the skills of the schools workforce);
and
■ management information, news and
developments that affect the education sector
as whole.
Teachers' TV will broadcast for 18 hours a day via
digital terrestrial, cable and satellite channels.
Headteachers
In England the National College for School
Leadership provides a range of programmes for
the development of school leaders at all levels. The
three national headship training programmes are:
the National Professional Qualification for
137
10 Education and training
UK 2005
Headship (NPQH) for aspiring headteachers; the
Headship Induction Programme - formerly the
Leadership and Management Programme for New
Headteachers; and the Leadership Programme for
Serving Headteachers. Since April 2004 it has
been mandatory for all first-time heads in local
education authority maintained schools or
non-maintained special schools to hold the
NPQH or to be working towards it.
Wales and Northern Ireland have their own
versions of the NPQH, adapted to suit their
respective school systems. In Wales the NPQH
will become mandatory in 2005; the Welsh
Professional Headship Induction Programme
(PHIP) and the Leadership Programme for
Serving Heads mirror their counterparts in
England. In Scotland the Scottish Standard for
Headship, gained through the Scottish
Qualification for Headship, will become
mandatory from August 2005.
Allied professions
Some of the other professions involved in
education and training are described below.
Childcare
There are a range of relevant qualifications for
those working in childcare. For example, in
nursery work, trainees under supervision work
towards a level 2 qualification on the NQF (see
page 134) in Early Years Education, Childcare
and Playwork. On-the-job progression can then
be made to a managerial or supervisory position
by working towards a level 3 qualification.
Careers advisers
In England and Wales fully qualified advisers are
required to hold a relevant qualification at NVQ or
SVQ level 4 or equivalent. In England career
guidance is delivered by Connexions (see page 127)
personal advisers, who must also have successfully
completed Connexions specific training.
Further and higher education
There were around 57,000 full-time further
education and 78,000 full-time higher education
academic staff in the United Kingdom in 2002/03.
All those entering further education teaching in
England must have, or gain within given timescales,
an appropriate teaching qualification. A framework
of professional standards for teaching is being
developed by the Higher Education Academy for
2005/06. In Wales the Further Education Teachers’
Qualifications Regulations 2002 require new further
education teachers to hold or work towards a stage 3
further education teaching qualification. The Welsh
Assembly Government will be making regulations
under the provisions of the Education Act 2002 to
ensure that new principals of further education
institutions in Wales gain or hold a principalship
qualification.
In Scotland lecturers on full-time permanent
contracts are encouraged to obtain a qualification,
and the Scottish Further Education Funding
Council provides funding to cover the cost of
training.
In Northern Ireland a Postgraduate Certificate in
Further and Higher Education is required if an
approved teaching qualification is not already held.
Administration and
management
State schools in England and Wales are maintained
by LEAs (see page 119). With a few exceptions, this
is also the position in Scotland. In Northern
Ireland all schools are funded by the five education
and library boards. Further education colleges in
the United Kingdom are legally independent
institutions with independent governing bodies that
include nominations from the local community and
businesses. Universities and higher education
colleges are legally independent corporate
institutions with individual governing bodies.
A number of government departments are
responsible for education policy:
■ the DfES in England;
■ the Welsh Assembly Government Department
for Training and Education;
■ the Scottish Executive Education Department
(primary and secondary education) and the
Scottish Executive Enterprise, Transport and
Lifelong Learning Department; and
■ the Department of Education and the
Department for Employment and Learning in
Northern Ireland.
LEAs are responsible for pre-16 provision in Great
Britain and they fund schools largely on the basis

2004 Spending Review
In the 2004 Spending Review announced in July,
spending on education and skills in the United
Kingdom is to rise from £63.2 billion in 2004/05
to £76.8 billion in 2007/08. UK spending on
education, which was 4.7 per cent of GDP in
1997, will increase to 5.6 per cent of GDP by
2007/08.
Investment priorities for England include:
■ capital support of over £5 billion a year for
investment in school buildings;
■ funds for Sure Start (see page 167) to rise by
£769 million between 2004/05 to 2007/08;
■ the number of children's centres to increase to
up to 2,500 by 2008;
■ 100,000 new childcare places by 2008;
■ a pilot extending free part-time early
education places to 12,000 two-year-olds in
disadvantaged areas;
■ a New Deal for Skills to help those with no or
low qualifications into work and then to
improve their prospects by acquiring skills;
and
■ maintaining the levels of student spending per
head in real terms in higher education over
the Spending Review period.
Under the Review, the DfES is committed to
2.5 per cent efficiency savings.
of pupil numbers. The DfES funds post-16
education institutions directly. Specific central
government grants are made to LEAs in Great
Britain to improve school performance in literacy,
numeracy and ICT. The Government also allocates
some resources directly to schools in England for
them to use as they wish. The costs of the
education and library boards are met directly by
the Northern Ireland Executive.
School management
England and Wales
All state schools work in partnership with LEAs.
They receive their recurrent funding, through the
LEAs’ school funding formulae, as budget shares.
A school is free to spend its budget share as it sees
fit provided it does so ‘for the purposes of the
school’. Schools are run by headteachers and
governing bodies, comprising parents,
headteacher, school staff, LEA and local
community representation.
The Education Act 2002 established a ‘Power to
Innovate’ which enabled the Government to
exempt the governing bodies of schools and LEAs
in England and Wales from educational legislation
for a limited period. The power lifts regulatory
requirements so an applicant can carry out a
specific innovative project, initially for a period of
up to three years, that has the potential to raise
standards of education.
From September 2005, LEAs will be responsible
for coordinating admissions to all schools in their
area through a locally agreed scheme which
ensures that parents receive a single offer of a
school place and that all receive that offer on the
same day. LEAs for community and voluntary
controlled schools and governing bodies for
foundation and voluntary aided schools (the
admission authorities) are responsible for
determining and applying admission
arrangements for individual schools. Before doing
so, they must take part in discussions with local
schools, churches and others, to coordinate
admission arrangements, taking account of
statutory codes of practice. Any disagreements on
school organisation or admissions in England are
referred to an independent adjudicator; those
regarding religious or denominational admission
criteria are referred to the Secretary of State for
Education and Skills. In Wales the National
Assembly determines school organisation
proposals and deals with objections to admissions
arrangements.
Admission authorities are not allowed to
introduce selection by ability, unless it is for sixth
form admission or is designed to ensure that
pupils of all abilities are admitted and that no one
level of ability is over- or under-represented.
Where existing partial selection by ability is
challenged, the adjudicator (in Wales the National
Assembly Government) decides whether it should
continue.
In England there are 164 designated grammar
schools which select all pupils on ability. Local
parents are allowed to petition for a ballot and
139
10 Education and training
UK 2005
(if sufficient numbers locally wish it) to vote on
whether to keep these selective admission
arrangements.
Scotland
Nearly all Scottish schools are education authority
schools financed by the authorities and central
government. The headteacher is responsible for
decision-making on at least 80 per cent of
school-level expenditure.
In May 2002, 84 per cent of eligible education
authority schools had a school board consisting
of elected parents and teachers and members
co-opted from the local community. In addition
to promoting contact between parents, school
and community, they are involved in procedures
to appoint senior staff and to determine the
community use of school premises. They may also
take on further executive functions by delegation
from their education authority.
The eight grant-aided schools are all run by boards
of managers that receive government grants.
Northern Ireland
Boards of governors are responsible for the
management of individual schools and include
elected parents and teachers among their
members. Virtually all schools have delegated
budgets under which school governors determine
spending priorities.
Rights of parents
England and Wales
Parents have a statutory right to information
about schools and to express a preference for a
school for their child. There is an appeal system if
their choice is not met. Parents must be given
a copy of the annual report from the school
governors, which includes summaries of the
school’s results in National Curriculum assessment
tests, public examinations, vocational
qualifications (if applicable) and rates of pupil
absence. This will be replaced by a school profile
in September 2005.
Parents must be given a written annual report on
their child’s achievements in all subjects, including
results of tests and examinations. Arrangements
must also be made for the discussion of reports
with teachers.
Parents are also entitled to see or be provided with
a copy of their child’s pupil record within 15
school days of making a written request. Unless
there is a court order preventing it, all parents
have a right to participate in decisions about their
child’s education.
Home/school agreements set out the
responsibilities of schools, pupils and parents and
are a statutory requirement for all maintained
schools.
Scotland
Parents have a statutory right to request their
choice of school and the education authority must
meet this request except in certain circumstances
set out in law. There is an appeal system if their
choice is not met. Information is published on
budgeted school running costs, examination
results, pupil attendance and absence, 5-14
attainment targets and results, and the
destinations of school leavers. Schools are required
to provide parents with information about their
children’s attainment in each subject, pupil
attainment targets, teachers’ comments on their
progress, and to provide access to their child’s
educational records.
Northern Ireland
The system of reporting to parents is broadly
similar to that in England and Wales, except
that no annual performance tables on a
school-by-school basis are published.
Educational standards
England and Wales
The Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted)
in England and the Office of Her Majesty’s
Chief Inspector in Wales (Estyn) aim to
improve the quality and standards of education
through independent inspection, regulation and
advice.
Schools are inspected at least once in six years, and
more often where weaknesses have been identified
in an earlier inspection. All schools must produce
an action plan to address the key issues raised in
the inspection report. A school failing to provide
an acceptable standard of education is deemed
to need special measures and is subject to regular
monitoring visits by inspectors.
LEAs are expected to monitor, challenge and
support schools causing concern and must produce
140
UK 2005
10 Education and training
a statement of action when schools are placed in
special measures. They may use their intervention
powers to add additional governors, take back a
school’s delegated budget or replace the governing
body with an interim executive board.
Ofsted inspects all 16-19 education and training
in sixth form and further education colleges (that
are conducted with the Adult Learning
Inspectorate), teacher education and LEAs. Ofsted
is also responsible for the regulation of all early
years childcare providers.
The Adult Learning Inspectorate performs the
same function as Ofsted for post-19 provision in
colleges and for work-based learning, adult and
community learning and learndirect. In Wales,
Estyn has responsibility for all these areas as well
as for the provision of careers guidance.
Scotland
In Scotland, HM Inspectorate of Education
operates as an executive agency of the Scottish
Executive. It inspects, reviews and reports on state
and independent schools, further education
colleges and the education functions of local
authorities. Reports are published and are usually
followed up within two years.
Northern Ireland
The Education and Training Inspectorate
monitors, inspects and reports on standards of
education and training provided by schools,
colleges and other grant-aided organisations, and
provides information and policy advice to the
Department of Education, the Department of
Culture, Arts and Leisure, and the Department
for Employment and Learning.
International links
Large numbers of people from other countries
come to the United Kingdom to study, and many
UK people work and train overseas. The British
Council (see chapter 7) encourages links between
educational institutions in the United Kingdom
and developing countries.
The Commonwealth Education Fund
The Commonwealth Education Fund was set up in
2002 to highlight the need for universal primary
education in the Commonwealth and to raise
children’s awareness of development issues.
Actionaid, Oxfam and Save the Children
administer the fund. The Government provided a
grant of £10 million to the fund until December
2005, and matches contributions by businesses
and others. There are estimated to be 70 million
children in the Commonwealth who do not go to
school.
European Union
The Socrates education programme supports
partnerships between schools, colleges and
universities, by promoting the European
dimension in education through language
learning, mobility opportunities for educational
staff, pupils and students and a range of
multinational projects.
The Leonardo da Vinci vocational training
programme supports co-operation in vocational
training across Europe through multinational pilot
projects, work placements and trainer exchanges,
and research projects.
Overseas students and teachers in the UK
In 2001/02 there were 97,900 overseas students in
further education in the United Kingdom, and
247,400 overseas students in higher education.
Most pay fees covering the full costs of their
courses. Nationals of other EU states generally pay
the lower level of fees applicable to UK home
students.
In order to teach in maintained schools in England
and Wales, it is generally necessary to hold QTS
(see page 136). Regulations do not allow for the
automatic recognition of teaching qualifications
gained abroad unless the teacher is a national of
the European Economic Area (see page 69) or
Switzerland. Other nationals can be appointed
under certain circumstances as temporary
unqualified teachers for up to four years. These
may gain QTS through a school-based training
programme, or, in England only, through the
Overseas Trained Teachers programme.
Government scholarship schemes
The Government makes provision for foreign
students to study in the United Kingdom through
its Chevening Programme and other scholarship
schemes. In 2002/03 about 3,400 overseas
scholarships were awarded under scholarship
141
10 Education and training
UK 2005
schemes funded by the Foreign & Commonwealth
Office (FCO), and other government departments.
In addition to the Chevening Programme, these
are the Commonwealth Scholarships and
Fellowship Plan, Department for International
Development Shared Scholarships, Marshall
Scholarships, and North Atlantic Fellowships.
Other schemes
The Overseas Research Students Award Scheme,
funded by the higher education funding councils,
provides help for overseas full-time postgraduate
students with outstanding research potential. In
addition, most UK universities and colleges offer
bursaries and scholarships for which graduates of
any nationality are eligible. Other public and
private scholarships are available to students from
overseas and to UK students who want to study in
other countries.
The Teachers’ International Professional
Development Programme aims to provide teachers
with opportunities for international study visits or
exchanges which will enable them to benefit from
good practice, develop international educational
links with other schools, carry out research and
share information with a network of other
participants.

Both full-time and part-time employment in the
United Kingdom have risen over the last decade.
The increase has been predominantly in the
service sector, in which over three-quarters of
employees now work. At the same time
unemployment has fallen considerably since the
last peak at the end of 1992 and in spring 2004
reached its lowest rate since the introduction of
the International Labour Organisation (ILO)
measure of unemployment in 1984.
Patterns of employment
The Labour Force Survey (LFS)1 carried out by the
Office for National Statistics shows that, on a
seasonally adjusted basis, 29.7 million people aged
16 and over were economically active in the
United Kingdom in spring 2004, comprising
28.3 million in employment2 and 1.4 million
unemployed (Table 11.1). The number in
employment represented an increase of 206,000 on
the previous year. The employment rate among
those of working age (men aged 16 to 64 and
women aged 16 to 59) was 74.7 per cent,
unchanged from spring 2003. The economic
activity rate for people in this age group was
78.6 per cent. Some 7.8 million people of working
age were economically inactive.
One of the main long-term trends in the labour
market is the increased participation of women in
employment. In spring 2004, 70 per cent of
working-age women were in employment,
1 The LFS data in this chapter do not take account of October 2004
revisions (see page vii).
2 There are two main measures of employment: the number of
people in employment and the number of jobs; they differ because
one person can have more than one job.
Definitions
Economic activity
The labour market can be divided into two groups:
the economically active and inactive. The economically
active are defined as those who are either in
employment (employee, self-employed, unpaid
family worker or on a government-supported
training programme) or unemployed and actively
seeking work. The economically inactive are people
who do not meet either of these criteria: for example
those in retirement and those not actively seeking
work.
Unemployment
The unemployment figure is based on LFS
estimates of the number of people without a job
who are seeking work. It refers to the number
available to start work within two weeks who have
either looked for work in the previous four weeks
or are waiting to start a job they have already
obtained. It is based on ILO guidelines and is the
official measure of UK unemployment.
Employment and unemployment rates
The employment rate is the percentage of people
in a given age group who are in employment. The
unemployment rate is the percentage of the
economically active who are unemployed.
Redundancy rate
The ratio of the number of redundancies in one
quarter to the number of employees in the
previous quarter, measured as redundancies per
1,000 employees.

compared with 58 per cent in 1984. Among many
reasons for their greater involvement is that more
women delay having children until their thirties
and are then more likely to return to work
afterwards, making use of a range of childcare
options. Other reasons include the increasing
levels of educational attainment among women
and changing social attitudes to women working.
The difference in employment rates between men
and women has narrowed from 19 percentage
points in 1984 to 10 percentage points in 2004.
Differences in employment rates within the
regions of the United Kingdom are generally
greater than differences between regions. The
Annual Local Area LFS shows that in 2002/03 the
greatest contrast in rates was found between local
authorities in London. The capital includes Tower
Hamlets, with the lowest employment rate in
Great Britain (53 per cent), and Richmond upon
Thames, with a rate of 82 per cent. The local
authorities with the highest employment rate in
Great Britain are Forest Heath (in the East), and
Tandridge (in the South East), both with rates of
88 per cent.
date. The number of young people unemployed
for more than two years decreased by 5,000 to
18,000 over the same period (a fall of 21 per cent).
Older workers
There were 6.3 million people aged between 50
and state pension age3 in employment in spring
2004, representing 22 per cent of all people in
employment in the United Kingdom. Their
employment rate was unchanged on the previous
year at 70 per cent. The economic inactivity rate
among men aged 50 to 64 increased from
23 per cent in 1984 to peak at 29 per cent in 1995
and was 26 per cent in spring 2004. The rate for
women aged 50 to 59 declined from 41 per cent to
31 per cent between 1984 and 2004. Over
90 per cent of people above state pension age were
economically inactive (see page 143) in spring
2004, but 995,000 were in employment, of whom
660,000 were women.
In spring 2004, 15 per cent of the unemployed
were aged 50 and over, of whom 33 per cent had
been unemployed for more than 12 months. The
Government will be bringing forward legislation
to outlaw age discrimination in employment and
training by 2006 (see page 154). Its Age Positive
website promotes the Code of Practice on Age
Diversity in Employment.
Disabled people
The LFS uses the definition of disability in the
Disability Discrimination Act, which includes both
work limiting and non-work limiting disabled
people. In spring 2004 there were about 7 million
people of working age with long-term disabilities
in the United Kingdom, of whom just under half
were in employment. The unemployment rate
among long-term disabled people in spring 2004
was 8 per cent, a fall of around 3 percentage points
since spring 1998.
Young people
Households with no one in work
The economic activity of young people is closely
linked to their participation in full-time education
(FTE). Of those 16- to 17-year-olds not in FTE in
spring 2004, 77 per cent were economically active,
and of these 27 per cent were unemployed. For
those in FTE, 44 per cent were economically
active. Youth unemployment decreased slightly
between spring 2003 and 2004 with 389,000
people aged 18 to 24 unemployed at the latter
The number of workless households (among
households where at least one adult was of
working age) was 3.0 million in spring 2004, some
150,000 fewer than in 1999. This represented a rate
of worklessness of 16.1 per cent in spring 2004,
compared with 17.3 per cent in 1999.

Lone parents
Secondary and temporary work
In spring 2004 the rate of worklessness for lone
parent households with dependent children was
42.1 per cent, down 1.2 percentage points from the
previous year and down 6.0 percentage points
from spring 1999. The number of such households
in spring 2004 was 751,000, some 40,000 fewer
than five years earlier.
Working patterns
For the past decade, about three-quarters of those
in employment have been full-time workers, with
the remainder working part time. A significant
number of people have alternative employment
patterns, such as second and temporary jobs.
There is also a growing number of people who
have a flexible work pattern.
Part-time work
There were nearly 7.4 million people in part-time
work in the United Kingdom in spring 2004 (Table
11.2), of whom 78 per cent were women. Over the
past decade the number of people working part
time has increased by over 1 million, but as a
proportion of all those in employment it has
remained at around 25 per cent. People work part
time for a variety of reasons. In spring 2004,
74 per cent did not want a full-time job while
8 per cent were working part time because they
could not find full-time work.

Just over 1 million people had a second job in
spring 2004 and about 1.5 million people (6 per
cent of employees) were engaged in temporary
jobs (Table 11.2). Around a quarter worked in a
temporary job because they could not find a
permanent one. The Employment Act 2002 gives
fixed-term employees the right to equal treatment
on pay, pensions, holidays, sick pay and training.
Temporary employment is lower in the United
Kingdom than in most other European Union
countries.
Flexible working patterns
Government policy has stressed the importance of
maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Flexible
working arrangements can make a contribution to
this. A fifth of employees working full time in the
United Kingdom and a quarter of those working
part time had some type of flexible working
arrangement in spring 2004. Flexible working
hours was the most common form of arrangement
for full-time employees from both sexes. It was
also the most common arrangement for men who
worked part time, whereas term-time working was
the most common for women who worked part
time (see also page 146).
The Second Work-Life Balance Study, published by
the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) in
October 2003, found strong support for extending
flexible working practices from both employers
and employees. The survey of employers found
that 84 per cent agreed with the statement
‘employers should make special effort to
accommodate the particular difficulties facing
parents of young and disabled children in
balancing their work and family life’, and
94 per cent of employers agreed with the
statement ‘people work best when they can balance
their work and other aspects of their lives’.
Hours of work
The most common hours worked by those in
employment in the United Kingdom were between
31 and 45 hours in spring 2004. A slightly higher
proportion of men (57 per cent) than women
(46 per cent) worked these hours. The next most
common length for men was over 45 hours
(32 per cent) whereas for women it was between
16 and 30 hours (30 per cent). A higher

Flexible arrangements for parents
Regulations introduced across the United
Kingdom in April 2003 give parents of children
under 6 or parents of disabled children under 18
the right to request a flexible work pattern: either
a change to the hours they work; a change to the
times when they are required to work; or the
opportunity to work from home. Employers have
a statutory duty to consider such applications and
may only refuse on business grounds.
In April 2004 the DTI published results of its first
flexible working employee survey. The survey
questioned employees in September, October and
November 2003, and February 2004. It found
that 52 per cent of all employees in Great Britain
were aware of the right of working parents to
request flexible working and that the large
majority (86 per cent) of flexible working requests
made since April 2003 were either fully or partly
accepted by employers.
proportion of women (44 per cent) than men
(11 per cent) worked 30 hours or less a week.
Hours worked tend to be longest in agriculture and
construction, and shortest in public administration,
education and health, and other services. These
differences between industries reflect the mix of
part-time and full-time workers, as well as any
difference in the standard working week.
Regulations implementing an EC Directive on
working time are in force in the United Kingdom.
They apply to full-time, part-time and temporary
workers and provide for:
■ a maximum working week of 48 hours (on
average), although individual workers can
choose to work longer;
■ a minimum of four weeks’ annual paid leave;
■ minimum daily, weekly and in-work rest
periods;
■ a limit for night workers of an average eight
hours’ work in a 24-hour period; and
■ a right for night workers to receive free health
assessments.
From August 2004 these regulations were extended
to the working time of junior doctors, with the
Travelling to work
According to the 2001 Census, 62 per cent of
people aged 16 to 74 who were in employment
in England and Wales travelled to work in a car
or van. Far smaller proportions (14 per cent) used
public transport and 13 per cent went on foot or
on a bicycle. Fifty eight per cent of workers
travelled less than 10 kilometres to their
workplace and only 5 per cent travelled 40
kilometres or more. The majority (80 per cent) of
those who walked to work travelled less than
2 kilometres to their workplace. Of those who
used the train, just under a quarter (23 per cent)
travelled 40 kilometres or more.

implementation of the maximum 48-hour
working week to be phased in by 1 August 2009.
There are specific provisions for 16- and
17-year-olds in respect of entitlement to rest and
health assessments and specific working time and
night work limits.
Self-employment
In spring 2004, 3.6 million people (nearly three-
quarters of whom were men) were self-employed
in the United Kingdom (Table 11.2). This
represented 13 per cent of those in employment, a
small increase since spring 2003. Those who were
self-employed were most likely to work in
construction or banking, finance and insurance,
and less likely to work in manufacturing, transport
and communication.
Occupations and industries
There has been a long-term growth in managerial
and professional occupations and a decline in
skilled trades, elementary occupations4 and
process, plant and machine operatives.
The patterns of occupations followed by men and
women in the United Kingdom are quite different
(Table 11.3). More than a fifth of women in

likely to be followed by women. Conversely
women were more likely than men to be employed
in the personal services and in sales and customer
services. Only the professional and associated
occupations, and elementary occupations, were
followed by similar proportions of men and
women.
Employment by sector
One of the major long-term trends in employment
in the United Kingdom has been the large increase
in employment in service industries (Table 11.4).
Between March 1984 and March 2004 the number
of workforce jobs in service industries increased
from 17.4 million to 23.9 million, a rise of 38 per
cent, compared with a rise in the total number of
jobs of 17 per cent. Growth in finance and
business services was particularly strong, up by
80 per cent over this period.
In recent years most other sectors have
experienced falling levels of employment. The
biggest long-term decline has been in energy and
water, with a reduction of 64 per cent between
1984 and 2004, reflecting, among other things, a
large fall in jobs in the coal industry.

Pay and conditions
Earnings
According to the New Earnings Survey (NES),
average gross weekly earnings for full-time adult
employees whose pay was not affected by absence
were £476 in Great Britain in April 2003 (an
increase of 2.4 per cent since April 2002), and
£405 in Northern Ireland (Table 11.5). London
had by far the highest average earnings within the
United Kingdom (£637 a week) and the North
East had the lowest (£402 a week). Across all
regions in the United Kingdom, men earned more
than women. However, female employees in
London earned more on average than male
employees from many of the other regions.
In Great Britain average hourly pay, excluding
overtime, for full-time male adult employees whose
pay was not affected by absence was £12.88 in April
2003, compared with £10.56 for female employees.
Expressed in percentage terms, women were paid
82.0 per cent of the male rate - the narrowest gender
pay gap since the NES began in 1970. For full-time
employees in Northern Ireland the hourly rate for
men was £10.64, compared with £9.51 for women.
Directors and chief executives of major
organisations were the highest paid occupation,

National minimum wage
The statutory national minimum wage (NMW)
was introduced in 1999. In October 2004, largely
based on the recommendations of the Low Pay
Commission, the Government introduced a new
NMW for people who are under 18 and above
school leaving age. Minimum wage rates, from
1 October 2004, are;
■ £4.85 an hour for those aged 22 or above;
■ £4.10 an hour for workers aged 18 to 21, and
for those aged 22 or over receiving accredited
training in the first six months of a new job
with a new employer; and
■ £3.00 an hour for those who are under 18 and
above school leaving age.
Almost all workers who are 16 or over are covered
by the NMW, including casual workers, agency
workers, part-time workers, overseas workers and
workers in small businesses. Workers not covered
include the majority of the self-employed and
members of the Armed Forces.
The NMW is enforced through a combination of
measures. For example:
■ employers are required by law to keep records
to prove they are paying the NMW;
■ Inland Revenue Compliance Officers
investigate all complaints about non-payment
of the NMW; they visit employers thought
to be likely to pay below the minimum wage
and take enforcement action where necessary;
and
■ individuals can take action through an
employment tribunal or civil court.

Fringe benefits offered by some employers include
schemes to encourage financial participation by
employees in their companies, pension schemes,
medical insurance, subsidised meals, company cars
and childcare schemes.

schemes, where employees acquire shares or
options to buy shares from their employer. An

Workforce skills
The demand for different types of skills varies
across the United Kingdom and this is reflected in
the organisations responsible for managing skills,
described in chapter 10.
The Government published a Skills Strategy and
Delivery Plan for England in 2003, which sets out
how it aims to close the productivity gap with
competitors through a highly skilled, productive
workforce. The Strategy identified particular gaps
in basic skills such as literacy, numeracy and use of
IT. It also identified skills gaps at intermediate and
higher levels - for example there is a need for
more people with technician, higher craft and
associate professional qualifications, and a need to
develop high quality leadership and management
skills, particularly at middle management level in
companies, and in small and medium-sized
enterprises.
The New Deal for Skills forms part of the Skills
Strategy and was announced in the 2004 Budget.
It is a joint project between the Department for
Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Department
for Education and Skills with involvement from
the Learning and Skills Council (see page 135),
Jobcentre Plus (see page 153), the DTI and the
Treasury. It aims to improve the support to the
low-skilled by creating a new skills guidance
service, co-located with Jobcentre Plus where
possible, and improving mechanisms of financial
support for those for whom training provides a
route back to work.
The New Deal for Skills takes forward the
recommendations set out in the February 2004
report of the National Employment Panel, Welfare
to Workforce Development. The Panel is an
employer-led body that provides independent
advice to Ministers.
The National Employers Skills Survey 2003 found
that about 2.4 million workers in England were
described by their employers as not proficient in
their jobs. One in five job vacancies remained
unfilled because of a lack of skilled applicants and
44 per cent of the employers experiencing skills
shortages said they were losing business as a result.
The Scottish Executive’s strategy for lifelong
learning, Life Through Learning; Learning Through
Life, was published in 2003. It sets out five goals to
achieve the best possible match between the
learning opportunities open to people and the
skills necessary to strengthen Scotland’s economy.
Futureskills Scotland (part of Scottish Enterprise
and Highlands and Islands Enterprise carried out
the Skills in Scotland 2003 survey. It found that
skills shortages were uncommon, and were
concentrated in skilled trades and personal service
occupations, and among the other services, health
and social work, and agriculture industries.
The Department for Employment and Learning in
Northern Ireland is developing a Skills Strategy in
conjunction with other Northern Ireland
departments and agencies and has established a
Skills Task Force.
Skills Monitoring Surveys were carried out in
Northern Ireland in 2000 and 2002 and the next is
scheduled for early 2005. In addition, a series of
skills forecasting studies on specific industry
sectors have been completed.
Investors in People
Investors in People (HP) is the National Standard
that sets a level of good practice for improving an
organisation’s performance through its people. It
links the training and development of employees
to the organisation’s business objectives. Reported
benefits include increased productivity, higher
profits, lower rates of absenteeism and improved
morale. Investors in People UK is responsible for
the promotion, quality assurance and development
of the Standard. In March 2004 over 7 million
employees worked in liP recognised organisations.
Unemployment
There has been a steadily downward trend in the
number of unemployed people since 1993, apart
from a slight increase between spring 2001 and
spring 2002 (Figure 11.7). The unemployment rate
in spring 2004 was down 0.2 percentage points on
spring 2003 and, at 4.8 per cent, was at its lowest
level since the introduction of the ILO measure of
unemployment in 1984. This represents about

1.4 million unemployed people (see Table 11.1)
and compares with the EU-15 average in 2003 of
8.1 per cent and a rate of 6.0 per cent in the
United States.
Within the United Kingdom, unemployment rates
in spring 2004 were highest in Scotland (6.1 per
cent), followed by Northern Ireland (5.0 per cent),
England (4.7 per cent) and Wales (4.6 per cent).
In addition, there were significant variations in
unemployment rates within regions.
In recent years there has been a substantial fall in
long-term unemployment. In spring 2004 some
290,000 people aged 16 and over had been
unemployed for over a year, of whom 135,000 had
been out of work for over two years. These figures
represent falls of 9 per cent and 13 per cent
respectively since spring 2003.
In June 2004, 851,000 people were claiming
unemployment-related benefits, representing
2.7 per cent of the total UK workforce. Around
two-thirds of claimants had been claiming benefits
for less than six months.
Redundancies
Redundancy levels in the United Kingdom have
remained roughly constant since the statistical
series began in 1995. In spring 2004 the
redundancy rate was 5.9 per 1,000 employees,
compared with 6.4 per 1,000 in spring 2003. The
highest redundancy rate was in manufacturing at
12.1 per 1,000. The redundancy rate in the services
sector was 4.3 per 1,000 employees.
Economic inactivity
In spring 2004, 7.8 million people of working age
in the United Kingdom were economically
inactive, of whom 61 per cent were women. When
including those over state pension age (65 for men
and 60 for women) there were 17.5 million
economically inactive people.
Figure 11.8 shows that inactivity rates were highest
for people over the state pension age although
around 10 per cent of men and women of this age
were still economically active. Given many 16- to
17-year-olds continue in full-time or part-time
education after they complete their compulsory
education, the inactivity rate for this group is also
fairly high. Inactivity rates among men were lowest
for those aged 25 to 34 and 35 to 49, at around
8 per cent, and for women the rate was lowest for
35- to 49-year-olds at 22 per cent.
Sickness and disability were the major reasons for
economic inactivity among working-age men in
spring 2004. Looking after the family or home was
the most common reason for inactivity among
working-age women - 45 per cent said this was the
main reason for not seeking work. Government

11 The labour market
policy is aimed at helping those who are currently
inactive to make the transition towards activity,
primarily through the New Deal programmes (see
page 152) and Jobcentre Plus (see page 153).
Labour market policy
The Government’s strategy for ensuring
employment opportunity for all was set out in its
Green Paper, Towards Full Employment in a
Modern Society, published in 2001. It is based on:
■ helping people to move from welfare to work,
through extending the series of New Deal
programmes (see page 152);
■ easing the transition to work by removing
barriers to working and ensuring that people
are financially secure when moving from
welfare to work;
■ making paid work more attractive, through
promoting incentives to work and reforming
the tax and benefits system (see chapters 23
and 12); and
■ securing progression in work through lifelong
learning, to ensure that people are well
trained and able to adapt to changing
economic circumstances.
Although the UK employment rate has increased
over the last ten years the Government wants to
increase the employment opportunities for certain
sections of society who may experience
disadvantage such as lone parents, people on
sickness and disability benefits, and those who
have been on benefits for a long time -
particularly in areas where there are high
concentrations of economic inactivity. In
December 2003 it published Full employment in
every region, which outlines its strategy of:
■ making the benefit system encourage those
people who are economically inactive but
capable of, and often interested in, work;
■ improving the financial incentives for people
on sickness and disability benefits, and for
people living in areas where housing rents are
high, so that they gain more by returning to
work; and
■ providing more flexible opportunities for
training and childcare and reducing other
barriers to work.
Welfare to work
The DWP operates a number of programmes
aimed at helping people into work, including:
■ Employment Zones - working in 13 areas of
Great Britain where there are high
concentrations of unemployment;
■ Action Teams for Jobs - operating in 63 areas
in Great Britain, these aim to remove the
barriers to employment faced by jobless
people and, by working with employers, to
move them into suitable vacancies;
■ StepUP - a programme aimed at providing
guaranteed jobs for up to 50 weeks in areas of
high unemployment, for those who have not
been successful on the New Deal;
■ Progress2work - a £40 million programme
helping recovering drug misusers find
employment. Progress2work-LinkUP,
which began in October 2002, is piloting the
same approach with a wider group,
including ex-offenders, alcohol misusers and
the homeless;
■ Adviser Discretion Fund - which gives
Jobcentre Districts flexibility to address the
specific barriers to work affecting their
communities; and
■ Ambition Programmes - industry-specific
training and recruitment programmes in
sectors such as IT, retailing, energy,
construction and the public sector.
The Government’s welfare to work policy is also
delivered throughout the United Kingdom
through a number of‘New Deaf programmes,
targeted at specific groups (see Table 11.9). In
2004/05 the provision for expenditure on New
Deals includes £330 million for young people,
£256 million for the 25 plus programme,
£95 million for lone parents and £42 million for
disabled people.
Recruitment and job finding
There are many ways in which people look for
work in the United Kingdom. According to the
LFS, in spring 2002, more than half of all
employees obtained their current job either by
hearing about it from someone who worked there
or by replying to an advertisement. In spring 2004
there were an estimated 631,000 vacancies in the
United Kingdom, 48,300 more than in spring 2003.

Jobcentre Plus
In Great Britain the Jobcentre Plus network
provides help in finding jobs and pays benefits to
people of working age. It has responsibility for
running local offices formerly managed by the
Employment Service and the Benefits Agency,
including Jobcentres and social security offices. By
the end of March 2004 around 400 Jobcentre Plus
offices had been opened. The DWP expects the
network of offices will be completed by 2006.
Until this time, services in some areas will
152
UK 2005
11 The labour market
continue to be provided in social security offices
and Jobcentres. A similar programme to combine
Jobcentre and social security offices is under way
in Northern Ireland. The new offices are known as
‘Jobs and Benefits’.
All Jobcentre Plus vacancies are now available on
the Internet, on one of the largest job banks in the
world. Vacancies are also available through
electronic touch-screen kiosks, known as
‘Jobpoints’, which are replacing traditional vacancy
display boards in Jobcentres. The DWP is
planning to install Jobpoints in locations such as
libraries, supermarkets, prisons, and community
centres.
Employers with a vacancy can use the Employer
Direct service, which provides a single national
telephone number for employers to have their
vacancies advertised on the Internet and on all
Jobpoints. From summer 2004 a new service -
Employer Direct Online - enabled employers to
notify their vacancies over the Internet.
Advisory services
Most people who make a claim for a working-age
benefit have to take part in a meeting with a
personal adviser, for example to discuss help to
find work or support such as training or childcare.
If the individual is claiming benefits other than
JSA (see page 172), it is his or her decision
whether or not to look for work.
Jobcentre Plus advisers assess eligibility for JSA
and provide advice about jobs, training and self-
employment opportunities. To receive the
allowance, each unemployed person has to
complete a Jobseeker’s Agreement, which sets out
his or her availability for work, the types of job
that are being looked for, and the steps that, if
taken, offer the best chance of securing work.
Employment agencies
There are many private employment agencies,
including several large firms with significant
branch networks. The law governing the conduct
of employment agencies is less restrictive in the
United Kingdom than in many EU countries, but
agencies must comply with legislation that
establishes minimum standards designed to
protect agency users, both workers and employers.
The Recruitment and Employment Confederation
is the association representing the private
recruitment and staffing industry in the United
Kingdom. It has a membership of over 6,000
recruitment agencies and over 8,000 recruitment
consultants. All members must abide by a code of
good recruitment practice.
New website for foreign workers
In December 2003 the Government launched a
website {www.workingintheuk.gov.uk) that
provides information about the rules for foreign
nationals who want to work legally in the United
Kingdom, including information on applying for a
work permit. The site also provides advice for
employers on preventing illegal working and
includes other information on immigration policy.
Industrial relations
Individual employment rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For example,
most employees have a right to a written statement
setting out details of the main conditions,
including pay, hours of work and holidays.
Employees with at least two years of continuous
employment with their employer are entitled to
lump sum redundancy payments if their jobs cease
to exist and their employers cannot offer suitable
alternative work.5
Minimum periods of notice are laid down for both
employers and employees. Most employees who
believe they have been unfairly dismissed have the
right to complain to an employment tribunal (see
page 154), subject to the general qualifying period
of one year’s continuous service. If the complaint
is upheld, the tribunal may make an order for
re-employment or award compensation.
Legislation prohibits discrimination in
employment, training and related matters, on
grounds of sex or marital status, or gender
reassignment, disability, race, nationality
(including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin
5 The statutory redundancy payment is calculated according to a
formula based on a person's age, the number of years of
continuous service up to a maximum of 20 years and his or her
weekly pay up to the current maximum of £250 per week.
However, many employers pay more than the statutory amount.
153
11 The labour market
UK 2005
(see page 108). In December 2003 new
employment regulations came into force in Great
Britain. The Employment Equality (Sexual
Orientation) and the Employment Equality
(Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003,
implemented parts of the EC Employment
Directive, and extended protection against
discrimination in employment and training to
cover sexual orientation and religion or belief.
Northern Ireland has separate legislation
implementing the Directive and discrimination in
employment, training and related matters on
grounds of political opinion is also unlawful.
Between July and October 2003, the Government
conducted a consultation exercise outlining
proposals that would implement the part of the
EC Employment Directive relating to age
discrimination. It is planned that legislation
outlawing age discrimination in employment and
vocational training will come into force in October
2006.
The purpose of the Equal Pay Act 1970 is to
eliminate pay discrimination between women and
men, when doing work that is the same or broadly
similar, work that is rated as equivalent, or work
that is of equal value. Regulations under the Act
that came into force in 2003 lengthened the time
limit for bringing cases, and the time limit for
which arrears payments can be made. An Equal
Pay Questionnaire was introduced in April 2003,
designed to help employees who believe they may
not have received equal pay to request relevant
information from their employers.
The Disability Rights Commission, the Equal
Opportunities Commission and the Commission
for Racial Equality have powers to investigate
cases of discrimination at work in Great Britain.
The Equality Commission in Northern Ireland
has similar powers.
Legislation that was due to come into
force in October 2004 provides more protection for
disabled people against discrimination in the
workplace. The employment and vocational
training provisions of the Disability Discrimination
Act 1995 were extended to employers with fewer
than 15 employees and to most previously
excluded occupations, such as police officers,
firefighters and partners in businesses.
All pregnant employees have the right to statutory
maternity leave with their non-wage contractual
benefits maintained, and to protection against
detriment and dismissal because of pregnancy.
Statutory maternity, paternity and adoption pay
are described in chapter 12. The Employment Act
2002 included provisions for paternity, maternity,
adoption, and flexible working for parents of
young or disabled children.
Employment tribunals
Employment tribunals in Great Britain have
jurisdiction over complaints covering a range of
employment rights, including unfair dismissal,
redundancy pay, equal pay, and discrimination.
New tribunal regulations, including provisions to
deter cases with weak claims and defences, took
effect in 2001 and reforms brought about by the
Employment Act 2002 were due to come into force
in October 2004. These included:
■ provision for cost recovery for management
time in vexatious cases;
■ requirements on employers to provide
statutory grievance procedures at the
workplace to help resolve disputes; and
■ requirements on employees, in most cases, to
begin these procedures before taking a
complaint to a tribunal.
A similar tribunal system operates in Northern
Ireland, and similar reforms are being introduced.
Between March and June 2004, the Government
carried out a consultation on new rules of tribunal
procedure for dealing with complex equal value
cases. These involve workers claiming equal pay on
the basis that they are doing work of equal value
to that of someone of the opposite sex, rather than
the same or a similar job. The Government plans to
introduce these new regulations by the end of 2004.
In March 2003 the Government announced plans
to bring the top ten non-devolved tribunals
(including employment tribunals) into a new,
unified Tribunals Service. Full proposals were
published in a White Paper - Transforming Public
Services: Complaints, Redress and Tribunals - by
the Department for Constitutional Affairs in July
2004.
Labour disputes
The largest annual number of working days lost
through stoppages in the United Kingdom was in
1926, the year of the General Strike, when just over
154
UK 2005
11 The labour market
160 million working days were lost. The coal
industry accounted for 146 million of these days.
Since 1970 there have been peaks in 1972, 1979
and 1984 (Figure 11.10). In 1972, a miners’ strike
accounted for 45 per cent of the 24 million days
lost. A strike by the engineering workers in 1979
resulted in just over half of the 29 million days
lost. Another miners’ strike in 1984 was
responsible for over 80 per cent of the 27 million
days lost.
In 2003 there were 133 stoppages of work arising
from labour disputes in the United Kingdom, and
0.5 million working days were lost as a result,
down from 1.3 million in 2002. In 2003, 28 per
cent of the working days lost were in the public
administration and defence sector, with the next
highest sector being education, at 26 per cent.
Stoppages over wage rates and earnings accounted
for 56 per cent of days lost.

Trade unions and employers'
organisations
Trade unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. As well as negotiating pay and other
terms and conditions of employment with
employers, they provide benefits and services, such
as educational facilities, financial services, legal
advice and aid in work-related cases. In autumn
2003 there were around 7.4 million trade union
members in the United Kingdom according to the
LFS.6 The proportion of employees who were
union members was 29 per cent in 2003
(compared with 32 per cent in 1995), and the
proportion among all those in employment was
27 per cent (29 per cent in 1995). By occupation,
employee membership is highest among
professionals, nearly half of whom were trade
union members in 2003. Membership was lowest
for sales and customer service employees of whom
around one in ten were members.
The largest union in the United Kingdom is the
public service union UNISON, which has around
1.3 million members. Other unions with
membership over 500,000 are:
■ Amicus - formed by the merger in 2002 of
the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical
Union and the Manufacturing, Science and
Finance union;
■ the Transport and General Workers Union; and
■ the GMB - a general union with members in
a wide range of industries.
At the end of March 2004 there were 195 trade
unions on the list maintained by the Certification
Officer, who, among other duties, is responsible
for certifying the independence of trade unions.
Entry on the list is voluntary but to be eligible a
trade union must show that it consists wholly or
mainly of workers and that its principal purposes
include the regulation of relations between
workers and employers or between workers and
employers’ associations. A further 20 unions were
known to the Certification Officer.
Trades Union Congress
The national body of the trade union movement in
England and Wales is the Trades Union Congress
(TUC), founded in 1868. In January 2004 its
affiliated membership was 69 trade unions, which
together represented some 6.4 million people.
There are six TUC regional councils for England
and a Wales Trades Union Council. The TUC
annual congress meets in September and a General
Council represents the TUC between annual
meetings.
6 There are two main sources of information on trade union
membership: the ONS Labour Force Survey and data provided by
trade unions to the Certification Office. Differences in coverage
can result in different estimates - in 2002/03 there were
7.7 million trade union members in the United Kingdom according
to the Certification Office.
155
11 The labour market
UK 2005
In Scotland there is a separate national body, the
Scottish Trades Union Congress, to which UK
unions usually affiliate their Scottish branches.
Nearly all trade unions in Northern Ireland are
represented by the Northern Ireland Committee of
the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU). Most
trade unionists in Northern Ireland are members
of unions affiliated to the ICTU, while the
majority also belong to unions based in Great
Britain, which are affiliated to the TUC.
The TUC participates in international trade union
activity, through its affiliation to the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the
European Trade Union Confederation. It also
nominates the British workers’ delegation to the
annual ILO Conference.
Trade union and industrial relations law
Legal requirements governing trade unions include
the following:
■ All individuals have the right not to be
dismissed or refused employment (or the
services of an employment agency) because of
membership or non-membership of a trade
union.
■ Where a union is recognised by an employer
for collective bargaining purposes, union
officials are entitled to paid time off for
certain trade union duties and training.
■ A trade union must elect every member of its
governing body, its general secretary and its
president. Elections must be held at least
every five years and be carried out by a secret
postal ballot under independent scrutiny.
Measures in the Employment Relations Act
2004 (see box) will change the requirements
on unions to hold a postal ballot for
presidents.
■ If a trade union wishes to set up a political
fund, its members must first agree in a secret
ballot a resolution adopting those political
objectives as an aim of the union. The union
must also ballot its members every ten years
to maintain the fund. Individual members
have a statutory right to opt out of
contributing to the fund.
■ For a union to have the benefit of statutory
immunity when organising industrial action,
the action must be wholly or mainly due to a
trade dispute between workers and their own
employer. Industrial action must not involve
workers who have no dispute with their own
employer (so-called secondary action) or
involve unlawful forms of picketing. Before
Employment Relations Act 2004
The Employment Relations Act 2004 is mainly
concerned with collective labour law and trade
union rights. The Act includes measures to:
■ improve the process whereby a trade union gains
recognition by an employer, through statutory
means;
■ tackle intimidation by unions or employers during
statutory union recognition ballots. The measures
will outlaw practices such as dismissing union
activists or threatening workers in an attempt to
influence a ballot;
■ simplify the law on industrial action ballots and
ballot notices;
■ provide the Secretary of State with the power to
make funds available to independent trade
unions and federations of trade unions to
modernise their operations;
■ define more closely the actions that employers
and unions should undertake when taking steps
to resolve industrial disputes;
■ widen the ability of the unions to lawfully expel
or exclude individuals whose political behaviour
is incompatible with trade union membership;
■ ensure that union members have clear rights to
use their union's services;
■ improve trade union regulation;
■ allow the Secretary of State to include non¬
postal methods of balloting in statutory union
elections and ballots; and
■ remove the requirements for union presidents
(or their equivalents) to be elected by a secret
postal ballot of the entire membership, provided
they are already elected members of the union
executive.

calling for industrial action, a trade union
must obtain the support of its members in a
secret postal ballot.
Employers' organisations
Many employers in the United Kingdom are
members of employers’ organisations, some of
which are wholly concerned with labour matters,
while others are also trade associations concerned
with commercial matters in general. Employers’
organisations are usually established on an
industry basis rather than a product basis, for
example, the Engineering Employers’ Federation.
At the end of March 2004, there were 85
employers’ associations on the list maintained by
the Certification Officer and a further 80 were
known to the Certification Officer. Most national
organisations belong to the Confederation of
British Industry (see page 363).
ACAS
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service
(ACAS) is an independent statutory body with a
general duty of promoting the improvement of
industrial relations. ACAS aims to operate through
the voluntary co-operation of employers,
employees and, where appropriate, their
representatives. Its main functions are collective
conciliation; provision of arbitration and
mediation; advisory mediation services for
preventing disputes and improving industrial
relations through the joint involvement of
employers and employees; and the provision of a
public enquiry service. ACAS also conciliates in
disputes on individual employment rights, and
runs a voluntary arbitration system for resolving
unfair dismissal claims. In April 2004 the
arbitration service provided by ACAS in England
and Wales to resolve complaints concerning unfair
dismissal was extended to Scotland. The scheme is
optional and both employer and employee must
choose arbitration rather than a tribunal hearing.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations Agency,
an independent statutory body, provides similar
services to those provided by ACAS.
Health and safety at work
There has been a long-term decline in injuries to
employees in the United Kingdom, partly
reflecting a change in industrial structure away
from the traditional heavy industries, which tend
to have higher risks. In Great Britain in 2003/04
there were 235 deaths of employees and the self-
employed from injuries at work, which
represented a fatal injury rate of almost one per
100,000 workers. Falls from a height, being struck
by a moving vehicle and being struck by a
moving/flying object continue to be the three most
common kinds of accident, accounting for 29 per
cent, 29 per cent and 12 per cent of fatal injuries
respectively. In Northern Ireland in 2002/03 there
were 21 fatal accidents in the workplace.
The main legislation in this area in Great Britain is
the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. It
imposes general duties on everyone concerned
with work activities, including employers, the self-
employed, employees, and manufacturers and
suppliers of materials for use at work. Associated
Acts and regulations deal with particular hazards
and types of work. Employers with five or more
staff must prepare written statements of their
health and safety policy and their assessment of
significant risks and bring them to the attention of
their staff. The regulatory regime for health and
safety at work in Northern Ireland broadly mirrors
that of England, Scotland and Wales. The principal
legislation is contained in the Health and Safety at
Work (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 as amended
by the Health and Safety at Work (Amendment)
(Northern Ireland) Order 1998.
The DWP has lead responsibility for the
sponsorship of the Health and Safety Commission
(HSC) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
Other government departments have specific
health and safety responsibilities, for example, the
DTI for civil nuclear matters and the Department
for Transport for rail passenger safety. The Health
and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland has
responsibility for enforcing legislation there.
Health and Safety Commission
The HSC has responsibility for developing policy
on health and safety at work in Great Britain,
including proposals for new or revised regulations
and approved codes of practice. In February 2004
the HSC published A strategy for workplace health
and safety in Great Britain to 2010 and beyond. The
strategy aims to:
■ work with others, especially on workplace
health, and form closer working relations
between HSE and local authorities;
157
11 The labour market
UK 2005
■ promote effective health and safety
management, the case for health and safety,
and worker involvement;
■ focus on key ways to reduce workplace injury
and ill health; and
■ develop more effective ways of
communicating HSC and HSE aims.
The HSC has advisory committees covering
subjects such as toxic substances, genetic
modification and occupational health. There are
also several industry advisory committees, each
covering a specific sector of industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The HSE is the primary means of carrying out the
HSC’s policies. It provides technical advice and
enforces health and safety law through its
inspectorates. In premises such as offices, shops,
warehouses, restaurants and hotels, legislation is
enforced by inspectors appointed by local
authorities, working as agents of the HSC under
guidance from the HSE.
The Health and Safety Laboratory, an agency of
the HSE, supports investigations of incidents and
workplace situations. It also carries out longer-
term research on occupational health and safety
problems.

Social protection refers to the support that is
provided by central government, local authorities,
private bodies, voluntary organisations and
individuals to those who are in need or at risk.
Recipients of such help include children and
families; older people and survivors (such as
widows); those who are sick, physically disabled or
sensorily impaired; people with learning
disabilities or mental health problems; and low
earners and the unemployed. The Government
provides social protection principally through the
social security system and health and personal
social services. Services relating specifically to
health are included in chapter 13.
The social security system is designed to secure a
basic standard of living for people in financial
need. It provides income during periods of
inability to earn (including periods of sickness and
unemployment), pensions for retired people,
financial help for low-income families and
assistance with costs arising from disablement. The
provision of these benefits is administered by the
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in
Great Britain (mainly through the Jobcentre Plus
network and The Pension Service) and the Social
Security Agency of the Department for Social
Development in Northern Ireland. The Inland
Revenue administers tax credits (see page 161).
Personal social services refers to the assessment
for, and provision of, practical help and support
for older people, disabled people, vulnerable
children and young people, those with mental
health problems or learning disabilities, and their
families and carers. These services may be
residential, day care, short-break or ‘domiciliary’
(provided for people needing support to live in
their own homes). In certain circumstances, direct
cash payments may be made to enable individuals
to obtain relevant services for themselves.
In Great Britain the social services departments of
local authorities are responsible for ensuring the
direct provision or commissioning of services and
for ensuring that people receive a high-quality
sendee, regardless of the provider. In Northern
Ireland sendees are provided by Health and Social
Sendees (HSS) Trusts.
Central government is responsible for establishing
national policies, securing resources, issuing
guidance and overseeing standards. An
independent body is responsible for inspecting
and regulating social care services in each part of
the United Kingdom (see page 162).
Various voluntary, charitable and not-for-profit
organisations also offer care, assistance and
support to vulnerable members of society.
Examples include the Anchor Trust, which works
with older people; Barnardo’s, which helps
children and young people (and their families);
and Mencap, which supports people with learning
disabilities, their parents and carers. Citizens
Advice (see page 479) offer free and impartial
advice on a wide range of issues including benefits,
housing, debt, legal matters, employment, and
immigration.
Expenditure
Average UK social protection expenditure per
head was £3,842 in 2001, similar to the EU average
(Figure 12.1). These figures include central and
local government expenditure on social security
and personal social services, sick pay paid by

allow direct comparisons they are expressed in
Purchasing Power Parities (which take account of
the general level of prices within each country). As
well as different levels of expenditure in the EU
countries, the figures reflect differences in
demographic structures, unemployment rates and
other social, institutional and economic factors.
Social security is the largest single area of UK
government spending, amounting to an estimated
£131 billion in 2003/04 - 28.5 per cent of total
managed expenditure. Over half of government
expenditure on social security benefits (excluding
tax credits) goes on pensioners.
In 2002/03 gross expenditure on personal social
services by local authorities was £15.2 billion in
England. Expenditure on older people accounted
for 45 per cent of the total and on children for
23 per cent (Figure 12.2). In Wales, spending on
personal social services was £1.0 billion, while
spending on social work amounted to £2.2 billion
in Scotland and £600 million in Northern Ireland.
The social security system
Benefits
■ contributory, paid to people who have made
the required contributions to the National
Insurance Fund (see page 161);
■ means-tested, available to people whose
income and savings are below certain levels;
■ benefits which are neither contributory nor
means-tested, mainly paid to offset extra costs
of, for example, disability, or paid universally
(for example Child Benefit); and
■ payments made by employers to employees
who are sick, expecting a baby or adopting a
child (these payments are based on earnings
and the terms and conditions of
employment).
Most benefits are increased annually in line with
percentage increases in retail prices. The main
benefits (payable weekly) are described on pages
161 and 171.
From April 2003 the Government began paying
benefits, state pensions and war pensions directly
into bank, building society or Post Office accounts.
This method of payment, called Direct Payment, is
being phased in over two years. By October 2003,
almost half of those receiving benefits or pensions
had switched to direct payments.
Tax credits
Social security benefits can be grouped into four
types:
Administered by the Inland Revenue, tax credits
have been introduced with the aim of improving
160
UK 2005
12 Social protection
the way the Government supports families with
children and working people on low incomes,
including disabled workers. The main tax credits
are the Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit.
National Insurance contributions (NICs)
With the exception of a small National Health
Service (NHS) allocation, all NICs are paid into
the National Insurance Fund. All contributory
benefits and their administrative costs are paid out
of the Fund.
Entitlement to many benefits, for example
Retirement Pension, Incapacity Benefit and
contributory Jobseeker’s Allowance, is dependent
upon the payment of NICs or the award of credits.
Employees and the self-employed aged under 65,
and employers, are all liable to pay contributions
once an individual’s earnings exceed a certain
amount. Where an employer operates a final salary
pension scheme (see page 164), the employee and
his or her employer pay a reduced rate of
contribution to offset the cost of the contribution
to the pension. The current NIC rates are set out
on the Inland Revenue website. Self-employed
people pay lower NICs than employees but receive
fewer benefits; in particular they are not eligible
for the State Second Pension (see page 164).
Social care providers
Providers of care range from families, friends and
volunteers to large statutory, voluntary and private
Table 12.3 Selected key benefits and tax credits (from April 2004)
State Retirement Pension
A taxable benefit payable, if the contribution conditions
have been met, to women from the age of 60 and men
from the age of 65 (from 2020, the state pension age for
both men and women will be 65). The full basic pension is
£79.60 a week for a single person and £127.25 for a
married couple - lower rates apply for those who have not
paid full contributions. It is not possible for people in work
to choose to contract out of the basic scheme. There is an
additional state pension scheme (see page 164), although
many people contract out of this and belong instead to
occupational schemes (run by employers), or personal
pension plans.
Child Benefit
A tax-free, universal, non-contributory payment of £16.50 a
week for the eldest qualifying child and £11.05 for each
other child. It is not affected by income or savings and is
payable for children up to the age of 16, and for those
under 19 who continue in full-time, non-advanced
education.
Income Support
Payable to certain people aged between 16 and 59 who
are not required to be available for work, and whose
savings are below £8,000 (£16,000 for people in
residential care or a nursing home). Those eligible include
lone parents, carers, and long-term sick and disabled
people. Income Support is based on circumstances,
including age and whether the claimant is single, a lone
parent or has a partner. The rates are £33.50 for a person
aged 16-17, £44.05 for someone aged 18-24 and £55.65
a week for people aged 25 or over. Couples aged 18 or
over receive £87.30. There are additional allowances for
dependent children and premium payments for those with
extra expenses, for example people with disabled children.
Pension Credit
Guarantees everyone aged 60 or over a weekly income of
at least £105.45 a week for a single person or £160.95 for
a couple. For pensioners aged 65 or over some existing
income and savings are not taken into account, in order to
avoid penalising people who have saved in the past.
Working Tax Credit (WTC)
For people on low incomes who usually work at least 16
hours a week and are:
■ aged 16 or over and responsible for at least one child; or
■ aged 16 or over and disabled; or
■ aged 25 or over and usually work at least 30 hours a
week.
In addition to the basic credit, there are additional elements
for single parents and couples, disabled people, childcare
costs, and people aged 50 or over who are returning to
work after a period on benefit. WTC is administered by the
Inland Revenue.
Child Tax Credit (CTC)
A payment to support families with children. It is for people
who are aged 16 or over and responsible for at least one
child or young person who lives with them. As with WTC, it
is administered by the Inland Revenue. The amount of CTC
paid depends on income and the number of children. There
are additional amounts for children aged under one and for
those with disabilities.

sector organisations. In April 2004 a single
comprehensive inspectorate for social care in
England was formed, bringing together the work
previously undertaken by the Social Services
Inspectorate (SSI); the SSI/Audit Commission
joint review team; and the social care functions of
the National Care Standards Commission.
The Commission for Social Care Inspection
(CSCI) is responsible for:
■ inspecting all public, private, and voluntary
social care organisations, including local
social services authorities;
■ registering services that meet national
minimum standards;
■ publishing an annual report to Parliament on
national progress on social care and an
analysis of where resources have been spent;
■ validating all published performance
assessment statistics on social care; and
■ publishing star ratings for social services
authorities.
In Wales and Scotland, the independent agencies
responsible for inspecting and regulating social
care services have a remit that also includes private
hospitals and clinics. They are the Care Standards
Inspectorate for Wales (CSIW) and the Scottish
Commission for the Regulation of Care (the Care
Commission). Social services authorities, however,
are inspected by separate bodies, the Social
Services Inspectorate for Wales and, in Scotland,
the Social Work Services Inspectorate.
In Northern Ireland, a new Health and Personal
Social Services Regulation and Improvement
Authority will become responsible for monitoring
and regulating the quality of health and care
services. It was set up in April 2004 and will
become fully operational in April 2005.
Informal carers
Much of the care given to people with long-term
physical or mental ill-health, a disability, or
problems relating to old age is provided by family
members, friends, and neighbours. The 2001
Census found that one in ten people in the United
Kingdom (5.9 million people) were providing
unpaid care (looking after, giving help or support)
to family members, friends, neighbours or others.
The majority of these carers (68 per cent) were
providing unpaid care for up to 19 hours a week,
but around 21 per cent (1.3 million people) did so
for 50 or more hours a week.
Carers can receive financial help from the
Government. The Carer’s Allowance is paid to full¬
time carers who are aged 16 or over and who are
spending at least 35 hours a week looking after
someone who is getting Attendance Allowance,
Disability Living Allowance (at the middle or
highest rate for personal care) or Constant
Attendance Allowance. The rate of Carer’s
Allowance in April 2004 was £44.35 a week. For
every complete tax year it is received, this is
counted as a contribution to the State Second
Pension.
Carer’s Allowance is not paid to full-time students
or if the carer is earning over £79 a week (after
allowable expenses). Carers entitled to the
Allowance and on low income may be able to
qualify for the carer premium, paid with
income-related benefits such as Pension Credit
or Income Support. The carer premium from
April 2004 is £25.55 a week.
The Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000
provides carers in England and Wales with the
right to have their need for services assessed by the
local authority, and for the local authority to
provide services direct to carers. The Act also
extended the power of local authorities to offer
direct payments to carers. Local authorities can
help young carers using powers in the Children Act
1989, which allow them to provide services to
other family members - such as helping a disabled
parent fulfil his or her parenting role - where that
is the best way to help the child.
The Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 will be
implemented from April 2005. It applies to
England and Wales. The Act aims to:
■ ensure that all carers know they are entitled to
an assessment of their needs;
■ place a duty on councils to consider a carer’s
outside interests (work, study or leisure)
when carrying out an assessment; and
■ promote better joint working between councils
and the health service to ensure support for
carers is delivered in a coherent way.
Under the Community Care and Health (Scotland)
Act 2002, the ability of carers to provide care is
assessed independently of the needs of the person
receiving care. The Act also requires local
authorities to take account of a carer’s
162
UK 2005
12 Social protection
contribution and views before deciding what
services to provide for the cared-for person.
Local authorities
Local authority social services departments provide
support and services to children and their families,
older people and those with learning disabilities,
physical disabilities or mental health needs. These
include the assessment of needs, the provision of
help, such as meals on wheels and home help, and
the running of day centres and residential homes.
Efforts are made in the provision of services to
promote independence and choice, and to help
disabled people live as independently as possible.
A new framework for delivering housing support
services, the Supporting People programme, began
in 2003 (see page 306).
The General Social Care Council in England, the
Care Council for Wales and the Scottish Social
Services Council are responsible for promoting
high standards of conduct and training for social
care workers by agreeing and issuing statutory
codes of practice, setting up a register of social
care workers, dealing with matters of conduct, and
regulating and supporting social work education
and training. All three bodies began registering
social care workers on a phased basis from April
2003, starting with qualified social workers.
Residential and nursing homes
Care homes provide a range of facilities for people
who cannot manage at home, and some are
registered to provide nursing care. Most care
homes are run by the independent sector. The cost
of care and accommodation is funded in a number
of ways: by the NHS where the person’s primary
need is for healthcare, by local authority social
services, or by the individual following a means
test. The details of such funding vary in each part
of the United Kingdom (see page 166).
Under the Care Standards Act 2000, national
minimum standards for care homes for people
aged 18-65 and for care homes for older people
came into force in England in 2002 and were
slightly amended in June 2003. The standards
cover such areas as choice of home, health and
personal care, daily life and social activities,
complaints and protection, environment, staffing,
management and administration. Broadly similar
standards apply in Wales and Scotland.

Pensions
In 2001/02 the State Retirement Pension was
received by around 11 million people (including
those living overseas) and accounted for
£42 billion of social security benefit expenditure.
In 2002/03, according to the Family Resources
Survey, 59 per cent of employees of working age
and 44 per cent of self-employed people of
working age were contributing to either an
occupational or a personal pension scheme or
both (see page 164).
State pensions
The basic State Retirement Pension (see page 161)
is based on NICs and is payable when people reach
state pension age, unless they choose to defer.
Under proposals in the Pensions Bill (see page 165),
those choosing to defer taking their pension by at
least a year will be able to take the deferred
pension as a lump sum instead of higher weekly
payments.
It is possible to build up an additional state
pension based on NICs and earnings. The State
Second Pension replaced the State Earnings-
Related Pension Scheme (SERFS) from 2002.
163
12 Social protection
UK 2005
The State Second Pension provides an additional
pension for low and moderate earners, and for
certain carers and people with a long-term illness
or disability who have not been able to make
contributions. Any SERFS entitlement that has
already been built up is protected, both for those
who have already retired and for those who have
not yet reached pensionable age.
Occupational pensions
An occupational pension scheme is an
arrangement that employers make to provide
pensions for their employees when they retire.
These schemes may also provide a tax-free lump
sum on retirement, and benefits for the dependants
of an employee if he or she dies. It is common for
both employer and employee to contribute, based
on a percentage of the employee’s earnings. All
employers with five or more employees are
required to provide their employees with access to
a stakeholder pension scheme if they do not
provide access to an occupational scheme or to a
personal pension with an employer contribution of
at least 3 per cent.
There are two main types of occupational pension
scheme:
■ final salary (sometimes known as defined
benefit) schemes, which offer a
predetermined level of pension benefit,
expressed as a fixed proportion of the
employee’s final salary for every complete year
as a scheme member. The scheme may give
members the option to convert part of the
pension to a tax-free lump sum or it may
specifically provide a separate tax-free lump
sum; and
■ money purchase schemes, in which the
contributions of the employer and the
employee are invested. The size of the fund
depends on the amount of these contributions
and the performance of the investment. When
an employee retires or leaves the scheme, he or
she can receive a proportion of the fund as a
tax-free lump sum, while the remainder must
be used to purchase an annuity (an
arrangement by which a life assurance
company pays a regular income, usually for
life, in return for a lump-sum premium).
Personal and stakeholder pensions
Personal pensions are provided through financial
services companies, such as insurance companies,
banks, investment companies and building
societies. Employers may make contributions in
addition to those of employees. The money in the
fund is invested to provide a pension when the
owner retires.
Stakeholder pensions are a form of personal
pension introduced by the Government to provide
a pension option for people who do not have
access to a good occupational or personal pension.
Regulations provide that transfers can be made
without charge from one stakeholder pension to
another arrangement (including a different
stakeholder) and for people to vary the amount
they contribute to the scheme.
Regulation
The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority
(Opra) is the regulator of pension arrangements
offered by employers in the United Kingdom and
seeks to ensure that pension schemes comply with
the legislation.
Opra’s Pension Schemes Registry maintains a
register of UK tax-approved occupational and
personal pension schemes. It also offers a service,
which will be taken over by the DWP in April
2005, for tracing pension schemes when people
have lost touch.
The Government has announced that Opra will be
replaced by a new Pensions Regulator in April
2005 (see page 165).
The Office of the Pensions Advisory Service gives
help and advice to people who have problems with
state, company, personal or stakeholder pensions
and has a telephone helpline. The Pensions
Ombudsman deals with complaints of
maladministration against occupational and
personal pension schemes and adjudicates on
disputes.
Pension reform
As people are living longer, the pensions industry
is required to support a greater number of
pensioners for longer periods. This increased
pressure on pension funds has been exacerbated in
recent years by falling share prices - pension funds
generally rely on financial stock market returns to
pay policyholders. As a result, many employers
have closed their final salary schemes to new
employees, increased employee contributions or,
in a few cases, wound up existing schemes. There
164
UK 2005
12 Social protection
have also been some instances where employees
have lost pension rights when their employer went
out of business.
In June 2003, following an independent review
and a Green Paper, the Government published
Simplicity, security and choice: Working and
saving for retirement: Action on Occupational
Pensions. This was followed in February 2004
by the introduction of the Pensions Bill, which
is designed to protect members of pension
schemes through a number of measures,
including:
■ a Pension Protection Fund for defined
benefit pension schemes in the United
Kingdom which will protect the pension
rights of members of underfunded pension
schemes whose employers have become
insolvent; and
■ a new Pensions Regulator from April 2005,
with a legal framework that will enable it
to tackle the areas of greatest risk to
members’ benefits and powers to educate
and advise those who administer or advise
on pensions.
In an amendment to the Bill in May 2004 the
Government proposed a £400 million fund to help
workers who have already lost their pensions. It
will pay the money over a 20-year period to assist
people who lost their pension when their
employer went out of business. Stakeholders will
be consulted on how the fund will operate.
Simplicity, security and choice: Informed choices for
working and saving, published in February 2004,
contains proposals that would help people to make
informed choices about saving and could equip
them to plan better for financial security in
retirement.
Other financial support
In addition to the State Retirement Pension,
people aged 60 or over are eligible for other
benefits. For those on low incomes, the Pension
Credit (see page 161) replaced the Minimum
Income Guarantee in October 2003.
Most people aged 60 or over are entitled to a
Winter Fuel Payment of up to £200 for each
eligible household. A further payment of up to
£100 is paid to households that include someone
aged 80 or over. From 2004/05, a new Age-Related
Payment is being paid with the Winter Fuel
Payment to people aged 70 or over, to help with
council tax bills and other expenses.
Free NHS prescriptions and eye tests are provided
to those aged 60 or over. People receiving Pension
Credit can also get free NHS dental treatment,
wigs and fabric supports, vouchers towards the
cost of glasses or contact lenses, and refunds of
necessary travel costs to hospitals for NHS
treatment (including check-ups). Pensioners aged
75 or over can claim a free television licence.
Across the United Kingdom older people are
entitled to free travel or concessionary fares on
public transport (see page 330).
Care services for older people
Some £6.9 billion was spent by English local
authorities on older people in 2002/03, 45 per cent
of their total spending on personal social services
(Figure 12.2).
Domiciliary care
Wherever possible, services are designed to help
older people live at home. These services may
include domestic help, the provision of meals in
the home, sitters-in, night attendants and laundry
services, as well as direct payments, day centres,
lunch clubs and recreational facilities.
In England 661,000 older people (8.4 per cent of
all people aged 65 or over) were being helped to
live at home by local authorities at the end of
March 2003. Gross expenditure on day and home
care provision for older people amounted to
almost £2 billion in 2002/03.
In Northern Ireland, around 22,000 older people
(9.6 per cent of people aged 65 or over) were
receiving home care services at 31 March 2003.
During 2002/03, over £92 million was spent on
day and home care for older people, and just over
11 million hours of home help and home care
were provided.
Residential care
According to the 2001 Census nearly 324,000
people over retirement age were living in
residential care or nursing homes in Great Britain,
and around 19,000 were living in medical and care
establishments in Northern Ireland. Residents who
need regular and frequent care from a registered
nurse are cared for in homes that are registered to

provide nursing care. In England, residents’ care
and accommodation is funded by the NHS (where
the person’s primary need is for healthcare), by
social services or by the individual following a
means test.
The Welsh Assembly Government has
implemented a policy to ensure that the services of
a registered nurse are free of charge in all care
settings. Funding has been set at £100 a week for
each self-funder who is assessed as needing
nursing care. Similar arrangements, with funding
up to £100 apply in Northern Ireland.
In Scotland, the Community Care and Health
(Scotland) Act 2002 provides for free personal care,
and for free nursing care in care homes that
provide nursing. The Act allows people to make
top-up payments if they wish to enter more
expensive accommodation than the local authority
would normally pay for (they may also defer these
payments until their home is sold after death).
Families and children
Financial support
CTC and WTC (see page 161) provide financial
support for children and their families. The level
of CTC was increased by 13 per cent in April 2004
in order to try to reduce child poverty.
All pregnant employees have a right to 26 weeks’
ordinary maternity leave and most can take a
further 26 weeks’ additional maternity leave.
Statutory Maternity Pay is paid directly from the
employer for a maximum of 26 weeks to women
who have been working for the same employer for
26 weeks and who earn on average at least £79 a
week. It is paid at a rate equal to 90 per cent of
their average weekly earnings for the first 6 weeks
and a standard rate of £102.80 a week for the
remaining 20 weeks, or at the 90 per cent rate if
average earnings are less than £102.80.
Women who are not eligible for Statutory
Maternity Pay because, for example, they are self-
employed or have recently changed jobs or left
their job, may qualify for a weekly Maternity
Allowance, which is paid for up to 26 weeks at a
standard rate of £102.80, or at a rate equal to
90 per cent of their average weekly earnings if
this is less than £102.80.
Fathers who have 26 weeks’ service with their
employer have a right to two weeks’ paternity leave
within eight weeks of the child’s birth. Those whose
average weekly earnings are at least £79 per week
qualify for Statutory Paternity Pay, which is paid at
the same standard rate as Statutory Maternity Pay -
£102.80 per week (or 90 per cent of average weekly
earnings if this is less than £102.80).
Employees who adopt a child have a right to take
52 weeks’ adoption leave and receive Statutory
Adoption Pay for 26 weeks, paid at the same rate
as Statutory Maternity Pay. To qualify, they must
have worked for their employer for 26 weeks.
Where a couple adopt jointly, they can choose
166
UK 2005
12 Social protection
which one of them will take adoption leave and
pay. The other may take paternity leave and may
qualify for Statutory Paternity Pay if their average
weekly earnings are at least £79.
Subject to certain qualifying requirements, both
mothers and fathers are entitled to 13 weeks’
unpaid parental leave before the child’s 5th
birthday. Parents of disabled children can take
18 weeks before the child’s 18th birthday. Parents
of children aged under 6 and parents of disabled
children aged under 18 have the right to request
flexible working patterns. Employers have a duty
to consider these requests and may only refuse on
business grounds (see also page 146).
A Child Trust Fund will be set up in April 2005.
The fund will provide every child born after
September 2002 with an initial endowment at
birth of £250 (or £500 for the poorest families).
Parents, family members and friends will be
able to make additional contributions, up to an
annual limit of £1,200. Children will be able
to access their accounts when they reach the
age of 18.
Child Support Agency
The function of the Child Support Agency (CSA)
is to ensure that parents who live apart meet their
financial responsibilities to their children. The
Northern Ireland Child Support Agency has a
similar role. Both agencies:
■ assess claims for child support maintenance;
■ trace and contact non-resident parents;
■ help conclude paternity disputes when a man
denies he is a child’s father;
■ calculate child maintenance; and
■ arrange, collect and pass on maintenance
payments to the parent who is caring for the
child, taking action to make the non-resident
parent pay if necessary.
In March 2003 the way that child support
payments are calculated was changed for new
applicants and for people whose case is linked to a
new application. The new scheme provides a
simpler system that is designed to get money to
more children more quickly. It enables non¬
resident parents to calculate their liability even
before the CSA has completed an assessment.
Other support for families and children
Local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland,
and HSS Trusts in Northern Ireland, are required to
safeguard and promote the welfare of any children
in need and, so far as is consistent with that, to
promote the upbringing of children by their parents.
The services provided to those with assessed needs
include advice, guidance, counselling, help in the
home and family centres. Help can be given to the
immediate family of the child or to any other
member of the family, if it is done with a view to
safeguarding and promoting the child’s welfare.
Local authorities can provide these services directly
or arrange them through another agency such as a
voluntary organisation. They are required to
publicise the help available to families in need.
Local authorities also help people fleeing domestic
violence, often working with specialist voluntary
organisations that provide refuges where women
and children receive short-term accommodation
and support, pending a more permanent solution.
In 2003 a Minister for Children, Young People and
Families was appointed, with responsibilities for a
broad range of policies and programmes to meet
the needs of children and young people in
England. The Children Bill (see page 168) contains
plans to create a Children’s Commissioner in
England. Wales already has a Children’s
Commissioner: Scotland and Northern Ireland
have Commissioners for Children and Young
People.
Sure Start
In England, the Sure Start Unit brings together a
number of programmes for children and families
- from pregnant mothers to children up to age 14
(or 16 for those with special needs). They include
universal, free part-time early education for three-
and four-year-olds, and childcare services such as
day nurseries, childminders, after-school clubs and
holiday schemes. Early education and childcare are
provided by the state, private and voluntary
sectors, often through local Sure Start programmes
and children’s centres in the most disadvantaged
communities.
In the 2004 Budget, the Government announced
increased funding for Sure Start programmes in
England, including early education and childcare,
in order to continue expanding services for young
children and families. Spending will rise by £669
million between 2004/05 and 2007/08.
167
12 Social protection
UK 2005
In Wales, Cymorth - the Children and Youth
Support Fund - provides support with the aim of
improving the life chances of children and young
people from disadvantaged families. Through Sure
Start Scotland, all 32 local authorities are funded
to work in partnership with health services and
voluntary organisations to identify need and
deliver services to vulnerable families with very
young children. The Scottish Executive is also
working towards an Integrated Strategy for the
Early Years covering from pre-birth to six-year-
olds and their families. In Northern Ireland, some
19,000 under-fours and their families have access
to Sure Start programmes.
Day care
Day care facilities are provided for children by day
nurseries, childminders, playgroups, and out of
school clubs, run privately or by voluntary
organisations or, in some cases, by local
authorities.
Children Bill
Following its Green Paper, Every Child Matters,
which was published in September 2003, the
Government introduced the Children Bill in March
2004. It contains measures that are intended to
protect children from harm, promote their
well-being and support all children to develop
their full potential. The proposals include:
■ a duty on agencies to co-operate to improve
the well-being of children and young people;
■ a duty on key agencies to safeguard children
through Local Safeguarding Children Boards;
■ a database with basic information about every
child;
■ a Director of Children's Services in every local
authority to ensure clear accountability;
■ enabling pooled budgets between health,
education and social care professionals;
■ an integrated inspection framework; and
■ an independent Children's Commissioner to
champion the views of children and young
people.
Many of the proposals will apply in Wales as well
as England.
The Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted)
(see page 140) is responsible for the regulation of
childminding and day care for children under
eight years of age in England. Its Early Years
Directorate registers and inspects childcare
provision and assesses its suitability on the basis of
National Standards which set minimum levels of
quality for day care.
In Wales, CSIW (see page 162) is responsible for
ensuring that childminders and providers of day
care for young people are suitable and that they
comply with regulations and national minimum
standards. The Care Commission is responsible for
regulating day care providers in Scotland. National
care standards for early education and childcare
aged up to 16 have been published, and HM
Inspectorate of Education and the Care
Commission operate an integrated inspection
regime in conjunction with these standards and
other key documents.
In Northern Ireland, the new Regulation and
Improvement Authority will take over the
regulation of day care providers and other
services, covering provision for children aged up
to 12, from local HSS Trusts. The Authority should
be fully operational by April 2005.
Child protection
Child protection is the joint concern of a number
of different agencies and professions. Local
authority-led area child protection committees
determine how the different agencies should co¬
operate to help protect children in their area from
abuse and neglect. The Children Bill (see box)
proposes that the committees will be superseded
by statutory Local Safeguarding Children Boards.
Local authority social services departments help
children who are in need, including those
considered to be at risk of significant harm, and
each department holds a register of children
considered to be at risk. There were around 32,700
children on child protection registers in the United
Kingdom at 31 March 2003.
In England and Wales a child may be brought
before a family proceedings court if he or she is
suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm.
The court can commit children to the care of the
local authority under a care order or a supervision
order. However, an order is made only if the court
is also satisfied that this will positively contribute
168
UK 2005
12 Social protection
to the child’s well-being and be in his or her best
interests. All courts have to treat the welfare of
children as the paramount consideration when
reaching any decision about their upbringing.
There is a general principle that, wherever
possible, children should remain at home with
their families.
In Scotland, children who have committed
offences or are in need of care and protection may
be referred to the Children’s Reporter. If
compulsory intervention is needed, the child will
be brought before a Children’s Hearing, which can
impose a supervision requirement on a child. In
some cases, this requirement will be conditional
on the child living away from home - for example
where the Hearing believes the child will receive
the right help or supervision from foster parents,
in a children’s home or at a special residence.
Supervision requirements are reviewed at least
once a year until ended by a Children’s Hearing.
The Scottish Executive carried out a review of the
Children’s Hearings system during 2004/05.
In September 2003 the Government published a
report, Keeping children safe. This was a response
to a review of arrangements for safeguarding
children and an inquiry into the death of an eight-
year-old girl at the hands of those caring for her.
The conclusions of the report have been taken into
account in the proposed changes to the child
protection regime in the Children Bill (see page
168).
In Scotland, a Child Protection Review, similarly
prompted by the death of a child, produced a
report, It’s Everyone’s Job to Make Sure I’m Alright,
in 2002. In response, the Scottish Executive
announced a number of measures including a
three-year reform programme for child protection
services, and a Framework for Standards in Child
Protection and a Children’s Charter, which were
launched in March 2004.
Fostering and children's homes
Local authorities and HSS Trusts in Northern
Ireland must provide accommodation for children
who have no parent or guardian, who have been
abandoned, or whose parents are unable to
provide for them. They have a duty to ensure that
the welfare of children being looked after away
from home is properly safeguarded. This includes
protecting their health, providing for their
education and ensuring contact with their
families. As far as possible they work in
partnership with the parents of children who are
in their care.
When a child in local authority care is the subject
of a care order imposed by the court, the local
authority shares legal responsibility for that child
with their parents. Although it consults with the
child’s parents about where the child should live,
the local authority will usually be responsible for
deciding this, taking account of the child’s
circumstances, wishes and feelings. Children can
also enter care as a result of a voluntary agreement
between their parents and the local authority.
Children looked after under voluntary agreement
are referred to as ‘accommodated’.

Department for Education and Skills
Younger children are placed wherever possible
with foster carers, sometimes as a short-term
measure (for example when parents are
temporarily unable to look after their child
because of family illness) or, if necessary, for
longer periods. Children’s homes can be run by
local authorities, or by private or voluntary
organisations.
In the year ending 31 March 2003 there were some
41,100 children in foster care and 6,700 in
children’s homes in England (Table 12.6). In Wales
there were just over 4,500 children being looked
after by local authorities, the majority of whom
were in foster homes. In Scotland, just under
11,400 children were being looked after, of whom
14 per cent were in residential accommodation
169
12 Social protection
UK 2005
and the remainder were living at home with their
parents or elsewhere in the community. In
Northern Ireland, 2,400 children were being
looked after - 64 per cent in foster care and
12 per cent in childrens homes.
Local authorities in England and Wales have a
duty to assess and meet the needs of young people
leaving care. Each care leaver should have a written
plan (called a Pathway Plan) and the support of a
personal adviser. Local authorities must keep in
touch with care leavers and ensure they have access
to suitable accommodation.
All children’s homes and fostering services are
required to register with the CSCI (see page 162)
or its equivalent bodies in Scotland and Wales.
The CSCI is responsible for inspecting all
children’s homes to assess the quality of care
provided.
Adoption
There were 5,459 adoption orders in England and
Wales in 2002. An adoption order gives parental
responsibility for a child to the adopting parent(s)
and must be obtained by relatives and step-parents
seeking to adopt, as well as by non-relatives who
have been approved by an adoption agency.
Adoption orders can be granted to applicants by the
High Court, county courts and magistrates’ courts.
People who adopt a child may be eligible for time
off work and Statutory Adoption Pay (see page
166).
The Adoption and Children Act 2002 will
modernise the legal framework for domestic and
inter-country adoption in England and Wales.
The child’s welfare will be the paramount
consideration in all decisions to do with adoption.
Unmarried couples will be legally allowed to adopt
children together, as well as single people and
married couples. The Act also introduces new
restrictions on bringing a child into the United
Kingdom for adoption, on arranging adoptions
and on advertising children for adoption. The
restriction on advertising also applies in Scotland
and Northern Ireland. The Act is being
implemented gradually and should come fully into
force in September 2005.
The National Adoption Standards for England are
intended to ensure that children, prospective
adopters, adoptive parents and birth families
receive a consistent and high-quality adoption
service no matter where they live. The CSCI (see
page 162) is responsible for the registration and
inspection of voluntary adoption agencies and the
inspection of local authority adoption services in
England. The CSIW has similar responsibilities in
Wales, as has the Care Commission in Scotland.
Adoption standards are in place in Wales and
Scotland and standards for Northern Ireland will
be issued at a later date.
The Adoption Register for England and Wales
holds information on children waiting to be
adopted and approved adoptive families waiting to
adopt, and can suggest matches between children
and approved adopters. The aim is to tackle delays
in finding suitable adoptive families where a local
family cannot be found or the child needs to move
away from the area.
People with a sickness or
disability
According to the 2001 Census 10.9 million people,
or 18.5 per cent of the UK population, reported a
long-term illness, health problem or disability that
limited their daily activities or work.
The Disability Rights Commission aims to
eliminate discrimination against disabled people,
promote equal opportunities, encourage good
practice and advise the Government on the
operation of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995
(see page 111). The Equality Commission (see
page 110) has a similar role in Northern Ireland.
The Department of Health publication A Practical
Guide for Disabled People or Carers provides
information about services from government
departments and agencies, the NHS and local
government and voluntary organisations. The
Disability Unit in the DWP runs a website to
help disabled people learn more about their
rights and the relevant legislation for disabled
people in the United Kingdom. The Department
for Social Development in Northern Ireland
has produced a guide to public services for
people with disabilities and people over
pensionable age.
An initiative to help people with an illness or
disability to find work, Pathways to Work, is being
piloted in seven areas of England, Wales and
170
UK 2005
12 Social protection
Scotland with a budget of £1 billion over two and
a half years from 2002/03 to 2005/06. The
initiative provides:
■ early support from personal advisers,
including work-focused interviews and action
plans;
■ specialist programmes, including new
condition management (rehabilitation)
services provided jointly by Jobcentre Plus
and the NHS; and
■ greater financial incentives to work, including
a Return To Work Credit of £40 a week for
52 weeks for those finding a job that pays less
than £15,000 a year.
Disabled people benefit from a range of
concessions on public transport (see page 330).
They may also be eligible for WTC (which
replaced Disabled Person’s Tax Credit in April
2003) (see page 161) and cold weather payments.
People injured as part of activity in the Armed
Forces may be entitled to War Disablement
Pension (see page 174).
Care services for people with physical
disabilities
Local authority social services departments and
HSS Trusts in Northern Ireland help with social
rehabilitation and adjustment to disability. They
are required to identify the number of disabled
people in their area and to provide and publicise
services. These may include advice on personal
and social problems arising from disability, as well
as occupational, educational, social and recreational
facilities, either at day centres or elsewhere.
Other services may include minor adaptations to
homes such as ramps for wheelchairs, or bath rails,
the delivery of cooked meals, support with
personal care at home and direct payments with
which disabled people can purchase support to
meet their assessed need. Local housing authorities
Table 12.7 Main benefits available to sick and disabled people from April 2004
Statutory Sick Pay
Employers are responsible for paying this up to a maximum
of 28 weeks. There is a single rate of £66.15 a week for all
qualifying employees, provided their average gross weekly
earnings are at least £79.
Incapacity Benefit
Paid to people of working age who become sick or disabled
and stop working or looking for work as a result. Entitlement
begins when entitlement to Statutory Sick Pay ends or, for
those who do not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, from the
fourth day of sickness. Payments, which depend on age and
the length of illness, range from £55.90 to £74.15 a week.
Severe Disablement Allowance
A tax-free benefit for people who have not been able to
work for at least 28 weeks because of illness or disability
but who cannot get Incapacity Benefit because they have
paid insufficient NICs. The benefit is £44.80 a week, plus
additions of up to £15.55 depending on the person's age
when he or she became incapable of work. Additions for
adult dependants and for children may also be paid. In April
2001 this Allowance was abolished for new claims. From
that date, people aged 16 to 20, or 16 to 25 if they were in
education or training at least three months immediately
before age 20, can instead claim Incapacity Benefit without
having to satisfy the contribution conditions.
Disability Living Allowance
A non-contributory tax-free benefit to help severely
disabled people aged under 65 with extra costs incurred as
a result of disability. Entitlement is measured in terms of
personal care and/or mobility needs. There are two
components: a care component which has three weekly
rates - £58.80, £39.35 and £15.55 - and a mobility
component with two weekly rates, of £41.05 and £15.55.
It is payable to those aged three or over who have severe
difficulty walking, or aged five or over who need help
getting around.
Attendance Allowance (AA)
Paid to people who need help to look after themselves. It is
paid if a person becomes ill or disabled on or after his or
her 65th birthday and needs help for at least six months.
There are different rates depending on whether the
claimant needs care during the day, during the night, or
both, and on the extent of the disability. AA ranges from
£39.35 to £58.80 a week depending on circumstances and
is not normally affected by savings or income.
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit
For people who have been disabled by an accident at work
or through a prescribed disease caused by a particular type
of employment. The rate is between £14.71 and £120.10 a
week depending on the level of disablement and age.
171
12 Social protection
UK 2005
provide assistance with major adaptations such as
stairlifts and ground-floor toilets. Alternatively,
local authorities and voluntary organisations may
provide severely disabled people with residential
accommodation, either on a permanent basis or
temporarily in order to relieve their existing carers.
Special housing may be available for those able to
look after themselves.
Services for people with learning
disabilities
In England, the Government’s policies for
improving services for people with learning
disabilities, their families and carers were set out in
Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning
Disability for the 21st Century, published in 2001.
Learning Disability Partnership Boards have been
set up in local council areas to take forward the
Valuing People programme at local level. Until
2006 there will be a team of regionally based
workers providing support to Partnership Boards
and sharing good practice.
In Scotland, the Scottish Executive is working with
local agencies through Partnerships in Practice
agreements to improve the lives of people with
learning disabilities in line with its review, The
same as you?, published in 2000.
Social services departments and HSS Trusts in
Northern Ireland can provide or arrange short¬
term care, support for families in their own
homes, residential accommodation and support
for various types of activity outside the home.
People with learning disabilities may also be able
to receive direct payments from local authorities
to let them buy for themselves the support that
will meet their assessed needs. The aim is to
ensure that, as far as possible, people with learning
disabilities can lead full lives in the community.
The NHS provides specialist services when the
ordinary primary care services cannot meet
healthcare needs.
People with a mental health problem
Under the Care Programme Approach in England,
each service user should receive an assessment
leading to an agreed care plan. A care coordinator
is appointed to keep in contact with the service
user, and review the plan regularly in the light
of the individual’s changing needs. The separate
Welsh Mental Health Strategy employs many of
the same principles in delivering services in Wales.
In Scotland, each NHS board works with its local
authority care partners, with users of mental
health services and with their carers in order
to develop joint strategies and provide local and
comprehensive mental health services. These
plans are expected to conform to the Framework
for Mental Health Services and to comply with
standards set by Quality Improvement Scotland.
The Mental Health (Care and Treatment)
(Scotland) Act 2003 aims to provide more
appropriate services and rights for people with
mental health problems who receive compulsory
treatment. The Act will be implemented before
2005. Meanwhile, the Scottish Executive is
working on a Code of Practice and other
guidance. Northern Ireland has an integrated
health and social services structure allowing
a multi-disciplinary approach to care
management.
Arrangements made by social services authorities
for providing care in the community include
direct payments, home help, day centres, social
centres and residential care. Social workers are
increasingly being integrated with mental health
staff in community mental health teams under
single management. Help may be provided to
find housing, secure an adequate income, and
sustain basic daily living - shopping, cooking,
and washing. In certain circumstances social
workers can apply for a person with a mental
disorder to be compulsorily admitted to and
detained in hospital. There are safeguards for
patients to ensure that the law is used
appropriately.
Unemployed people
Claimants for Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) must be
capable of, available for, and actively seeking work.
They must normally be aged at least 18 and under
pension age. JSA can be either contribution-based
or income-based:
■ Contribution-based JSA is available to those
who have paid sufficient NICs. They are
entitled to a personal JSA for up to six
months (£53.95 a week from April 2004 for a
person aged 25 or over), regardless of any
savings or partner’s income.
■ Income-based JSA: those on a low income are
entitled to an income-based JSA, payable for
as long as the jobseeker requires support and
continues to satisfy the qualifying conditions.
172
UK 2005
12 Social protection
Help with travel arrangements
Local authorities have a duty to provide transport
to and from social services facilities, such as day
centres. An Audit Commission report in 2001
estimated that local authorities in England and
Wales were spending over £150 million a year on
such transport. Some 63,000 adults in England had
help with transport as part of their community care
service during 2002/03. Arrangements vary, and
include the use of dedicated coaches, buses,
minibuses, taxis and hired cars.
Non-emergency patient transport services are
available to take people to and from outpatient
appointments and clinics and for non-urgent
transfers between hospitals. They are free of charge
where there is a medical need. There are about
14 million non-emergency patient journeys in
ambulances each year. According to the government
report on Transport and Social Exclusion, Making the
Connections, over 1.4 million people miss their
appointments or do not use healthcare services
because of transport problems. The report called for
an expansion of the criteria for patient transport
services, to include medical, mobility, transport and
financial grounds.
People on low incomes can get help with travel to
hospital for treatment through the Hospital Travel
Grants Scheme. Community Care Grants are
available from the Social Fund (see page 174) to
help people with travel costs to visit a relative in
hospital.
The Scottish Executive is funding four pilot schemes
for demand-responsive transport in urban areas.
One of them, operating in four areas of Glasgow,
will help people who have travel difficulties and
those on low incomes to attend health
appointments and visit patients in hospital.
 J
The amount a claimant receives comprises an
age-related personal allowance (£55.65 a week
from April 2004 for a single person aged 25 or
over), plus other allowances. Some allowances
are determined by circumstances on a basis
similar to Income Support (see page 161).
Recipients of JSA and people aged under 60 who
receive Income Support can benefit from a Back to
Work Bonus. The aim of this scheme is to
encourage people to keep in touch with the labour
market by undertaking small amounts of work
while claiming benefit. It allows people to accrue a
tax-free lump sum of between £5 and £1,000 if
working part-time while in receipt of Income
Support or JSA. There are a number of other
financial benefits for unemployed people to help
them back into employment, including various
New Deals (see chapter 11).
People on low incomes
People on low incomes can claim Income Support
or, for those over 60, Pension Credit (see box
on page 161). In 2002/03 there were around
4.1 million people receiving Income Support in
the United Kingdom. Other benefits for which
unemployed people and those on low incomes
may be eligible include exemption from NHS
charges, vouchers towards the cost of spectacles,
publicly funded legal help and free school meals
for their children. People on low incomes,
pensioners, widows, widowers and long-term sick
people on Incapacity Benefit may be eligible for
extra help to meet the cost of value added tax
(VAT) on their fuel bills.
Housing Benefit is an income-related, tax-free
benefit which helps people on low incomes meet
the cost of rented accommodation. The amount
paid depends on personal circumstances, income,
savings, rent and whether other people are sharing
the home. It also normally depends on the general
level of rents for properties with the same number
of rooms in the locality. Most single people aged
under 25 who are not lone parents and who are
renting privately have their Housing Benefit
limited to the average cost of a single non-self-
contained room (that is, with shared use of
kitchen and toilet facilities) in the locality.
Council Tax Benefit helps people to meet their
council tax payments (the tax set by local councils
to help pay for services - see page 376). The
173
12 Social protection
UK 2005
scheme offers help to those claiming Income
Support and income-based JSA and others with
low incomes. In Northern Ireland, where council
tax was not introduced, Housing Benefit helps
with the cost of rent and/or rates.
The Social Fund provides payments in the form of
loans or grants to help with expenses which are
difficult to meet on a low income. These payments
can be:
■ budgeting loans for intermittent expenses;
■ community care grants to help, for example,
people resettle into the community from care,
or to remain in the community, to ease
exceptional pressure on families, to set up
home as part of a planned resettlement
programme or to meet certain travel
expenses; and
■ crisis loans to help people in an emergency or
as a result of a disaster where there is serious
risk to health or safety.
Budgeting loans and community care grants are
available only to people who are receiving social
security benefits and some tax credits.
Asylum seekers receive limited cash benefits and
may qualify for other services (see page 106).
Widows and widowers
Bereavement Payment is a one-off payment to
widows aged under 60, and widowers aged under
65 - or those aged 60/65 or over whose spouses
were not entitled to a basic State Retirement
Pension when they died. It is payable provided the
spouse paid a minimum number of NICs.
Widowed Parent’s Allowance is a regular payment
for widows or widowers bringing up children. It is
based on the late spouse’s NICs and continues
while the children are still dependent.
Bereavement Allowance is a regular payment, also
based on the late spouse’s NICs, which is payable
for 52 weeks to widows and widowers aged 45 or
over who are not bringing up children.
A number of charities and voluntary organisations
advise and support people who have been
bereaved. A consortium of some of the leading
bodies has published a set of national standards
for bereavement care.
War pensioners
The Veterans Agency is part of the Ministry of
Defence (MoD). It provides advice and help with
new and ongoing claims for war disablement
pensions and war widows’ and widowers’
pensions. In addition, the Agency is the single
point of contact within the MoD for providing
information and advice on issues of concern to
veterans and their families.
The War Pensioners’ Welfare Service, through
working closely with ex-Service organisations and
other statutory and voluntary organisations,
provides a comprehensive advice and support
service for all war pensioners and war widows and
widowers living in the United Kingdom and the
Republic of Ireland.
In Great Britain there were approximately 260,000
beneficiaries of War Disablement and War
Widow’s/Widower’s Pensions in 2003. The
majority are Second World War veterans, but there
are also small numbers of First World War
veterans, ex-National Servicemen and those
disabled in more recent conflicts. War Disablement
Pension is payable to ex-members of the Armed
Forces as a result of disability due to Service. It
also can be claimed by, among others, civilians,
merchant seamen and members of the Polish
forces under British command, although special
conditions apply in these cases. War
Widow’s/Widower’s Pension is payable to widows
and widowers of ex-members of the Armed Forces
where death is due to or hastened by Service.
There are proposals for a new Armed Forces
Pension Scheme and a new compensation scheme
for those killed or injured in service, to replace the
current schemes with effect from 2005/06.
Arrangements with other
countries
As part of the European Union’s efforts to
promote the free movement of labour, regulations
provide for equality of treatment and the
protection of benefit rights for people who move
between Member States. The regulations also cover
retired pensioners and other beneficiaries who
have been employed, or self-employed, as well as
dependants. Benefits covered include Child Benefit
and those for sickness, maternity, unemployment,
174

retirement, invalidity, accidents at work and
occupational diseases. The Government
introduced special measures for nationals of most
of the ten countries that joined the European
Union in May 2004. Workers from these countries
(excluding Malta and Cyprus) are able to take up
employment in the United Kingdom provided that
they are registered under a new workers’
registration scheme. If they enter the United
Kingdom in the hope of finding employment they
are not entitled to income-related benefits.
The United Kingdom has reciprocal social security
agreements with a number of other countries that
also provide cover for some national insurance
benefits and family benefits.

The state of public health
Over the past century major social and economic
trends such as improvements in nutrition and
housing, advances in medicine and technology,
and the development of health services that are
freely available to all have led to significant
improvements in the nation’s health. In 1901,
males born in the United Kingdom could expect
to live to around 45 years of age and females to
around 49. By 2002 life expectancy at birth had
increased to 76 and 81 years respectively.
Declines in infant mortality have contributed to
the increases in life expectancy over the past
century. In 1921, 84.0 children per 1,000 live births
in the United Kingdom died before the age of one;
by 2002 the rate was 5.2 per 1,000 (Figure 13.1).
Cancer
About a third of people in the United Kingdom
will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime
and about a quarter will die from the disease. As
average life expectancy has risen, the population at
risk of cancer has grown, with two-thirds of cases
occurring in those aged over 65. There are over
200 different types of cancer but the four major
types - lung, colorectal, breast and prostate -
account for over half of all cases diagnosed.
Since the mid-1970s there has been a steep decline
in the death rate for lung cancer among males
(Figure 13.2). This can be closely linked to the
proportion of the population who smoke (see
Figure 13.5). In contrast, the lung cancer death
rate among females continued to rise until 1988,
since when there has been little change. The death
rate for females is still only half that for men, but

the difference between the sexes has narrowed
considerably.
Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer
death among women. Death rates peaked in the
late 1980s but have since fallen steadily and now
only just exceed the rate for lung cancer. The
improvement can be linked to advances in
treatment and to the introduction of a national
screening programme (see page 192). For prostate
cancer, which only affects men, the death rate
peaked in 1992 but has since declined. Since the
mid-1990s, prostate cancer has been the second
most common cause of cancer death among men.
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause
of cancer death among both males and females.
176
UK 2005
13 Health
Figure 13.2 Death rates from selected cancers,1 UK
Rates per 100,000 population
Males Females
Death rates have gradually declined since 1976, by
28 per cent among males and 44 per cent among
females, widening an existing gap between the
sexes in death rates for this form of cancer.
diseases were 7,000 per million males and 4,300
per million females. By 2003 the death rates had
fallen by over half for both sexes, to 3,100 and
1,900 respectively.
Survival rates from lung cancer are low compared
with the other most common cancers. For those
diagnosed with lung cancer in England and Wales
between 1996-99, the five-year survival rate
(adjusted for overall levels of mortality from other
causes in the general population) for both men
and women was around 6 per cent. Cancers with
the highest five-year survival rates included:
melanoma, at 77 per cent for men and 87 per cent
for women, female breast cancer at 78 per cent,
prostate cancer at 65 per cent and cervical cancer
at 61 per cent.
Circulatory disease
The United Kingdom has one of the highest
premature death rates from circulatory disease
(which includes heart disease and strokes) in
Europe. A number of risk factors have been
identified, including smoking, obesity, drinking
alcohol and lack of regular exercise. Over the past
30 years, while circulatory diseases have remained
the most common cause of death among males
and females of all ages in the United Kingdom,
they have also shown by far the greatest decline. In
1973, age-standardised death rates from circulatory
Chronic diseases
In the United Kingdom, there are some 17.5
million people living with chronic conditions like
diabetes and asthma. People with chronic diseases
account for up to 80 per cent of GP consultations
in England, around 180 million visits a year. In
March 2004 the Department of Health (DH)
announced that a specialist team would be set up
at a demonstration site within each of the 28
Strategic Health Authority (SHA) areas.
Infectious diseases
Although diseases such as measles, tuberculosis
(TB) and whooping cough became far less
common during the last century, they can still give
cause for concern. Between 1993 and 1994 for
example, measles registrations nearly doubled,
from 12,000 to 23,500, before the underlying
downward trend resumed. In 2002 the number of
cases of measles notified in the United Kingdom
was 3,700. In contrast notifications of TB have
increased quite steadily since 1987 and the disease
is now more common than either measles or
whooping cough. In 2002 there were around 7,200
177
13 Health
UK 2005
cases, compared with 6,100 in 1991. The rise has
been particularly noticeable in London, with a TB
notification rate of 39 per 100,000 population in
2002, compared with 15 per 100,000 in the West
Midlands (which had the next highest rate), and
just 4 per 100,000 in Northern Ireland.
Immunisation
Government targets are for 95 per cent of children
to be immunised by the age of two against
diphtheria, tetanus, polio, whooping cough,
Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib), meningitis C and
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). In recent
years, publicity questioning the safety of the MMR
combined vaccine has led to a fall in the proportion
of children immunised. In 2002/03, 82 per cent of
children in the United Kingdom had received the
vaccine, compared with 91 per cent in 1991/92.
Although regional variations were generally small,
the figure in London was 72 per cent.
Vaccination against influenza is intended
primarily for people in high risk groups, which
include those with chronic heart disease, lung
disease, renal disease or diabetes. Older people are
vulnerable to influenza, and a free National Health
Service (NHS) vaccination is available to everyone
aged 65 and over. The extension of free
vaccination and a national advertising campaign
have been major factors in the increased uptake
among this group. In 2002/03 nearly 70 per cent of
over-65s in England were vaccinated.
MRSA
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) is a hospital-acquired infection which is
resistant to treatment by penicillin and methicillin
antibiotics. There is currently no known vaccine,
although a new drug is currently under trial in
the United Kingdom. MRSA was first identified in
1961, the same year that methicillin came into
use. Reports of MRSA bloodstream infections
have increased significantly since the mid-1990s
and a recent study has shown that between 1993
and 2002 the number of deaths involving MRSA
in England and Wales rose from 51 to 800. This
was matched by an increase in laboratory reports
of MRSA bacteraemia, from 210 in 1993 to
5,310 in 2002. Steps to tackle MRSA and other
'superbugs' are described on page 184.
Sexually transmitted infections
Diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections made
in genito-urinary medicine clinics in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland have been increasing,
especially among young people. In 2003, genital
chlamydia was the most common sexually
transmitted infection diagnosed, with just over
89,800 cases. This was 9 per cent more than in
2002 and more than double the 34,100 cases in
1996.
Since 1996 the number of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) diagnoses in the
United Kingdom has risen each year. The
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre
reported that by the end of 2002 the estimated
number of people living with HIV in the United
Kingdom was 49,500, an increase of
20 per cent compared with 2001. In 2003, 6,600
new HIV cases were diagnosed (Figure 13.3). By
contrast, the numbers of AIDS diagnoses and
deaths in HIV-infected individuals declined after
the introduction of effective therapies in the mid-
1990s, and in more recent years have remained
relatively constant, with 766 reports of AIDS and
475 deaths reported for 2003.

Substance misuse
Alcohol
The consumption of alcohol in excessive amounts
can lead to an increased likelihood of problems
178
UK 2005
13 Health
such as high blood pressure, cancer and cirrhosis
of the liver. DH advice is that consumption of
three or four units' a day for men and two or three
units a day for women should not lead to
significant health risks. Consistently drinking
more than this is not advised. In 2002/03, 38 per
cent of men and 23 per cent of women in Great
Britain exceeded the recommended amount of
alcohol on at least one day in the week before
being interviewed (Table 13.4).
In 1974, 51 per cent of men and 41 per cent of
women in Great Britain reported that they were
regular cigarette smokers. By 2002/03 this had
fallen to 27 per cent of men and 25 per cent of
women (Figure 13.5). The figures for Northern
Ireland were 35 per cent of men and 32 per cent of
women in 1986, falling to 27 per cent and 26 per
cent respectively by 2002. Measures to encourage a
further reduction are described on page 196.

Alcohol-related deaths in England and Wales have
been rising for years. Between 1979 and 2000 the
number more than doubled, from 2,506 to 5,543.
Of the deaths in 2000, 85 per cent were due to
chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. In 2000 the
age-standardised rate for alcohol-related deaths
among men was 13 per 100,000 population,
almost twice the rate among women (7 per
100,000). Services to combat alcohol misuse are
described on page 196.
Smoking
More cancer deaths in the United Kingdom can be
attributed to smoking tobacco than to any other
single risk factor. Over the past 30 years, the
reduction in lung cancer deaths can be closely
linked to the fall in the proportion of the
population who smoke.
1 A unit of alcohol is 8 grams by weight or 10 millilitres (ml) by
volume of pure alcohol. This is the amount contained in half a pint
of ordinary strength beer or lager, a single measure of pub spirits
(25 ml), one glass of ordinary wine or a small pub measure of
sherry or other fortified wine.
In Great Britain in 2002/03, 20 per cent of men
and 18 per cent of women in the managerial and
professional group smoked, compared with 32 per
cent and 31 per cent respectively among the
routine and manual group. The differences in
Northern Ireland were even more marked. In
2002, men in semi-skilled manual occupations
were twice as likely to smoke as professional men
(33 per cent compared with 17 per cent). Women
in semi-skilled manual occupations were three
times as likely to smoke as professional women
(35 per cent compared with 11 per cent).

Drugs
Results from the 2002/03 British Crime Survey
(see page 204) indicate that 16 per cent of men
and 9 per cent of women aged 16 to 59 in
England and Wales had taken an illicit drug in
the previous year. Young people are more likely
179
13 Health
UK 2005
than older people to use drugs. The most
commonly used drug in 2002/03 among those
aged 16 to 24 years was cannabis. Cocaine and
ecstasy were the most commonly used Class A
drugs (see glossary) among those aged 16 to 59.
Since 1996 there has been an increase in the use
of cocaine among young people, especially among
young men. In contrast, the use of amphetamines
has declined.
In 2002 there were almost 2,700 deaths due to
drug-related poisoning in England and Wales, a
7 per cent fall compared with 2001. Almost 70 per
cent of these deaths were among males. Heroin
and/or morphine were involved in 790 deaths;
more than any other drug, but the lowest figure
since 1999. In contrast, the number of deaths
involving methadone remained relatively stable at
just over 200, while deaths involving cocaine rose
to their highest recorded level of almost 140.
Continuing recent trends, deaths involving
paracetamol fell to their lowest recorded level of
around 460. Measures to prevent the misuse of
drugs are described on page 196.
Diet and nutrition
The DH recommends that a healthy diet should
include at least five portions of a variety of fruit
and vegetables (excluding potatoes) a day. The
2000-01 National Diet and Nutrition Survey
showed that only 13 per cent of men and 15 per
cent of women aged 19 to 64 in Great Britain were
consuming this amount on an average daily basis.
The proportion of men and women eating the
recommended amount increased with age. Less
than 5 per cent of men and women aged 19 to 24
were consuming an average five or more portions
a day, compared with 24 per cent of men and 22
per cent of women aged 50 to 64.
Obesity is linked to heart disease, diabetes and
premature death. The body mass index (BMI) is a
measure for assessing an individual’s weight
relative to their height, and a BMI score of over 30
is taken as the definition of obesity for adults aged
16 and over. In recent years the proportion of the
population who are obese or overweight has been
rising. In 2002, 22 per cent of men and 23 per cent
of women aged 16 and over in England were
classified as obese. A further 43 per cent of men
and 34 per cent of women were overweight
(Figure 13.6).

The National Health Service
The NHS was created in 1948 to provide
healthcare for the UK resident population, based
on need, not the ability to pay. It is made up of a
range of health professionals, support workers and
organisations. The NHS is funded by taxation and
is accountable to Parliament. All taxpayers,
employers and employees contribute to the cost, so
that members of the community who do not
require healthcare help to pay for those who do.
Most forms of treatment are provided free, but
others, such as prescription drugs and eye tests,
may incur a charge.
In England the NHS is overseen by the DH, which
is responsible for developing and implementing
policies and for the overall regulation and
inspection of health services. The devolved
administrations have similar responsibilities in
other parts of the United Kingdom. The DH
represents UK health interests at an international
level, principally through the European Union
(EU) and the World Health Organisation.
NHS Direct
NHS Direct, a nurse-led telephone helpline, was
launched in England in 1998. It aims to provide
fast and convenient access to health information
and advice, helping people to care for themselves
and their families, when it is appropriate to do so,
180
UK 2005
13 Health
and directing them to the most appropriate level
of care when they need professional help. NHS
Direct Online (www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk), an Internet
extension of the telephone-based services, features
an electronic version of the NHS Direct self-help
guide, an encyclopedia of over 400 health topics
and an interactive enquiry service for health
information. By mid 2004, the telephone service
and the website were each receiving over 500,000
calls or visits every month.
Wales has a similar telephone and Internet service,
NHS Direct Wales (www.nhsdirect.wales.nhs.uk)
which offers advice in both English and Welsh.
The service in Scotland is known as NHS 24
(www. n hs24. com).
In April 2004 comprehensive health information
from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) was
launched on NHS Direct Online. ‘BMJ Best
Treatments’ provides information on the most
common health conditions including explanations
of elective surgery procedures, details of other
treatments available, and advice on pre- and post¬
operative care. It also offers information on the
choice of possible treatments for 60 chronic
conditions, ranking them according to effectiveness
and highlighting the risks and benefits of each.
Electronic initiatives
The NHS is making increasing use of new
technology in patient care and has a major
information technology (IT) development
programme. This is focusing on improving the IT
infrastructure and developing electronic national
services for prescriptions, patient records and
appointments.
NHSnet is a range of voice and data services used
by the NHS, covering radio, telephone and
computer-based communications. In February
2004 a £530 million, seven-year contract providing
broadband Internet access linking all NHS
organisations in England was awarded to BT.
The New National Network, also known as N3,
will enable transmission of voice and video
information as well as data such as emails, medical
information, test results and GP payment
information. The network will ensure secure
transmission of all confidential medical
information. An equivalent scheme, HPSSnet,
has been set up by Northern Ireland Health and
Personal Social Services (HPSS).
In the longer term, it is intended that NHSnet will
support electronic booking systems and replace
paper-based health records with electronic
versions. By 2010 the Government intends that
every patient in England will have an individual
electronic care record, containing a summary
of key personal and health data. The NHS Care
Records Service will connect more than 30,000
GPs and 270 acute, community and mental health
NHS Trusts (see page 183) in a single, secure
national system. It will be of particular use to
accident and emergency (A&E) staff who will be
able to access information about emergency
patients and help diagnose them more quickly.
The information on the NHS Care Records will
grow over time and eventually people will have
access to their own records, enabling them to be
more involved in making decisions about their
care and treatment.
The NHS in England
The Health and Social Care (Community Health
and Standards) Act 2003 legislated for the next
stage in the Government’s programme of NHS
reform and investment. Key provisions include:
■ the establishment of NHS Foundation Trusts
(see page 183), which enjoy new freedoms
and are locally accountable;
■ the establishment of two independent
regulators - the Commission for Healthcare
Audit and Inspection (CHAI - see page 198)
and the Commission for Social Care
Inspection (CSCI - see chapter 12, page 162);
■ recovery by the NHS of hospital treatment
and/or ambulance costs where patients have
received compensation for injuries;
■ a new duty on Primary Care Trusts (PCTs)
(see page 183) to provide or secure the
provision of primary dental services; and
■ the replacement of the Welfare Food Scheme
(see page 192).
Reducing health inequalities and avoidable ill
health are key aims in the Government’s health
strategy. The 2002 report, Securing Our Future
Health: Taking a Long-Term View, assessed the
resources required to provide high-quality health
services in the future. The report illustrated the
considerable difference in expected cost depending
on the extent to which people engaged in living
healthier lifestyles. In February 2004 a follow-up
report, Securing Good Health for the Whole
181
13 Health
UK 2005
Population, recommended that the Government
develops a more coherent strategy to reduce
preventable illness caused by unhealthy behaviour,
such as smoking and physical inactivity. Other
recommendations include:
■ HM Treasury should produce a framework
for the use of economic instruments in
relation to public health, such as tax credits
or a tax on unhealthy ingredients in food;
■ the Government should set consistent
national objectives to improve the nation’s
health; PCTs and other agencies should devise
local targets, based on national objectives but
taking account of local needs;
■ the cost-effectiveness of public health
strategies and treatments should be evaluated;
■ measures of productivity in the NHS should
move away from narrow definitions of
output, to overall measures of health
outcomes, and compare the effectiveness of
prevention and cure; and
■ an annual report on the state of the nation’s
health should be produced.
The Government welcomed the report and said it
proposed to build on it through a formal public
consultation exercise and a White Paper to be
published later in the year. The consultation
document, Choosing Health? set out a number of
issues for debate, including smoking in public
places; encouraging walking; access to fruit and
vegetables; food labelling; preventing and treating
sexually transmitted infections; and healthy
workplaces. Members of the public were able to
take part in the consultation through media polls
and through the DH website.
The Government also aims to increase the choice
patients have over when, where and how they are
treated. In December 2003 it published Building on
the Best. Plans include:
■ giving patients a choice of provider for
planned surgery;
■ making it possible for patients to get repeat
prescriptions from their pharmacist without
having to go back to their GP;
■ expanding the range of medicines available
over the counter without prescription;
■ developing new ways for people to receive
primary care, such as at nurse-led clinics; and
■ making it easier for patients to receive
treatment that best suits their lifestyle - for
example, allowing commuters to register with
a GP near their workplace.
In line with the policy of devolving more power
and responsibility to front-line organisations and
staff there will be fewer national performance
targets over the three-year period from 2004,
allowing flexibility for local targets to meet local
needs. In July 2004 the DH published National
standards, local action: health and social care
standards and planning framework 2005/06 -
2007/08. The document sets out 24 core healthcare
standards that all providers of care to NHS patients
have to meet, covering the seven key areas: safety;
clinical and cost-effectiveness; governance; patient
focus; accessible and responsive care; care
environment and amenities; and public health.
There are also ten developmental standards setting
out what providers should be seeking to achieve
over the coming years. The CHAI (see page 198)
will assess the performance of providers against
these standards.
Strategic Health Authorities
The health administration structure in England
came into effect in 2002. The NHS Reform and
Health Care Professions Act 2002 provided for
28 SHAs, with typical populations of between 1.5
and 2.4 million. They are responsible for creating a
framework for local health services, and for
NHS National Tariff
A National Tariff for clinical procedures was
introduced in April 2004 and will be phased in
throughout England by 2008. It means that
hospital trusts will be paid a fixed fee for each
type of operation, whether they treat the patient
themselves or purchase treatment from the
private sector. The tariff sets a fixed price (for
elective treatment) for 48 different procedures,
including:
■ cataract operation - £786;
■ heart valve surgery - £10,199;
■ heart bypass - £8,080;
■ hip replacement - £5,568;
■ hernia surgery - £956; and
■ knee replacement - £6,182.

building capacity, supporting performance
improvement and managing the performance of
PCTs and of NHS Trusts (though not NHS
Foundation Trusts - see below) in their areas.
Primary Care Trusts
Responsibility for deciding which health services
the local population needs and for ensuring the
provision of these services lies with the 303 local
PCTs across England. They are responsible for
providing all services, including hospitals, dentists,
mental health services, Walk-in Centres, NHS
Direct (see page 180), patient transport (including
A&E), population screening, pharmacies and
opticians, and for developing health improvement
programmes and seeing that local NHS
organisations work effectively with local
authorities and social services. In 2004/05, 81 per
cent of the total NHS budget will be controlled
by PCTs.
Care Trusts
Care Trusts are NHS bodies that work in both
health and social care and can be established
where NHS organisations and local authorities
agree to work together. A Care Trust is usually set
up where it is felt that closer integration between
health and social care is needed or would be
beneficial at a local level. Seven Care Trusts had
been established by August 2003.
NHS Trusts
NHS Trusts are the organisations responsible for
running most NHS hospitals. Although the
statutory functions of the Trusts were not changed
following NHS reorganisation, they are now
overseen by the SHAs.
NHS Foundation Trusts
The Health and Social Care (Community Health
and Standards) Act 2003 (see page 181) included
provision for the creation of NHS Foundation
Trusts. These are independent legal entities, owned
by their members (who include patients, staff and
local people). They are outside the DH’s
accountability and performance management
systems. Foundation Trusts are granted a licence to
operate by an independent regulator and are
controlled by a Board of Governors elected
annually by the members. Foundation Trusts have
greater powers and flexibility than traditional NHS
hospitals. In particular they may:
■ borrow from the private sector;
■ retain their surpluses and money from the
sale of land and assets; and
■ exercise a greater degree of flexibility in
setting pay and benefits packages.
Although Foundation Trusts will be able to raise
income by charging for the treatment of private
patients, their private work is limited by a cap on
the proportion of their income that can come
from private treatment. The licence given to each
Trust specifies which services it is required to
provide as a condition of its authorisation. This
list will initially mirror the clinical services
provided by the Trust at the time of its
establishment. In addition, service agreements
with PCTs will specify that the services provided
must comply with national quality and safety
standards. Foundation Trusts will be assessed
against national clinical and quality standards by
the CHAI (see page 198).
The first ten Foundation Trusts were established in
April 2004, with a further ten in July 2004. Only
NHS Trusts attaining three stars under the
Government’s star rating system are eligible to
apply for Foundation Trust status. However, the
Government hopes that over the next four to five
years all NHS Trusts will become Foundation
Trusts.
Walk-in Centres
NHS Walk-in Centres are a network of nurse-led
centres where no appointment is necessary. They
offer quick access to a range of services, including
healthcare advice and information, and treatment
for minor ailments and injuries. They are intended
to complement GP surgeries and reduce pressure
on GPs. Thirteen new centres were due to open in
2004/05, bringing the total number in England to
65. They are funded from a three-year £40 million
investment package announced in July 2003.
Health education
Established in 2000, the Health Development
Agency (HDA) works to improve the health of
people and communities in England, and to reduce
health inequalities. In partnership with others,
it gathers evidence of what works, advises on
standards and develops the skills of all those
working to improve health. Following a review
of the DH’s arm’s length bodies (see box, page 184)
it was announced in July 2004 that the functions
of the HDA would be taken on by the National
Institute for Clinical Excellence (see page 197).

Hospital 'superbug' action plan
In July 2004 the Government published plans to
improve cleanliness and reduce the level of
hospital-acquired infections such as MRSA (see
page 178). The measures include:
■ publishing hospitals' infection rates;
■ a new target for hospitals to reduce MRSA
rates year on year;
■ a national review of infection control and
cleanliness by the CHAI (see page 198);
■ cleanliness inspections by the patients'
forum in each Trust, four times a year;
■ putting matrons in charge of cleaning staff;
and
■ sharing national and international best
practice.
NHS and Independent Treatment Centres
NHS Treatment Centres provide pre-booked
surgery and diagnostic tests. They are a way of
increasing the number of routine operations the
NHS can perform in some of the specialities where
waiting times are longest.
By July 2004, 27 NHS-run Treatment Centres were
open, and a further 19 were in development. Two
independent Treatment Centres were also open.
There will be an estimated 80 Treatment Centres
by the end of 2005, treating an additional 250,000
patients a year.
The NHS in Wales
In Wales, the operation of the NHS is the
responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government,
which has the power to make changes to the
structure of the NHS in Wales through secondary
or ‘delegated’ legislation (see page 51). There are
22 Local Health Boards (LHBs) in Wales, which
replaced the five Health Authorities in April 2003.
The LHBs report to three regional offices within the
NHS Wales Department of the National Assembly.
A Health and Well-being Partnership Council,
chaired by the Health and Social Services Minister,
brings together key personnel from the NHS, local
government, the voluntary and independent
sectors, staff and professional groups, and patients’
Review of 'arm's length bodies'
The DH's arm's length bodies (ALBs) carry out a
wide range of regulatory, standard-setting and
public welfare functions, as well as providing
central services to the NHS. In October 2003 the
Secretary of State for Health announced a review
of these bodies. In July 2004 the report
Reconfiguring the Department of Health's Arm's
Length Bodies was published. This sets out the
Government's conclusions based on the review
and the input of the ALBs. Over time the number
of ALBs will be reduced from 38 to 20. By
2007/08 the Government anticipates savings in
expenditure of around £500 million and a
reduction in posts of around 25 per cent.
representatives, to ensure the direction and
leadership of the agenda for health and well-being.
The Council is supported by a network of similar
partnerships at a local level.
The Health (Wales) Act 2003 contains measures
aimed at giving patients more say in the running
of the NHS and providing information to protect
and improve public health in Wales. These include:
■ reform of the Community Health Councils
and powers for the establishment of an
Association of Welsh Community Health
Councils;
■ establishment of a Wales Centre for Health
(WCH); and
■ establishment of Health Professions Wales
(HPW).
WCH will bring together information and
evidence on public health issues, and provide
advice to policy makers. It will also lead the
development of multi-professional education and
training for public health, coordinate professional
surveillance of health trends and undertake risk
assessments of threats to health and well-being.
HPW was established in April 2004 to support
education and training for a range of healthcare
professions, including laboratory staff, nurses,
midwives, health visitors, physiotherapists and
radiographers.

Since devolution, the Welsh Assembly Government
has determined its own spending priorities for the
budget for the NHS in Wales. The planned health
budget for 2004/05 is £4.3 billion, an increase of
£1.7 billion on 1999/2000. Much of this additional
investment is being directed towards tackling the
priorities outlined in Improving Health in Wales
(published in 2001): coronary heart disease, cancer
services, mental health services, intensive care,
primary and community care, children’s services
and local priorities set out in Health Improvement
Programmes. Other measures will address waiting
lists and waiting times, pressures on admissions,
and human resource development for the NHS
workforce.
An Inequalities in Health Fund was established
in 2001 to stimulate and support new local action
to tackle factors that cause health inequalities,
including inequities in access to health services.
The Fund, which has concentrated on coronary
heart disease as its first priority, is supporting
more than 60 projects in disadvantaged
communities across Wales.
In 2003 Health Commission Wales was established
as an independent agency under the Welsh
Assembly Government. It has responsibility for
planning and commissioning specialised health
services, including cancer and cardiac services and
the Welsh Blood Service (see page 194). Funding
allocated to Health Commission Wales in 2004/05
was £403 million.
The NHS in Scotland
The Scottish Executive’s Health Department is
responsible for the leadership of NHSScotland and
for the development and implementation of health
and community care policy.
Scotland has 15 NHS Boards, each of which is
responsible for all NHS services in its area. The
Boards and 32 local authorities work together to
strengthen the local focus of health provision, and
every local authority has a seat on its principal
NHS BoWd. Other NHS bodies, such as the
Scottish Ambulance Service, NHS Health Scotland
and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (see page
197), provide services on a national basis.
In 2003 the Scottish Executive’s Health
Department published Improving Health in
Scotland - The Challenge. This outlined a
framework for the delivery of a more rapid rate of
health improvement in the four priority areas of:
■ early years - stressing the importance of
infant and child health to later life;
■ teenager transition - encouraging young
people to make healthy lifestyle choices, with
all schools involved in a health promotion
programme by 2007;
■ the workplace - engaging employers in
improving health at work; and
■ communities - active health improvement
programmes introduced through Community
Planning Partnerships, which will bring
together the NHS, local authorities and the
voluntary sector at a local level.
Action in the priority areas will include work
to tackle key health risk factors including diet,
physical activity, alcohol, tobacco and mental
health.
To achieve these aims, the Executive’s core
spending on health is planned to rise from
£7.2 billion in 2003/04 to £8.0 billion in 2004/05
- this represents approximately a third of the
devolved Scottish budget. The distribution of
NHS funds across Scotland reflects relative
healthcare needs, including those caused by
deprivation and by geographical remoteness.
For 2004/05, the Scottish Executive allocated
a capital budget for the NHS in Scotland of
£350 million, a 13 per cent increase on 2003/04.
Almost £240 million will be distributed to Health
Boards to improve healthcare facilities and
services, with a further £108 million to support a
number of centrally funded initiatives, including:
■ £39 million for the West of Scotland cancer
centre; work commenced in July 2004;
■ £14 million for the development of GP
premises to improve access for patients;
■ £2 million for the roll-out of colorectal cancer
screening across Scotland;
■ £13 million for the purchase of linear
accelerators for cancer treatment; and
■ £5 million for the provision of Positron
Emitting Tomography scanners across
Scotland.
The White Paper Partnership for Care, published in
2003, set out a package of proposed reforms that
included:
185
13 Health
UK 2005
■ establishment of unified NHS Boards and the
abolition of NHS Trusts, with requirements to
devolve authority to front-line staff;
■ establishment of community health
partnerships to provide greater accountability
and integration with social services;
■ guaranteed waiting times for treatment,
initially for certain heart surgery, but to be
extended to other services;
■ establishment of a new Scottish Health
Council to ensure that the NHS Boards fulfil
their new duties; and
■ increased involvement of, and accountability
to, patients through the introduction of an
integrated care record, a new statement of
patient’s rights and responsibilities, and
a new complaints procedure.
After smoking, poor diet is the most significant
contributor to poor health in Scotland, being
linked to high levels of cancer and heart disease.
By 2005 the Executive has set targets to:
■ double the average intake of fruit and
vegetables to more than 400 grams a day;
■ reduce the average intake of food energy from
total fat from 41 per cent in 1995 to no more
than 35 per cent; and
Health and well-being constituency
profiles for Scotland
In March 2004, NHS Health Scotland published
health and well-being profiles which compare
each Scottish parliamentary constituency with the
national average. The profiles, which include
80 indicators, also show the changes in the ten
years to 2001. The profiles showed that for
Scotland as a whole over the decade;
■ life expectancy for males increased by 3 per
cent or 2.1 years, and for females by 2.4 per
cent or 1.8 years;
■ infant mortality decreased by 32.4 per cent;
■ the rate of heart disease fell by 35.4 per
cent; and
■ hospital admissions attributable to alcohol
increased by 52 per cent overall and by
22 per cent for teenagers.
■ reduce the average intake of food energy from
saturated fatty acids from 17 per cent in 1995
to no more than 11 per cent.
In 2003 the Scottish Executive published its first
national physical activity strategy Let’s Make
Scotland More Active. This aims to increase
physical activity levels in people of all ages. It sets
targets that by 2022, 50 per cent of adults will be
taking at least 30 minutes of moderate activity
every day, and 80 per cent of children will be
taking at least 60 minutes of moderate activity
a day.
NHS 24 was launched in Scotland in 2002. This is
a nurse-led telephone advice service similar to
NHS Direct in England (see page 180). The first
call centre covered the Grampian region. The
service will be fully operational across Scotland by
the end of 2004. There are also plans to introduce
a NHS 24 online service.
The NHS in Northern Ireland
The Department of Health, Social Services and
Public Safety (DHSSPS) is responsible for the
development and implementation of health,
community care and public safety policy in
Northern Ireland.
There are four Health and Social Services Boards
(Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western) which
are agents of the DHSSPS. The Boards are
responsible for planning, commissioning and
purchasing health services for residents in their
areas.
Unlike other parts of the United Kingdom, health
and personal social services are provided as an
integrated service by 19 Health and Social Services
Trusts. The HSS Trusts manage front-line health
staff and services and control their own budgets.
Since 2000, the Government has produced a
written contract with the people of Northern
Ireland setting out, within the limits of the
financial resources available, the plans and
priorities for tackling problems and improving
public services. The latest document, Priorities and
Budget 2004-06, identifies the following priorities
for health and social services in Northern Ireland:
■ reduction in preventable deaths, diseases and
injuries;
■ more responsive hospital services;
■ accessible and effective primary care;
186
UK 2005
13 Health
improvements in the quality of health and
social care provided;
better support for those who need care in the
community;
better life chances for children; and
safeguarding the rights and interests of
children.
Finance
In 2003/04 an estimated 74 per cent of the NHS
was financed through general taxation, with
21 per cent from National Insurance contributions
(see chapter 12) and 5 per cent from charges and
other receipts.
In response to Priorities and Budget, DHSSPS
published Priorities for Action 2004/05 which
details how the Department, Boards and Trusts
will achieve these targets and how resources are
deployed for the benefit of the local community.
DHSSPS has implemented a number of initiatives
to modernise service delivery and ensure that high
quality services are provided for all the people of
Northern Ireland. One example is Investing for
Health (2002). This is a framework of action to
improve health and well-being and reduce health
inequalities and is based on partnership working
among departments, public bodies, local
communities, voluntary bodies and district
councils. Investing for Health has resulted in a Five
Year Tobacco Action Plan; a Teenage Pregnancy
and Parenthood Strategy and Action Plan;
Promoting Mental Health Strategy and Action
Plan; Home Accident Prevention Strategy and
Action Plan; Sexual Health Strategy; Physical
Activity Strategy; Food and Nutrition Strategy;
and a Health Promoting Schools Initiative.
In February 2004 the Strategic Investment
Programme was announced. This included over
£300 million of capital investment in the HPSS.
Some £72 million of this money will be used over
the next three years for a programme of hospital
developments as set out in Developing Better
Services - Modernising Hospitals and Reforming
Structures. This document details the way forward
for acute service provision in Northern Ireland
and sets out proposals for new organisational
structures to manage health and social services. In
addition, capital monies will provide for:
■ increased hospital capacity, additional renal
capacity and expansion of magnetic
resonance imaging to all main hospitals;
■ new secure accommodation for the mentally
ill, and a new Acquired Brain Injury service;
and
■ a new cancer centre at the Belfast City
Hospital.
The April 2002 Budget announced increases in
National Insurance contributions from April 2003
to provide extra funding for the NHS. As a result,
public spending on health will increase from
£66.3 billion in 2002/03 to £107.2 billion in
2007/08. This will result in the proportion of UK
GDP spent on health services increasing from
7.6 per cent to 9.2 per cent over this five-year
period. Government plans for public expenditure
on health for the three financial years from
2004/05 are set out in Table 13.7.

Some NHS funding is raised from other, non¬
government, sources. For example, some hospitals
increase revenue by taking private patients, who
pay the full cost of their accommodation and
treatment. Hospitals can also use private finance
for NHS capital projects, under the Private
Finance Initiative, which aims to promote
commercial partnership between the public and
private sectors (see page 370). This involves new
NHS facilities being designed, built, maintained
and owned by the private sector, which then leases
them back to the NHS. The NHS retains control of
key planning and clinical decisions.
Charges
Around 650 million prescription items, worth
around £7.5 billion, were dispensed in the
community in England in 2003. The proportion of
187
13 Health
UK 2005
items provided in the community free of charge
was 86 per cent. The following groups are exempt
from prescription charges:
■ people aged 60 and over;
■ children under 16 and full-time students
under 19;
■ women who are pregnant or have given birth
in the previous 12 months;
■ people with certain medical conditions;
■ NHS in-patients; and
■ people who receive (or whose partners
receive) certain social security benefits (see
chapter 12), or who qualify on low income
grounds.
There are charges for most types of NHS dental
treatment, including examinations. However, the
following people are entitled to free treatment:
women who begin a course of treatment while
pregnant or within 12 months of having a baby;
children under 18; full-time students under 19;
NHS in-patients (where treatment is carried out
by a hospital dentist); NHS hospital dental service
out-patients; community dental service patients;
and adults on low incomes or receiving the same
benefits or tax credits as for free prescriptions.
Free NHS sight tests are available for people aged
60 and over, children up to the age of 16, full-time
students under the age of 19, adults on low
incomes or receiving the same benefits or tax
credits as for free prescriptions, patients whose
sight test is carried out in a hospital eye
department as part of their treatment; and people
who have, or are at particular risk of, eye disease.
Around 10.5 million sight tests were paid for by
PCTs and Local Health Boards in England and
Wales in the year ending 31 March 2004.
Fraud prevention
The NHS Counter Fraud Service was established
in 1998 and incorporated into the NHS Counter
Fraud and Security Management Service (CFSMS)
in April 2003. The CFSMS estimates that since
1999 counter-fraud work has benefited the NHS by
£320 million, compared with costs of £20 million.
NHS workforce
The NHS is one of the largest employers in the
world. In 2003 there were the equivalent of over
1 million full-time direct care employees in NHS
hospital and community health services in Great
Britain (Table 13.8).

Doctors and dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’ registers
may practise as doctors or dentists in the NHS.
University medical and dental schools are responsible
for undergraduate teaching, and the NHS provides
hospital and community facilities for training.
Full registration as a doctor requires five or six
years’ training in a medical school, in a hospital
and in the community, with a further year’s
hospital experience. The regulating body for
the medical profession in the United Kingdom
is the General Medical Council and the main
professional association is the British Medical
Association.
For a dentist, five years’ training at a dental school
and satisfactory completion of one year’s
mandatory vocational training are required before
becoming eligible to work as a principal or
associate in the General Dental Services of the
NHS. All NHS general dental practitioners are
paid by a combination of capitation fees for
children registered with the practice, continuing
care payments for adults registered, and a
prescribed scale of fees for individual treatments.
The regulating body for the dental profession in
the United Kingdom is the General Dental
Council, and the main professional association is

Regulation of controlled drugs
The fourth report of the Shipman Inquiry, the
Regulation of Controlled Drugs in the Community,
was published in July 2004. The inquiry was set up
following the conviction in January 2000 of a
Manchester GP who had murdered patients by
administering controlled drugs. The report makes
three groups of recommendations:
■ setting up an integrated and multidisciplinary
inspectorate to monitor and audit the
prescription, storage, distribution and disposal
of controlled drugs;
■ restrictions that would discourage or prevent
health professionals from prescribing in
circumstances in which it could be considered
unsafe or unwise for them to do so; and
■ measures to tighten up the handling and
safekeeping of controlled drugs along each
part of the supply chain, from the supplier to
the patient's home, and to provide a complete
audit trail, both in the NHS and in the private
sector.
The final report of the inquiry, on the monitoring
of medical practitioners, is expected later in 2004.
The Health and Social Care (Community Health
and Standards) Act 2003 gave PCTs the
responsibility for ensuring the delivery of high
quality dental services to meet all reasonable
requirements within their area. Financial resources
for commissioning local dental services will be
devolved to PCTs from October 2005, at which
time a new dental contract will also come into
force. In July 2004 the Government announced
plans to recruit an extra 1,000 dentists by October
2005, accompanied by extra investment of
£368 million in NHS dentistry.
Nurses, midwives and health visitors
The majority of nursing students undertake the
pre-registration Diploma in Higher Education
programme, which emphasises health promotion
as well as care of the sick and enables students
upon qualification to work either in hospitals or in
the community. The programme lasts three years
(full-time) and consists of periods of university
study combined with practical experience in a
hospital and in the community. Midwifery
education programmes for registered general/adult
nurses take 18 months, while the direct entry
programme lasts three years (full-time). Health
visitors and district nurses are registered adult
nurses who have a further specialist qualification
and care for clients in the community.
The Nursing and Midwifery Council is
responsible for regulating and registering nurses
and midwives throughout the United Kingdom.
Nurse consultants
In 2000 the first nurse consultant posts were
introduced. The NHS Plan committed the
Government to establishing 1,000 such posts by
2004, and by June 2004 over 870 posts had been
filled. The positions combine specialist practice
with leadership, consultancy, education and
research responsibilities.
Modern matrons
In 2001 the first ‘modern matron’ posts were
created in England. Each matron is in overall
charge of a group of hospital wards, helping to
ensure high standards of care. They set and
monitor standards for cleaning and catering, and
can take action where these are not met. Over
3,000 appointments had been made by April 2004.
Pharmacists
Only people on the register of pharmaceutical
chemists may practise as pharmacists. Registration
requires four years’ training in a school of
pharmacy, followed by one year’s practical
experience in a community or hospital pharmacy
approved for training by one of the regulatory
bodies for the profession - the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and the
Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland.
Community pharmacists are paid professional fees
for dispensing NHS prescriptions. From 2003,
supplementary prescribing was introduced with
the aim of speeding access to medicines for
patients with conditions such as asthma, diabetes,
coronary heart disease and high blood pressure.
This allows suitably trained pharmacists and
nurses to issue repeat prescriptions to patients,
avoiding the need for them to revisit their doctors.

Opticians
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of optometrists (ophthalmic opticians)
and dispensing opticians in the United Kingdom.
Only registered optometrists may test sight. In
general, optometric training takes four years (five
years in Scotland), including a year of practical
experience under supervision. Dispensing
opticians usually take a two-year full-time course
with a year’s practical experience, or a three-year
part-time day-release or distance-learning course
while employed with a registered optician.
Other health professions
The Health Professions Council is a UK-wide
regulatory body responsible for setting and
monitoring the standards of professional training,
performance and conduct of 12 healthcare
professions: arts therapists, chiropodists, clinical
scientists, dieticians, biomedical scientists,
occupational therapists, orthoptists, paramedics,
physiotherapists, prosthetists and orthotists,
radiographers, and speech and language therapists.
Council for the Regulation of Health Care
Professionals
The Council for the Regulation of Health Care
Professionals was established in 2003 to oversee
the individual regulators of healthcare professions
in the United Kingdom. The Council is responsible
for ensuring consistency in the work of the
regulators, and helps Parliament to hold them to
account. The creation of the Council met a
commitment set out in the 2000 NHS Plan and
was also one of the recommendations made in the
2001 report of the public inquiry into children’s
heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary.
Recruitment
Delivering the NHS Plan, published in 2002, set
new targets for 15,000 extra consultants and CPs,
35,000 nurses, midwives and health visitors, and
30,000 therapists and scientists by 2008.
Several initiatives have been put in place to recruit
new staff and encourage former NHS healthcare
professionals to return to the service. The ‘Return
to Practice’ initiative, which seeks to attract former
staff back to the NHS, has been running since
February 1999. Under this scheme, nearly 17,500
nurses, midwives and health visitors had returned
to work in the NHS by December 2003.
The CP returners scheme offers incentives to
doctors returning to work in the NHS. The
scheme includes a package of financial and
working measures designed to adapt work to
individual CPs’ needs. Benefits include:
■ salaried refresher training tailored to
individual needs;
■ a ‘golden hello’ payment up to £12,000;
■ flexible working options enabling full- or
part-time hours; and
■ support and advice on childcare.
In February 2004 the Government announced the
launch of a recruitment and retention strategy to
increase the number of radiographers working in
the NHS in England. The strategy will receive
£3.4 million funding over two years and will
focus on increasing the workforce, encouraging
qualified radiographers to return to the NHS
and developing career paths for all radiography
staff.
NHS online recruitment service
In December 2003 the Government launched
an online recruitment service for the NHS, which
allows candidates to view job advertisements
and apply for positions on one website
{www.jobs.nhs.uk). Forty-six NHS organisations
were selected to pilot the service, which was
rolled out across the NHS in England in April
2004. The service will complement the NHS
careers service, which provides information to
people wishing to start or return to a career in
the NHS. A daily total of around 1,500 jobs is
displayed.
The NHS is also recruiting from abroad, and in
2000 set a target of recruiting 1,000 doctors and
2,000 nurses by March 2005, focusing on countries
where there are surpluses of suitably qualified
staff. To increase capacity and reduce waiting
times, the Government has also introduced an
overseas clinical teams initiative whereby surgeons
and their existing teams of suitably qualified
medical specialists are being employed by the
NHS. The Government’s top priority area for
overseas teams is for them to work in new NHS
Treatment Centres (see page 184).

Services for children, women,
men and older people
Children
Activities promoting the health of children
include: prevention of childhood accidents;
immunisation and vaccination (see page 178);
screening and health surveillance; and health
education on diet and exercise.
Babies and pre-school children
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance for pre-school children is run by
community health services and GPs. They receive
an annual payment for every child registered on
the programme (in Scotland this is carried out by
the Community Paediatric Service, which may be
based in a primary care or acute services trust).
Health visitors have a central role in health
promotion and in identifying the healthcare needs
of under-fives and helping to ensure access to
services. They visit new-born babies at home
between 10 and 14 days after birth. Later checks
usually take place at:
■ six to eight weeks (with a physical
examination by a health visitor, GP or clinic
doctor);
■ six to nine months (including hearing and
sight assessments);
■ 18 months to two years; and
■ pre-school, at three to four-and-a-half years.
School health services
Children attending state schools have access to the
school health service. School nurses check hearing,
sight, speech and weight, administer vaccinations
and are involved in health education, counselling
and sex education. The service also assists teachers
with pupils who have medical needs.
Child guidance and child psychiatric services
provide help and advice to families and children
with psychological or emotional problems. In
recent years, efforts have been made to improve
co-operation between community-based child
health services and local authority education and
social services for children. This is particularly
important in the prevention of child abuse and for
the health and welfare of children in care.
The Food in Schools programme is a joint venture
between the DH and the Department for
Education and Skills. A range of nutrition-related
activities and projects has been developed as part
of the programme, to complement existing
healthier-food initiatives in schools.
Pilot projects run in over 300 schools during the
2003/04 academic year included healthier
breakfast clubs, tuck shops, vending machines,
lunch boxes and cookery clubs. Schools are also
being encouraged to carry out an ‘audit’ during
the school day and develop food policies for the
whole school. The results of the pilot projects will
be brought together and made available to schools
across England from the beginning of 2005.
The National School Fruit Scheme ensures that all
children aged four to six receive free fruit on each
school day. Each year from 2004, about 440 million
pieces of fruit will be distributed to over 2 million
children in some 18,000 schools in England.
In Wales, a Food and Fitness Task Group for
children and young people helps to plan and
coordinate food and fitness initiatives. Schools in
the Welsh Network of Healthy School Schemes are
being encouraged to audit their activity related to
food and nutrition. Over 350 schools have
developed fruit tuck shops and a healthy vending
pilot project is under way in secondary schools. The
primary school breakfast scheme, which provides a
free healthy breakfast at school, was introduced in
September 2004 and will be available to all schools
wishing to participate by January 2007.
In Scotland, nutritional standards for school meals
were set out with the publication of Hungry for
Success in February 2003. The Scottish Executive
committed funding of £64 million over three years
to develop nutritional standards for school meals
and provide free fruit three times a week to all
primary 1 and 2 children. The Executive also
provided funding of £24 million over three years
to develop the Active School Co-ordinators
Programme, which aims to encourage children to
be more physically active.
Children's National Service Framework
The Children’s National Service Framework
(NSF), published in 2004, set new national
standards for children in England, across both the
NHS and social services. It has a broad remit
covering eight areas: hospital services; the ill child;
child and adolescent mental health services;
191
13 Health
UK 2005
disabled children; children in special
circumstances; healthy children and young people;
maternity; and medicines. The first module, on
hospital services, was published in 2003.
Women
Women have particular health needs related to
certain forms of cancer and to pregnancy.
Screening
Under the UK breast cancer screening programme,
every woman aged between 50 and 64 is invited
for a breast X-ray every three years by
computerised call-up and recall systems. In
England the upper age limit was raised to 70 in
2004, and the same change is being made on a
phased basis in Wales and Scotland. In 2002/03,
1.3 million women of all ages were screened in
England, and 9,849 cases were diagnosed.
National policy for cervical screening is that
women should be screened every three to five
years (three-and-a-half to five-and-a-half years in
Scotland) so as to detect indications of the long
developmental stage that may proceed to invasive
cancer. The programme invites women aged 20 to
64 (20 to 60 in Scotland) for screening. However,
since many women are not invited immediately
when they reach their 20th birthday, the age group
25 to 64 is used to give a more accurate estimate of
coverage of the target population. By the end of
March 2003, 81 per cent of women aged 25 to 64
had been screened at least once in the previous
five years in England, 86 per cent in Scotland,
81 per cent in Wales and 73 per cent in Northern
Ireland.
Maternity
A woman is entitled to care throughout
pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period. Care
may be provided by a midwife, a community-
based GP, a hospital-based obstetrician, or a
combination of these. Special preventive services
are provided under the NHS to safeguard the
health of pregnant women and mothers with
young children. Services include free dental
treatment; health education; and vaccination and
immunisation of children against certain
infectious diseases (see page 178).
The Welfare Food Scheme supports mothers on
low incomes. The scheme was originally created in
1940 as a wartime measure to protect the health of
young children during times of rationing. The
scheme provides tokens for free liquid milk and
infant formula milk to those who qualify on the
grounds of low income or receipt of tax credits.
In February 2004 the Government announced
reforms to the scheme to be phased in across
England from early 2005. Under the new scheme
called Healthy Start, milk tokens will be replaced
with weekly vouchers that can be used to buy fresh
produce as well as milk. The scheme will be
expanded to cover all pregnant women under the
age of 18, regardless of family income. The
vouchers will be worth at least £5.60 a week to
families with children under one, and at least
£2.80 a week to those with children over one.
In England and Wales, two guides are given to
first-time mothers free of charge. The Pregnancy
Book is a complete guide to a healthy pregnancy,
labour and giving birth as well as life with a new
baby. Birth to Five is a guide to the early stages of
development, nutrition, weaning and common
childhood ailments. The Scottish equivalent is
Ready, Steady, Baby! produced by NHS Health
Scotland. New mothers also receive a Personal
Child Health Record to record immunisations,
tests, birth details and health checks.
Teenage pregnancy
The Social Exclusion Unit’s report on teenage
pregnancy in England, published in 1999, set out a
national strategy to halve the rate of under-18
conceptions by 2010, with an interim reduction of
15 per cent by 2004. It also aims to increase the
participation of teenage parents in education and
work, to reduce their risk of social exclusion. To
aid delivery of these aims, every top-tier local
authority has a ten-year teenage pregnancy strategy
and a detailed three-year action plan. Between
1999 and 2001 the conception rate for women
aged under 18 in England and Wales fell from 45.9
to 42.3 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 17 years, but
there was a slight increase (to 42.8) in 2002.
Abortion
Under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, a time
limit of 24 weeks applies to the largest category of
abortion - risk to the physical or mental health
of the pregnant woman — and also to abortion
because of a similar risk to any existing children
of her family. There are three categories to which
no time limit applies:

In 2003 the number of legal abortions performed
on women resident in England and Wales rose by
3.2 per cent to 181,600. The age-standardised rate
rose from 17.0 to 17.5 abortions per 1,000 women
aged between 15 and 44. In Scotland in 2002 the
number fell by 2.9 per cent to 11,800 with the
overall age-standardised rate falling from 11.3 to
10.4 per 1,000 women aged between 15 and 44.
Men
The lower life expectancy of men (see page 176)
is the most significant indication of the health
inequalities that exist between the sexes. Two
possible reasons are that men tend to have less
healthy lifestyles in terms of diet, smoking and
higher alcohol and drug intake, and that they are
involved in more accidents. They also risk later
diagnosis and treatment because, according to
some experts, they do not consult a doctor as
quickly as women do when a problem arises.
In recent years, Government and other health
campaigns have aimed to raise awareness and
improve treatments for male-specific cancers. In
both England and Scotland the respective Cancer
Plans set out the Government’s and Scottish
Executive’s intention to introduce prostate cancer
screening as soon as techniques are sufficiently
developed. In the meantime, a prostate cancer risk
management programme has been launched in
both England and Scotland. One element of this
is a project for prostate specific antigen (PSA)
testing. Extra Government funding for research
has also been allocated. In 2003/04, funding for
the NHS Prostate Cancer Programme was
£4.2 million, a twentyfold increase since 1999.
Older people
The NSF for Older People sets out national
standards for care across health and social services
in England. These standards apply whether an
older person is being cared for at home, in a
residential setting or in a hospital. The NSF
focuses on conditions that are particularly
significant for older people and that have not been
covered in other NSFs (see page 197). Two of the
aims for 2004 were that:
■ every general hospital that provides care for
stroke victims should have a specialised stroke
service; and
■ every general practice should be using
protocols agreed with local specialist health
and social care services to diagnose, treat and
care for patients with depression and
dementia.
The Diabetes NSF includes a target that by 2006
at least 80 per cent of people with diabetes will be
offered screening for the early detection of diabetic
retinopathy (a cause of blindness in older people).
Mobile centres for treatment of
cataract patients
From February 2004 cataract patients in areas
of England with the longest waiting times
were able to get treatment at mobile centres.
The two new mobile treatment centres move
around England, performing an extra 44,000
cataract operations over the next five years.
Hospital and specialist services
District general hospitals offer a broad spectrum
of clinical specialities, supported by a range of
other services, such as anaesthetics, pathology and
radiology. Almost all have facilities for the
admission of emergency patients, either through
A&E departments or as direct referrals from GPs.
Treatments are provided for in-patients, day cases,
out-patients and patients who attend wards for
treatment such as dialysis.
Some hospitals provide specialist services covering
more than one region or district, for example for
heart and liver transplants and rare eye and bone
cancers. There are also specialist hospitals, such as
the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children,
Moorfields Eye Hospital, and the National Hospital
for Neurology and Neurosurgery, all in London.
These hospitals combine specialist treatment
facilities with training and international research.

Organ transplants
United Kingdom Transplant (a special health
authority of the NHS) provides a 24-hour support
service to all transplant units in the United
Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland for the
matching and allocation of organs for transplant.
In some cases transplants are multi-organ. United
Kingdom Transplant is also responsible for
maintaining the NHS Organ Donor Register. In
July 2004 the Government announced that, as part
of the implementation of its arm’s length bodies
Review (see page 184), UK transplant would
merge with the National Blood Authority to create
a new National Blood and Transplant Authority.
The number of organ transplants carried out in
the United Kingdom during 2003/04 was 2,863,
the highest on record. This figure included 1,787
kidney transplants, for which there was a waiting
list of 4,989 patients at the end of that year, and
679 liver transplants.
At the end of 2003 there were five designated adult
cardio-thoracic transplant centres and one
paediatric transplant centre in England, and one
adult centre in Scotland. There are six designated
adult and three paediatric liver transplant units in
England and one adult unit in Scotland.
People who are willing to donate their organs after
death may carry a donor card. The NHS Organ
Donor Register contained around 11 million
names at December 2003. The Government aims
to have 16 million people registered by 2010.
Blood services
Blood services are run by the National Blood
Service in England and north Wales, the Welsh
Blood Service, the Scottish National Blood
Transfusion Service, and the Northern Ireland
Blood Transfusion Service.
Over 3 million donations are made each year by
voluntary unpaid donors in the United Kingdom.
These are turned into many life-saving components
and products for patients. Red cells, platelets and
other components with a limited ‘life’ are prepared
at blood centres, while the production of plasma
products is undertaken at the Bio Products
Laboratory in Elstree (Hertfordshire) and the
Protein Fractionation Centre in Edinburgh.
Use of human tissue
In December 2003 the Government published the
Human Tissue Bill. This arose from events at the
Bristol Royal Infirmary and the Royal Liverpool
Children's Hospital (Alder Hey), when organs and
tissue from children who had died were removed,
stored and used without proper consent. This
practice had been fairly widespread and the law in
this area was not clear and consistent.
Most of the provisions in the Bill will apply in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It seeks to
establish a new body - the Human Tissue
Authority - which would oversee the use of
human tissue for a wide range of purposes,
including anatomical examination, education and
training, research and transplantation. The
consent of the donor or family members would
form the basis for keeping or using tissues and
cells. The Bill would also make it an offence,
throughout the United Kingdom, to analyse DNA
without consent (as envisaged in the genetics
White Paper - see page 200). In time the Human
Tissue Authority will be merged with the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (see page
200) to form the Regulatory Authority for Fertility
and Tissue.
Each of the four blood services coordinates
programmes for donor recruitment, retention and
education, and donor sessions are organised
regionally, in towns and workplaces. Donors are
aged between 17 and 70. Blood centres are
responsible for blood collection, screening,
processing and supplying hospital blood banks.
They also provide laboratory, clinical, research and
specialist advisory services and facilities. They are
subject to nationally coordinated quality audit
programmes, through the Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, see page 199).
Ambulance and patient transport
services
NHS ambulances are available free to the public
through the 999 telephone system for medical
emergencies and accidents, as well as for doctors’
urgent calls. Non-emergency patient transport
services are free to NHS patients considered by
their doctor, dentist or midwife to be medically
unfit to travel by other means.
194
UK 2005
13 Health
In many areas volunteer drivers provide a hospital
car service for non-urgent patients. Patients on
low incomes may be eligible for reimbursement of
costs of travelling to hospital.
Emergency response
In 2003/04 the number of emergency calls to the
NHS in England rose by 8 per cent to 5.3 million;
the number of incidents attended by 7 per cent to
4.3 million; and the number of emergency patient
journeys by 6 per cent to 3.4 million. Paramedics
using cars or motorcycles and 'approved first
responders' (such as a doctor) helped to ensure
that the ambulance services met their target of
responding to 75 per cent of Category A calls
(those which are immediately life threatening)
within eight minutes. There were 16 dedicated air
ambulance services in England and Wales in April
2004, all operating as independent charitable
trusts. Scotland has two helicopters and four
fixed-wing aircraft funded by the Scottish
Executive.
v 
Hospices
Hospice (or palliative) care is a special type of care
for people whose illness may no longer be curable.
It focuses on controlling pain and other distressing
symptoms, and on providing psychological
support to patients, their families and friends,
both during the illness and into bereavement.
Palliative care services mostly help people with
cancer, although patients with other life-
threatening illnesses are also cared for.
The first hospices in the United Kingdom were
opened in 1967 and were provided on a voluntary
basis. Most care continues to be provided by the
voluntary sector, but is also increasingly provided
within NHS palliative care units, and by hospitals
and community palliative care teams. The care
may be provided in a variety of settings: at home
(with support from specially trained staff), in a
hospice or palliative care unit, in hospital or at a
hospice day centre. There were 216 hospice or
palliative care units in the United Kingdom in
January 2003, providing around 3,000 beds.
In June 2003 there were 28 children’s hospices in
England, providing respite care from birth to 16
years of age. Palliative care networks for children
are being established across England to coordinate
how and where services are provided. In Scotland
there are two children’s hospices, the second of
which became operational in April 2004.
The National Council for Hospices and Specialist
Palliative Care Services brings together voluntary
and health service providers in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland, to provide a coordinated view of
the service. Its Scottish counterpart is the Scottish
Partnership for Palliative Care.
Sexual health
The Government’s public health strategy includes
the provision of sexual health services. Free
contraceptive advice and treatment are available
from GPs and family planning clinics, which also
offer tailored services for young people. Clinics
provide condoms and other contraceptives free of
charge and emergency or ‘morning after’ pills are
available from pharmacists without a prescription.
The DH has developed a national sexual health
and HIV strategy to bring together initiatives in
these areas, including work on chlamydia (see page
178). The first phase of a national screening
programme for chlamydia was launched in 2002 at
ten sites across England. In January 2004 the
Government announced the introduction of a
further 16 programmes covering 50 PCTs across
England. The programmes primarily target
women aged 16 to 24, as this group is at greatest
risk of infection.
In Wales, recent sexual health promotions have
included condom distribution schemes and
sexually transmitted infection and HIV prevention
campaigns. Following the Welsh Assembly
Government’s Strategic Framework for Promoting
Sexual Health, a Review of HIV and Sexual Health
Services has been commissioned. The Scottish
Executive is also developing plans for a sexual
health strategy.
Alcohol
In March 2004 the Government published the
Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England. This
identifies a need for greater awareness of alcohol
misuse issues among health service staff, and an
improvement in their ability to deal with them. It
195
13 Health
UK 2005
proposes pilot schemes to find out whether earlier
identification and treatment of those with alcohol
problems can improve health and lead to longer-
term savings. It also proposes measures aimed at
achieving a long-term change in attitudes
to irresponsible drinking and behaviour,
including:
■ making the ‘sensible drinking’ message easier
to understand and apply;
■ targeting information campaigns at those
most at risk, in particular binge drinkers and
chronic drinkers;
■ ensuring better information for consumers on
products and at point of sale;
■ creating alcohol education programmes for
schools that can change attitudes and
behaviour, as well as raise awareness; and
■ moves to ensure television advertising does
not target young drinkers or glamorise
irresponsible behaviour.
In 2002 the Scottish Executive published a Plan for
Action on Alcohol Misuse. This aims to reduce
alcohol-related harm in Scotland and prioritises
action to reduce binge drinking and harmful
drinking by children and young people.
In Northern Ireland, the Strategy for Reducing
Alcohol Related Harm was published in 2000 and is
being implemented with the drug strategy. A
review has commenced to determine the overall
effectiveness of the Northern Ireland drugs and
alcohol strategies and the structures and activities
developed to take them forward.
There is also close co-operation between statutory
and voluntary organisations. In England, Alcohol
Concern and other voluntary organisations play a
prominent role in improving services for problem
drinkers and their families, increasing public
awareness of alcohol misuse, and improving
training for professional and voluntary workers. In
Scotland local action is coordinated through a
network of 22 local action teams, while Alcohol
Focus Scotland promotes responsible drinking and
offers a range of training and counselling services.
Tobacco
Cigarette advertising on UK television has been
banned since 1965. During 2003/04 a number of
wider restrictions came into effect under the
Tobacco Advertising and Promotions Act 2002. This
will lead to a ban on most forms of tobacco
advertising, promotion and sponsorship in the
United Kingdom, including magazines,
newspapers, billboards, the Internet, and
sponsorship of cultural and sporting events.
NHS smoking cessation services offer information,
counselling and motivational help to smokers who
want to stop. In England, the Government target for
2002/03 was for 100,000 smokers to have quit by
the four-week follow-up stage. Results show that of
the 234,900 smokers who set a quit date in 2002/03,
124,100 reported that they had successfully quit at
the four-week stage. A target of 800,000 successful
quitters at the four-week stage has been set for the
three years 2003/04 to 2005/06 combined. In July
2004 the Government announced a new target to
reduce adult smoking rates to 21 per cent or less by
2010 (from 26 per cent in 2002), with a reduction
among routine and manual groups to 26 per cent
or less (from 31 per cent).
Drugs
The misuse of drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and
amphetamines, is a serious social and health
problem (see page 179). The Government
launched its ten-year anti-drugs strategy Tackling
Drugs to Build a Better Britain in 1998. In 2002 an
updated version of the strategy was published,
building on the progress and lessons learned. This
focused on the most dangerous drugs and the
communities and individuals most affected by
them. It aims to discourage young people from
using drugs in the first place and to provide
support to parents and family members who are
concerned about drugs.
The DH has a target to double the participation of
problem drug users in drug treatment
programmes in England by 2008, and to increase
year on year the proportion of users successfully
sustaining or completing treatment programmes.
Within the UK strategy, there are separate
strategies for Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Programmes are delivered at a local level
by Drug Action Teams or similar teams composed
of all those involved in drugs issues (for example
PCTs, the social and probation services, and the
police). They agree a strategy that applies the
national policy to the particular conditions in
their area.

Medical standards
Standards of care
NHS Charters
Your Guide to the NHS, which in 2001 replaced the
earlier Patient’s Charter, provides information on
how to get treatment and sets out minimum
standards of service, targets for the NHS and
improvements in the NHS Plan. It also details what
patients have a right to expect from the NHS and
what is expected from patients. A new guide for
Scotland The NHS and You was published in 2004.
National Service Frameworks
The aim of NSFs is to set national standards and
reduce variations in service within the NHS. Since
1999 in England, NSFs for mental health, coronary
heart disease, cancer, diabetes and older people
(see page 193) have been published. In addition an
NSF for renal services is being developed in a
modular format. Part One: Dialysis and
Transplantation was published in January 2004
with Part Two: Prevention and End of Life Care to
follow. The first part of the Children’s NSF, which
included the standard for hospital services, was
published in 2003 and the remainder in 2004. An
NSF for long-term conditions (with a particular
focus on neurological conditions) is also in
preparation.
National Institute for Clinical Excellence
NICE was established in 1999 to develop national
standards for best practice in clinical care within
the NHS in England and Wales. NICE publishes
three types of guidance:
■ technology appraisals on the use of new and
existing medicines and treatments: by July
2004, 80 had been published;
■ clinical guidelines on the appropriate
treatment and care of people with specific
diseases and conditions: by July 2004, 29 had
been published; and
■ interventional procedures on whether
techniques used for diagnosis or treatment
are safe and work well enough for routine
use: by July 2004, 79 had been published.
(This category of guidance applies to Scotland
as well as England and Wales.)
The Institute’s membership is drawn from the
health professions, the NHS, academics, health
economists and patients.
In October 2003, new treatments referred to NICE
for appraisal in its next work programme included
those for people with chemotherapy induced
anaemia, and heart failure. New clinical guidelines
will include topics such as breast and prostate
cancers, puerperal/perinatal mental health, and the
management of chronic fatigue syndrome.
NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is responsible
for developing and running a national system of
quality assurance in healthcare for the NHS in
Scotland. This involves setting clinical standards,
reviewing and monitoring performance and
providing a single source of national advice on
effective practice. It also takes the lead on patient
safety and is responsible for investigating any cases
of serious service failure.
Treatment centres for ME sufferers
In January 2004 the Government announced the
creation of 12 new centres in England to support
people with chronic fatigue syndrome, also
known as ME, backed by extra investment of
£8.5 million. The centres will provide access to
specialist assessment, diagnosis and advice;
develop education and training resources for
health professionals; and support clinical research
into the causes and treatment of the condition.
Complaints
There are three levels to the NHS complaints
procedure: the first involves resolution of a
complaint locally, following a direct approach to
the Patients Advice and Liaison Service at the
relevant NHS service provider; the second involves
an independent review procedure if the complaint
is not resolved locally; and as a final resort,
patients may approach the Health Service
Commissioner (in Northern Ireland, the
Commissioner for Complaints) if they are still
dissatisfied. The majority of complaints do not
proceed beyond the local level.
Since 30 July 2004 the CHAI (see page 198) has
been responsible for the independent review of
complaints. The Government is planning to issue
amended regulations setting out the reformed local
resolution process during 2005 after considering
relevant recommendations made by the Shipman
Inquiry report (see page 189) and other inquiries.
197
13 Health
UK 2005
The Independent Complaints Advocacy Service
provides assistance to people who wish to
complain about the NHS in England.
In 2002/03, 63 per cent of complaints about
hospital and community health services in
England were resolved within the performance
target of 20 working days. The top four subjects of
these complaints were clinical treatment (34 per
cent); the attitude of staff (13 per cent); delays and
cancellations to outpatient appointments (12 per
cent); and communication/ information to
patients (9 per cent). These have consistently been
the top complaints since 1996/97, when such
figures were first collected.
In Wales, a revised NHS complaints procedure was
introduced in April 2003. Key changes include:
■ strengthened local resolution (first stage) with
the offer of independent complaints
facilitation/mediation;
■ independent review (second stage) by a pool
of trained lay reviewers appointed by, and
accountable to, the Welsh Assembly
Government; and
■ support to complainants by independent
advocates based at Community Health
Councils.
Health Service Commissioners
England and Wales each have Health Service
Commissioners who are responsible for
investigating complaints about health service
bodies that have not been dealt with to the
satisfaction of the member of the public
concerned. The English and Welsh posts are held
by one person who is also Parliamentary
Commissioner for Administration (the
Ombudsman, see page 62). The Health Service
Commissioner reports annually to Parliament and
to the Welsh Assembly Government.
In Scotland, complaints about the health service
can be directed to the Scottish Public Services
Ombudsman, who is also the Parliamentary and
Housing Commissioner and who reports to the
Scottish Parliament. In Northern Ireland
complaints about health and social services bodies
are investigated by the Commissioner for
Complaints.
Health Service Commissioners can investigate
complaints that a person has suffered hardship or
injustice as a result of a failure in a service
provided by a health service body (including
action by health professionals arising from the
exercise of clinical judgement); complaints of a
failure to provide a service to which the patient
was entitled; or maladministration.
Inspection and regulation
The NHS Reform and Health Care Professions Act
2002 introduced changes to the way in which
health and social services are regulated. Further
legislation included in the Health and Social Care
(Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 (see
page 181) introduced two new independent
inspectorates: the CHAI and the CSCI (see page
162). The Act also provided new healthcare
inspection powers for the National Assembly for
Wales through the establishment of Healthcare
Inspectorate Wales. Separate arrangements will
continue in Scotland.
Commission for Healthcare Audit
and Inspection
The CHAI became fully operational from April
2004. Known as the Healthcare Commission, it is
responsible for investigating the performance of all
NHS organisations and private hospitals in
England. It has also assumed responsibility for the
financial monitoring work of the Audit
Commission (see page 369) within the NHS in
England, the work of the Commission for Health
Improvement and the private healthcare role of
the National Care Standards Commission.
Following assessments, the Healthcare
Commission publishes star ratings for all NHS
organisations in England and recommends special
measures where there are persistent problems. It
also publishes an annual report to Parliament on
national progress on healthcare in England and
Wales and how resources have been used. In Wales,
HIW, which became operational in April 2004, has
the same responsibilities for undertaking reviews
and investigations into the provision of healthcare
by NHS bodies in Wales. The voluntary and
private healthcare sector in Wales is regulated by
the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales.
Safety
Health Protection Agency
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) was
established in April 2003 with a remit covering
198
UK 2005
13 Health
biological, chemical and radiological hazards,
infectious disease control and health emergency
planning. The Health Protection Agency Act 2004
established the HPA as a UK-wide non-
departmental public body. In addition to the
above health functions, the UK Government and
the devolved administrations will look to the HPA
to provide all the functions currently carried out
by the National Radiological Protection Board
(NRPB), which is being wound up. The extent to
which the Agency undertakes health functions will
vary in different parts of the United Kingdom, to
take account of the different needs and wishes of
the DH and the devolved administrations.
Medicines and medical equipment
The Medicines and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was established in
2003. It is responsible for the regulation of both
medicines and healthcare products in the United
Kingdom and for safeguarding the interests of
patients and users by ensuring that medicines,
equipment and other products meet appropriate
standards of safety, quality and performance, and
that they comply with relevant EC Directives.
Only medicines that have been granted a
marketing authorisation issued by the MHRA or
the European Medicines Agency may be supplied
to the public. Marketing authorisations are issued
following scientific assessment on the basis of
safety, quality and effectiveness.
In January 2004 the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer
published Building a safer NHSfor patients -
improving medication safety. The report examined
the causes and frequency of medication errors,
highlighted drugs and clinical settings that carry
particular risk, and identified models of good
practice for health professionals and NHS
organisations to follow when prescribing drugs.
Food safety
Under the Food Safety Act 1990, it is illegal to sell
or supply food that is unfit for human
consumption or falsely or misleadingly labelled.
The Act covers a range of commercial activities
related to food production, the sources from
which food is derived, such as crops and animals,
and articles that come into contact with food.
There are also more detailed regulations, which
apply to all types of food and drink and their
ingredients. Local authorities are responsible for
enforcing food law in two main areas: trading
standards officers deal with the labelling of food,
its composition and most cases of chemical
contamination; and environmental health officers
deal with hygiene, cases of microbiological
contamination of foods, and food that is found to
be unfit for human consumption.
The Food Standards Agency (ESA) is responsible
for food safety and standards in the United
Kingdom and represents the Government on these
issues in the European Union. The ESA has offices
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Its key
aims are to:
■ reduce foodborne illness by 20 per cent
between 2001 and 2006 by improving food
safety throughout the food chain;
■ help people to eat more healthily;
■ promote honest and informative labelling to
help consumers;
■ promote best practice within the food
industry; and
■ improve the enforcement of food law.
Research
The Medical Research Council (MRC, see also
page 395) supports medical research in the United
Kingdom by providing funding for research
programmes and infrastructure, and by investing
in training and employment, both in universities
and its own research centres. The MRC receives an
annual grant from the Office of Science and
Technology (part of the Department of Trade and
Industry). In 2003/04 the MRC received £410
million and realised a further £68 million from
external sources, such as joint-funding initiatives
and commercial activities.
The MRC advises the Government on matters
relating to medical research, and co-operates with
Health Departments throughout the United
Kingdom, the NHS and other government
departments concerned with biomedical and
health service research. It also works closely with
other research councils, medical research charities,
industry and consumers, to identify and respond
to current and future health needs.
Human fertilisation and embryology

United Kingdom in 1978, a result of the technique

Increase in research funding
In the March 2004 Budget, the Government
announced an extra £100 million for the NHS for
medical research and development. As a result,
the combined government budget for medical
research will rise from £1.0 billion in 2004 to
£1.2 billion a year by 2008. The additional
funding will be used to research the treatment
and cure of Alzheimer's, stroke, diabetes and
mental health, and to develop new medicines for
children. The creation of the UK Clinical Research
Collaboration will bring together the NHS, the
MRC, medical charities, industry and patients, to
speed up the development and availability of new
medicines and treatments.
legal implications were examined by a committee
of inquiry and led eventually to the passage of the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. The
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority
(HFEA) licenses and inspects centres providing
certain infertility treatments, undertaking human
embryo research or storing gametes or embryos. It
also maintains a code of practice giving guidance
to licensed centres and reports annually to
Parliament. As part of the implementation of the
review of the DH’s arm’s length bodies (see page
184), the HFEA will, subject to legislation, be
merged with the Human Tissue Authority (see
page 194), to form the Regulatory Authority for
Fertility and Tissue.
Genetic profiling and other advances in genetics
have the potential to improve health and
healthcare through more precise diagnosis, better
targeted and more effective use of existing drugs,
and new gene-based drugs and therapies. The
2003 genetics White Paper, Our inheritance, our
future - realising the potential of genetics in the
NHS, set out a plan for the NHS, including the
investment of £50 million over three years from
2004, to help realise the benefits of genetics in
healthcare. New initiatives include:
■ a substantial investment in upgrading genetics
laboratories, and more genetics counsellors,
consultants and laboratory scientists;
■ more than £7 million on initiatives to
introduce genetics-based healthcare into
mainstream NHS services;
■ a Genetics Education and Development
Centre to take the lead in education and
training in genetics for all healthcare staff;
and
■ research in pharmacogenetics, gene therapy
and health services research.
The White Paper also set out the safeguards
against, and controls on, inappropriate or unsafe
use of developments in genetics. In addition to
existing controls on gene therapy and use of
genetic test results by insurance companies, the
Government will introduce new legislation to
ban DNA theft, meaning it will become an offence
to test someone’s DNA without their consent
except for medical or police purposes. This is
being taken forward in the Human Tissue Bill
(see page 194).
Health arrangements with
other countries
The member states of the European Economic
Area (EEA - see page 104) have special health
arrangements under which EEA nationals resident
in a member state are entitled to receive
emergency treatment, either free or at a reduced
cost, during visits to other EEA countries. These
arrangements also apply in Switzerland. Treatment
is provided, in most cases, on production of a
valid Form El 11. There are also arrangements for
people who go to another EEA country specifically
for medical care, or who require continuing
treatment for a pre-existing condition. From the
end of 2005 the Form El 11 will be replaced by the
European Health Insurance Card.
Unless falling into an exempted category (for
instance people engaging in employment, taking
up permanent residence or seeking asylum in the
United Kingdom), visitors to the United Kingdom
are generally expected to pay for all non-emergency
treatment. The United Kingdom also has a
number of bilateral agreements with some other
countries, such as Australia and New Zealand.
In December 2003 the Government announced
changes to the legislation that allows the NHS to
charge overseas visitors for treatment. The new
regulations, which came into effect in April 2004,
prevent the following people (among others) from
receiving free treatment:
200
UK 2005
13 Health
■ failed asylum seekers and others with no legal
right to be in the country, for conditions
arising after their legal status has been finally
determined;
■ the dependants and spouse of someone who
is permanently resident in the United
Kingdom visiting the country briefly just to
obtain free treatment. They will only be
entitled to free treatment if they permanently
reside in the country; and
■ business travellers to the United Kingdom
and their dependants who fall ill or are
injured on a trip to the UK.
There were also changes made to the rules
covering UK pensioners who spend part of the year
living in another EEA country. The new rules make
it easier for them to receive free NHS treatment,
by allowing them to spend up to six months out of
the country every year and still be eligible.
Overseas students studying full time in the United
Kingdom became fully exempt from charges.
Health provision outside
the NHS
Private healthcare
As an alternative to the NHS, people are entitled to
pay for their own health and social care, for example
by joining a private healthcare organisation or
simply paying for private treatment when the need
arises. In addition, there is the option of private
medical insurance, which, depending on the
premium paid, will cover people’s healthcare in
times of need. In 2002, 6.7 million people in the
United Kingdom were covered by private medical
insurance, more than three times the number in
1971 (2.1 million).
The UK market for private dentistry has expanded
rapidly in recent years, growing by almost 50 per
cent in real terms between 1997 and 2001, to a
value of over £1 billion. Around 7 million people
in the United Kingdom regularly receive private
dental treatment.
Partnerships
In 2000 the DH signed an agreement with the
independent healthcare sector (which comprises
the private and voluntary sectors), covering care,
and workforce and service planning. It involves the
NHS using the independent sector’s spare
capacity; transfer of patients between the two
sectors; exchange of information; and joint
working on preventive and rehabilitation services.
The publication of Growing Capacity: independent
sector diagnosis and treatment centres in 2002
marked the launch of a procurement process for a
series of independent sector diagnosis and
treatment centre projects, with expressions of
interest being invited from both UK and overseas
independent healthcare providers (see page 184).
When fully operational there are expected to be 34
independent sector treatment centres in England
providing services for NHS patients. These will
complement 46 NHS-run centres that will treat an
additional 144,000 patients a year when fully
operational by the end of 2005.
In April 2004 the Government announced two
supplementary contracts to be run by Nuffield
Hospitals and Capio Healthcare UK, to perform
almost 25,000 hip, knee and other operations for
the NHS in 2004/05. The combined contract value
is about £75 million and will make use of existing
spare capacity in independent hospitals.
Complementary and alternative
medicine
There has been an increasing interest in, and use
of, complementary and alternative medicine
(CAM) in recent years. An ONS survey published
in 2001 found that one in ten people in the United
Kingdom had used a complementary therapy in
the last year.
Two CAM professions (osteopaths and
chiropractors) are regulated by law. In March 2004
the Government published proposals to regulate
herbal medicine and acupuncture practitioners.
The proposals would mean that those who meet
the required standards of competence will be
included on a register of practitioners who are
entitled to practise. Sanctions, including removal
from the register, will be applied to those whose
fitness to practise is impaired.
In November 2003 NICE (see page 197) published
clinical guidance giving cautious endorsement of
some complementary medicines in easing the
symptoms of multiple sclerosis. The guidelines
recognised the role of therapies such as fish oils,
reflexology and t’ai chi.

The legal framework
The United Kingdom has three legal systems
(operating in England and Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland) and three systems of criminal
justice. In each system there is emphasis on the
independence of both prosecuting authorities and
the judiciary, but unlike many countries, there is
no single criminal or penal code that sets out the
principles on which the justice system operates.
The criminal law presumes that a person is
innocent until proven guilty. The standard of
proof required is that the evidence should
establish guilt ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. In civil
law - which is primarily concerned with regulating
disputes between individuals or organisations - a
case only has to be proved on the ‘balance of
probabilities’. In both criminal and civil cases, the
courts make their decisions on an adversarial
rather than an inquisitorial basis.
In all three legal systems many areas of law have
developed over the centuries through the decisions
of the courts. Consistency is achieved because the
decisions of higher courts are binding on those
lower down. The House of Lords is currently the
ultimate appeal court in the United Kingdom,
except for Scottish criminal cases. However, in June
2003, the Government announced its intention to
create a new independent Supreme Court, separate
from the House of Lords, which would take over its
judicial functions. These plans would also bring to
an end the post of Lord Chancellor (see page 213)
and establish an independent Judicial
Appointments Commission. A Constitutional
Reform Bill (see page 46) to enact these changes
was published in Lebruary 2004.
Statutes passed by the Westminster or Scottish
Parliaments are the ultimate source of law. As the
United Kingdom is a member of the European
Union (EU, see page 67) there is also a legal duty
to comply with European Community (EC) law.
Courts in the United Kingdom are obliged to
apply the latter in cases where the two conflict. A
statute may confer power on a minister, local
authority or other executive body to make
delegated legislation (see page 51).
EC law is derived from the EC treaties, from the
Community legislation adopted under them, and
from the decisions of the European Court of
Justice. Under the Treaties of Rome, that court has
International co-operation against
crime
Measures in the Crime (International Co¬
operation) Act 2003 are intended to improve
international co-operation against terrorism,
money laundering, people trafficking and
financial crime. They include:
■ paving the way for the United Kingdom to
have access to the Schengen information
database of missing and wanted persons and
items, covering the whole of the EU;
■ improved arrangements for police surveillance
between EU countries;
■ mutual recognition between EU countries of
orders to freeze evidence, so that the
authorities in one country will act swiftly on
the court order of another;
■ modernising UK counterfeiting laws to cover
payment methods such as direct debit;
■ making terrorist offences committed outside
the United Kingdom by UK citizens offences
under UK law; and
■ recognition of driving disqualifications across
EU Member States.

the highest authority to decide points of EC law.
Where a point arises before a UK court, it may
refer the point of law to the Court of Justice for it
to decide. Sometimes a court is obliged to make a
reference to the European Court.
The European Convention on Human Rights was
incorporated into UK law under the Human
Rights Act 1998. It guarantees the right to a fair
trial, to freedom of thought and expression, and to
respect for family and private life. All public
authorities, including the courts, must act
compatibly with these rights. The rights in the
Convention do not take precedence over an Act of
Parliament. Where they conflict, the higher courts
may make a declaration of incompatibility and
Parliament then decides what action to take.
Crime in the United Kingdom
There are two main measures of the extent of
crime in the United Kingdom: surveys of the
public and the recording of crimes by the police.
The British Crime Survey (BCS - covering
England and Wales) and similar surveys of the
public in Scotland and Northern Ireland give a
more complete measure of many types of crime
because they include offences that are not reported
to the police. They also give a more reliable picture
of trends, as they are not affected by the extent to
which the public report crime to the police or by
variations in police recording practice. Recorded
crime statistics are affected by reporting and
recording practices. In England and Wales there
have been major changes to the recording of
crimes since 1997/98.
The BCS1 estimated that 11.7 million crimes were
committed against adults living in private
households in England and Wales in the 12
months before interview in 2003/04, a 5 per cent
decrease on the previous year (Figure 14.1). The
risk of being a victim of crime during this period
was estimated at around 26 per cent, one-third
lower than the risk in 1995 (40 per cent).
The most recent surveys in Scotland (covering
crime in 1999) and Northern Ireland (covering
crime in 2000-01) both estimated that the risk of

crimes such as illegal drug use are not covered.

respondents were asked to recall their experience of crime in the
previous calendar year. From 2001/02, when the BCS became a
continuous survey, the recall period was changed to the 12
months prior to interview.

being a victim of crime was 20 per cent. In both
cases, crime had fallen since the previous survey.
In England and Wales the term ‘recorded crime’ is
used for crime and attempted crime recorded by
the police and notified to the Home Office (so
called ‘notifiable offences’). All indictable and
triable-either-way offences (see page 214) have to
be notified, but few of the ‘summary’ offences
(such as motoring offences) that are dealt with by
magistrates. Similar terminology is used in
Northern Ireland, but in Scotland the term
‘crimes’ is reserved for the more serious offences
(roughly equivalent to indictable and triable-
either-way) while less serious crimes are called
‘offences’.
Differences in legal systems and recording
practices mean that recorded crime statistics from
the different parts of the United Kingdom are not
exactly comparable. However, Table 14.2 suggests
that the crime rate is higher in England and Wales,
and that a higher proportion of crime is detected
(see glossary) in Scotland.
In 2003/04 in England and Wales, 52 per cent of
offences recorded by the police involved forms of
theft or burglary, while 19 per cent involved
violence (Figure 14.3).

In 2002, 481,000 people were cautioned for, or
found guilty of an indictable offence in England
and Wales - about 3 per cent more than in 2001.
Young people aged between 16 and 24 were by far
the most likely to be cautioned or convicted and in
every age group the rate for males was much
higher than that for females (Table 14.4).
Some 125,000 people were convicted in Scottish
courts in 2002, 4 per cent more than in 2001.
There were increases in convictions for crimes
such as serious assault, shoplifting, drugs and
drink-driving, partly offset by decreases for crimes
such as robbery, other theft and speeding.

later in the chapter. However, a number of
agencies have a wider remit.
The British Transport Police (BTP) aims to ensure a
safe railway environment that is free from
disruption and the fear of crime. BTP’s remit covers
rail operators, staff and passengers throughout
Great Britain and also includes the London
Underground, the Docklands Light Railway and
two tram systems - the Midland Metro and
Croydon Tramlink. The force dealt with 83,000
crimes and 50,000 minor offences in 2003/04. A
Police Authority for the BTP was set up in 2004.
The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS)
works on behalf of all UK law enforcement
agencies. It provides strategic and tactical
intelligence on serious and organised crime, both
nationally and internationally. It is the gateway for
UK law enforcement enquiries overseas via the
International Criminal Police Organisation
(Interpol), the European Police Office (Europol)
and the overseas liaison officers networks. It also
coordinates on behalf of police forces with the
Security Service, in accordance with the Security
Service Act 1996. Subject to legislation, NCIS will
become part of a new Serious Organised Crime
Agency in 2006 (see below).
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigates and
prosecutes serious and complex fraud in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. It employs multi-
disciplined teams of lawyers, accountants, police
officers and other specialists and has wide powers
that go beyond those normally available to the
police and prosecuting authorities. Under the
Criminal Justice Act 1987, staff authorised by the
Director of the SFO have powers to require a
person to answer questions, provide information
or produce documents for an investigation.

Vehicle crime
The risk of a vehicle-owning household in
England and Wales having its car stolen is about
once every 77 years. The Home Office Car Theft
Index for 2003 showed that older cars (aged
11-15 years) are more likely to be stolen than
new cars (three years old or less). Cars that were
13 years old (registered in 1989) were most at
risk, with a theft rate of 30 cars per 1,000
registered, compared with just 5 per 1,000 for
cars registered in each year between 1996 and
2001. The more sophisticated security measures
now fitted as standard to new cars are thought
to be the main reason for the difference.

Measures to reduce crime
Various agencies and departments are involved in
a range of crime reduction measures with the aim
of reducing the social and economic costs that crime
can have on individuals and on society as a whole.
Organised crime
A new strategy for tackling organised crime was
set out in a White Paper in March 2004 {One Step
Ahead: a 21st Century Strategy to Defeat Organised
Crime). The proposed measures include:
■ new powers to disrupt criminal activity and
convict those responsible;
■ better use of existing powers such as tax,
immigration and planning laws;
■ the creation of a new Serious Organised
Crime Agency; and
■ closer co-operation between the Immigration
Service, Special Branch and Customs.
It is proposed that the Serious Organised Crime
Agency will come into existence in April 2006,
bringing together the responsibilities of the
National Crime Squad (see page 212), the NCIS,
the investigative and intelligence work of HM
Customs and Excise, and the Home Office’s
responsibilities for immigration crime. The agency
will employ experts with technological, financial,
criminal intelligence and investigative skills. People
smuggling and drug trafficking are two of the
areas that will be targeted.
Community safety
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998, as amended by
the Police Reform Act 2002, places a statutory
requirement on responsible authorities to work
with other local agencies and organisations to
develop and implement strategies to tackle crime
and disorder and misuse of drugs in their area.
These statutory partnerships are known as Crime
and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs), or
Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) in other
parts of the United Kingdom. The responsible
authorities are the police, local authorities, fire and
police authorities and Primary Care Trusts (health
authorities in Wales). There are 376 partnerships
in England and Wales, supported and monitored
by ten Home Office regional teams in the
Government Offices (see page 12) and the
National Assembly for Wales (see page 18).
The Building Safer Communities Fund is a three-
year programme for CDRPs, running from
2003/04. The aim is to encourage problem-solving
approaches based on a knowledge of ‘what works.
Examples include:
■ tackling drug-related crime and strengthening
communities against drugs;
■ tackling repeat victimisation through anti¬
burglary projects;
■ measures to reduce anti-social behaviour
through pub watch schemes; and
■ work with young people at risk of truancy
and offending.
Within the Scottish Executive Justice Department,
the Crime Prevention Unit has responsibility for
developing crime prevention and community
safety policy on behalf of Scottish ministers. All
32 local councils in Scotland have formed non-
statutory CSPs bringing together the four key
agencies - local authorities, police, fire and health
boards or trusts - as well as other public, private
and voluntary sector organisations. The Scottish
Executive has also formed a Scottish Forum on
Community Safety, which brings together at a
national level all the key agencies involved.
The Community Safety Unit within the Criminal
Justice Directorate of the Northern Ireland Office
is helping to establish 26 local CSPs. These
partnerships are developing local action plans,
based on an audit of crime and disorder issues.

14 Crime and justice
Anti-social behaviour
Anti-social behaviour covers a wide range of
unacceptable behaviour and disorder, including
harassment, intimidation, graffiti, vandalism,
drunk and disorderly behaviour, begging and
litter. The Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003
included measures to help tackle
such behaviour in England and Wales, for
example:
■ widening the use of fixed penalty notices
against problems such as noise nuisance,
truancy and graffiti;
■ encouraging parents to prevent and tackle
anti-social behaviour by their children;
■ enabling the swift closure of premises used in
connection with the production, use or
supply of class A drugs (see glossary);
■ allowing for the dispersal of groups in order
to counter ongoing or likely harassment,
intimidation, alarm or distress to members of
the public; and
■ changes to improve the operation of anti¬
social behaviour orders (ASBOs).
ASBOs, first introduced in 1999, are effective for a
minimum of two years. They are civil orders that
can be used to prohibit an offender (aged ten or
over) from committing specific anti-social acts or
from entering defined areas. The Home Office
published its national action plan and launched
the TOGETHER campaign against anti-social
behaviour in October 2003.
The Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2003
provided for the extension of ASBOs to 12- to
15-year-olds; the extension of electronic tagging to
Mobile phone use while driving
It has been illegal to use a mobile phone while
driving in Great Britain since December 2003,
and since March 2004 in Northern Ireland. The
maximum penalty, if the matter goes to court, is
£1,000 for drivers of cars and £2,500 for drivers
of buses, coaches, vans and lorries. The law does
permit 999 calls made in a genuine emergency
and the use of hands-free equipment, if drivers
have proper control of their vehicle.
v_ 
under 16s; and parenting orders to make parents
act in the best interests of their children. The
Scottish Executive is providing £95 million over
2004 to 2006 to fund the implementation of the
provisions of the Act.
Domestic violence
Domestic violence accounts for nearly a fifth of all
violent crime in England and Wales. In 2002,
36,000 incidents of domestic abuse were reported
to Scottish police and 13 women were killed by
their partner or former partner. The Domestic
Violence, Crime and Victims Bill, introduced into
Parliament at the end of 2003, proposed the
biggest overhaul of domestic violence legislation in
England and Wales for 30 years. It includes a range
of measures that would provide additional
protection and support for victims and help to
bring perpetrators to justice. Many of the elements
in this Bill are already in place in Scots law.
The Government’s strategy on domestic violence,
of which the Bill is a part, was outlined in the
consultation paper Safety and Justice, published
in June 2003. It focuses on the prevention of
domestic violence; protection and justice; and
support for victims.
Drugs misuse
According to the Home Office, about 4 million
people in England and Wales use at least one
illicit drug each year and drug misuse results in
£10 billion to £18 billion a year in social and
economic costs. There are strong links between
illegal drug use and crime.
The UK-wide drugs strategy Tackling Drugs to
Build a Better Britain was introduced in 1998 and
updated in 2002 following a review. It focuses on:
■ helping young people resist drug misuse;
■ protecting communities from drug-related
anti-social and criminal behaviour;
■ enabling people to overcome drug problems
through treatment; and
■ reducing the supply of illegal drugs on the
streets.
In England, 147 local Drug Action Teams (DATs)
bring together representatives of relevant agencies
including health and education authorities, social
services and the voluntary sector. DATs work with
CDRPs (see page 206) to help the police and
207
14 Crime and justice
UK 2005
communities tackle drug problems and associated
crime, and contribute to the delivery of the
National Drug Strategy. Similar arrangements
apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Criminal Justice Interventions Programme
(CJIP), which began in April 2003, is a three-year
programme to develop and integrate measures for
directing drug misusing offenders out of crime
and into treatment. It involves criminal justice and
treatment agencies working together with other
services to provide a tailored solution for those
individuals who commit crime in order to fund
their use of Class A drugs (see glossary).
Interventions under the CJIP include drug testing
those who have committed certain types of
offence; enhanced arrest referral (designed to
encourage drug users to take up appropriate
treatment after arrest); community sentencing;
throughcare and aftercare (treatment and support
that begins after sentencing and continues during
and after release from prison); legislative changes
to introduce bail restrictions for those testing
positive for the use of cocaine, heroin or crack;
and additional support for young people.
The programme initially concentrated on areas
with high levels of acquisitive crime, but a year
after it was launched, the Government announced
that it would be expanded to another 36 police
Basic Command Unit (BCU) areas, bringing the
total to 66. The throughcare and aftercare parts of
the programme and enhanced arrest referral are
being phased in across England and Wales.
Cannabis reclassification
In January 2004 cannabis was reclassified from a
Class B to a Class C drug (see glossary) across
the United Kingdom. This means that the
maximum penalty for possession has been
reduced from five years' imprisonment to two
years', although police guidance in England and
Wales recommends that, in the absence of
aggravating factors, adults should usually be
given a warning and have the drug confiscated.
The maximum penalty for supply, dealing,
production and trafficking remains at 14 years'
imprisonment, as the maximum penalty for
Class C substances was raised when cannabis
was reclassified.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their
own drug strategies within the UK framework.
The Scottish Executive has provided funding for
pilot arrest referral schemes. Although not directly
linked to the criminal justice process, they provide
another route into treatment for drug misusing
offenders. Drug treatment and testing orders
(DTTOs) have been made available to courts in
Scotland on a phased basis since 1999. At present
courts covering 70 per cent of the population in
Scotland can make a DTTO and all will have
access to the order by mid-2005. Scotland has
retained the sentencing option of probation with a
condition of treatment, which is intended for
lower tariff offenders than those subject to the
DTTO.
Terrorism
Permanent measures to counter terrorism on a
UK-wide basis were contained in the Terrorism Act
2000 and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security
Act 2001. Provisions in these Acts - which
extended the definition of terrorism to cover
ideological and religious motivation - include:
■ an offence of inciting terrorist acts abroad
from within the United Kingdom;
■ powers to seize suspected terrorist cash at
borders;
■ a judicial authority to consider applications
for extensions of detention of terrorist
suspects;
■ specific offences relating to training for
terrorist activities;
■ offences relating to weapons of mass
destruction;
■ better security at airports and nuclear sites;
and
■ an extension of police powers to detain and
question those suspected of terrorist offences.
The 2001 Act also gave the Home Secretary the
power to certify and detain foreign nationals who
are believed to be international terrorists and a
threat to national security. The provision applies
to people whose removal from the country is
temporarily or indefinitely prevented by a point of
law relating to an international agreement such as
the European Convention on Human Rights, or by
a practical consideration.
At the end of February 2004 the Home Office
began a six-month consultation process to review
208
UK 2005
14 Crime and justice
the existing counter-terrorist provisions and
consider how to take legislation forward.
An emergency EU Justice and Home Affairs
council meeting was held in Brussels in March
2004, following terrorist bombings in Madrid. The
UK Government secured agreement on various
proposals aimed at combating terrorism across the
EU. These included an agreement to establish new
common standards for the retention of
communications data and an agreement to
implement proposals to improve the exchange of
data between countries (for example in respect of
lost or stolen passports).
In the same month the Government announced
£15 million additional funding to help Special
Branch police disrupt and prevent attacks against
the United Kingdom.
Justice in England and Wales
The criminal justice system in England and Wales
consists of several agencies and departments,
which are together responsible for maintaining law
and order and for the administration of justice
(see Figure 14.5 overleaf). The government
departments involved are:
■ The Home Office deals with matters relating
to criminal law, the police, prisons and
probation. The Home Secretary also has
general responsibility for internal security.
■ The Department for Constitutional Affairs
(DCA) deals with matters relating to the
judiciary and (through the Court Service, see
page 212) administers the courts. Under
proposals in the Constitutional Reform Bill
(see page 46) the Lord Chief Justice would
become the professional head of the judiciary
in England and Wales, assuming the new title
of President of the Courts of England and
Wales.
■ The Law Officers’ Departments comprise the
Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the SFO
(see page 205) and the Customs and Excise
Prosecution Office. The CPS is responsible for
the independent prosecution of nearly all
criminal cases instituted by the police.
Criminal justice agencies
The police service
There are 43 police forces organised on a local
basis in England and Wales. The Metropolitan
Police Service and the City of London force are
responsible for policing London.
Police forces are maintained in England and Wales
by local police authorities. In the 41 police areas
outside London they normally have 17 members -
nine locally elected councillors, three magistrates
and five independent members. The authorities set
local policing objectives in consultation with the
chief constables and local community, while the
Government sets ministerial priorities for the
police as a whole. All police forces are subject to
inspection by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary
(HMIC), which reports to the Home Secretary.

Each police force also has a Special Constabulary -
a volunteer force with full constabulary powers.
The main role of special constables is to carry out
local intelligence-based patrols and crime
reduction initiatives, targeted at specific crime
problems. They give up a few hours a week,
typically evenings or weekends, supporting regular
officers and local communities. There were 11,000
special constables in post at the end of March
2003.
Police powers
Police powers and procedures are defined by
legislation and accompanying codes of practice.
Evidence obtained in breach of the codes may be
ruled inadmissible in court. The codes must be
available in all police stations.
Police officers can stop and search people and
vehicles if they reasonably suspect that they will
find stolen goods, offensive weapons or

implements that could be used for burglary and
other offences. The officer must record the grounds
for the search and the person searched is entitled to
a copy of the officer’s report. The police stopped
and searched 868,900 people and 26,400 vehicles in
England and Wales in 2002/03. The total of
895,300 stops and searches was 21 per cent more
than in 2001/02. The same proportion (13 per
cent) led to an arrest as in the previous two years.
The police may arrest a suspect on a warrant
issued by a court, but can also do so without a
warrant for arrestable offences (those for which
the sentence is fixed by law or for which the term
of imprisonment is five years or more).
Suspects must be cautioned before the police can
ask any questions about an offence. As a result of
the Criminal Justice Act 2003, a suspect for an
arrestable offence can be detained in police
custody without charge for up to 36 hours.
Someone suspected of a serious arrestable offence
can be held for up to 96 hours, but not beyond 36
hours unless a warrant is obtained from a
magistrates’ court. The Act also allows the police
to take fingerprints and DNA samples from people
who have been arrested and detained at police
stations. This was only previously possible once
the person had been charged.
As another result of the 2003 Act, the CPS is
responsible for determining the charge in all but
minor and routine offences. In certain cases a
caution (reprimand or formal warning for youth
offenders) may be more appropriate than a
prosecution. A caution is not the same as a
conviction, and will only be given if the person
admits the offence. Young offenders (those aged
10-17) are given a reprimand for most first
offences, and a final warning for a second offence,
at which point they are referred to the local Youth
Offending Team (see page 218). However, each
case is looked at individually and all factors,
including the seriousness of the offence and the
impact on the victim, are considered before
deciding on the best course of action.
Once a person is charged, he or she may be
released on bail to attend a magistrates’ court. If
not granted police bail, the defendant must be
brought before a court as soon as possible. There
is a general right to bail, but magistrates may
withhold it. In certain circumstances, the
prosecution may appeal to a Crown Court judge
against the granting of bail by magistrates.
Complaints against the police
Members of the public can make complaints
against the police if they feel they have been
treated unfairly or improperly, if they feel the
police have not given them sufficient information,
or if they are not happy with the outcome of an
investigation by the police. Under the Police
Reform Act 2002, a new system has been set up,
and the Independent Police Complaints
Commission (IPCC) replaced the Police
Complaints Authority in April 2004. The IPCC
has the power to supervise or manage a police
investigation or to conduct its own investigation.
It is also responsible for monitoring the way
complaints are handled by local police forces.
Community relations
A number of measures have been taken in recent
years to improve relations between the police and
the community. These include stricter regulation
of stop and search powers, ten-year minority
ethnic employment targets for recruitment,
regression and retention in the police service; a
complete overhaul in the way racist incidents are
handled; and community and race relations
training for over 130,000 police personnel. Racial
discrimination by the police was made unlawful by
the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, which
also gave them a duty to promote race equality.
The Police Reform Act 2002 included powers for
the Home Secretary to make statutory codes of
practice and regulations governing policing
practices and procedures.
Community Support Officers (CSOs) play a
complementary role to police officers in tackling
disorder and anti-social behaviour. They carry out
routine patrols to increase visible policing in the
community, and provide reassurance to the public.
CSOs help free up the time of police officers,
enabling them to tackle more serious crimes. The
Police Reform Act allows chief officers to give CSOs
limited powers to deal with anti-social behaviour
and disorder, including a power of detention for
30 minutes (currently being piloted in six forces);
issuing penalty notices for minor offences; and
dealing with abandoned vehicles.
Neighbourhood wardens are employed by local
authorities and housing associations to provide a
highly visible, uniformed and semi-official
presence in residential and public areas, town
centres and high-crime areas. Their overall
211
14 Crime and justice
UK 2005
purpose is to improve quality of life and
contribute to the regeneration of their areas.
Specialist crime bodies
The National Crime Squad (NCS) is concerned
with serious and organised crime that transcends
national and international boundaries - for
example, money laundering, counterfeiting, and
the illegal trafficking of arms or drugs. The NCS
will form part of the new Serious Organised
Crime Agency in 2006 (see page 206).
The Forensic Science Service (FSS) is an executive
agency of the Home Office that provides forensic
science services to police forces through its seven
regional laboratories. As well as being a source of
training, consultancy and scientific support, it
operates the national DNA database in England
and Wales, which is used to match DNA profiles
taken from suspects to profiles from samples left at
scenes of crime.
The Police Scientific Development Branch of the
Home Office provides technical, operational and
policy support for the UK law enforcement
community, including police forces. It evaluates,

equipment and techniques.
Prosecution authorities
The CPS is a single independent authority for
England and Wales which, in common with other
agencies of the criminal justice system, is
organised in 42 local areas, each with its own Chief
Crown Prosecutor. The head of the CPS is the
Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who is
superintended by the Attorney General. The
responsibilities of the CPS include:
■ giving pre-charge and early advice to the
police, in accordance with statutory guidance
issued by the DPP;
■ deciding on the appropriate charge or other
disposal (for example a caution or
reprimand);
■ continuously reviewing each case throughout
its lifetime;
■ dealing with disclosure issues;
■ conducting the prosecution of cases in the
magistrates’ and Crown courts;
■ preparing and conducting cases, including
instructing counsel for hearings and/or
applications in all higher courts; and
■ keeping victims informed of the progress of
cases, including informing and if necessary
meeting with them when charges are altered
or dropped.
HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate is the
independent Inspectorate for the CPS. Its purpose
is to promote improvement in the efficiency,
effectiveness and fairness of the prosecution
service through a process of inspection, evaluation
and identification of good practice.
Other prosecuting authorities include the SFO
(see page 205), which also answers to the Attorney
General, and bodies such as the Inland Revenue,
HM Customs and Excise commissioners, local
authorities and trading standards departments, all
of which prosecute cases in their own discrete areas
of work. Individual citizens may bring private
prosecutions for most crimes, but some need the
consent of the Attorney General and these cases
may be taken over by the DPP.
Criminal courts
The Court Service, an executive agency of the
DCA, is responsible for the administration of the
Crown Court, High Court and Court of Appeal.
Magistrates’ courts are administered locally by
Magistrates’ Courts Committees, working within a
national framework set by the DCA. However, the
Courts Act 2003 provided for a new unified courts
administration to be created by April 2005,
combining the functions of the Court Service and
the Magistrates’ Courts Committees. This will be
called HM Courts Service, and will operate as an
agency of the DCA.
About 96 per cent of criminal cases are dealt with
at a magistrates’ court. Cases may be tried by lay
magistrates (usually three sitting together) or by a
District Judge (Magistrates’ Court) who usually
sits alone. District Judges are legally qualified and
salaried, while magistrates (also known as Justices
of the Peace) are unpaid, and advised on the law
and procedure by a qualified clerk.
Magistrates cannot normally pass sentences of
imprisonment that exceed six months or fines
exceeding £5,000. From December 2005
magistrates will be able to give consecutive
sentences of up to 12 months, as a result of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003. In triable-either-way
cases the magistrates may commit the offender to
the Crown Court if a more severe sentence is
thought necessary.
212
UK 2005
14 Crime and justice
The Crown Court tries more serious criminal
cases, as well as hearing appeals from the
magistrates’ courts. It sits in 78 main Crown Court
Centres, divided into six regions known as circuits.
Trial of cases is by a jury2 of 12 people (see page
216) selected at random from the Electoral
Register and directed on matters of law by a judge.
Only a High Court Judge can try the more serious
offences.
A Coroner (usually a senior lawyer or doctor)
must hold an inquest if a person died a violent or
unnatural death, or died while in prison or in
other specified circumstances. He or she may also
need to hold an inquest if the cause of death
remains unknown following a post-mortem
examination.
The Coroner’s Court establishes how, when and
where the death occurred. A Coroner may sit alone
or, in certain circumstances, with a jury. Following
a consultation process in 2003 a programme of
reform of the coroner service in England and
Wales is under way, and is expected to be
completed by around 2008.
The judiciary
Judges are appointed from the ranks of practising
barristers and solicitors. They have independence
of office and can be removed only in rare and
limited circumstances involving misconduct or
incapacity. They are not subject to ministerial
control or direction.
Most judicial appointments are filled through
advertised open competition. Applicants are
considered by a panel consisting of a judge, a lay
member and a senior civil servant who acts as
chairman, with input from members of the
judicial community through a consultation
process. Chosen candidates are then recommended
to the Lord Chancellor.
Appointments to the High Court are also
advertised, although not confined to those who
apply. Candidates are considered by a wide
consultation process, and discussed with the senior
judiciary, following which the Lord Chancellor
makes his recommendations to The Queen.
2 Under provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 a judge may sit
alone in a limited number of cases involving threats and
intimidation of juries. The Act also paved the way for judge-alone
trial in a small number of exceptionally long, complex fraud cases.
The Constitutional Reform Bill (see page 46),
which would abolish the post of Lord Chancellor,
also seeks to replace the current arrangements for
appointing judges with an independent Judicial
Appointments Commission (JAC). The Secretary
of State for Constitutional Affairs would only be
able to appoint candidates recommended by the
JAC and would have limited powers to reject its
recommendations.
The Lord Chancellor has traditionally been
regarded as the head of the judiciary: under
proposals in the Bill the Lord Chief Justice would
become the professional head of the judiciary in
England and Wales, assuming the new title of
President of the Courts of England and Wales.
The legal profession
Although people are free to conduct their own
cases if they so wish, barristers and solicitors, or
other authorised litigators, generally represent the
interests of parties to a dispute. Barristers practise
as individuals, but may join a group of other
barristers in Chambers. Solicitors usually operate
in partnership with other solicitors, but some are
self-employed. Large firms employ not only
qualified solicitors, but also legal executives and
support staff. The Bar Council is the regulatory
and representative body for barristers, and the Law
Society performs a similar function for solicitors.
The Legal Services Ombudsman oversees the way
in which the relevant professional bodies handle
complaints about barristers, solicitors and other
legal practitioners.
The prison service
Since the end of June 2004, the National Offender
Management Service (NOMS - see page 214) has
had overall responsibility for HM Prison Service
(HMPS). There are 139 prisons in England and
Wales, including ten that are privately run.
Accommodation includes high security prisons,
open prisons, young offender institutions and
remand centres.
Adult male sentenced prisoners are classified into
different groups for security purposes, ranging
from Category A (whose escape would seriously
endanger the public or the security of the state) to
Category D (prisoners who can reasonably be
trusted in open conditions). Women are held in
separate prisons or in separate accommodation in
mixed prisons. Remand prisoners (those currently
213
14 Crime and justice
UK 2005
awaiting trial) enjoy wider rights and privileges
than convicted prisoners.
Every prison establishment in England and Wales
has an Independent Monitoring Board comprising
volunteers drawn from the local community and
appointed by the Home Secretary. They perform a
‘watchdog’ role on behalf of ministers and the
general public by providing day-to-day
independent oversight of prisons to ensure that
prisoners are being cared for decently and with
humanity.
National Offender Management
Service
Following an independent review of correctional
services, the Home Secretary announced in
January 2004 that the prison and probation
services would work more closely as a single
service. The National Offender Management
Service (NOMS) will focus on reducing
reoffending by ensuring that offenders are
managed throughout their sentence, both in
custody and in the community. Over time, it is
anticipated that the private and voluntary sectors
will have an increased opportunity to provide
services to NOMS. The process of establishing
NOMS began in June 2004.
HM Inspectorate of Prisons is an independent
body that inspects prisons and reports on the
treatment of prisoners and prison conditions. It
submits annual reports to the Home Secretary.
Each prison establishment is visited about once
every three years.
Probation service
The National Probation Service (NPS) is based in
42 areas, with the same boundaries as the police
and CPS. The NPS supervises offenders in the
community under direct court orders and on
release on licence from custody. The caseload on
any given day is in excess of 200,000. Each year the
NPS assists magistrates and judges in their
sentencing decisions through the provision of
about 253,000 pre-sentence reports, and 10,000
bail information reports.
HM Inspectorate of Probation reports
independently to ministers on the performance of
the NPS. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman
investigates complaints from prisoners and those
subject to probation supervision, or those upon
whom reports have been written. The
Ombudsman is appointed by the Home Secretary
and is independent of both the Prison Service and
the NPS.
The prosecution process
When deciding whether or not to charge, the CPS
must first consider whether there is enough
evidence to provide a realistic prospect of
conviction, and then consider whether it would be
in the public interest to prosecute. This two-stage
test is set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
If there is insufficient evidence or prosecution
would not be in the public interest, the CPS has
the authority to discontinue or otherwise
terminate the proceedings. It has a continuing
duty to review cases and can determine whether to
continue with a charge or deal with the matter by
way of a caution, reprimand or final warning.
The flow of cases through the criminal justice
system is shown in Figure 14.7.
Court procedures
Summary offences are the least serious and may be
tried only in the magistrates’ court. Indictable-
only offences, such as murder, manslaughter or
robbery, must be tried by a judge and jury in the
Crown Court on ‘indictment’.3 Triable-either-way
offences are dealt with as summary offences unless
the magistrates decide the case is more suitable for
the Crown Court, or the defendant elects to be
tried in the Crown Court.
Trial
The law presumes an accused person is innocent
until proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt by
the prosecution. Accused people have a right at all
stages to stay silent; however, when questioned,
failure to mention facts that they later rely upon in
their defence may not be helpful to their case. If
the defendant pleads guilty, the judge will decide
upon the appropriate sentence.
Criminal trials normally take place in open court
(that is, members of the public and press are
allowed to hear the proceedings) unless there are
specific reasons why this would not be

appropriate. If a ‘not guilty’ plea is entered, the
prosecution and defence form opposing sides in
an adversarial system. They call and examine
witnesses and present opposing versions of the
case. Strict rules of evidence govern how this may
be done. Written statements by witnesses are
allowed with the consent of the other party or in
limited circumstances at the discretion of the
court. Otherwise evidence is taken from witnesses
testifying orally on oath.
The Courts Act 2003 includes provisions for a
Criminal Procedure Rule Committee. Working to
a programme agreed by the criminal justice
ministers, the Committee will make rules for all
criminal courts in England and Wales, including
magistrates’ courts, the Crown Court and the
Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). The
membership of the Committee has been devised
to ensure that the key parties involved in a
criminal trial have the opportunity to help in
modernising and streamlining the criminal trial
process. The aim will be to make rules that are
both simple and simply expressed. It is expected
that the Committee will be established later in
2004 and that the first Criminal Procedure Rules
will come into force in 2005.
Publicly funded legal service
Advice and assistance are available without
reference to an individual’s means to anyone
who is arrested and held in custody at a police
station, or other premises, or who appears before
a court.
A defendant charged with a criminal offence may
apply for a representation order, which will entitle
him or her to the services of a solicitor and/or
barrister, depending on the type of case. The court
must be satisfied that it is in the interests of justice
that publicly funded representation should be
granted. In the Crown Court, judges have the
power to order a defendant to pay some or all of
the defence costs.
In criminal proceedings, the Legal Services
Commission, through the Criminal Defence
Service, makes arrangements for duty solicitors to
assist unrepresented defendants in the magistrates
courts. Advocacy assistance is also available in
some other specified circumstances. During
2002/03 over 1.5 million acts of assistance were
granted by the Criminal Defence Service at a total
net cost of around £526 million. Criminal legal aid
Public Defender Offices are being piloted in eight
areas. In these areas the Public Defender Service
(PDS) directly employs solicitors and offers a
complete service to clients from the police station,
through the magistrates’ court and on to the
Crown Court as appropriate. Clients may choose
whether to be represented by PDS or duty
solicitors. An independent evaluation of these
pilots is due to report in 2005.
The jury
Around 500,000 jurors are selected at random by
computer every year. They are chosen from the
Electoral Register for the surrounding area near
the Crown Court and must be aged over 18 and
under 70. They are expected to attend the court
for around two weeks or for the duration of any
trial for which they are selected.
In jury trials, the judge decides questions of law,
sums up the case to the jury, and discharges or
sentences the accused. A jury is independent of the
judiciary, and is responsible for deciding questions
of fact. The jury’s verdict may be ‘guilty’ or ‘not
guilty’ and the latter would result in an acquittal.
Juries may, subject to certain conditions, reach a
verdict by a majority of at least 10-2.
If an accused person is acquitted by a jury, there is
no right of appeal from the prosecution and the
accused cannot be tried again for that same
offence, except in serious cases where new and
compelling evidence has come to light. However,
an acquittal may be set aside and a retrial ordered
if the High Court is satisfied that a juror or a
witness has been interfered with or intimidated,
and there is a real possibility that the acquittal
would not have happened but for the interference
or intimidation. Any attempt to interfere with
jurors or witnesses is a criminal offence.
Sentencing and appeals
The court sentences the offender after considering
all the relevant information, which may include
pre-sentence or any other specialist reports, and a
mitigating plea by the defence. A range of
sentences are available, depending on the type of
court and the seriousness of the offence:
work in the Crown Court and higher courts
amounted to a further £569 million.

■ discharge (which can be absolute, or
conditional on not committing another
offence);
■ monetary (for example fines, compensation
orders and confiscation orders);
■ custody (which can be immediate or
suspended in whole or in part); and
■ community sentence.
In 2002, 336,700 offenders were sentenced for
indictable offences in England and Wales. Table
14.8 shows how the form of sentence varied
according to the type of offence committed. A
majority of those convicted of drug offences were
fined or discharged, while a majority of those
convicted of robbery, sexual offences or burglary
were given immediate custodial sentences. Overall,
one in three offenders were given community
sentences.
Community sentences
A community punishment order (formerly
community service) means that the offender has to
do a certain number of hours of unpaid work for
the community. If the offender is in employment,
he or she will be expected to do it during his or her
own time. The work is organised by the NFS.
A community rehabilitation order (formerly
probation order) means that, for the duration of
the order, the offender will be under the
supervision of a probation officer. Offenders who
fail to comply with the terms of an order may be
taken back to court where they can be re-sentenced
for the offence. Other types of community sentence
include attendance centre orders, and drug
treatment and testing orders. In order to provide
more flexible options for sentencers, the Criminal
Justice Act 2003 has created a single community
sentence under which the various types of
community order are available.
Custodial sentences
Imprisonment is the most severe penalty available
to the courts, and is generally only available for the
more serious offences, each of which has a
maximum prison term usually specified by an Act
of Parliament. Life imprisonment is the
mandatory sentence for murder, and is also
available for certain other serious offences. There
are mandatory minimum sentences for serious
repeat offenders. Any time spent in custody before
the trial usually counts towards the prison sentence.
One in four of those convicted of an indictable
offence in 2002 in England and Wales were given a
custodial sentence (Table 14.8). The prison
population has increased in recent years. In
December 2003 there were over 74,000 prisoners,
an increase of 2 per cent over the previous year.
Appeals
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may
appeal to the Crown Court against the conviction
217
14 Crime and justice
UK 2005
and/or the sentence imposed, or on a point of law,
by judicial review or case stated, to the High Court.
Appeals from the Crown Court go to the Court of
Appeal (Criminal Division). This normally sits in
London at the Royal Courts of Justice and is
presided over by the Lord Chief Justice, who is the
most senior judge in England and Wales.
A further appeal can be made to the House of
Lords on points of law of public importance, if
permission is given. Under proposals in the
Constitutional Reform Bill (see page 46), the
judicial functions of the House of Lords would be
undertaken by an independent Supreme Court.
The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which is
independent of both government and the courts,
reviews alleged miscarriages of justice that have
been through the appeal process. It can refer the
case back to the Court of Appeal if it considers
there is a real possibility that a conviction or
sentence would not be upheld. This only occurs in
a very small number of cases. Referral of a case to
the Commission depends on some new argument
or evidence coming to light that was not raised at
the trial or on appeal.
Youth justice
The youth justice system comprises Youth
Offending Teams (Yots), the police, youth courts
and the institutions in which young people are
held in custody. The Youth Justice Board (YJB) for
England and Wales is a non-departmental public
body that maintains and oversees the operation of
the youth justice system as a whole.
Every local authority in England and Wales is
served by a Yot, made up of representatives from
the police, NFS, social services, health, and
education. Yots also have access to services
concerned with drug and alcohol misuse, and in
some cases housing staff. The Yot uses a national
assessment system to identify the specific problems
that make the young person offend and to
measure the risk he or she poses to others. This
enables the Yot to identify suitable programmes to
address the needs of the young person with the
intention of preventing further offending.
Youth courts
When someone under the age of 18 is charged
with an offence, his or her case is heard by either a
youth court or the Crown Court depending on the
severity of the offence and whether he or she is
co-accused with an adult. The youth court is a
magistrates’ court especially established to deal with
young people. It is served by Youth Panel Magistrates
and District Judges. They have the power to give
detention and training orders of up to 24 months, as
well as a range of community sentences. Youth courts
are less formal than adult courts and hearings are not
held in public. However, the victim of the crime can
ask to attend the hearing, and victims often have
the opportunity to make an input to the sentencing
process through the Yot.
Sentencing
Young people who plead guilty to a first offence in
court must receive a referral order, unless they are
given an absolute discharge or fine, or the offence
is so serious that a custodial sentence is required.
The young person is required to attend a Youth
Offender Panel, which is made up of a Yot officer
and two volunteers from the local community. The
Panel agrees a contract lasting between 3 and 12
months with the young person, his or her parents
or carers, and the victim (where appropriate). The
contract can include attending programmes to
address offending behaviour, repairing the harm
done by their offence or one of a variety of other
actions.
Reparation orders require the young person to
address the harm caused by the offence.
Reparation can be made to the victim or to the
community. Examples include cleaning up graffiti
or undertaking appropriate community work. The
order is overseen by the Yot. Other non-custodial
sentences can include fines, action plan orders,
attendance centre orders, and supervision orders.
Custodial sentences
The main custodial sentence for offenders aged 12
to 17 is the detention and training order. Half of
the order is spent in custody and the other half
under supervision in the community, although
early release from custody is available in certain
circumstances.
There are three types of secure accommodation in
which a young person can be placed: secure
training centres, local authority secure children’s
homes and young offender institutions. The Youth
Justice Board is responsible for purchasing
bedspaces, placing young people in appropriate
secure accommodation and setting the standards
for these facilities.

Civil justice
Jurisdiction in civil matters in England and Wales
is administered mainly by the county courts and
the High Court, the latter handling the more
substantial and complex cases. County courts also
handle family proceedings, such as divorce,
domestic violence and matters affecting children.
Magistrates’ courts have civil jurisdiction in family
matters (when they sit as a Family Proceedings
Court) and in miscellaneous civil orders, but do
not deal with divorce cases.
Most civil disputes are dealt with through statutory
or voluntary complaint mechanisms, or through
mediation and negotiation. Arbitration is common
in commercial and building disputes. Ombudsmen
have the power to determine complaints in the
public sector and, on a voluntary basis, in some
private sector activities (for example, banking,
insurance and pensions). Many cases where a claim
is issued do not go to trial because the parties settle
out of court. Other cases are determined without
trial because the case has no merit (summary
judgment), or the defendant does not respond to
the claim (judgment in default), or the defendant
offers to pay by instalments.
Successful actions taken in the civil courts can
result in damages being awarded to the individual
pursuing the claim. The amount awarded in each
case varies according to the circumstances.
The number of claims issued in the civil courts has
declined following a peak in the late 1980s and
early 1990s (Figure 14.9). In 2003, 1.57 million
claims were entered, a decrease of over 3 per cent
since 2002. Money claims represented 86 per cent
of the total. Most of the remainder were actions
for the recovery of residential premises.
The Court Service (see also page 212) is
responsible for the administration of the Court of
Appeal, High Court, county courts, probate service
and a number of tribunals.
Tribunals
There are some 80 tribunals in England and Wales
which together deal with over 1 million disputes a
year. Most are concerned with cases that involve
the rights of private citizens against decisions of
the State in areas such as social security, income
tax and mental health. Some tribunals deal with
other disputes, such as employment.
Figure 14.9 Writs and summonses
issued in England and Wales
Millions
1 Queen's Bench Division.
Source: Court Service
A new unified tribunals service was announced in
2003. The new service has at its core the top ten
non-devolved tribunals, covering areas such as
employment, immigration, tax and pensions. A
White Paper, Transforming Public Services:
Complaints, Redress and Tribunals, was published in
July 2004. This set out more detailed plans for
unifying the tribunals into a new dispute resolution
service, which is planned to start in 2006.
Courts
The High Court is divided into three Divisions:
■ The Queen’s Bench Division deals with
disputes relating to contracts, general
commercial matters and breaches of duty -
known as ‘liability in tort’ - covering claims of
negligence, nuisance or defamation.
■ The Chancery Division deals with disputes
relating to land, wills, companies and
insolvency.
■ The Family Division deals with matrimonial
matters, including divorce, and the welfare of
children.
Appeals in most civil cases were reformed by the
Access to Justice Act 1999. In most cases a person
must obtain permission before he or she can
appeal. The general principle is that appeal ‘lies’ to
the next level of judge in the court hierarchy. A
county court appeal lies from a District Judge to a
Circuit Judge and from a Circuit Judge to a High
219
14 Crime and justice
UK 2005
Court Judge. In the High Court appeal lies from a
master or District Judge of the High Court to a
High Court Judge and from a High Court Judge to
the Court of Appeal.
As in criminal cases, appeals from magistrates’
courts in civil matters go to the High Court, on
matters of law, or to the Crown Court, if the case
is to be re-heard. A further appeal on points of law
of public importance would go to the House of
Lords.
Proceeding with a claim
Where a claim is not settled, or is subject to
summary or default judgment, there is a system of
three tracks to which disputed claims are assigned
by a judge. These are the:
■ small claims track, for most cases worth less
than £5,000, at an informal hearing by a
District Judge;
■ fast track, for most cases from £5,000 to
£15,000, with a fixed timetable from
allocation to trial; and
■ multi-track, for cases worth over £15,000 or
of unusual complexity or significance, which
are supervised by a judge and given timetables
tailored to each case.
Publicly funded legal services
The Legal Services Commission administers the
Community Legal Service (CLS). The CLS Fund
provides legal help and representation to
qualifying applicants, depending on their personal
financial circumstances and the merits of their
case. It supports eligible people in cases of
divorce and other family issues, and also in
non-family cases including welfare benefits, debt,
housing and property, immigration and
nationality, clinical negligence, and actions
against the police.
Recipients may be asked to make a contribution,
depending on their personal financial
circumstances and the outcome of the case.
During 2003/04 there were 925,000 acts of
assistance under the CLS and the total net
expenditure was £898 million. In recent years,
there has been a switch in emphasis to encourage
early resolution of disputes without recourse to
protracted and expensive legal action.
In addition to providing legal help and
representation in civil matters, CLS activities
extend to providing access to legal advice for the
wider community, in particular via its website
(www.justask.org.uk). CLS Partnerships bring
together organisations offering legal and advice
services into local networks in England and
Wales. These include solicitors, Citizens Advice
(see page 479), law centres, local authority services
and other independent advice centres.
Justice in Scotland
The Scottish Parliament makes laws on matters
devolved to it (see chapter 4 and appendix A).
The Advocate General for Scotland is one of the
three UK law officers, along with the Attorney
General and Solicitor General for England and
Wales, and is the UK Government’s principal legal
adviser on Scots law. The Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland are the Scottish law
officers, as well as being the only non-elected
members of the Scottish Cabinet. They provide the
Scottish Executive with advice on legal matters and
represent its interests in the courts.
The Scottish Executive Justice Department, under
the Minister for Justice, is responsible for the
police service in Scotland, for civil and criminal
justice, criminal justice social work services,
prisons, courts administration, legal aid, and
liaison with the legal profession. The Department
is also responsible for the operation of Scots law as
it relates to international law and relations with
other legal systems, including those of other parts
of the United Kingdom.
Advocates (broadly speaking the Scottish
equivalent of barristers) and Solicitor-Advocates
(who are accredited specifically for civil or
criminal business) have audience in the Supreme
Courts. Solicitors in Scotland (numbering 9,120 in
October 2003) have audience in the Sheriff and
District Courts (see page 222) and in the other
courts and tribunals. They practise largely in
partnerships and incorporated practices.
The professional body for advocates is the Faculty
of Advocates. For solicitors the regulator is the
Law Society of Scotland, which also regulates
conveyancing and executry practitioners. The
Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman oversees the
way in which these bodies handle complaints
against practitioners.

Scots law
The legal principles, rules and concepts of Scots
law can be traced from diverse sources, including
Roman law, canon law and the influences of
other European systems. The main sources are
judge-made law, certain legal treatises having
'institutional' authority, legislation, and EC law.
The first two sources are sometimes referred to as
the common law of Scotland. Legislation, as in
the rest of the United Kingdom, consists of
statutes (Acts of the UK or Scottish Parliament) or
subordinate legislation authorised by the Scottish
or UK Parliament. Many statutory offences are
shared with England and Wales through UK-wide
legislation (for example road traffic law) and laws
relating to issues such as environmental pollution.
Criminal justice agencies
The police
Scotland has eight ‘territorial’ police forces. Other
police forces or UK law enforcement agencies that
operate in Scotland include the British Transport
Police (see page 205), the NCIS (see page 205) and
HM Customs and Excise.
Legal responsibility for policing is shared by police
authorities or joint boards (both made up of local
authority councillors); chief constables; and
Scottish ministers. Police authorities or joint
boards determine the budgets and the resources
available to each force. They also appoint senior
police officers (with the agreement of Scottish
ministers) and determine the number of police
officers and support staff for their areas. Once
appointed, such staff come under the control of
the Chief Constable for the area. The Chief
Constable also has sole responsibility for
operational decisions about police deployment
and law enforcement in the area.
Scottish ministers make regulations concerning the
terms and conditions of police officers. They are
advised by the Police Negotiating Board (on pay
and conditions) and the Police Advisory Board for
Scotland (on other matters).
Police numbers in Scotland reached a record
whole-time equivalent of 15,645 at the end of
March 2004, an increase of 835 since March 1999.
Police powers
The police have a general duty to uphold and
enforce the law and to maintain the peace in
Scotland. They are provided with powers through
both common law and statutory law to carry out
this duty, including powers of arrest and
detention.
The police in Scotland can arrest someone without
a warrant, under wide common law powers, if
suspects are seen or reported as committing a
crime or are a danger to themselves or others.
Someone suspected of a serious offence may be
held for police questioning without being arrested,
but for no more than six hours without being
charged. If arrested, suspects must be charged and
cautioned. The case is then referred to the
Procurator Fiscal (see page 222).
As in England and Wales, the police have
responsibility for a number of other tasks
including criminal investigation, traffic
management and community liaison. They also
rely on a number of specialist support services
such as forensic science laboratories, air support
and underwater search teams. In addition, there
are several centrally provided police services,
known as ‘common police services’ maintained or
funded by the Scottish Ministers. These include
the Scottish Criminal Record Office, the Scottish
Police College and the Scottish Drug Enforcement
Agency (Operational and Intelligence Groups).
Scotland has community wardens similar to the
neighbourhood wardens in England and Wales (see
page 211). Community wardens can perform a
variety of tasks depending on the needs and
priorities of the community, but do not have police
powers. Following pilot schemes, community
warden schemes were extended to every local
authority area in Scotland in April 2004. Most
schemes are run by the local authorities.
HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) is
independent of police forces, police authorities and
the Scottish Executive. HMIC has a statutory duty
to submit an annual report to Scottish ministers on
the state and efficiency of Scotland’s police forces.
As HMIC is not a regulatory body it has no powers
to direct the police. It makes recommendations
based on professional judgement.
Complaints against the police
A complaint alleging criminal conduct against a
police officer is investigated on behalf of the Lord
221
14 Crime and justice
UK 2005
Advocate by the Area Procurator Fiscal for the
force area in which the officer serves. The decision
on whether to prosecute is made by the Solicitor
General for Scotland. Complaints alleging
misconduct on the part of a police officer are
investigated by the officer’s force, either at local
level or by the Deputy Chief Constable, and, if
upheld, can result in penalties ranging from a
warning, to dismissal from the service. In cases of
serious criminal behaviour or misconduct it is
open to the regional Procurator Fiscal or the
police force to request the appointment of
investigating officers from another force. Police
authorities have responsibility for dealing with
complaints against chief officers.
FFMIC has a statutory authority to respond to
referrals from dissatisfied complainants by
considering the manner in which their complaints
have been dealt with by chief constables.
Prosecution authorities
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service
provides Scotland’s independent public
prosecution service. It is a department of the
Scottish Executive and headed by the two Scottish
Law Officers (see page 220). They are assisted by
Advocate Deputes and are known collectively as
Crown Counsel. Advocate Deputes are usually
experienced, practising advocates who are
appointed for a period of about three years.
The Department is the sole public prosecution
authority in Scotland. It is responsible for making
decisions about and bringing prosecutions for
almost all criminal offences - statutory (devolved
and reserved) and non-statutory (common law).
Unlike in England, there is no general right of
prosecution. The prosecution is undertaken by the
Lord Advocate in the interests of the public as a
whole, rather than on behalf of the police and
other agencies such as HM Customs and Excise or
individual citizens.
Scotland does not have a coroner’s office. The
Department has the duty to investigate sudden,
suspicious or unexplained deaths. It decides if
criminal proceedings or a fatal accident inquiry
should be held and conducts such proceedings
and inquiries.
Criminal courts
There are two types of criminal procedure in
Scotland - solemn and summary. Solemn
procedure covers the most serious cases involving
trial on indictment before a judge or sheriff sitting
with a jury. A Scottish jury is made up of 15
people and a simple majority (8-7) is sufficient to
establish guilt or innocence. Three verdicts are
available: ‘guilty’, ‘not guilty’, or ‘not proven’. A not
proven verdict is the equivalent of not guilty in
that it is an acquittal. Summary procedure covers
less serious offences involving a trial by sheriff
sitting alone or a magistrate who may sit alone or
in a bench of three.
Scotland has a three-tier criminal court system.
These are, in order of precedence, the High Court
of Justiciary (the High Court), the Sheriff Courts
and the District Courts. In addition there are
separate drug courts, youth courts and children’s
hearings, and a pilot domestic abuse court is
planned by the end of 2004.
The High Court of Justiciary, established in 1672, is
the supreme criminal court. It handles the most
serious crimes such as murder and rape. It is
peripatetic, sitting in cities and larger towns as
required. As an appeal court it sits only in
Edinburgh. It comprises the Lord Justice General,
the Lord Justice Clerk, and another 30 judges known
formally as Lords Commissioners of Justiciary.
The 49 Sheriff Courts deal mainly with less serious
offences. They can sit under either summary or
solemn procedure. The maximum sentence a
Sheriff Court can impose under summary
procedure is three months or, for a second or
subsequent offence of dishonesty or personal
violence, six months (unless a lower or higher
statutory maximum is specified for a particular
offence). The maximum fine is £5,000. Under
solemn procedure, the maximum sentence is five
years’ imprisonment or an unlimited fine. If the
court considers its sentencing powers to be
insufficient it can remit a case to the High Court.
District Courts sit under summary procedure only
and are managed by local authorities. Each court
comprises one or more Justices of the Peace (lay
magistrates) who sit alone or in threes with a
qualified legal assessor as convener or clerk of
court. They handle cases of breach of the peace,
drunkenness, minor assaults, petty theft, and
offences under the Civic Government (Scotland)
Act 1982. As the lowest level of criminal court, the
district court has limited sentencing powers. Lay
justices can impose sentences of imprisonment or
detention up to a maximum of 60 days, and can
222
UK 2005
14 Crime and justice
impose fines of up to £2,500 (unless a lower or
higher statutory maximum is specified for a
particular offence). However, in the Glasgow
District Court there are professional stipendiary
magistrates who have the same sentencing powers
as a sheriff sitting in a summary court.
The Scottish Court Service, an executive agency of
the Scottish Executive Justice Department, is
responsible for the administration, organisation
and staffing of the Supreme Courts (the High
Court and, in relation to civil matters, the Court
of Session) and the Sheriff Courts.
Around 143,000 people were proceeded against in
Scottish criminal courts in 2002; of whom 125,000
had a charge proved. Of the latter, 4 per cent were
dealt with under solemn procedure, 63 per cent in
sheriff summary courts, and 33 per cent in district
and stipendiary magistrates’ courts.
Reform of summary justice
The Mclnnes report was published in March 2004
after a two-year review of the way that the
justice system in Scotland deals with less serious
offences. It recommended:
■ the creation of a single unified summary court
managed by the Scottish Court Service;
■ an all professional judiciary - consisting of
sheriffs and new 'summary sheriffs' - both
with identical sentencing powers in summary
cases; and
■ enhanced sentencing powers to allow summary
courts to impose sentences of one year's
imprisonment and a maximum £20,000 fine.
The Scottish Executive is consulting on these
recommendations.
Prison service
The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) is an executive
agency. In 2002/03 there were 16 prison
establishments (15 public and one private), and an
average daily prison population of 6,475, of whom
fewer than 280 were women.
The main statutory duty of HM Inspectorate of
Prisons for Scotland is the regular inspection of
individual establishments. Matters that are
inspected and reported on include physical
conditions, quality of prisoner regimes, morale of
staff and prisoners, facilities available to staff and
prisoners, questions of safety and decency, and
the establishment’s contribution to preventing
re-offending.
Complaints from prisoners that have not been
resolved through the internal grievance system of
the SPS are investigated by the Scottish Prisons
Complaints Commission.
There are statutory arrangements governing the
early release of prisoners. Offenders serving terms
of less than four years may be automatically
released at specific points in their sentences. Those
detained for longer require Parole Board approval.
Ministers are statutorily obliged to give effect to
the Parole Board’s directions.
Criminal justice social work
There is no separate probation service as in
England and Wales. Instead, the Scottish Executive
funds local authorities to provide criminal justice
social work. This includes supervising offenders
subject to community disposals, providing reports
to court to assist sentencing and providing
supervision to certain categories of offenders
following release from custody.
Local authorities have a statutory responsibility for
prisoners sentenced to over four years in prison on
their release, and for those sentenced to supervised
release orders and extended sentences.
Throughcare is provided to prisoners and their
families from the point of sentence or remand,
during the period of imprisonment, and following
release into the community. Local authorities also
provide voluntary aftercare, which consists of
supervision, support and assistance to people who
request such a service within 12 months of their
release from custody. This service might be in the
form of advice on access to benefits,
accommodation, education and training or
alcohol or drugs rehabilitation.
Legal aid
The Scottish Legal Aid Board manages legal aid in
Scotland. Its main tasks are to grant (or refuse)
applications for legal aid; to pay solicitors or
advocates; and to advise Scottish ministers on legal
aid matters. Where legal aid is granted to the
accused in criminal proceedings, he or she is not
required to contribute towards expenses.
223
14 Crime and justice
UK 2005
Sentencing and appeals
Of the 125,000 convictions in Scottish courts in
2002, 13 per cent resulted in a custodial sentence
and 12 per cent in a community sentence. Sixty-
three per cent of all convictions resulted in a fine
or compensation order as the main penalty,
compared with 73 per cent in 1993.
Non-custodial disposals
Non-custodial disposals available to Scottish
courts include fines, community service orders,
probation orders, restriction of liberty orders, and
drug treatment and testing orders. Community
reparation orders (see page 218) will be
introduced as a result of the Antisocial Behaviour
etc. (Scotland) Act 2004.
An offender given a community service order is
required to carry out unpaid work of benefit to
the community for between 80 and 240 hours in
summary proceedings, and 300 hours in solemn
proceedings.
Offenders can be placed on probation for a period
of between six months and three years. The order
has an action plan in which the offender agrees to
address his or her offending behaviour and its
underlying causes. Additional conditions can be
attached in respect of unpaid work, place of
residence, curfew conditions, financial recompense
to the victim, and attendance at a programme for
alcohol or drug treatment.
Restriction of liberty orders require an offender to
be restricted to a specific place for a maximum of
12 hours a day up to a maximum of 12 months,
and/or from a specified place or places for 24 hours
a day up to 12 months. The legislation also provides
for the use of electronic monitoring equipment to
monitor the offender’s compliance with the order.
Electronic monitoring may also be used as a
condition of a probation order or a drug treatment
and testing order, or as a condition of licence for
those under supervision in the community.
In 2002 15,200 convictions resulted in a
community sentence, 12 per cent more than in
2001. These mainly comprised probation and
community service orders, with the average length
of a community service order being 153 hours.
Custodial sentences
In Scotland a court must obtain a social enquiry
report before imposing a custodial sentence if the
accused is aged under 21 or has not previously
served a custodial sentence. The number of
custodial sentences imposed in 2002 was 16,800, of
which 82 per cent were for six months or less.
Appeals
The High Court of Justiciary also sits with at least
three judges as the Scottish Court of Criminal
Appeal. In both solemn and summary procedure
a convicted person may appeal against conviction,
or sentence, or both. The Court may dispose of an
appeal in a number of ways, including authorising
a retrial if it sets aside a conviction. There is no
appeal from this court to the House of Lords. Just
under 2,500 appeals were concluded in 2002,
equivalent to 2 per cent of total convictions in that
year. Of these, 3 per cent resulted in a conviction
being quashed and 15 per cent in a reduced
sentence.
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission
considers alleged miscarriages of justice and refers
cases meeting the relevant criteria to the Court of
Appeal for review. It will usually do this only if the
normal appeal procedure has been exhausted.
Youth justice
Criminal proceedings may be brought against any
child aged eight or over, but the instructions of the
Lord Advocate are necessary before anyone under
16 is prosecuted. Many of the children under 16
who have committed an offence or are considered
to be in need of care and protection may be
referred to the Children’s Reporter, who decides
whether the child should be brought before a
children’s hearing. The hearing consists of three
lay people who are not lawyers. The hearing
members decide whether compulsory supervision
is required and, if so, in what form.
In 2002 the Scottish Executive launched a ten-
point action plan for dealing with problem young
offenders. Two points in particular sought to
tackle this issue. Firstly a fast-track Children s
Hearing to deal with persistent offenders in the
under-16 age group was introduced in January
2003 as a pilot scheme in 43 areas. Secondly, a
two-year pilot youth court was launched in June
2003 to deal with 16- and 17-year-olds (who
would otherwise be prosecuted under the standard
summary sheriff court procedure). The court has
designated sheriffs, a range of specially tailored
community programmes at its disposal, and a

14 Crime and justice
fast-track process that ensures all offenders make
their first appearance in the court within ten days
of being charged. A second pilot youth court was
set up in June 2004 and will run for two years.
All the community sentences available to the
courts in Scotland can be used to deal with young
offenders.
Civil justice
Most civil business in Scotland is conducted in
one of 49 Sheriff Courts (see page 222). The
matters dealt with include debt, claims for
compensation, contract disputes, divorce, eviction,
anti-social behaviour, and various applications
under statutes concerned with matters such as
licensing and bankruptcy. An appeal is possible
from the Sheriff to the Sheriff Principal and then
to the Court of Session. Appeal to the House of
Lords from the Court of Session is available.
The Court of Session, which sits in Edinburgh, is
the supreme civil court in Scotland. It is both a
court of first instance for the initial consideration
of cases and the court of appeal for most civil
matters, although Sheriffs Principal can also hear
appeals at local level. The jurisdiction of the Court
of Session as a court of first instance is broadly the
same as the jurisdiction of the Sheriff Court.
However, some matters can only be raised in the
Court of Session, such as the judicial review of
decisions by administrative authorities.
Tribunals in Scotland deal with a range of matters
including employment, education, children’s
hearings, immigration, social security and tax.
Most tribunals are supervised by the Scottish
Committee of the Council on Tribunals, which has
a statutory role to review the constitution and
working of tribunals in Scotland.
Justice in Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland’s legal system is broadly similar
to that in England and Wales. The Lord Chancellor
is responsible for court administration through
the Northern Ireland Court Service, while the
Northern Ireland Office (NIO, see page 31), under
the Secretary of State, deals with policy and
legislation concerning criminal law, the police and
the penal system. The Lord Chancellor has general
responsibility for legal aid, advice and assistance.
A major review of the criminal justice system was
set up under the 1998 Belfast (Good Friday)
Agreement (see page 32) and reported in 2000.
Key recommendations included:
■ a focus on promoting human rights within
the criminal justice system;
■ a new Public Prosecution Service building on
the work of the existing Director of Public
Prosecutions Office;
■ an independent Judicial Appointments
Commission;
■ an Independent Criminal Justice Inspectorate;
■ an Independent Northern Ireland Law
Commission;
■ improvements to youth justice arrangements
- including the creation of a Youth Justice
Agency; and
■ the development of North/South
co-operation on criminal justice matters.
The review received broad support from most
political parties and from practitioners in the
criminal justice system. As a result, the majority of
the recommendations have been, or are in the
process of being, implemented. Those
recommendations that required legislation were
enacted in the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002.
Criminal justice agencies
The police
In 2001 the Royal Ulster Constabulary became the
Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in line
with recommendations made by the Independent
Commission on Policing. The Commission’s
report followed the Belfast (Good Friday)
Agreement of 1998, which said there should be ‘a
new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland,
with a police service capable of attacting and
sustaining support from the community as a
whole’. Under the process of change an Oversight
Commissioner was appointed, as well as an
independent Policing Board with Unionist and
Nationalist participation and broad powers to
hold the police to account. The Board works with
district policing partnerships in the 26 district
council areas. Complaints against the police are
investigated by an independent Police
Ombudsman.
PSNI strength at the end of March 2004, including
student officers in training, was 7,489. This was
225
14 Crime and justice
UK 2005
complemented by 1,572 full-time and 864 part-
time reserve officers. The first batch of recruits
appointed under the system of 50:50 recruitment
of Catholics and non-Catholics graduated in 2002.
Prosecution authorities
Following the review of the criminal justice system
in Northern Ireland an independent prosecution
service is being set up and will be responsible for
undertaking all criminal prosecutions. The Public
Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland will be
headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions and
will replace the existing Department of the
Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern
Ireland. It is anticipated that this service will be
fully implemented by December 2006.
The courts
The Northern Ireland Court Service is accountable
to the UK Parliament through the Parliamentary
Secretary at the DCA and the Lord Chancellor. It
is responsible for the administration of the
Supreme Court, county courts, magistrates’ courts,
coroners’ courts and for certain tribunals.
The Supreme Court of Judicature comprises the
Court of Appeal, the High Court and the Crown
Court. All matters relating to these courts are
under the jurisdiction of the UK Parliament. The
Court of Appeal consists of the Lord Chief Justice
(as President) and two Lords Justices of Appeal.
The High Court is made up of the Lord Chief
Justice and five other judges. The practice and
procedure of the Court of Appeal and the High
Court are virtually the same as in the
corresponding courts in England and Wales. Both
courts sit in the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast.
The Court of Appeal has power to review the civil
law decisions of the High Court and the criminal
law decisions of the Crown Court, and may in
certain cases review the decisions of county courts
and magistrates’ courts. Subject to certain
restrictions, an appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal can go to the House of Lords. As
in the rest of the United Kingdom, a Criminal
Cases Review Commission, which is independent
of both government and the courts, reviews
alleged miscarriages of justice.
The High Court is divided into a Queen’s Bench
Division, Chancery Division, and a Family
Division, along similar lines to the courts in
England and Wales (see page 219). The Crown
Court deals with all serious criminal cases.
County courts and magistrates’ courts differ in a
number of ways from those in England and Wales.
County courts are presided over by one of 14
county court judges, two of whom — in Belfast and
Londonderry - have the title of Recorder. Appeals
from the county courts go to the High Court.
Although primarily civil law courts, the county
courts also handle appeals from the magistrates’
courts in both criminal and civil matters. In civil
matters, the county courts decide most actions in
which the amount or the value of specific articles
claimed is below a certain level. They also deal
with actions involving title to, or the recovery of,
land; equity matters such as trusts and estates;
mortgages; and the sale of land and partnerships.
The day-to-day work of dealing summarily with
minor local criminal cases is carried out in
magistrates’ courts presided over by a full-time,
legally qualified resident magistrate. The
magistrates’ courts also exercise jurisdiction in
certain family law cases and have a very limited
jurisdiction in other civil cases.
Prison service
The Northern Ireland Prison Service, established
in April 1995, is an executive agency of the NIO. It
operates under the direction and control of the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, within a
statutory framework based on the Prison Act
(Northern Ireland) 1953 and the Prison and Young
Offenders Centre Rules (Northern Ireland) 1995.
The Prison Service has three operational
establishments: Maghaberry Prison, a high-
security prison housing male prisoners, as well as
accommodating male immigration detainees at its
facility in Belfast; Magilligan Prison, a medium-
security prison housing adult male prisoners that
also has low-security accommodation for selected
prisoners nearing the end of their sentence; and
Hydebank Wood, a medium- to low-security young
offenders centre and prison that accommodates all
young male offenders aged between 17 and 21, and
all female prisoners including young offenders and
immigration detainees. The overall annual prison
population in Northern Ireland increased by
12 per cent from an average of 1,026 in 2002 to an
average of 1,152 in 2003.
Each prison has a Board of Visitors or Visiting
Committee comprising volunteers appointed by
the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

Probation Board
The Probation Board for Northern Ireland is a
non-departmental public body established under
the Probation Board (Northern Ireland) Order
1982. It is primarily charged with carrying out risk
assessments and providing pre-sentence reports
for the courts, the statutory supervision of
offenders in the community, and the performance
of social welfare duties in prisons and young
offender centres.
During 2003/04 the Board received 8,267 requests
for reports from the courts, 5 per cent more than
in the previous year. Its caseload of clients subject
to court orders at 31 March 2004 was 3,251, an
increase of nearly 7 per cent on the previous year.

Everyone in the United Kingdom has a legal right
to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
Religious organisations and groups may conduct
their rites and ceremonies, promote their beliefs
within the limits of the law, own property*, and run
schools and a range of other charitable activities.
Although the United Kingdom is predominantly
Christian, most world religions are represented. In
particular there are large Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and
Jewish communities.
Religious affiliations in the UK
The 2001 Census was the first to include a religion
question in England, \N ales and Scotland
(although a census was taken of places of worship
in 1851). Censuses in Northern Ireland have
included a question on religion since 1926.
The Census question in England and W ales was
voluntary and designed to measure religious
identification in the broad sense. It asked What is
vour religion?'. Difterent questions were used in
Scotland and Northern Ireland, to reflect local
differences in the requirement for information.
Over three-quarters 77 per cent) of the
population of Great Britain said that they
identified with a religion in the 2001 Census.
Fifteen per cent said thev had no religion, and the
remainder (8 per cent) did not answ er the
question. Of those who identified with a religion,
93 per cent *41 million people) said they were
Christian.
Of the 3 million people who belonged to a religion
other than Christianitv. just over half identified
themselves as Muslims, with smaller numbers of
Hindus. Sikhs, lews and Buddhists. London had a
higher proportion of all these rehgions among its
population than other regions.
Some 8.6 million people in Great Britain stated
that they had no religion. Organisations such as
the British Humanist Association and the National
Secular Society represent the views of some of
those who do not identify with a religion.
The faith communities
Christians
The Christian community in the United Kingdom
consists of many denominations. Of these, the
Anglican and Catholic Churches and the Church
of Scotland have some of the largest memberships.
Several other Christian denominations are known
collectively as the ‘Free Churches’, including
Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians and the United
Reformed Church.
Anglicans
The four Anglican churches in the United
Kingdom are the Church of England, the Church
in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church, and the
A new i-church
In March 2004 the Church of England announced
the creation of its first Internet parish
{www.i-church.org), providing a spiritual ministry
for people who are unable, or do not wish, to join
a local congregation. Applications for the post of
'web pastor' were invited by the Diocese of
Oxford, whose pioneering initiative is being
funded by the Church Commissioners. Alyson
Leslie was subsequently appointed to the post,
and the i-church was dedicated at a service in
Oxford on 30 July 2004.

15 Religion
Church of Ireland (Northern Ireland). They form
part of a worldwide communion of 38 Anglican
churches.
The Church of England is divided into two
geographical provinces, each headed by an
archbishop, and numerous dioceses (regions under
the care of a bishop). The province of Canterbury
has 30 dioceses, including the Diocese in Europe;
and the province of York has 14 dioceses. The
dioceses are divided into archdeaconries and
deaneries, which are in turn divided into 13,000
raaishes, although in practice many parishes are
grouped together.
The Archbishop of Canterbury7 is Diocesan Bishop
of Canterbury, Primate of All England and leader
of the Anglican Communion. He takes the lead
in respect of Anglican relationships with other
Christian churches in the United Kingdom and
abroad, and he also leads in respect of Anglican
relationships with other faiths.
The .Archbishops' Council is the centre of an
administrative system deeding with inter-Church
relations, inter-faith relations, social questions,
recruitment and training for the ministry, and
missionary work. The General Synod, elected
from the laity and clergy7 of each diocese and
numbering 581 members, normally meets twice
s near. It has the power to prepare legislation -
called Measures - about any matter to do with
the Church of England. Parliament may accept
or reiect such Measures, but cannot amend
them. If accepted, they become part of the law of
the land.
The .Archbishops of Canterbury7 and York, the
Bishops of Durham, London and Winchester, and
the 21 senior diocesan bishops from other dioceses
of the Church of England have seats in the House
erf Lords 1 see page 45).
Archbishops, bishops and the deans of some
Church of England cathedrals are appointed by
The Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister.
The Crown Appointments Commission, which
includes lay7 and clergy7 representatives, plays a key
role in the selection of archbishops and diocesan
bishops.
The 33 Church Commissioners, accountable to the
General Synod and to Parliament, are responsible
for the management of a large part of the Church
of England's inv ested assets. The Crown appoints a
A changing priesthood
The year 2004 was the tenth anniversary of the
ordination of the first women priests in the Church
of England. The number of full-time stipendiary
women clergy in 2002 was 1,262, compared with
7,920 male clergy. The ordination of women
remains a controversial issue for some sections of
the Anglican congregation and women cannot be
appointed as bishops. There has also been debate
about the appointment of openly gay clergy. In July
2003, for example, Canon Jeffrey John withdrew
from his appointment as suffragan Bishop of
Reading (assistant to the diocesan Bishop)
following opposition from the evangelical wing of
the Church and from Anglicans abroad.
Member of Parliament from the governing party7
to the unpaid post of Second Church Estates
Commissioner, to represent the Commissioners in
Parliament. The Church Commissioners currently
meet some 20 per cent of the Church of England’s
total running costs, providing support for parish,
bishops and cathedral ministry and the pensions
of the clergy. Parishes and dioceses meet the
remaining costs.
Catholics
There are eight provinces of the Catholic Church
in the United Kingdom - four in England, two
in Scotland, one in Wales and one that includes
Northern Ireland. The Roman Catholic
Archbishops for England, Wales and Scotland have
their seats in the Archdioceses of Westminster,
Cardiff and Glasgow. Northern Ireland is covered
by the Archdiocese of Armagh. The Bishops’
Conference is a permanent institution of the
Catholic Church whereby the bishops of a country
together exercise pastoral, legislative and teaching
offices as defined by the law of the Church. There
is a Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales,
and another for Scotland. The Irish Episcopal
Conference covers all of Ireland.
There are 22 territorial Catholic dioceses in
England and Wales and eight in Scotland.
Northern Ireland is covered by seven dioceses,
some of which extend into the Republic of Ireland.
Each diocesan bishop is appointed by the Pope
and governs according to Canon Law and through
reference to a Council of Priests, a College of
229
15 Religion
UK 2005
Consultors, a Finance Committee and a Pastoral
Council.
Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland is the largest Protestant
church in Scotland and has a Presbyterian form of
government - that is, government by church
courts, composed of ministers, elders and deacons.
There are over 1,500 congregations, governed
locally by courts known as Kirk Sessions. The
courts above these are the ‘Presbyteries’,
responsible for a geographical area made up
of a number of parishes. The General Assembly,
or Supreme Court, meets annually under the
convenership of an elected moderator, who serves
for one year.
Other Christians
The rise of the Puritan movement in the 16th and
17th centuries led to a proliferation of
nonconformist churches. The term ‘Free Churches’
is often used to describe these Protestant churches
which, unlike the Church of England and the
Church of Scotland, are not ‘established’ Churches
(see page 234). Free Churches include Methodist,
Baptist, The United Reformed, Presbyterian,
Salvation Army and a variety of Pentecostal
churches.
The British Methodist Church (which covers only
Great Britain, there being a separate Irish
Methodist Church), is the largest of the Free
Churches in the United Kingdom. Originating in
the 18th century following the evangelical revival
under John Wesley, it has around 6,400 places of
worship. The present Church is based on the 1932
union of most of the separate Methodist
Churches.
The Baptists, dating from the 17th century, are
mainly organised in associations of churches, most
of which belong to the Baptist Union of Great
Britain. The union covers England, a significant
proportion of the English-speaking Baptist
churches in Wales, and two Baptist Churches in
Scotland (both of which also belong to the Baptist
Union of Scotland). There is also a Baptist Union
in Wales and an Association of Baptist Churches in
Ireland (which covers both Northern Ireland and
the Republic).
The United Reformed Church was formed in 1972
from the union of the Congregational Church in
England and Wales with the Presbyterian Church
in England. In 1982 and 2000 there were further
unions with the Reformed Churches of Christ and
the Congregational Union of Scotland.
Among the other Free Churches are the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Presbyterian
(or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, the
Union of Welsh Independents, and a number of
independent Scottish Presbyterian churches which
are particularly active in the Flighlands and
Islands.
The Salvation Army was founded in the East End
of London in 1865 by William Booth. It runs over
900 local church and community centres.
The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) was
founded in the middle of the 17th century under
the leadership of George Fox. Unitarians and Free
Christians, whose origins go back to the
Reformation, belong to a similar tradition. The
Christian Brethren, founded in the 19th century,
comprises the Open Brethren, the Reunited
Brethren and the Plymouth Brethren No. 4.
People of different cultures coming to settle in the
United Kingdom since the Middle Ages have
contributed to the diversity of Christian
denominations. Christian communities founded by
migrants include those of the Orthodox, Lutheran
and Reformed Churches of various European
countries, the Coptic Orthodox Church, Armenian
Church and a number of Churches originating in
Africa, such as the Cherubim and Seraphim
Churches. These tend to be concentrated in the
larger cities of the United Kingdom, particularly
London, and use a variety of languages. The largest
is the Greek Orthodox Church, many of whose
members are of Cypriot origin.
Other developments within the Christian tradition
have included the rise of Pentecostalism and the
charismatic movement (which emphasises
personal religious experience and divinely inspired
powers). A number of Pentecostal bodies were
formed in the United Kingdom at the turn of the
20th century. The two main organisations in the
United Kingdom tracing their origins back to this
period are the Assemblies of God, and the Elim
Pentecostal Church. They have since been joined
by other Pentecostal groupings with roots in the
Black community. Immigration from the
Caribbean and Africa since the Second World War
has led to a significant number of Black Majority
Churches, many of which are Pentecostal.
230
UK 2005
15 Religion
The Christian ‘house church’ movement (or ‘new
churches’) began in the 1970s when some of the
charismatics began to establish their own
congregations.
Muslims
By the early 19th century Muslim seamen, mainly
from Yemen and the Indian subcontinent, had
settled in several areas of the United Kingdom,
including the dockland areas of Cardiff, South
Shields and London. There was further settlement
after the First World War, and again in the 1950s
and 1960s as people arrived to meet the shortage
of labour following the Second World War.
The 1960s and 1970s saw the arrival of significant
numbers of Muslims of Asian origin from Kenya
and Uganda, as well as those arriving directly from
the Indian subcontinent. There are well-
established Turkish Cypriot, Nigerian and Arab
Muslim communities, and more recently Muslims
from Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo have
sought refuge in the United Kingdom. In addition,
there are smaller numbers of White and Black
Caribbean Muslims. The principal Sunni and Shi’a
traditions are both represented among the UK
Muslim community. The Muslim Council of
Britain, founded in 1997, represents 400 national
and regional Muslim bodies as well as local
mosques, professional associations and other
organisations. The Council aims to promote co¬
operation, consensus and unity on Muslim affairs
in the United Kingdom and serves as an advocacy
and representative body for British Muslims.
The London Muslim Centre
A large number of residents and visitors attended
the opening of a new Muslim community centre
in Whitechapel, East London in June 2004. Built
next to the East London Mosque, facilities at the
centre include a gym, library, creche, exhibition
centre and classrooms. Members of the public
contributed to the construction costs, and further
funding was provided by the European Regional
Development Fund and by central and local
government. The centre was opened by Shaykh
Abdur-Rahman al-Sudays, Imam of the Ka'bah in
Makka (Mecca). One of the centre's aims is to
improve dialogue between Islam and other faiths.
Hindus
Most Hindus in the United Kingdom are of
Gujarati or Punjabi origin with smaller numbers
from Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and the southern
states of India and Sri Lanka. Others settled from
countries to which earlier generations of Indians
had migrated such as Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania,
Uganda and Zambia.
The main umbrella bodies for Hindus are the
National Council of Hindu Temples (UK), the
Hindu Council UK and more recently the Hindu
Forum of Britain (formed in March 2004). Other
national bodies serving the Hindu community
include Vishwa Hindu Parishad (UK).
Sikhs
Most of the Sikh community in the United
Kingdom originates from the Indian part of the
Punjab, although a minority came via East Africa
and other former British colonies to which
members of their families had previously
migrated. The community in the United Kingdom
is believed to be the largest outside the Indian
subcontinent.
The Network of Sikh Organisations represents
over 100 Sikh organisations in the United
Kingdom. It promotes understanding of the Sikh
way of life, organises events and celebrations for
the major Sikh festivals, and provides advice and
information.
Jews
Jews settled in England after the Norman
Conquest in 1066. They were banished by royal
decree in 1290, but re-admitted following the
English Civil War (1642-51). Sephardic Jews, who
originally came from Spain and Portugal, have
been present since that time. The majority of Jews
in the United Kingdom today are Ashkenazi,
descended from people who emigrated or fled
persecution in the Russian Empire between 1881
and 1914, or Nazi persecution in Germany and
other European countries from 1933 onwards.
Sixty per cent of those Ashkenazi households who
are affiliated to synagogues acknowledge the
authority of the Chief Rabbi. The Reform Syna¬
gogues of Great Britain, the Masorti Synagogues,
the Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues
and the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations
together account for most of the remaining
synagogue-affiliated community membership.
231
15 Religion
UK 2005
The Board of Deputies of British Jews is the
officially recognised representative body for the
Jewish community. Founded in 1760, the Board’s
representation is through deputies elected by
synagogues and deputies elected by community
organisations. It serves as the voice of the
community to both government and the wider
non-Jewish community and calls on the Chief
Rabbi and the Communal Rabbi of the Spanish
and Portuguese Jews’ Congregation for religious
advice and guidance when needed.
Buddhists
The Buddhist community in the United Kingdom
includes people of White, Chinese and other
ethnic groups. Various traditions are represented.
The Network of Buddhist Organisations, founded
in 1993, links various educational, cultural,
charitable and teaching organisations. The
Buddhist Society promotes the principles, but does
not adhere to any particular school of Buddhism.
Other traditions
Jainism was brought to the United Kingdom
mainly by immigrants from the Gujarat and
Rajasthan areas of India. The Zoroastrian religion
is mainly represented by the Parsi community
from India; the founders of the UK community
originally settled here in the 19th century. The
Baha’i movement originated in Persia in the
19th century. Rastafarianism, with its roots in the
return-to-Africa movement, emerged in the West
Indies early in the 20th century and arrived in the
United Kingdom with immigration from Jamaica
in the 1950s.
Other religious groups in the United Kingdom
were originally founded in the United States in the
19th century, including a number deriving from
the Christian tradition. Examples include a
growing number of Mormons (the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), and Jehovah’s
Witnesses, Christadelphians, Christian Scientists,
and Seventh-day Adventists.
A number of newer religious movements,
established since the Second World War and often
with overseas origins, are now active in the United
Kingdom. Examples include the Church of
Scientology, the Transcendental Meditation
movement, the Unification Church and various
New Age groups.
Places of worship
There are around 16,000 Anglican churches, and
42 Anglican cathedrals which serve as focal points
of the dioceses. The Catholic Church has nearly
4,590 churches and the Church of Scotland over
1,500. The Church in Wales also has about 1,500
places of worship.
Liverpool Cathedral
After marking the 25th anniversary in October
2003 of the completion of its construction,
Liverpool's Anglican cathedral celebrated its
centenary with a special service at 4.00 pm on
19 July 2004 - exactly 100 years since King
Edward VII laid the foundation stone. The
Cathedral is the largest in Britain, with an area of
9,987 square metres and its bells are said to
have the highest and heaviest peal in the world.
The architect was Sir Giles Gilbert Scott.
English Heritage (see page 290) provides funds for
repairs to Anglican and Catholic cathedrals
through its Cathedral Repairs Grant Scheme. It
provided almost £40 million through the scheme
between 1991 and 2004. In January 2004 it
announced a new £2 million funding package
for 20 cathedrals in England, including £200,000
each for Lincoln, Salisbury, Leicester and Truro
cathedrals and St George’s Chapel, Windsor.
In his 2004 Budget, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer announced that the Listed Places of
Worship Grant Scheme, launched in 2001, will be
expanded to allow a full VAT refund for eligible
repair and maintenance work. Under current
plans, the scheme will remain in place until March
2006. It applies to listed places of worship of all
religions throughout the United Kingdom. The
Repair Grants for Places of Worship in England
Scheme, which runs from 2002 to 2005, is funded
jointly by English Heritage and the Heritage
Lottery Fund. All faith groups and denominations,
Christian and non-Christian, are eligible to apply
if they are formally constituted religious
organisations. In 2003/04, £30 million was made
available for urgent repairs.
Since 1969 over 1,600 churches in England have
become redundant and around £33 million has
232
UK 2005
15 Religion
been raised from their disposal. Redundant
churches are increasingly being used for residential
property or as civic, cultural or community
centres. The Churches Conservation Trust, funded
jointly by the Government and the Church of
England, preserves Anglican churches of particular
cultural and historical importance that are no
longer used as regular places of worship. In 2004,
332 churches were maintained in this way. A
number of outstanding buildings from other
denominations and faiths are cared for by the
Historic Chapels Trust.
There are over 1,000 mosques and numerous
community Muslim centres throughout the
United Kingdom. Mosques are not only places of
worship but also offer instruction in the Muslim
way of life, and facilities for education and welfare.
They range from converted buildings in many
towns and suburbs to the Central Mosque in
Regent’s Park, London, with its associated Islamic
Cultural Centre. The main conurbations in
London, the Midlands, the North West and North
East of England, and Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland also have their own central
mosques with a range of community facilities.
The first Hindu temple, or mandir, was opened
in London in the 1950s and there are now 143 in
the United Kingdom; many are affiliated to the
National Council of Hindu Temples (UK). The
Swaminarayan Hindu Temple in Neasden,
north-west London, is the largest and was the first
purpose-built Hindu temple in Europe. There are
also a number of meeting places in addition to the
official places of worship. There are over 200 Sikh
temples, or gurdwaras, in the United Kingdom, the
vast majority located in England and Wales. They
cater for the religious, educational, welfare and
cultural needs of their community. In March 2003
the largest gurdwara outside India was opened in
Southall, west London.
There are about 300 Jewish synagogues in the
United Kingdom, but there are many additional
congregations that do not have their own purpose-
built synagogue buildings. There are over 400
Buddhist centres in the United Kingdom at which
meditation or spiritual practice can take place,
although it is not considered essential to go to
a temple and practice can take place at home.
Examples include the Wat Buddhapadipa Temple
in London, the Amaravati Monastery in
Hertfordshire and the Kagyu Samye Ling Tibetan
Centre in Dumfriesshire and Galloway.
Religious ceremonies
and festivals
Although there are secular alternatives, religious
traditions play a major role in commemorating
births, marriages, deaths and other important life
events.
In 2002 around 38 per cent of UK marriages were
solemnised with a religious ceremony, compared
with approximately 60 per cent in 1971. There are,
however, wide variations within the United
Kingdom. Seventy-two per cent of marriages in
Northern Ireland in 2002 involved a religious
ceremony, compared with 62 per cent in Scotland
and 34 per cent in England and Wales.
Of the 85,870 religious ceremonies in England
and Wales in 2002, 68 per cent were solemnised
in the Church of England or the Church of Wales;
12 per cent in nonconformist churches; another
12 per cent in the Catholic Church; 5 per cent in
other Christian bodies and 3 per cent in other
faith traditions.
The two most important periods in the Christian
calendar are Easter and Christmas, which are
major public holidays in the United Kingdom.
Festivals and events observed by other religions -
such as Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha (Muslim),
Diwali and Janmashtami (Hindu), Vaisakhi
(Sikh), the High Holy Days and Passover (Jewish),
and the Birthday of the Buddha - are adding
to the visible diversity of life in the United
Kingdom today.
Religious education
In England and Wales all maintained schools must
provide religious education and a daily act of
collective worship, although parents can withdraw
their children from either or both of these
activities. In maintained schools without a
religious designation, each local education
authority is responsible for producing a locally
agreed syllabus, which must reflect Christianity as
the main religious tradition of the country, while
taking account of the teachings and practices of
the other principal religions represented in the
United Kingdom. There are no nationally
prescribed attainment targets, nor assessment
levels or programmes of study for religious
233
15 Religion
UK 2005
education, but the subject must be provided up to
but not including sixth form level.
State supported schools that are designated as
having a religious character are often called faith
schools. In these schools collective worship is in
the tenets of the faith of the school. In 2004 there
were about 6,230 primary and almost 600
secondary state supported faith schools in
England. All but around 40 of these were
associated with Christian denominations.
State supported faith schools can be either
foundation or voluntary controlled (both of which
are entirely funded by the local education
authority) or voluntary aided (where school and
parent organisations make a contribution to
capital expenses). Voluntary aided schools (61 per
cent of the total) are responsible for setting their
own admission policies, and the religious
education they provide is in accordance with the
tenets of their own faith. Voluntary controlled
schools teach the locally agreed religious education
syllabus and the local authority sets admissions
policies.
Since December 2003 independent schools,
including academies (see page 122), have been
able to apply to be designated as schools with
a religious character. This allows them to employ
teaching staff with the same religious beliefs as the
school. Independent schools are not funded by the
state. They draw their funding from fees paid by
parents, donations and appeals. Of the 2,300
registered independent schools, which include
academies, about 1,000 describe themselves as
having a religious character and, by mid-2004, 478
had successfully applied for designation.
In April 2004 the Qualifications and Curriculum
Authority published a consultation document for
a non-statutory national framework for religious
education in England. The proposed framework
acknowledged the fact that many people have no
formal beliefs.
Citizenship became a statutory national
curriculum subject in secondary schools in
England in 2002. Pupils are taught about the
diversity of national, regional, religious and ethnic
identities in the United Kingdom, and the need for
mutual respect, tolerance and understanding.
In Scotland, education authorities must ensure
that schools provide religious education and
regular opportunities for religious observance.
The law does not specify the form of religious
education, but it is recommended that pupils
should be provided with a broad-based
curriculum, through which they can develop
a knowledge and understanding of Christianity
and other world religions, and develop their own
beliefs, attitudes, moral values and practices.
Roman Catholic schools account for nearly all of
the 440 state supported faith schools in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland the main Churches have
approved a core syllabus for religious education
and this must be taught in all grant-aided schools,
though parents may withdraw their children from
attendance at religious education or collective
worship. Integrated education (where Protestant
and Catholic pupils are taught together) is
encouraged and all schools must be open to pupils
of all religions, although in practice most Catholic
pupils attend Catholic maintained schools or
Catholic voluntary grammar schools, and most
Protestant children are enrolled at controlled
schools or non-denominational voluntary
grammar schools. However, the number of inter¬
denominational schools is gradually increasing
and in 2003/04, 16,494 primary and secondary
pupils enrolled at integrated schools compared
with 11,382 pupils in 1998/99.
Religion and society
The influence of Christianity and other religions
in the United Kingdom has always extended far
beyond the comparatively narrow spheres of
organised and private worship. Religious
organisations are actively involved in voluntary
work and other services to the community, and
many faith groups maintain active links with
government.
Church and state
Two Churches have special status with regard to
the State. In England, since the rejection by Henry
VIII of the supremacy of the Pope in 1534, the
Anglican Church of England has been legally
recognised as the official, or ‘established’, Church.
The Monarch is the ‘Supreme Governor’ of the
Church of England and must always be a member
of the Church, and promise to uphold it. A similar
position was occupied by the Presbyterian Church
of Scotland until the early 20th century. This
continues to be recognised as the national Church
234
UK 2005
15 Religion
in Scotland, but the Monarch holds no
constitutional role in its government, although
she is represented at the General Assembly (see
page 230) through the office of the Lord High
Commissioner. Neither of the established
Churches are funded by the State. There are no
established Churches in Wales or Northern
Ireland.
Charitable work
In 2004 there were nearly 11,400 charities in
England and Wales with a religious objective
(excluding those registered as a place of worship).
Christian Aid, CAFOD (Catholic Agency for
Overseas Development), Muslim Aid and Islamic
Relief (the two largest Muslim charities), Khalsa
Aid (a Sikh charity) and UK Jewish Aid are among
the many UK-based charities that organise appeals
and deliver relief aid globally.
Within the United Kingdom the Salvation Army is
an important provider of accommodation for
homeless people, and offers other services
including work with alcoholics, prison chaplaincy
and a family-tracing service. The Quakers have a
long tradition of social concern and peacemaking.
Trusts with a Quaker history, such as the Cadbury
and Rowntree Trusts (see also page 112), support
many social initiatives, particularly funding for
housing.
British and Foreign Bible Society
(BFBS)
The BFBS celebrated its bicentenary on 8 March
2004 with a special service at St Paul's Cathedral.
Founded in London in 1804, the Society's original
aim was to increase the availability of Christian
Scriptures in England and Wales. By 2003,
however, there was a worldwide fellowship of
136 national Bible Societies, working in more
than 200 countries and territories. Each Society
is a non-denominational organisation whose
purpose is to translate, produce and distribute the
Bible 'without note or comment' in a range of
languages and at prices they can afford. By the
end of 2002 the Societies had helped to ensure
that the Bible, or some part of it, had been
translated into over 2,000 languages.
The Church Urban Fund, established by the Church
of England, is an independent charity, which raises
money to enable those living in the most
disadvantaged urban areas to set up local projects to
alleviate the effects of poverty. Although rooted in
the Christian faith, the fund does not restrict its
grants on the basis of religious belief.
The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland,
through its Board of Social Responsibility, is the
largest voluntary social work agency in Scotland.
Links with government
In October 2003 the Foreign & Commonwealth
Office (FCO) held its first ‘Multi Faith Week’: a
 R«Aa
Pilgrimage
Pilgrimage to sacred sites is an integral aspect of
worship for some faiths. Each year about 20,000
British Muslims travel to Makka to perform the
Hajj, where they join around two million other
pilgrims. The Hajj is an important expression of
faith and a journey involving significant
emotional and physical demands. Since 2000 a
British Hajj Delegation has travelled to Makka to
provide consular, pastoral and medical assistance
to British pilgrims. The Delegation is a team of
volunteers from the British Muslim community
and is accompanied by Muslim staff from the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office.
Walsingham in Norfolk first became a place of
pilgrimage in medieval times. There are two
shrines - one Anglican and one Catholic. In
2003, listeners to BBC Radio voted Walsingham
'the nation's favourite spiritual place', beating
other nominations such as Iona and Durham
Cathedral. During 2004 the image of Our Lady of
Walsingham (from the Anglican shrine) was taken
on her own pilgrimage to a series of secular
locations, including Pentonville Prison in London,
Oxford University, a comprehensive school in
Wales, Wolverhampton General Hospital,
Aldershot Barracks and Gatwick Airport. Prayers
and other events were held at each location,
v 
235
15 Religion
UK 2005
series of seminars, open days and receptions to
help build relationships with faith communities.
The FCO also provides support to the British Hajj
Delegation (see box).
In 2003 the Home Office set up a Faith
Communities Unit, which is responsible for
engaging with faith communities and promoting
inter-faith dialogue. Working Together:
Co-operation between Government and Faith
Communities, published in 2004, provides
guidance on national, regional and local
consultations, and advice for faith communities on
getting the most out of their dealings with
government. The report also recommends that
consideration be given to the involvement of
organisations representing those with non¬
religious beliefs, such as humanists and secularists.
In England the Inner Cities Religious Council,
based in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister,
provides a forum in which the Government and
faith communities work together on
neighbourhood renewal and social inclusion.
Chaired by a government minister, the Council’s
members are from the Christian, Muslim, Hindu,
Sikh and Jewish faiths.
The ecumenical Churches Regional Network
coordinates church involvement in English
Regional Development Agencies and church input
to regional initiatives. Inter-faith forums and
councils have been established in many of the
English regions.
Churches in Scotland have created a Scottish
Churches Parliamentary Office for formal
representation of their interests in the Scottish
Parliament. The Scottish Inter Faith Council works
with the Scottish Executive and other national and
local agencies to help ensure they are aware of the
interests of faith communities. In Wales, the
Churches have worked together to appoint a
Churches National Assembly Liaison Officer to
relate to the National Assembly for Wales.
Legal rights and responsibilities
The European Convention on Human Rights,
which was incorporated into the Human Rights
Act 1998, guarantees everybody in the United
Kingdom the right to religious freedom,
conscience and religion, subject to the law. In
Great Britain religious discrimination is unlawful
in the areas of employment and training under an
EC Directive that came into effect in December
2003. Its provisions do not apply in Northern
Ireland, where separate legislation prohibits
discrimination on a number of grounds, including
religious belief in employment, training and the
provision of goods, facilities and services. In
addition, a public authority, in carrying out its
functions relating to Northern Ireland, is obliged
to have regard to the need to promote equality of
opportunity between persons of different religious
beliefs and to have due regard to the desirability of
promoting good relations between such people.
In England and Wales certain offences motivated
by religious hatred are subject to a higher
maximum penalty. In addition, the Attorney
General’s power to challenge unduly lenient court
sentences was extended from October 2003.
Certain offences can be referred to the Court of
Appeal for review where it is felt that a tougher
sentence is merited. The Criminal Justice
(Scotland) Act 2003 also makes specific provision
for offences aggravated by religious prejudice.
Where a person commits such an offence, Scottish
courts must take the religious prejudice into
account when sentencing the offender, and state
any extra element of the sentence because of this.
In July 2004 the Home Secretary announced the
Government’s intention to introduce legislation
making incitement to religious hatred a criminal
offence in England and Wales.
Relations between religious
traditions
Ecumenical movements
Churches Together in Britain and Ireland (CTBI)
is the main coordinating body for the Christian
Churches in the United Kingdom and promotes
discussion of Christian faith and doctrinal issues
in the Christian community. It also coordinates
the work of its 33 member Churches or groupings
of Churches in the areas of social responsibility,
international affairs, church life, world mission,
racial justice, care of international students and
inter-faith relations. Its international aid agencies
- Christian Aid, CAFOD and SCIAF (Scottish
Catholic International Aid Fund) - are major
charities. Member Churches are also grouped in
separate ecumenical bodies, according to country:
Churches Together in England, Action of Churches
236
UK 2005
15 Religion
Together in Scotland, Churches Together in Wales
(Cytun), and the Irish Council of Churches.
The respective leaders of the Anglican and
Methodist Churches signed a national covenant in
November 2003, marking a commitment to unity
which envisages a movement towards shared
services, clergy and resources.
The Scottish Churches’ Initiative for Union began
in 1996, incorporating the Church of Scotland,
Methodist Church, Scottish Episcopal Church and
United Reformed Church. The Church of Scotland
voted to withdraw in May 2003. The Scottish
Episcopal Church reaffirmed its commitment to
the goal of unity in June 2004.
Co-operation between faiths
The Inter Faith Network for the UK links nearly
100 organisations with an interest in inter-faith
relations, including the representative bodies of
the Baha’i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain,
Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian
communities. The Network promotes good
relations between faiths in the United Kingdom,
and runs a public advice and information service
on inter-faith issues. In October 2003 it published
Local Inter Faith Activity in the UK: A Survey - the
results of a research project into inter-faith
initiatives across the United Kingdom. The project
found nearly 140 inter-faith and multi-faith local
bodies, 43 per cent of which had come into
existence since the beginning of 2000. The Scottish
Inter Faith Council also aims to promote good
relations between the different faith communities
in Scotland.
The Council of Christians and Jews works for
better understanding among members of these
two religions, and deals with educational and
social issues. The Three Faiths Forum and the
Calamus Foundation have as their focus
relationships between the Christian, Jewish and
Muslim traditions.
Some individual faith communities also have units
or programmes dedicated to inter-faith relations.
For example, CTBI has a Churches’ Commission
on Inter Faith Relations, which aims to enable the
churches to engage effectively in dialogue with
other faith communities in Britain and Ireland
and to facilitate a network of information and
experience among Christians about inter-faith
relations. The Inter-faith Unit of the Islamic
Foundation was set up with the specific aim of
developing better relations between the Muslim
and Christian traditions.

The United Kingdom has a strong tradition in
literature, theatre, popular and orchestral music
and the performing arts. These, together with
collections in UK museums and galleries, act
as a magnet for overseas visitors and make a
substantial contribution to the economy.
According to economic estimates made by the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport
(DCMS), the creative industries accounted for
8 per cent of UK Gross Value Added in 2002 (see
glossary and page 357), and creative employment
provided 1.9 million jobs in Great Britain in 2003.
Participation
With the exception of the cinema, the percentage
of the population who attend various types of
cultural event has remained fairly stable since the
early 1990s (Table 16.1). Admissions to UK
cinemas, however, fell to 167.3 million in 2003
from a record 176 million in 2002.

Attendance at some of the major museums and
galleries in England also rose between 2001/02 and
2002/03, with the National Museums Liverpool,
Natural History Museum, and the Victoria and
Albert Museum recording the biggest increases.
Churches and cathedrals are also an important
part of the nation’s cultural heritage, attracting
many visitors. York Minster and Canterbury
Cathedral receive over 1 million visitors each
a year. Kew Gardens in London, the National
Botanic Gardens in Carmarthenshire, Royal
Botanies in Edinburgh and the Botanic Gardens in
Belfast and are also popular destinations for
people with an interest in gardening and
horticulture. Windsor Castle, the Tower of
London and the Roman Baths in Bath are among
the top heritage attractions.
Highlights of 2003-04
Among the many cultural highlights from
mid-2003 to mid-2004 were:
■ the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO)
marked its 100th birthday in June 2004 with
a huge musical celebration. Many of the
world’s greatest artists and conductors,
including Mstislav Rostropovitch and
Michael Tilson Thomas, joined the LSO on
stage at London’s Barbican Centre (see also
page 242);
■ gardens, museums and galleries throughout
the United Kingdom ran a series of Treasure
Trails to celebrate the 250th anniversary of
the Royal Society of Arts. All the exhibits on
display were designed, built or inspired by the
RSA, an RSA Lellow or medallist. Among the
industrial designers featured at London’s

Eric Ottaway who designed the famous red
Routemaster Bus;
■ Ricky Gervais, star of The Office, became the
first UK actor to win a TV comedy-acting
award at the Golden Globes. The Office also
won the award for the best comedy;
■ a record 70 buildings received awards from
the Royal Institute of British Architects
(RIBA);
■ East London schools joined the University of
East London and Newham Sixth Form
College to stage Cascade 2004, an exhibition
of young people’s artwork supporting
London’s bid to stage the Olympic Games in
2012. A colourful wire and papier-mache
sculpture of Olympic figures in action formed
the centrepiece of the exhibition;
■ Jonathan Ive, designer of Apple’s iMac and
iPOD, was named by a panel of culture
experts as the most influential person in
British culture on BBC TV’s Cultural Movers
and Shakers programme.

Live performance
Festivals
Hundreds of professional arts festivals take place
in the United Kingdom each year. Some, like the
Fifty years of Lord of the Rings
The year 2004 marked the 50th anniversary of
the publication of the first two parts of JRR
Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. The
Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers were
both published in 1954. A special set of ten
stamps, designed by HGV, was issued by the
Royal Mail in February. The stamps, illustrating
places and characters from the novels, were taken
from Tolkien's original drawings apart from one
by his son, Christopher, featuring a map of
Middle Earth. Tolkien's celebrated fantasy came
first in The Big Read, a BBC poll to find the best¬
loved UK novel.
Edinburgh International Festival
Edinburgh International Festival is one of the
world's greatest celebrations of the arts. The
2004 event featured performances of music,
theatre, opera and dance, as well as lectures and
discussions. Highlights included three productions
from Hanover State Opera and an 11-hour
theatrical performance of Claudel's Le Soulier de
Satin. The Edinburgh Festival Fringe, with a wide
variety of programmes (including street events),
takes place alongside the main events. In recent
years it has proved a fertile training ground for
comedians and actors, who have progressed to
successful careers elsewhere. Other annual
Edinburgh events include the International Film
Festival, the Jazz Festival and the Edinburgh Mela
Festival. The Edinburgh International Book
Festival, which celebrated its 21st birthday in
2004, is the largest literary festival in Europe,
welcoming over 200,000 visitors.
Cardiff and Brighton Festivals, last for a month
and offer a wide variety of programmes.
The Aldeburgh Festival, founded by Benjamin
Britten, focuses on classical music. The Hay
Festival, held in Hay-on-Wye, originally focused
on literature - the town is renowned for its
second-hand bookshops - but has broadened its
range in recent years and its programme now
includes musical events and contributions from
guest speakers. Film festivals include the annual
London Film Festival, the Leeds Children’s and
Young People’s Film Festivals and the Brief
Encounters short film festival in Bristol.
Glastonbury, one of the world’s biggest outdoor
festivals, features many forms of culture: pop and
dance music, fringe theatre, painting, sculpture
and textile art. About 150,000 people attended the
2004 festival. There were over 2,000 performances
at over 30 different venues from artists from all
over the world. The WOMAD (World of Music,
Arts and Dance) festival celebrates many forms of
music, arts and dance from countries and cultures
all over the world. WOMAD was originally
inspired by UK musician Peter Gabriel. Since the
first festival in 1982, WOMAD has presented more
than 140 events in various different countries. UK

events in 2004 included the WOMAD Festival at
Rivermead, Reading.
. Festivals in Wales include Brecon Jazz and the
Llangollen International Eisteddfod, which
attracted performers from over 40 countries in
2004. The Belfast Festival is the largest of its kind
in Ireland, attracting over 50,000 visitors.
Featuring both Irish and international artists and
performers, the two-week arts extravaganza
includes theatre, dance, literature, jazz, classical,
popular and folk music, visual arts, and comedy.
Journeys and migrations were the themes for the
2004 festival.
Royal National Mod
The 100th Royal National Mod took place in
Oban on the west coast of Scotland in October
2003. The festival celebrates Gaelic language and
culture through competitions in music, drama,
dance, arts and literature. Visitors came from
Australia, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom
and the United States to take part in the
competition. The first Mod was held in Oban
in 1892.
Drama
Musicals, thrillers, and comedies provide most
of the material for London’s West End theatre
productions. The Mousetrap by thriller-writer
Agatha Christie opened in 1952 and is the longest-
running play, with over 20,000 performances by
the end of 2002. Les Miserables, based on Victor
Hugo’s novel, and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s The
Phantom of the Opera, are among the most
popular and longest-running musicals.
Clwyd Theatr Cymru in Mold is the national
English-speaking theatre company for Wales.
The Welsh language theatre company, Theatr
Genedlaethol Cymru, was established in Llanelli
in autumn 2003 and toured theatres throughout
Wales in 2004. There is also a national network
of production companies for theatre for young
people.
In Scotland, the Royal Lyceum Theatre and the
King’s and Festival Theatres in Edinburgh, and the
Citizen’s Theatre Glasgow, have full programmes
covering a wide range of productions. The
Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh is Scotland’s main
centre for new writing. The creation of a National
Theatre of Scotland (NToS) was announced in
September 2003 with start-up funding from the
Scottish Executive of £7.5 million over two years.
The NToS will commission productions to tour
a range of venues across Scotland.
Northern Ireland has six major theatres, including
the Opera House and Waterfront Hall in Belfast
and the new Millennium Forum in the city of
Londonderry. It also has several independent
theatre companies specialising in productions
of new work.
Music
Classical music
A range of professional orchestras perform
regularly throughout the United Kingdom,
offering a varied repertoire of classical works from
the great composers to more experimental pieces.
Four major symphony orchestras are based in
London: the London Symphony Orchestra, the
Philharmonia, the London Philharmonic, and the
Royal Philharmonic.
In the English regions the Bournemouth
Symphony, City of Birmingham Symphony, the
Halle (based in Manchester) and the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic orchestras are all well
known and highly rated. In Wales the BBC
National Orchestra of Wales offers a year-round
programme of orchestral and choral music - the
latter featuring the BBC National Chorus of Wales.
The Royal Scottish National orchestra is based in
Glasgow and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra
performs throughout Scotland and overseas. The
Ulster Orchestra is Northern Ireland’s only fully
professional orchestra.
Three well-established events in the classical
musical calendar are the Leeds International Piano
Competition for young pianists, held every three
years and won by Antti Siirala of Finland in 2003;
the biennial BBC Singer of the World in Cardiff
Competition, won by Tommi Hakala from Finland
in 2003; and the biennial BBC Young Musicians

LSO celebrates centenary
The London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), the first
independent, self-governing orchestra in the
United Kingdom, was founded in 1904. Many
distinguished conductors and composers have
been associated with the orchestra over the last
100 years, including Hans Richter, Sir Thomas
Beecham, Sir Edward Elgar and Sir Colin Davies.
The LSO was the first UK orchestra to travel
overseas, visiting Paris in 1906, and the first to
visit the United States, in 1912. Today the LSO
tours the world and is the only UK orchestra to
hold an annual residency at the Lincoln Center in
New York.
During 2004/05 the LSO is performing over 100
concerts, featuring many great international
artists, at its home in London's Barbican Centre.
As part of the centenary, the LSO's education and
community Discovery programme will launch a
new programme of work to involve people of all
ages and abilities in making music alongside the
players.
are the world’s largest music festival. The themes
of the 2004 series were ‘Back to Bohemia’,
‘East/West’ and ‘England at the Crossroads: 1934’.
In September 2004 the BBC presented the eighth
season of‘Proms in the Park’ in Belfast,
Manchester, Swansea and Hyde Park, London. All
four concerts featured top classical and pop artists
live on stage and linked up to the Royal Albert
Hall for the finale of the traditional Last Night of
the Proms concert.
English and Welsh choral societies have done
much to foster the oratorio tradition at the leading
music festivals. English ecclesiastical choral singing
is a speciality of the choirs of cathedrals and
Oxford and Cambridge colleges.
Opera
London’s Royal Opera House (ROH) at Covent
Garden attracts performers with international
reputations. Glyndebourne Opera (East Sussex),
which relies on private patrons for its summer
season, is another prestigious venue. The English
National Opera returned to play at the newly
restored London Coliseum in February 2004. The
restoration has provided more public space,
returned the auditorium to its original rich colour
scheme, and installed a new glass roof with views
of the Coliseum’s famous tower.
Welsh National Opera will move to a permanent
home at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff
when it opens in November 2004. Consisting of
the 1,900-seat lyric theatre, a studio theatre and a
dance theatre, with an additional concourse space
for live performances, the centre will host an
international showcase of opera, musicals, ballet
and dance.
Scottish Opera for All toured Scotland’s schools in
2004 with its innovative production of the
Minotaur. Schoolchildren had a backstage view of
opera production, and workshops with musicians
and singers allowed them to perform their own
version of the Minotaur.
Popular music
Turnover in the music industry was estimated at
over £2 billion in 2003, employing about 125,000
people. In 2003, over 236 million albums and
36 million singles were sold in the UK domestic
market. In Scotland, Edinburgh hosted the MTV
Europe Awards in November 2003, generating an
estimated £9 million for the economy.

UK and US artists continue to dominate the pop
charts. Coldplay’s Clocks won a Grammy Award
for Record of the Year in 2003. Rock band The
Darkness shot to fame during 2003. By February
2004 they had sold 1.2 million copies of their
debut album, Permission to Land, in the United
Kingdom and almost 1 million copies elsewhere
in the world. The Darkness won Best Group at the
2004 Brit Awards, while the award for Best British
Female went to Dido (see Table 16.2).
Folk music is popular in all parts of the United
Kingdom. In Northern Ireland, for example,
traditional musicians perform in pubs and clubs,
playing Fiddles and other Celtic instruments.
Scottish and Welsh festivals uphold Gaelic and
Celtic traditions in music and song.
Dance
Two major dance companies based in London are
the English National Ballet and the Royal Ballet.
Other important ballet companies include the
Birmingham Royal Ballet and the Northern Ballet
Theatre. Scottish Ballet is Scotland’s National
Dance Company and the fourth largest in the
United Kingdom. Its Associate Programme offers
children and young people the opportunity to take
courses taught by professional dancers.
Independent Ballet Wales is renowned for
presenting classical ballet in an unpretentious
and original way. Each year the company of
eight dancers and two technicians tours
around 90 venues throughout the United
Kingdom, including schools, arts centres and
universities. Its productions are re-choreographed
to suit each venue. It also runs workshops and
classes.
The Laban Centre in south-east London, which
opened in 2003, is the new home for one of
Europe’s leading institutions for contemporary
dance training and is the largest contemporary
dance space in the world. Contemporary dance
companies with established reputations are
Diversions, Spring Loaded and the Richard Alston
Dance Company. The Ballet Boyz, Michael Nunn
and William Trevitt, were commissioned by
television’s Channel 4 to write and present The
Rough Guide to Choreography, which aims to
demystify and widen audiences for contemporary
dance. In March and April 2004 Scotland’s
national dance centre, Dance Base in Edinburgh,
produced the entertaining Off Kilter, a witty look
at Scottish culture with choreography performed
to both traditional and world music.
The Critics' Circle
The Critics' Circle is an association of UK critics,
founded in 1913. It has nearly 300 members,
most of whom write for national and regional
newspapers and magazines.
The Critics' Circle has four sections representing
dance, drama, film and music. The first three
sections hold award ceremonies each year, with
critics voting for the winners.
In 2003, the English National Ballet won two
dance awards: the Company Prize for
Outstanding Repertoire (Classical) and Michael
Corder for Best Choreography (Classical). In the
drama awards, Eve Best was voted Best Actress
for Mourning Becomes Electra and Michael Sheen
Best Actor for Caligula. The Attenborough Award
for the best British film was won by Peter
Mullan's The Magdalene Sisters.
Film and broadcasting
Film
In 2003, cinemas took £742 million at the box
office in the United Kingdom, compared with
£755 million in 2002. An estimated 57,000 people
were employed in the film and video production
and distribution and film exhibition sectors. In
2002, film exports were worth £656 million.
There were record levels of film production in the
United Kingdom in 2003. Thirty major feature
films attracted inward investment of £729 million,
compared with £266 million in 2002. These
included Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,
King Arthur and Troy. There were 44 UK-produced
films such as Thunderbirds and Bride and Prejudice
(the Bollywood version of Pride and Prejudice).
In addition, there were 99 UK co-productions,
compared with 66 in 2002, indicating the growth
and importance of international partnerships to
the UK film industry.

Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was the
most popular film with UK cinema-goers in 2003,
followed by Finding Nemo. The United Kingdom
was involved in the production of three of the top
ten most popular films, Love Actually, Calendar
Girls and Johnny English.
The Government provides tax relief to encourage
film production in the United Kingdom.
Companies shooting films wholly or partly in the
United Kingdom can write off 100 per cent of
production expenditure against their liabilities for
tax. There are plans to extend tax credits to film
distribution in a bid to widen audiences for new
UK films.
Television
Around 95 per cent of UK households own a
television set, and, on average, people watched
26 hours of television a week in 2003.
The kinds of programmes produced in the United
Kingdom vary enormously. Soaps (long-running
series with multiple characters and plots) such as
EastEnders and Coronation Street regularly top the
ratings. Sporting events, such as the Euro 2004
football championships, and shows such as Pop
Idol and Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, were also
popular in 2004. Individual programmes receiving
BAFTA awards in 2004 in recognition of particular
merit included The Office Christmas Special
(comedy) and The Deal (drama).
Radio
The BBC broadcasts a wide spectrum of classical
music, jazz and world music (both live and
recorded) on Radio 3. BBC Radio 1 broadcasts
rock and pop, and much of the output of BBC
Radio 2 is popular and light music.
Among the independent stations, Classic FM
offers mainly classical music and Virgin Radio
plays rock and pop. Much of the output of UK
local radio stations consists of popular and light
music, phone-ins and news.
BBC Radio 4’s output is mainly talk-based and
includes current affairs and documentaries,
discussions and full-length plays. It is estimated
that over 90 per cent of the adult population aged
15 and over tune into radio, with BBC local and
national stations having just over half of the
audience share.
More details on the pattern of radio listening,
and the range of new digital stations available to
listeners, can be found in chapter 17.

Museums and galleries
There are around 1,860 registered museums and
galleries in the United Kingdom. These include the
major national museums, about 1,000 independent
museums, and others supported by local authorities,
universities, the Armed Services, the National Trust
and English Heritage.
In December 2001 free admission was reintroduced
to all national museums and galleries. Over the next
two years the number of visitors to these museums
and galleries increased by 72 per cent with over 5
million more visitors in each of 2002 and 2003.
There were 33.5 million visitors to all DCMS-
sponsored museums and galleries in 2002/03,
increasing to 34.7 million visitors in 2003/04. Over
1.2 million visits were made to national museums
and galleries in Wales in 2003/04. In 2003 a record
number of visits (over 0.75 million) were made to
the National Museums and Galleries of Northern
Ireland, 7 per cent more than in 2002.
The Designation Scheme was launched in 1997 to

international importance held in England’s non¬
national museums. Designated collections are held
in 62 museums or museum services across
England. The scheme is administered by The
Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA),
on behalf of the DCMS.
Renaissance in the Regions is a major new
initiative from the MLA to revitalise England’s
regional museums. Regional museum ‘Hubs’ or
centres of excellence have been established in each
English region with funding of £70 million over
four years from 2003/04. Visits by schoolchildren
to museums in Phase One of the initiative
increased by 28 per cent in 2003/04.
London's Transport Museum
London's Transport Museum tells the story of
London's transport history since the early 1800s.
Displays and special exhibitions explore the
impact of public transport on the growth of
London and the lives of Londoners. The collection
was started in the 1920s with two Victorian
horse buses and an early motor bus. Since then it
has grown to over 350,000 items ranging from
horse-drawn trams, red double-decker buses and
tube trains to posters, uniforms and early versions
of the innovative London Underground map,
designed by HC Beck.

The Arts Council of Wales supports a network of
galleries throughout Wales including Oriel Davies
Gallery in Newtown and Ffotogallery, which is
dedicated to the promotion of photographic art
in Wales.
Architecture and design
The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA),
with about 30,000 members, has been promoting
and advancing architecture since receiving its
Royal Charter in 1837. Architecture Week, held in
June and organised by Arts Council England in
partnership with RIBA, is a national celebration of
contemporary architecture with events around the
country.
In England, the Commission for Architecture and
the Built Environment (CABE) is responsible for
promoting high standards in the design of
buildings and spaces between them. Its urban unit,
CABE Space, was launched in May 2003 and is
responsible for encouraging good quality parks
and green spaces. In Scotland, a new body,
Architecture and Design Scotland (ADS), will
promote architecture from 2005, taking over and
developing the work of the Royal Fine Art
Commission for Scotland.
30 St Mary Axe
30 St Mary Axe, built on the site of the former
Baltic Exchange, is the newest addition to
London's skyline. At 180 metres, the 40-storey
tower, affectionately called 'the Gherkin' because
of its unusual curvilinear shape, is the second
tallest in the City of London. It was designed by
Norman Foster and partners, for Swiss Re. The
building incorporates a range of innovative
features, including use of natural ventilation and
daylight to reduce energy consumption. It also
boasts London's highest restaurant with a
360-degree panorama over the city and beyond.
Better use of design by business, the public sector
and educational bodies, is supported and
encouraged in the United Kingdom by the Design
Council. The Council is funded by a grant from
the Department of Trade and Industry.
Crafts
‘Crafts’ in the United Kingdom is an umbrella
term covering a huge range of activities, from the
making of ceramics and textiles to handmade toys
and other personal and household products.
The Crafts Council is the national development
agency for contemporary craft. It supports and
245
16 Culture
UK 2005
showcases the best in craft practice across the
United Kingdom, aiming to raise the profile of
crafts to an international audience. It runs an
international exhibition programme at its London
gallery, organises the annual Chelsea Crafts Fair
and in 2004 launched COLLECT, the art fair for
contemporary objects, at the Victoria and Albert
Museum. Craft Forum Wales supports craft
business groups in Wales. In Scotland, the Scottish
Arts Council has a Crafts department that
promotes crafts and helps craftworkers. The Arts
Council of Northern Ireland has played a leading
role in establishing an inter-agency Craft
Development Unit for Northern Ireland.
The Government’s £13 million Culture Online
programme uses new technologies to reach people
who do not normally participate in arts and
culture. Projects in the programme include World
War Two Remembered, with Age Concern and the
BBC, which enables older people to use computers
and the Internet to record their memories; and
SoundWorlds, which helps people to discover
and create music.
The written word
In 2002 UK publishers issued over 125,000
separate titles (including new and revised
editions). The UK book industry exported books
worth £1.3 billion in 2003 (see Table 27.11 on
page 427).

division, promotes the export of British books. The
Welsh Books Council promotes the book trade in
Wales in both Welsh and English and the Gaelic
Books Council supports the publication of books in
Gaelic. Other trade organisations include the
Scottish Publishers Association and the Independent
Publishers Guild. Booktrust encourages reading and
the promotion of books through an information
service and a children’s library.

Libraries and archives
Local authorities in Great Britain and education
and library boards in Northern Ireland have a duty
to provide a free lending and reference library
service. There are almost 5,000 public libraries in
the United Kingdom. In Great Britain more than
34 million people (60 per cent of the population)
246
UK 2005
16 Culture
were registered members of their local library in
2001/02, and 10 million people make a visit to a
public library at least once every two weeks. Those
who are not registered members can also use many
of the local library facilities.
Many libraries have collections of CDs, records,
audio- and video-cassettes, DVDs and musical
scores for loan to the public, while a number also
lend from collections of works of art, which may
be originals or reproductions. Most libraries hold
documents on local history, and all provide
services for children.
About 361 million books and 42 million audio¬
visual items were borrowed from UK public
libraries in 2002/03. Children’s author Jacqueline
Wilson, whose works include The Story of Tracy
Beaker, became the most borrowed author in 2003,
ending Catherine Cookson’s 17-year reign. Of the
20 most-borrowed books at libraries, 16 were
written by Jacqueline Wilson. Other authors
popular with borrowers include Danielle Steel,
Jack Higgins and crime novelist Agatha Christie.
Nearly all libraries have personal computers with
Internet connections for public use. The People’s
Network is a £120 million programme funded
through the National Lottery (see page 251) to set
up information communications technology
(ICT) learning centres in all UK public libraries. A
further £50 million is enabling library material to
be stored and accessed in digitised form.
I—  
Mobile libraries
Many people living in isolated rural communities
rely on mobile libraries to borrow books and
access information services. There are over 660
mobile libraries in the United Kingdom providing
a whole range of services, including Internet
access. Each mobile library serves hundreds of
local communities on a weekly, fortnightly or
monthly basis. It will carry about 3,500 items
including books, talking books and videos.
V   J
The British Library
The British Library, the national library of the
United Kingdom, is custodian of one of the most
important research collections in the world (150
million items spanning 3,000 years). The reading
rooms, including the Business and Intellectual
Property Centre, are open to those who need to
see material (manuscripts, newspapers, journals,
stamps, maps and
CD-ROMs as well as books) that is not readily
available elsewhere and to those whose work or
studies require the facilities of the national library.
The library’s Internet catalogue has details of more
than 10 million documents from the past 500
years, including books, journals and reports.
UK publishers are legally obliged to deposit a copy
of each new publication in the British Library. The
National Libraries of Scotland and of Wales, the
Bodleian at Oxford and the Cambridge University
Library (and the Library of Trinity College, Dublin)
can also claim copies of all new British publications.
Archives
In 2003 the Public Record Office and the Historical
Manuscripts Commission combined to form a new
organisation, The National Archives. Its building in
Kew houses the records of the superior courts of
law of England and Wales and those of most
government departments, as well as manuscripts of
historical documents, such as the Domesday Book
(1086) and autograph letters and documents of the
sovereigns of England. The Freedom of Information
Act (FOI) 2000, which comes into force in January
2005, gives people a general right of access to
information held by public authorities. This means
the 30-year period after which most public records
were available for inspection will no longer apply.
The National Archives has set up an FOI
implementation team and is developing procedures
for responding to requests for information when
the Act is implemented.
The National Archives also provides information
and advice about historical papers outside the
public records, and advises private owners,
grant-awarding bodies, record offices, local
authorities and the Government on the acquisition
and maintenance of manuscripts. It maintains the
National Register of Archives (the central
collecting point for information about British
historical manuscripts) and the Manorial
Documents Register, both of which are available to
researchers.
The National Archives of Scotland in Edinburgh
and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland
in Belfast serve a similar purpose.

Cultural opportunities
The National Curriculum in England and Wales
specifies that all children at school should receive
training in the arts, music and literature (see page
125). In Scotland, expressive arts are a key
component of the pre-school and 5 to 14
curricular guidelines. In Northern Ireland, creative
and expressive studies are part of the curriculum
in all publicly-financed schools, while cultural
heritage is one of six cross-curricular themes.
In England, Artsmark is a national award scheme
run by Arts Council England and supported by the
DCMS, the Department for Education and Skills
(DfES), and other relevant agencies. An Artsmark
is awarded to schools that show a demonstrable
commitment to the full range of the arts - music,
dance, drama, and art and design.
Other initiatives to encourage cultural excellence
in schools include:
■ a national grants scheme commencing in
September 2004 to complement the Music
and Dance (Aided Pupil) scheme to help
exceptionally talented young musicians and
dancers to benefit from the best specialist
training locally;
■ Youth Music, established in 1999 to provide
music-making opportunities for children and
young people up to the age of 18,
concentrating on those who live in areas of
social and economic need;
■ the Scottish Executive’s Youth Music
Initiative, which provides access to free music
tuition for all schoolchildren across Scotland;
■ Creative Partnerships, a nationwide initiative
managed by Arts Council England and
sponsored by the DCMS with additional
support from the DfES, which aims to give
schoolchildren aged 5 to 18 and their teachers
the opportunity to explore their creativity by
working with professionals;
■ The music manifesto, a unique coalition of
prominent people from the music industry,
the education world and leading music
organisations, which was launched in July
2004 to promote music education; (see page
125); and
■ Scotland’s Schools Cultural Coordinators
programme for heritage, arts and culture,
which identifies ways of maximising the
potential contribution of culture to young
people’s education.
In Northern Ireland, Creative Youth Partnership, a
three-year scheme that aims to create and support
arts programmes, activities and initiatives for
children and young people aged from 3 to
25 years, was launched in 2004. Funding of
£1.6 million has been provided by the Department
of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Arts Council of
Northern Ireland and the Department of
Education.
For those wishing to pursue a career in the arts,
training available at post-16 tends to concentrate
on particular specialisms. The DfES allocates
£14 million a year in grants for drama and dance
students for tuition and maintenance in England
and Wales. Over 800 students a year cover their
tuition fees in this way, on the same basis as other
higher and further education pupils. All training
must be at accredited institutions and towards
recognised qualifications, with annual evaluation
by the DfES to ensure that standards are
maintained.
The Royal National Theatre’s Education
Programme encourages access to drama through
youth theatre projects, touring productions,
workshops, rehearsed readings, work in schools
and a nationwide membership scheme.
Professional training in music is given at
universities and conservatoires. Professional
training for dancers and choreographers is
provided mainly by specialist schools, while all
government-funded dance companies provide
dance workshops and education activities.
The National Film and Television School is
financed jointly by the Government and the film,
video and television industries. It offers
postgraduate and short-course training for
directors, editors, camera operators, animators and
other specialists.
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in the art colleges and fine and applied
art departments of universities and in further
education colleges and private art schools. Some
of these institutions award degrees at postgraduate
level. The Royal College of Art in London is the
only wholly postgraduate school of art and design
in the world. Art is also taught to degree level at
the four Scottish art schools.
The Scottish Dewar Arts Awards support
exceptionally talented young people who have
248

limited financial resources. The awards aim to
foster excellence in the arts and offer young people
from less privileged backgrounds an opportunity
to develop their talent to the highest level.

A new Creative & Cultural Industries Sector Skills
Council is being established to coordinate UK
training and professional development in this
sector.
Administration
Many artists and performers engaged in cultural
activity rely on subsidies and funding from the
Government and other patrons of the arts. The
Government also has a role in protecting the rights
of authors through copyright legislation (see page
250); providing a regulatory framework for
cultural activities in areas such as film
classification; and encouraging greater public
participation in the arts.
Public sector involvement in the arts is expressed
in a number of ways:
■ through the work of the four administrations
directly responsible for culture in England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland;
■ through local government support for local
initiatives; or
■ through intermediate groups such as the arts
councils, which act independently from the
Government but are publicly funded and take
on the role of patrons of the arts.
The policy responsibilities of the DCMS include
the arts, public libraries and archives, museums
and galleries and the built heritage in England,
and UK-wide responsibilities for broadcasting,
creative industries, and the National Lottery (see
page 251).
DCMS objectives for the arts include:
■ creating an efficient and competitive market
by removing obstacles to growth and
unnecessary regulation;
■ broadening access to cultural events and to
the built environment;
■ raising the standards of cultural education
and training; and
■ ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to
achieve excellence in areas of culture and to
develop talent, innovation and good design.

The National Assembly for Wales has
responsibility for the arts in Wales and has
published a culture strategy, Creative Future. The
Scottish Executive’s National Cultural Strategy
provides the basis for the administration of the
arts in Scotland and a Cultural Commission has
been set up to review the delivery and governance
of culture. In Northern Ireland responsibility for
the arts rests with the Department of Culture, Arts
and Leisure.
Local authorities
Although policy is formulated by the UK
Government (for England) and the devolved
administrations, many initiatives and services
are provided at a local level. Local authorities
maintain many museums and art galleries, and
the network of public libraries. They also provide
grant aid for professional and amateur
orchestras, theatres, and opera and dance
companies.
Arts councils
Arts Council England, the Arts Council of Wales,
the Scottish Arts Council and Arts Council of
Northern Ireland are independent development
bodies that distribute government grants and
Lottery funding to a wide range of artists and arts
organisations. This can be through open
application schemes or by regular funding over a
long term. The arts councils also commission
249
16 Culture
UK 2005
research into the impact of the arts on society and
develop forward strategies.
Arts Council England funds major national arts
organisations in England, including the Royal
Opera, the Royal Ballet, the Birmingham Royal
Ballet, English National Opera, the Royal
Shakespeare Company, the Royal National
Theatre, the South Bank Centre and the main
touring companies, such as Opera North and
English National Ballet. Arts Council England also
funds a wide range of community, experimental
and culturally diverse work by individual artists
and large and small companies. In 2003/04 it made
3,647 grants for the arts, ranging in value from
£500 to £100,000.
The Arts Council of Wales supports major
companies such as the Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru
(Welsh Language National Theatre of Wales),
Welsh National Opera and over 130 other
organisations. The Scottish Arts Council supports
more than 100 artistic organisations, as well as
investing in individual artists. It supports festivals
from Edinburgh to Orkney and the national
companies: Scottish Ballet, the Royal Scottish
National Opera, Scottish Opera and the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra. During 2004, the Scottish
Arts Council invested over £60 million in the arts.
The Arts Council of Northern Ireland allocated
more than £7.3 million to 129 arts organisations
in 2004/05.

■ the portable antiquities scheme, set up to
record archaeological objects. Information
from the scheme is now available online. Over
30,000 records offer an important research
tool for both academics and the public;
■ schemes for museum registration and
designation of collections (see page 245); and
■ the Acceptance in Lieu Scheme, whereby
pre-eminent works of art may be accepted by
the Government in settlement of tax and
allocated to public galleries.
UK Film Council and bfi
The UK Film Council oversees the majority of
public funding for film in the United Kingdom. It
aims to stimulate a competitive, successful and
vibrant film industry and to promote the widest
possible enjoyment and understanding of cinema
throughout the nations and regions of the United
Kingdom. It aims to ensure that the economic,
cultural and educational aspects of film are
represented effectively at home and abroad. It also
supports UK Film Council US (the former British
Film Office in Los Angeles), which acts as its
information and marketing satellite in the United
States.
The UK Film Council supports new and innovative
film-makers as well as the production of
mainstream films, and training schemes to develop
the UK film industry workforce of the future. It is
the principal funder of the British Film Institute
(bfi), which promotes audience appreciation of film
through cultural and educational initiatives across
the United Kingdom. The Council works with Sgrin
Cymru, Scottish Screen and the Northern Ireland
Film and Television Commission to develop film
across the United Kingdom. It also provides
funding (£7.5 million a year) to the nine English
regional screen agencies.
Cinema licensing and film classification
Local licensing conditions differ from area to area,
but local authorities have a duty to prohibit
children from viewing unsuitable films. In
assessing films, authorities normally rely on the
judgement of an independent non-statutory body,
the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), to
which all items are submitted. The BBFC is also
legally responsible for classifying videos.
Responsibility for the policy on film and video
classification lies with the DCMS.
Authors' copyright and performers'
protection
Original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
works (including computer programs and
databases), films, sound recordings, broadcasts and
the typographical arrangement of published
editions are automatically protected by copyright
in the United Kingdom if they meet certain legal
requirements. The copyright owner has rights
against unauthorised reproduction, distribution,
public performance, rental, broadcasting and
250
UK 2005
16 Culture
adaptation of his or her work (including putting
material on the Internet without permission). In
most cases the author is the first owner of the
copyright, and the term of copyright in literary,
dramatic, musical and artistic works is for the life
of the author and for 70 years thereafter. There are
similar rules governing copyright on films. Sound
recordings and broadcasts are protected for a
period of 50 years.
National Lottery
The introduction of the National Lottery in 1994
significantly altered the funding of arts projects in
the United Kingdom. During the early years of the
Lottery, the focus of arts funding was on major
capital projects. Some shift in emphasis occurred
from 1998 onwards, with the allocation of funds to
smaller, local projects. By June 2004 the Arts
Councils across the United Kingdom had awarded
over 32,000 grants worth a total of over £2.3
billion. The UK Film Council had awarded over
1,600 Lottery grants worth over £107 million.
In addition, the DCMS has established the
National Endowment for Science, Technology
and the Arts (NESTA), which uses the income
generated by £250 million of Lottery funds to
support projects and inventions in the arts and
sciences.
Sponsorship
Total UK business investment in the arts in
2002/03 was £120 million, compared with £111
million in 2001/02. Arts & Business promotes and
encourages partnerships between business and the
arts. It has 400 business members and manages the
Arts & Business New Partners Programme on
behalf of Arts Council England and the DCMS.
Many arts organisations also benefit from the
fund-raising activities and financial support of
friends, groups and private individuals. For
example, theatre companies have traditionally
relied on the support of‘angels’, individual
sponsors investing often quite small amounts of
money to meet the costs of putting on a show, in
the prospect of subsequently recouping their
investment from box office proceeds.

Communications are moving into the digital age.
Technology is changing the way people in the
United Kingdom work, spend their leisure time,
access information and communicate with each
other. The number of UK households using new
forms of communication has increased rapidly in
recent years (Figure 17.1). Ownership of mobile
phones has grown from 17 per cent of households
in 1996/97 to 85 per cent in February 2004.
With the advent of digital television and radio,
alongside the continuing expansion of cable and
satellite television, there has been a proliferation of
new public service and independent channels.
Since December 2003 the Office of
Communications, Ofcom, has been responsible for
regulating TV and radio (apart from the BBC) as
well as telecommunications and wireless
communications (see page 262), but the press

Survey, Office for National Statistics
remains self-regulated. Both broadcast and non¬
broadcast media (including the press) are major
vehicles for advertising (see page 265).
Telecommunications
Turnover of the telecommunications services
sector in Great Britain grew by 6 per cent in 2003
to £50.8 billion.
Telephone services
A total of 396 billion minutes of telephone calls
were made from fixed and mobile links in 2003
(Table 17.2). Calls from fixed phones increased by
2 per cent and accounted for 85 per cent of all
calls in 2003, down from 86 per cent in 2002.
Calls from mobile phones grew by 13 per cent to
59 billion minutes in 2003.
The telephone is one of the most common
consumer durable goods in the home. At the end
of 2003, there were just under 35 million fixed
lines in the United Kingdom, although this figure
has been falling over the past few years with the
increased popularity of mobile phones.
British Telecommunications (BT) is the biggest
fixed-line UK operator with over 71 per cent of
revenue market share although competitors have
increased their share of the market, especially the
business market. BT runs one of the world s largest
public telecommunications networks, with around
29 million exchange lines. BT’s group turnover in
the year to March 2004 was £18.5 billion. The two
main cable operators are ntl and Telewest, with
2.5 million and 2.1 million telephony lines
respectively.
A variety of new telecommunications services have
emerged. For example, many companies offer their

Mobile telephones
At the end of March 2004 there were 54.7 million
active mobile phone customers in the United
Kingdom, compared with just under 50 million a
year earlier. The five network suppliers are Orange
(part of France Telecom), 02, Vodafone, T-Mobile
(a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom) and 3, which
launched its services in 2003. There are also
around 50 independent service providers. In 2003,
Vodafone had the largest market share in terms of
total retail revenue at 32 per cent.
Messaging services such as text messaging (SMS)
and picture messaging (MMS) are growing in
popularity. The networks handled 21.3 billion
messages in 2003, a 23 per cent increase on 2002.
Text and picture messaging accounted for between
14 and 19 per cent of each network’s retail
revenue.
BT and Cable and Wireless have been working
with Ofcom to develop new technology that can
trace the location of people making emergency
calls on mobile phones. In February 2004, the
London Ambulance Service became the first UK
organisation to adopt the new technology. The
Service receives about 750 calls from mobile
phones each day, around 25 per cent of total calls.
Regulation
Ofcom (see page 262) is responsible for promoting
competition and choice, and protecting the
interests of consumers.
The Communications Act 2003 represents a
substantial move towards complete deregulation of
the telecommunications industry, by replacing the
previous licence-based system in the United
Kingdom with a ‘general conditions of
entitlement’ regime. The Act also provides for the
implementation of a series of EU directives that
together make up the new regulatory framework
for European electronic communications. The
directives emphasise, among other things, lighter
regulation and greater consistency across Europe.
In September 2003, Ofcom’s predecessor Oftel
issued a Good Practice Guide for Service Delivery
for Disabled and Elderly Customers in the United
Kingdom. The guide aims to ensure that mobile
product and service providers are meeting the needs
of these customers, for example by producing
handsets that are compatible with hearing aids or
that are large enough to be gripped easily.
The Internet
By April 2004, 53 per cent of UK households had
Internet access at home, compared with 10 per
cent in 1998/99.
A growing number of homes and businesses are
using high-speed broadband connections.
According to Ofcom, there were nearly 4.5 million
such connections in the United Kingdom by the
end of June 2004, compared with around
2.2 million at the end of June 2003. Over 40,000
new connections were being made each week by
the end of December 2003.
The National Statistics Omnibus Survey found
that 58 per cent of adults in Great Britain had
used the Internet in a three month period prior
to being interviewed between April 2003 and
February 2004. Table 17.3 shows the most
common reasons given by those who used the
Internet - these include email and finding
information about goods or services. Among those

Postal services
The Post Office was founded in lo55. It pioneered
mail services and was the first service in the world
to introduce adhesive postage stamps as proof of
advance payment for mail. Under the provisions of
the Postal Services Act 2000, the Post Office ceased
to be a statutory corporation and its property,
rights and liabilities now belong to Royal Mail
Holdings pic, a company wholly owned by the
Crown. It has an operating subsidiary, Royal Mail
Group pic. Royal Mail Group serves its UK
customers through two main operations - Royal
Mail and Parcelforce Worldwide - and a subsidiary
company. Post Office Ltd, and employs around
200,000 people.
Competition and regulation
The Postal Services Commission, known as
Postcomm, is responsible for licensing postal
operators throughout the United Kingdom,
including Royal Mail. Every company that delivers
letters weighing up to 100 grams needs a licence
from Postcomm. It also regulates the price and
qualitv of services provided by Royal Mail.
In January 2003 Postcomm opened the market for
some business mail services. The first category
opened to competition - bulk mail above 4,000
items per mailing from a single user at a single site
in a similar format - was worth about £1.7 billion
in its first year, representing about 30 per cent of
the UK letter market by value. Postcomm is
reviewing options for the next stage of
competition.
By 1 April 2004 Postcomm had awarded long-term
licences (valid for a minimum of seven years) to
six postal operators in addition to Royal Mail.
Four other companies held interim licences, valid
for a minimum of 12 months.
Since January 2004 domestic customers have been
entitled to compensation when mail is delayed for
three days or more. There is a separate scheme for
bulk business users.
Royal Mail operations
Roval Mail delivers to all 27 million UK addresses.
It missed its quality of service targets for 2003/04,
delivering 90.1 per cent of first-class mail by the
next working day against a target of 92.5 per cent.
Deliveries were seriously affected by industrial
action in autumn 2003 and a fire at one of its
major mail centres.
The volume of mail has continued to grow despite
competition from other forms of communication,
254
UK 2005
17 Conmunications and the media
increasing by 5 per cent between 2000/01 and
2003/04. Mail is collected from over 113,000 post
boxes across the United Kingdom, and from Post
Office branches and large postal users. The UK
postcode system allows mechanised sorting down
to part of a street on a delivery round and, in
some cases, to individual addresses.
Parcelforce Worldwide provides a range of delivery
services throughout the United Kingdom,
handling 40 million items in 2003/04. As well as
delivering to all UK addresses, it offers a range of
services to 239 countries and territories worldwide.
At July 2004, there were around 16,000 Post Office
branches in the United Kingdom, of which some
560 were directly run by Post Office Ltd. The rest
are owned by the people who run them, including
franchisees and subpostmasters and
subpostmistresses. Post Office branches handle
a wide range of transactions, with a total turnover
of £977 million in 2003/04. They act as agents for
Royal Mail and Parcelforce Worldwide,
government departments and local authorities,
and also provide banking services. Post Office
branches offer access to current accounts for seven
UK banks, and to basic bank accounts for a
further 17, as well as providing access to National
Savings and Investments (see page 463). Post
Office Ltd is developing its own provision of
personal banking services. The first product, an
unsecured personal loan, was introduced in March
2004. Post Office Ltd also provides the largest
foreign exchange services in the United Kingdom.
About 29 million customers visit a Post Office
branch each week. The number of people using
the Post Office to collect benefit payments is
falling, due to the Government’s programme to
pay benefits directly into bank, building society or
Post Office accounts. People can still receive their
benefits at the Post Office by opening a Post Office
card account.
In October 2002, parliamentary approval wras
given for Government funding to assist the Post
Office in a programme involving the closure of up
to 3,000 urban Post Office branches across the
United Kingdom. The aim of the programme is to
create a more streamlined network of viable
branches, while ensuring that over 95 per cent of
the urban population still lives within one mile of
a Post Office branch. By July 2004, 1,273 branches
had been closed. Postwatch, the postal industry’s
independent watchdog, ensures that there is full
public consultation on every proposed closure,
and actively opposes closures wrhere it feels they
will restrict access to postal services or affect
people in deprived areas. In addition, the
Government is providing £450 million over three
years to support the rural Post Office network.

Television
Terrestrial television
There are five public service broadcasters in the
L'nited Kingdom: the BBC ' British Broadcasting
Corporation», ITY1, Channel 4, Five, and S4C
Stand Fedwur Cymru), which broadcasts Welsh-
language programmes. They each have a statutory
public service remit that governs the minimum
lev el of different types of programming they
should provide. The broadcasting regulator Ofcom
is conducting a review to find out howr far the
public service broadcasters are fulfilling their
remit. The first phase of the review', published in
April 2004, states that the broadcasters are only
partly fulfilling the requirements of the
Communications Act 2003. Ofcom’s findings
suggest that there is too much reliance on
programmes with obvious popular appeal, and
that tbe audience share for public service
broadcasters is falling. Ofcom has invited further
consultation with groups including viewers. The
results will be fed into the BBC’s Charter review
process see page 256 .
Local television services began in 1998. There are
18 local service licences, which make use of spare
frequencies as and when they are available.

UK 2005
17 Communications and the media
The BBC
The BBC was formed in October 1922 by a group
of leading wireless manufacturers. By 1925, it was
broadcasting radio programmes to most of the
United Kingdom. In its early days, the BBC’s
output concentrated on plays, concerts, talks and
variety programmes. News could only be
broadcast after 7.00 pm, to avoid affecting
newspaper sales. In 1936, the BBC launched the
world’s first regular high-definition television
service from Alexandra Palace in north London.
The BBC now broadcasts nearly 55,000 hours of
television each year to national and regional
audiences on its analogue and digital channels. It
provides two national networks financed mainly
by a TV licence fee - in 2004, a colour licence cost
£121.00 and a black and white licence £40.50. BBC
One is a mainstream channel, broadcasting
popular programmes across a range of genres
including documentaries and current affairs,
features, drama and light entertainment, sport,
religion and children’s programmes. BBC Two
The Hutton report
In May 2003 a news item was aired on BBC
Radio 4's Today programme about the evidence
relating to Iraq's alleged weapons of mass
destruction. In July 2003, Dr David Kelly, a
government weapons inspector - and the alleged
source of the Today story - committed suicide.
Lord Hutton conducted an inquiry into the
circumstances leading to Dr Kelly's death. His
report, published in January 2004, criticised the
reporting of the BBC journalist who made the
allegations against the Government, saying that
they were 'unfounded'. The report also criticised
BBC managers for failing to check the details of
the story as soon as the Government objected to
the allegations. This led to the resignation of the
BBC's Chairman and its Director-General. In a
statement, the BBC said that it believed it must
re-state its core editorial values, look hard at
issues of accountability and transparency, and
work to sustain editorial quality across the full
range of its programmes. A new Chairman was
appointed in April and new Director-General in
May 2004.
40 years of BBC Two
BBC Two celebrated its 40th birthday on 20 April
2004. It was originally launched at least partly to
encourage people to buy new television sets in
order to receive its 625-line transmission - a
technological advance which paved the way for
colour television. A special programme broadcast
on the anniversary featured clips from classic BBC
Two shows including Monty Python's Flying
Circus from the late 1960s, David Attenborough's
natural history programme Life on Earth from
1979 and award-winning comedy The Office from
2001 (see also chapter 16).
aims for more innovation and originality in its
programming, often catering for specialist
audience interests. For details of BBC digital
television channels, see page 258.
Network programmes are made at, or acquired
through, Television Centre in London and six
bases throughout the United Kingdom (Belfast,
Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, and
Manchester). Programmes are also commissioned
from independent producers, and the BBC must
ensure that at least 25 per cent of its original
programming comes from the independent sector.
In 2003/04, the BBC achieved this target with 29
per cent of qualifying programmes being
independent productions.
Education is a central component of the BBC’s
public service commitment. A range of
programmes is broadcast for primary and
secondary schools, further education colleges and
the Open University (see page 131). There are also
educational programmes for people learning from
home, or doing evening classes. Books, pamphlets,
computer software, and audio and video material
supplement the programmes.
The BBC operates under a Royal Charter. The
Charter and Agreement were granted in 1996 and
will expire in 2006. Before the Charter is renewed,
the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
(DCMS) is carrying out a detailed review of the BBC
and its work, including its digital and on-line
services, and plans to publish a Green Paper in late
2004 which will be sent out for consultation. This
will be followed by a White Paper setting out the
Department’s recommendations on the BBC s future.

17 Communications and the media
The ITV network
ITV began broadcasting in the United Kingdom in
September 1955. Today, the ITV network’s
analogue services are broadcast on Channel 3 as
ITV1. This is a federation of regionally based
commercial TV companies, which are licensed to
supply programmes in the 14 independent
geographical television regions. In February 2004
Carlton Communications and Granada pic - two of
the major regional licence-holders - merged to form
ITV pic, which now owns most of the regional ITV
licences. There are three other ITV broadcasting
companies: SMG, which runs Scottish TV and
Grampian; Ulster TV; and Channel TV. Until
October 2003, there were two licences for London,
one for weekdays and the other for the weekend. The
ITV merger means that a single company is now
responsible for delivering all regional services in the
capital for the first time in ITV’s history. A separate
company, GMTV, provides a national breakfast-time
service, transmitted on the ITV network.
All Channel 3 licences were renewed for a further
ten-year period from 1999, 2000 and 2001. Under
the Communications Act 2003, Channel 3 licensees,
Channel 4 and Channel 5 will also be offered new
digital licences. These will be valid until the end of
December 2014 or 18 months after the switchover
from analogue to digital (see page 259), whichever
is later. The licences will be issued before the end
of 2004, following consultation.
ITV 1 is a mainstream channel that aims to attract
the widest possible audience. Programmes are
broadcast 24 hours a day throughout the country.
Independent Television News (ITN) provides a
shared national and international news service for
the ITV network. From February 2004, ITV’s
national, international and regional news services
came together as a single division to enable a more
effective use of resources.
ITV 1 companies are obliged to operate a national
programme network. The ITV network centre,
which is owned by the companies, independently
commissions and schedules programmes. ITV 1
also provides 27 dedicated regional and sub¬
regional services for the 14 independent regions.
Operating on a commercial basis, licensees derive
most of their income from selling advertising time.
Their financial resources and programme
production vary considerably, depending largely on
the population of the areas in which they operate.
Newspaper groups can acquire a controlling
interest in ITV companies, although measures are
in force to deter any undue concentrations of
media ownership (see page 264).
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4 provides a national 24-hour television
service. It is a statutory corporation, licensed and
regulated by Ofcom, and funded by selling its own
advertising time. Its remit is to provide
programming that demonstrates innovation,
experiment and creativity in form and content;
appeals to the tastes and interests of a culturally
diverse society; includes a significant number of
educational programmes; and exhibits a distinctive
character. Channel 4 does not make programmes
but commissions them from independent
producers or acquires them from other
programme providers, including a number from
overseas. The Channel 4 Group also runs a
number of commercial businesses, including
digital channels E4 and FilmFour, which are
managed via a wholly owned subsidiary,
4Ventures.
In Wales the fourth analogue channel is allocated
to S4C, which is regulated by the Welsh Fourth
Channel Authority and funded by an annual grant
from the Treasury and advertising revenue.
Members of the Welsh Authority are appointed by
the UK Government. S4C must ensure that a
significant proportion of programming - the
majority aired between 6.00 pm and 10.00 pm - is
in Welsh. At other times it transmits Channel 4
programmes.
An independent review of S4C, requested by the
Authority, was published in July 2004. The
document recommends that S4C:
■ reviews its programme distribution
operations;
■ agrees a formula with the BBC for the supply
of programmes and other services; and
■ plays a more integral role in the developing
national cultural and economic agendas in
Wales.
Other recommendations cover S4C’s digital
services.
Five
The newest UK analogue terrestrial channel went
on air in 1997, its ten-year licence having been
257
17 Communications and the media
UK 2005
awarded by competitive tender to Channel 5
Broadcasting Ltd. Five reaches over 80 per cent of
the population and is financed by advertising
revenue. It broadcasts a range of programmes,
including current affairs, children’s programmes,
films, drama, and sport. It also produces 17 per
cent of UK regional TV programmes.
Text services
Teletext is a text-based data service, broadcast on
Channels 1 to 5 using the spare signal capacity in
analogue terrestrial television services. Most
domestic television sets can decode teletext signals,
which are displayed as text and simple graphics.
Teletext services include regularly updated
information on a variety of subjects, including
news, sport, travel, weather and entertainment.
Between January and September 2003, teletext
services attracted 18 million viewers a week.
Teletext is now also available on digital TV, the
Internet and mobile phones.
The BBC broadcasts its ‘Ceefax’ teletext service
within the BBC One and Two signals. For ITV1,
Channel 4 and Five, the teletext service is provided
under ten-year broadcasting licences, granted by
Reality TV
The past few years have seen an increase in the
number of 'reality' TV programmes shown in the
United Kingdom. These include 'fly-on-the-wall'
documentaries, capturing real-life events as they
unfold, and 'constructed documentaries' where
non-actors are filmed interacting with each other
in artificial environments. Viewing figures for
'factual entertainment' programmes rose by 20
per cent between 1998 and 2002.
In 2003, the most successful reality TV shows
were I'm a Celebrity — Get Me Out of Here! and
Pop Idol. The final of the third series of I'm a
Celebrity... attracted an average of 14.1 million
viewers — an audience share of 54.5 per cent. The
final of Pop Idol ms watched by 11.1 million
people. Other popular shows include Fame
Academy, where young people are filmed while
being coached to become singers and musicians.
Around 4.5 million people voted in the 2003
Fame Academy final.
Ofcom (see page 262). All terrestrial channels
provide subtitles via teletext for people with
hearing difficulties on most of their programmes.
Digital television
By the end of March 2004 nearly 13.1 million, or
53 per cent, of UK households were accessing
digital television via either terrestrial or satellite
transmitters.
Digital technology provides a more efficient way of
delivering television. Computer technology is used
to convert sound and pictures into a digital format
and to compress them. This means that several
television channels can be carried in the same
amount of space as analogue signals use to carry
one channel. Digital signals can be received by
standard aerials, satellite dishes or through cable
networks, but have to be decoded and turned back
into sound and pictures using a separate set-top
box or a decoder built into the television.
A single frequency carrying the signals of several
digital services is called a multiplex. There are six
terrestrial multiplexes capable of supporting
services in the United Kingdom. One is reserved
for and operated by the BBC, and the other five
are licensed by Ofcom. One of these is reserved for
Channel 3, Channel 4 and public teletext services,
and another for Five and S4C. The other three
multiplexes are licensed to the BBC and Crown
Castle International.
Most UK digital terrestrial television (DTT)
services are free-to-view but there are also a few
pay services, operated by Top Up TV. Freeview,
marketed by DTV Services Ltd and run by its three
shareholders - the BBC, Crown Castle
International and British Sky Broadcasting
(BSkyB), was launched in October 2002 as an
umbrella brand for UK DTT services, and offers
about 30 TV channels and 21 radio channels, along
with interactive services. By the end of March 2004,
3.5 million households were receiving Freeview.
All services from the public service broadcasters
that are available on analogue terrestrial are also
available on DTT. Other services available on DTT
include four news channels; BBC Parliament
(coverage of proceedings in the House of
Commons, House of Lords, the Parliament in
Scotland and the Assemblies in Wales and
Northern Ireland); BBC Three (new
entertainment, comedy, contemporary drama and
UK 2005
17 Communications and the media
music); BBC Four (in-depth coverage of culture,
the arts, science, history, business and current
affairs); two daytime children’s channels from the
BBC; ITV2 (an additional service from the ITV
network); and S4C2 (an additional service from
S4C, which provides over 80 hours of programmes
in Welsh each week). There are also several
shopping and entertainment channels.
The Government is looking at ways to exploit the
potential of digital TV. In December 2003, the
Cabinet Office published a policy framework
aimed at encouraging government departments to
consider the benefits of delivering public services
via digital television. The Learning and Skills
Development Agency has published a report that
sets out to raise awareness and stimulate debate on
interactive digital TV as a learning medium.
Switching to digital
The Government intends eventually to stop the
transmission of analogue terrestrial television. It
believes that the switchover to digital television
could start as early as 2007, and be completed by
2012. The Digital Television Project is a
partnership between the Government,
Interactive digital TV
Digital TV offers three types of interactive service:
stand-alone information; transactional services
(like shopping, banking and email); and enhanced
programming, where viewers can access
additional audio and video features. These
services can be delivered either through TV
channels or as video on demand, where viewers
have complete freedom to decide what is
transmitted to them and when. For video on
demand, viewers need a dedicated broadband
digital connection to their TV.
BBCi, the BBC's interactive TV service, offers
continuous news updates and enhanced
programming features such as quizzes, polls, and
additional audio and video features. For example,
viewers watching the BBC's coverage of the FA
Cup Final in May 2004 could switch between the
live football match, earlier highlights, statistics,
player profiles and news.
broadcasters, industry, consumer and other
groups. The Project’s action plan aims to enable
ministers to decide how and when to implement
digital switchover and help prepare a subsequent
implementation project. The Project aims to
complete its work by the end of 2004.
Non-terrestrial television
There are two main non-terrestrial television
delivery systems (platforms) in the United
Kingdom - cable and digital satellite television.
These are funded mainly by subscription income.
Both platforms offer packages of subscription-only
television services, including some premium
services such as film and sports channels and
pay-per-view events. Both cable and satellite are
required to carry the public service channels at no
additional cost to the viewer.
On both platforms, the selection of channels
available via subscription is broadly similar, but
there are some services that are unique to each
platform. Available services include Eurosport, the
Cartoon Network, UKTV channels (programmes
from TV archives), E4 (additional services from
Channel 4) and the Discovery Channel (science
and nature documentaries).
Foreign language services are also provided. Some
are designed for minority ethnic groups within the
United Kingdom, while others aimed primarily
at audiences in other countries. Viewers in the
United Kingdom can similarly receive a variety of
television services from other European countries.
Cable television
Cable television services are delivered to
consumers via underground networks of cables.
The signals are decoded using a converter box,
which is rented from the cable provider. Cable
customers can also access telephone services and,
in the case of digital cable, broadband Internet
services.
By June 2004 the cable network passed around
12.5 million UK homes, mostly in urban and
suburban areas. The two main cable providers are
ntl and Telewest, and both networks are in the
process of converting from analogue to digital. By
June 2004, there were 3.4 million cable television
subscribers, with digital cable accounting for
2.5 million of these.
259
17 Communications and the media
UK 2005
Analogue cable television systems can carry
around 65 television services, as well as a range of
telecommunications services. Digital cable
television can carry around 200 services (TV and
radio), plus interactive services.
Digital satellite
Referred to as ‘direct to home’, satellite television
signals are received through a specially designed
antenna (or ‘dish’) mounted on the outside of a
building, and are decoded using either a set-top
box or an integrated digital television.
Most satellite television in the United Kingdom is
provided by BSkyB, which had just over 7 million
subscribers at the end of June 2004. Sky Television
was launched in 1989 as an analogue-only service,
and began simultaneous digital broadcasting in
1998. In October 2001 the analogue signal was
switched off and the service renamed Sky Digital,
the first digital-only TV platform in the United
Kingdom. It has been fully interactive since 1999.
In June 2004, Sky Digital offered over 420 TV and
radio services. Most of the more popular channels
are accessible only by subscription to BSkyB, but
there is also a wide variety of free-to-view
channels. By the end of 2004, BSkyB will be
introducing a package of free-to-view television
services which viewers will be able to receive
without a subscription.

BBC network radio
Radio
Radio is popular in the United Kingdom, with
90 per cent of the adult population listening each
week in the quarter to June 2004. News, talk and
music are the main output of radio stations.
The BBC has five national radio networks, which
together transmit all types of music, news, current
affairs, drama, education, sport, comedy and a
range of features programmes. There are also 40
BBC local radio services covering England and the
Channel Islands, and national radio services in
Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including
Welsh and Gaelic language stations. At the end of
June 2004, BBC radio had a 53 per cent share of
the total UK radio audience (Table 17.4).
There were 274 independent local radio (ILR)
services by the end of July 2004, providing music,
local news and information, sport, education and
BBC network radio, broadcasting to the whole of
the United Kingdom, transmits nearly 44,000
hours of programmes each year on its five
networks:
■ Radio 1, a contemporary music station that
also provides news and information, serving
a young target audience;
■ Radio 2, offering a wide range of popular and
specialist music, news, information and
entertainment for a mainstream audience;
■ Radio 3, covering classical music and jazz,
drama, documentaries and discussion;
■ Radio 4, offering news and current affairs
coverage, complemented by drama, science,
the arts, religion, natural history, medicine,
finance, comedy and gardening features; it
also carries parliamentary coverage and
cricket on its longwave frequency, and
broadcasts BBC World Service programmes
overnight; and
260
UK 2005
17 Communications and the media
■ Five Live, broadcasting news, current affairs
and extensive sports coverage.
BBC World Service
The BBC World Service has been broadcasting for
over 70 years. It broadcasts in 43 languages
(including English) and had an estimated global
weekly audience of 146 million listeners in June
2004. As well as news, programmes cover the arts,
drama, business, documentaries, religion, science
and technology and sport.
While maintaining shortwave broadcasts for mass
audiences, the BBC World Service is making
programmes widely available on FM frequencies
and delivering services in major languages through
digital broadcasting and on the Internet.
BBC Monitoring, the international media
monitoring arm of the BBC World Service,
monitors and translates news, information and
comment from more than 3,000 radio, TV, press,
Internet and news agency sources around the
world. Users of the service include government
departments, journalists, academics and
businesses.
Independent national radio
There were three independent national radio
services operating in 2004, licensed and monitored
by Ofcom (see page 262):
■ Classic FM, which broadcasts mainly classical
music, together with news and information;
■ Virgin 1215, which plays rock and pop music
(and is supplemented by a separate Virgin
station that operates under a local London
licence and broadcasts on an FM frequency);
and
■ talkSPORT, a speech-based service.
Independent local radio
Independent local radio (ILR) stations broadcast
a wide range of programmes and news of local
interest, as well as music and entertainment, traffic
reports and advertising. There are also stations
serving minority ethnic communities. Ofcom
awards independent local radio licences in an open
competition. The success of local licence
applications is determined by the extent to which
applicants would broaden the range of radio
services available in the area, cater for the tastes
and interests of people in the area, and
demonstrate evidence of local demand or support,
and have the necessary resources to maintain the
service for the 12-year licence period.
Digital radio
Around 44 million people in the United Kingdom
live in areas where national digital radio services
are available. Ofcom has awarded one national
commercial multiplex licence carrying eight
programme services. It has also awarded licences
for 44 local digital multiplexes, which carry about
300 commercial radio services between them.
As with digital TV, digital radio allows more
stations to be broadcast within a similar amount
of radio spectrum. Listeners to digital radio can
hear analogue stations, plus a wide range of‘digital
only’ services including more stations and
additional text information.
40 years of pirate radio
The year 2004 marks the 40th anniversary of
pirate radio stations - stations that broadcast
without a licence. Radio Caroline, which began
transmitting from a boat off the coast of Essex in
spring 1964, was the first UK offshore station.
Caroline built up an audience of 8 million
listeners, and launched the careers of
broadcasters such as John Peel and Tony
Blackburn. Radio Caroline still exists as a digital
and satellite station.
Pirate stations can interfere with legal broadcasts
and disrupt vital safety communications. Penalties
under the Wireless Telegraphy Act /949 include
fines, seizure of all equipment and even
imprisonment. In 2003, the Radiocommunications
Agency prosecuted 71 pirate broadcasters.
At the end of June 2004, 1.7 million listeners in
the United Kingdom were tuning into the BBC’s
digital radio stations. The stations are:
■ IXtra, broadcasting contemporary black
music for a young audience;
■ Radios 1-4, Five Live and the BBC World
Service;
261
17 Communications and the media
UK 2005
■ 6 Music, broadcasting contemporary and
classic pop and rock music;
■ Five Live Sports Extra;
■ BBC Asian Network, a station for the Asian
communities in the United Kingdom; and
■ BBC7, broadcasting classic and new comedy,
drama and children’s programmes.
Regulation of broadcast media
In December 2003, under the provisions of the
Communications Act 2003, Ofcom became the
single regulator for broadcast media, assuming the
responsibilities of five individual regulators: the
Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC); the
Independent Television Commission (ITC); the
Office of Telecommunications (Oftel); the Radio
Authority; and the Radiocommunications Agency.
Although the BBC is subject to Ofcom’s regulation
concerning programme standards and economic
regulation, the BBC’s Board of Governors is
responsible for managing its public service remit.
Ofcom has a range of responsibilities inherited
from the five regulators it replaced. It monitors
standards and fairness on terrestrial, cable and
satellite TV and radio, considers complaints, and
adjudicates on claims of unfair treatment in
broadcasts and of unwarranted infringement of
privacy in programmes or in their preparation.
Another responsibility is licensing and regulating
all commercial television services (including BBC
commercial services) operating in, or from, the
United Kingdom, including those delivered by
non-terrestrial platforms. Ofcom must ensure that
a wide range of commercial television services is
available throughout the United Kingdom and that
they are of high quality and appeal to a variety of
tastes and interests. It must also ensure fair
competition in the provision of these services, and
compliance with the rules on media ownership.
The various television services are regulated
through licence conditions, codes and guidelines.
The codes cover programme content, advertising,
sponsorship and technical standards. If a licensee
does not comply with the conditions of its licence
or the codes, Ofcom can impose financial penalties.
Ofcom’s licensing and regulatory remit covers all
independent radio services including national,
local, cable, satellite and restricted services. Its
three main tasks are to plan frequencies, appoint
licensees with a view to broadening listener choice,
and to regulate programming and advertising.
Licensees must adhere to Ofcom codes covering
engineering, programmes, news and current
affairs, and advertising and sponsorship. Satellite
radio services must be licensed by Ofcom if they
are transmitted from the United Kingdom for
general reception within the country, or if they are
transmitted from outside but are managed
editorially from within the United Kingdom.
Ofcom is also responsible for managing the UK
radio spectrum, although the Government retains
some overriding powers of direction. This involves
international representation, commissioning
research, and allocating radio spectrum and
licensing its use.
The press
On an average weekday just over 50 per cent of
adults in the United Kingdom read a national
newspaper and nearly 27 per cent read a regional
daily paper. Each week nearly 28 per cent of adults
read a paid-for local weekly title. The United
Kingdom has a long tradition of a free (and often
outspoken) press. While newspapers are almost
always financially independent of any political
party, they can express obvious political leanings
in their editorial coverage, which may derive from
proprietorial and other non-party political
influences.
In addition to sales revenue, newspapers earn
considerable amounts from advertising. The press
is the largest advertising medium in the United
Kingdom, with total advertising spending in 2003
of around £8.4 billion (see page 265).
The national press
The national press consists of 11 morning daily
papers and 11 Sunday papers. In the six months to
March 2004, more than 12.7 million national
newspapers were sold every weekday and over 14
million on Sunday. The biggest-selling daily paper
is the Sun, which sells around 3.4 million copies.
At one time London’s Fleet Street area was the
centre of the industry, but now all the national
papers have moved their editorial and printing
facilities to other parts of London or away from
the capital altogether. Editions of many papers are
also printed in other countries.
262
UK 2005
17 Communications and the media
National newspapers are often described as
broadsheet or tabloid papers on the basis of
differences in format, style and content, although
one broadsheet, The Times, is available in a
compact’ tabloid size as well as the traditional
broadsheet and another, the Independent, is only
available in compact format. Many newspapers
have colour pages and most produce extensive
supplements as part of their Saturday or Sunday
editions, with articles on the arts, personal finance,
travel, gardening, home improvement, food and
wine, fashion and other leisure topics. Increasing
competition from other media in the delivery of
news, information and entertainment has
contributed to a gradual decline in circulation for
many titles.
Regional newspapers
There are more than 1,300 regional and local
newspaper titles and 98 regional press publishers,
the top 20 of which account for 85 per cent of all
UK regional and local newspaper titles. Most towns
and cities throughout the United Kingdom have
their own regional or local newspaper. These range
from morning and evening dailies to papers that are
published once a week. They mainly cover stories of
regional or local interest, but the dailies also cover
national and international news. In addition,
they provide a valuable medium for advertising.
Between July and December 2003, nearly
41 million regional papers were sold each week,
and 29 million free titles distributed each week.
London has one paid-for evening paper, the
Evening Standard. Its publisher also produces a
free daily morning newspaper, Metro, launched in
1999. Metro's London edition had a circulation of
nearly 450,000 between July and December 2003.
There are local weekly papers for every district in
Greater London; these are often different local
editions of one centrally published paper.
About 650 free distribution newspapers, mostly
weekly and financed by advertising, were
published in the United Kingdom in 2003. Top
free weekly titles include the Manchester Metro
News and the Glaswegian.
There is a broad-based daily and weekly
newspaper industry in Scotland covering local,
Scottish and UK as well as international issues.
The Daily Record is the biggest-selling weekday
paper, and the Sunday Mail the most popular
Sunday paper. There are also broadsheet
newspapers including the Scotsman (based in
Edinburgh) and the Herald (in Glasgow). The
press in Wales includes Welsh-language and
bilingual papers; Welsh community newspapers
receive an annual grant as part of the
Government’s wider financial support for the
Welsh language. Newspapers from the Republic
of Ireland, as well as the British national press,
are widely read in Northern Ireland. Regional
newspapers include the Belfast Telegraph, the Irish
Times and the News Letter in Ulster.
The minority ethnic press
There are several newspapers and magazines
produced by minority ethnic communities in the
United Kingdom. Most are published weekly,
fortnightly or monthly, although there are some
daily titles including the Chinese newspaper, Sing
Tao, the Urdu Daily AUSAF and the Arabic
Al-Arab. Afro-Caribbean newspapers include the
Gleaner, the Voice, New Nation and Caribbean
Times, each published weekly. The Asian Times
is an English language weekly for people of
Asian descent. Publications also appear in other
languages, particularly Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi
and Punjabi.
The periodical press
There are nearly 8,500 separate periodical
publications that carry advertising. In 2003,
advertising expenditure in the sector was more
than £1.8 billion. Periodicals are generally
classified as either ‘consumer’ titles, offering
readers leisure-time information and
entertainment, or ‘business and professional’ titles,
which provide people with material relevant to
their working lives. Within the former category,
there are general consumer titles, which have a
wide appeal, and specialist titles, aimed at people
with particular interests, such as motoring, sport
or music. A range of literary and political journals
appears monthly or quarterly, and there are also
many in-house and customer magazines produced
by businesses or public services.
Electronic newspapers
Most national newspaper groups have set up
websites, providing access to articles from their
printed titles or on-line versions of their papers.
Some offer additional special interest sites. The
audience for on-line papers is growing fast: in
August 2004, the Suns on-line version had just
263
17 Communications and the media
UK 2005
over 4.1 million visitors (up from 3 million in
August 2003).
The Talking Newspaper Association of the United
Kingdom is a registered charity whose members
supply newspapers and magazines in alternative
formats, primarily audio cassette, for blind,
partially sighted and disabled people. Its national
service, which acts as a newsagent for the visually
impaired, records over 250 titles on to audio
cassette and supplies over 100 titles in electronic
formats. The Association reaches more than
250,000 visually impaired listeners across the
United Kingdom.
Press Complaints Commission
A policy of press self-regulation, rather than
statutory control or a law of privacy, operates in
the United Kingdom. The Press Complaints
Commission (PCC) deals with complaints about
the content and conduct of newspapers and
magazines, and operates a Code of Practice agreed
by editors, which covers inaccuracy, invasion of
privacy, harassment and misrepresentation by the
press. The PCC’s jurisdiction also extends to
on-line versions of newspaper and magazine titles
by publishers that already subscribe to the Code.
It is a non-statutory body whose 17 members are
drawn from both the public and the industry. In
January 2004, the PCC created a Charter
Compliance Panel to scrutinise the way it deals
with complaints.
In 2003 the PCC received 3,649 complaints, a
39 per cent increase on the previous year. The PCC
has taken action to make lodging a complaint as
straightforward as possible. Around 42 per cent ot
the complaints related to national newspapers,
41 per cent to regional newspapers, 9 per cent
to newspapers specific to Scotland, 7 per cent
to magazines and the rest to publications in
Northern Ireland and to agencies. Most complaints
breaching the Code - 96 per cent in 2003 — are
resolved by editors.
The press and the law
There is no state control or censorship of the
newspaper and periodical press, and newspaper
proprietors, editors and journalists are subject to
the law in the same way as any other citizen.
However, certain statutes include sections that
apply to the press. There are laws governing the
extent of newspaper ownership in television and
radio companies (see below) and mergers
involving newspapers. Press representatives have a
legal right to be supplied with agendas and reports
of meetings of local authorities.
There is a requirement to reproduce the printer’s
imprint (the printer’s name and address) on all
publications, including newspapers. Publishers are
legally obliged to deposit copies of newspapers and
publications at the British Library (see page 247).
Publication of advertisements is governed by
wide-ranging legislation, including public health,
copyright, financial services and fraud legislation.
Legal restrictions are imposed on certain types of
prize competition.
Laws on contempt of court, official secrets and
defamation are also relevant to the press. A
newspaper might be in contempt of court if it
published something that created a substantial risk
that the course of justice in active legal
proceedings would be seriously impeded or
prejudiced. The unauthorised publication of
protected official information in areas such as
defence and international relations, where
unauthorised disclosure would be damaging, is an
offence under the Official Secrets Acts. These are
restrictions on publication generally, not just
through the printed press. Most legal proceedings
against the press are libel actions brought by
private individuals.
Media ownership
The Communications Act 2003 simplified UK
media ownership rules. The new rules aim to
promote competition and attract new investment,
while encouraging a range of different viewpoints
and maintaining specific limits on the ownership
of media assets. The changes mean that
individuals and organisations from outside the
European Economic Area (see page 104) and local
authorities can now own Broadcasting Act
licences. Ofcom (see page 262) will be reviewing
the rules at least every three years. New public
interest tests will allow the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry to intervene in media
mergers where there are public interest
considerations.
There are also changes to the rules governing
cross-media ownership. The new 20 per cent rule
means that no one controlling more than 20 per
264
UK 2005
17 Communications and the media
cent of the national newspaper market can hold an
ITV licence or hold more than a 20 per cent stake
in any ITV service. No one owning a regional ITV
licence can own more than 20 per cent of the local
or regional newspaper market in the same region.
Advertising and sponsorship
Total UK expenditure on advertising rose by
2.5 per cent to £17.2 billion in 2003. Press
advertising accounted for nearly 49 per cent (see
page 262), while television accounted for a further
25 per cent (see page 257).
Increasingly, companies are using new technology
such as the Internet to advertise their products.
Although Internet advertising accounted for only 2
per cent of total expenditure in 2003, this was an
increase of £143 million or nearly 62 per cent on
2002.

of programmes on its public service channels. It
must not give publicity to any firm or organised
interest except when this is necessary in providing
effective and informative programmes. It does,
however, cover sponsored events.
Broadcast media
Non-broadcast media
Advertising and sponsorship are allowed on all
commercial television and radio services, subject to
controls. Ofcom (see page 262) oversees the codes
governing advertising standards and programme
sponsorship previously operated by the ITC and the
Radio Authority and can impose penalties on
broadcasters that do not comply.
In 2003 there were 8,835 complaints to the ITC
about advertisements broadcast on UK television
(Table 17.5). Following consultation, Ofcom is
seeking parliamentary approval for its proposals to
contract out the regulation of broadcast advertising.
The new system is expected to begin in November
2004.
Advertisements on independent television and
radio are broadcast in breaks during programmes
as well as between programmes, and must be
distinct and separate from them. Advertisers are
not allowed to influence programme content.
Political advertising and advertisements for betting
(other than the National Lottery, the football
pools, bingo and amusement arcades) are
prohibited. All tobacco advertising is banned on
television and radio. Religious advertisements may
be broadcast on commercial radio and television,
provided they comply with the Ofcom guidelines.
The BBC may not raise revenue from broadcasting
advertisements or from commercial sponsorship
Advertising in non-broadcast media, including
newspapers, magazines, posters, sales promotions,
cinema, direct mail, and electronic media (such as
paid-for Internet advertising and text messages) is
regulated by the Advertising Standards Authority
(ASA).
The ASA is an independent body set up to ensure
that advertisers conform to the Committee of
Advertising Practice (CAP) Code (the British Code
of Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct
Marketing). This requires that advertisements and
promotions are legal, decent, honest and truthful;
are prepared with a sense of responsibility to the
consumer and society; and respect the principles
of fair competition generally accepted in business.
The ASA monitors compliance with the Code and
investigates complaints received. In 2003 it
received 14,277 complaints. Pre-publication advice
is available to publishers, agencies and advertisers
from the CAP Copy Advice Team. If an
advertisement is found to be misleading or
offensive, the ASA can ask the advertiser to change
or remove it. Failure to do so can result in
damaging adverse publicity from the ASA’s weekly
publication of its judgements, the refusal of
advertising space by publishers, and the loss of
trading privileges. The ASA can also refer
misleading advertisements to the Office of Fair
Trading (see page 358), which has the power to
seek an injunction to prevent their publication.

The United Kingdom has a long tradition of
sporting invention, participation and achievement.
In 2003, UK sportsmen and sportswomen held
over 50 world titles in a variety of sports,
including athletics, professional boxing, sailing,
water skiing, snooker and swimming. In the same
year able-bodied UK athletes won 88 medals at
world and European championships, while
disabled athletes won 99 medals at this level.
Major sporting events in 2003/04
In December 2003, the European Cross Country
Championship took place in Edinburgh, and for
the second consecutive year the winner of the
women’s race was Great Britain’s Paula Radcliffe.
Nearly 31,700 runners completed the London
Marathon in April 2004. The event, which started
in 1981, is the one of the largest marathons in the
world (only the New York and Chicago Marathons
had more finishers in 2003). Each year around
three-quarters of the runners are sponsored,
raising about £30 million for charities and other
good causes. Tracey Morris, a 36-year-old optician
from Leeds, was the first British woman home,
finishing in 2 hours, 33 minutes and 52 seconds,
which won her a place in the British team for the
Olympic Games in Athens. The oldest runner to
take part was 93-year old Fauja Singh, who ran his
first marathon at the age of 89. He improved his
record in 2004, finishing in 6 hours, 7 minutes and
13 seconds.
On 15 May 2004 the Arsenal football team ended
its 2003-04 season with a 2-1 win over Leicester
City. With 90 points, Arsenal was the clear winner
of the Premiership title. It did not lose any of the
38 matches in the season, becoming the first team
in the top division to go through a whole league
season unbeaten since Preston in 1888-89.
Rugby Union World Cup winners
On 22 November 2003 the England team won the
Rugby Union World Cup after a hard-fought final
against the host nation, Australia. The match was
decided in the last minute of extra time by a drop
kick from Jonny Wilkinson, resulting in a score of
20-17 to England. It was the first time a team from
the northern hemisphere had won the world title.
To celebrate the win a victory parade from Marble
Arch to Trafalgar Square was held on 8 December
2003, with the team travelling in two open-topped
buses before an estimated crowd of 750,000 fans.
In June and July 2004 Portugal hosted the Euro
2004 football championship. England was the only
team from the United Kingdom to qualify for the
competition and reached the quarter-finals, losing
to the eventual runners-up, Portugal, on penalties.
Greece beat Portugal 1-0 in the final and became
European Champions for the first time.
The national cricket sides of New Zealand, the
West Indies and India visited England during
summer 2004. England equalled its best ever run
in Test cricket by winning seven consecutive Test
matches: three against New Zealand and four
against the West Indies. This was the first time for
75 years that England had managed this feat and
only the third time ever.
The United Kingdom also hosts a number of
successful annual world sporting events - for
example the British Open (golf), Wimbledon
(tennis) and the Embassy World Championship
(snooker).
In April 2004, Manchester hosted the UCI World
Cup Classic in track cycling. The event took place

Olympic successes for Team GB
Team GB won 30 medals (9 gold, 9 silver and 12
bronze) at the Olympic Games in Athens in
August 2004 (Table 18.2), placing the team tenth
in the medals table. Over 270 men and women
from 22 sports represented Great Britain during
the two weeks of the Games.
Sailing was the most successful sport for Team
GB, with five medals: two gold, one silver and
two bronze. Kelly Holmes won two gold medals.
Her victories in the 800 and 1500 metres were
the first time that a British athlete had achieved
this middle-distance double since 1920. The gold
medal won by Matthew Pinsent in the coxless
four was his fourth gold medal in Olympic
rowing, while Bradley Wiggins' three medals in
cycling - one gold, one silver and one bronze -
were the most won by a Briton at a single
Olympics since 1964.
at the Manchester Velodrome, which will also be
hosting the event in 2005 and 2006. In July and
August 2004, Ayrshire in Scotland hosted the
World Bowling Championship and also in July,
Lilleshall in Shropshire staged the Junior
Outdoor Target Archery World Championships.
England has been chosen to host the UEFA
European Women’s Championships in football.
This means that England qualifies automatically
for the eight-nation final that will be held in
summer 2005.
Results of some of the regular sporting events held
in the United Kingdom are given in Table 18.1.
Participation
Watching and participating in sport are two of the
most popular forms of leisure activity. In 2002
Game Plan, a report published jointly by the
Cabinet Office Strategy Unit and the Department
for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), included a
target for increasing the proportion of the
population in England that were reasonably active1
1 30 minutes physical activity on at least five days a week.
by 2020. It also set out a strategy to increase the
percentage of schoolchildren (aged 5-16) who
spend a minimum of two hours each week on
physical education (PE) and school sport within
and beyond the curriculum from 25 per cent in
2002 to 75 per cent by 2006.
Sporting Britain, a report outlining the progress
made towards achieving these targets was published
by the DCMS in April 2004. It reported that:
■ 31 per cent of adults achieve the target of 30
minutes physical activity on at least five days
a week. The Government’s goal is to increase
this by at least 1 per cent a year;
■ 62 per cent of pupils spend at least two hours
a week on PE and school sport within and
beyond the curriculum;
■ 44 per cent of pupils are doing their two
hours within the curriculum.
The 2002 General Household Survey indicated
that 59 per cent of adults in Great Britain had
taken part in a sport, game or physical activity
(including walking 2 miles or more) in the four
weeks before interview. In every age group, males
were more likely than females to engage in a sport
European Year of Education through
Sport
With the Euro 2004 football championship taking
place in Portugal and the Olympic Games in
Greece, the European Union (EU) chose 2004 as
European Year of Education through Sport (EYES).
The main aim of EYES is to raise awareness of the
importance of sport in developing personal and
social skills, and to reinforce the links between
sport and education. Its slogan was 'Move your
body, stretch your mind'.
The Clean Start programme, coordinated by UK
Sport, is one of the projects that are being
promoted by EYES 2004. Its objective is to teach
13- to 17-year-olds about drug-free sport. Cross¬
curricular activities aim to help pupils to improve
their self-confidence, respect for health and well¬
being, commitment to personal achievement and
problem-solving, and analytical and
communication skills.

Walking 2 miles or more was the form of sport or

of £62 million in the development of grass-roots
football, community and education initiatives, and
essential stadium safety work. The Football

more boys and girls of school age to take part in
football and raise the standards of play in Wales.
In England, 308 clubs are affiliated to the Football
Association (FA) and about 40,000 clubs to
regional or district associations. In Scotland, there
are 79 full and associate clubs and nearly 6,000
registered clubs under the jurisdiction of the
Scottish Football Association. In Wales there are
155 clubs affiliated to the Football Association of
Wales (FAW) and 1,653 clubs affiliated to areas.
The Irish Football Association (covering Northern
Ireland) has 838 affiliated clubs.
Figures for the English Barclays Premier League
for 2003-04 show that the average attendance at
each game was 35,000. In comparison, in the
German Bundesliga 1 it was 37,000; in Primera
Division 1 in Spain it was 28,600; and in Serie A
in Italy it was 25,600, while in the Scottish Premier
League it was about 15,200.
The Football League is the governing body for the
72 clubs in Divisions 1, 2 and 3 (renamed the
Coca-Cola Football League Championship, Coca-
Cola Football League 1 and Coca-Cola Football
League 2 in 2004). These clubs attracted a total of
15.4 million supporters to league matches during
the 2003-04 season - the biggest aggregate
attendance generated for 40 years. In 2003-04,
the Coca-Cola Championship had an average
attendance of 15,303, which is 50 per cent higher
than the equivalent divisions in Germany and Italy
and more than double those in France and Spain.
Horse racing
Over 6 million people attended race meetings in
Great Britain in 2003, the highest figure recorded.
There were 1,220 race meetings and 13,000 horses
in training. The cumulative television audience was
over 500 million. Horse racing is second to football
as the most televised sport on terrestrial channels.
In 2003, about £9 billion was bet off-course on
horse racing, most of it in licensed betting offices.
The sport had record levels of overall income and
prize money in 2003. In June 2004, the sport’s
governing authority, the British Horseracing Board,
reached agreement with the Office of Fair Trading
on proposals for the modernisation of the sport
over the next few years.
Women’s football is one of the fastest growing
sports. The number of girls’ teams in England
increased from 80 in 1993 to 6,209 in 2003/04, and
the number of women’s teams from 400 to 1,013
over the same period.
Tennis
The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) estimated that
about 2.9 million people aged four and upwards
played tennis in Great Britain in 2003. All the
271
18 Sport
UK 2005
profits generated by the Wimbledon
Championships - £25.8 million in 2003 — are
invested by the LTA in British tennis for the
development of the game. The LTA's strategy
focuses on three priorities: making the game
appealing to juniors and keeping them in the sport;
developing a network of accessible clubs that are
welcoming to young people; and identifying and
developing the most talented players.
Sports policy
A ‘Sports Cabinet’ identifies priorities for sport in
the United Kingdom. Its membership comprises
the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
(who chairs the ‘Cabinet’) and the ministers with
responsibility for sport in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. The heads of the
five Sports Councils are also invited as obsen ers.
The Government’s Plan for Sport, an action plan for
delivery of the strategy for England set out in
A Sporting Future for All, was published in 2001. An
update, published in April 2003, gave objectives for
sport and education and sport in the community,
to be achieved by 2006.
In 2002, the Government’s sport and physical
activity objectives in England, entitled Game Plan,
was published by the DCMS and the Cabinet
Office Strategy Unit. The first Game Plan Delivery
report was published in April 2004.
Achievements include:
■ an Activity Coordination Team ACT), jointly
chaired by the Minister for Sport and the
Minister for Public Health, which has brought
together seven other government
departments, local government, health
organisations and sport funding bodies to
coordinate the drive to improve health by
increasing participation in sport and physical
activity. This work will contribute to the
public health White Paper due to be
published in autumn 2004;
■ of total funding of £581 million to improve
the community' use of facilities in schools and
other educational estabfishments in England
over 2002-06, £270 million had been
committed to 1,494 projects by the end of
June 2004;
■ a total of £119 million had been committed
under the Space for Sport and Arts
Programme to improve primary school
facilities in 65 deprived areas across England.
At 30 June 2004, 168 projects had been
completed and a further 78 were on site;
■ from July 2004 the public has had access to
a database of sports facilities called Active
Places, covering venues such as sports halls,
swimming pools, synthetic turf pitches, golf
courses, ice rinks and athletics tracks.
Sport 21 2003-2007 Shaping Scotland’s Future, the
updated strategy for sport in Scotland, was
published in March 2003. It is founded on three
visions of a Scotland where:
■ sport is more widely available to all;
■ sporting talent is recognised and nurtured;
and
■ world-class performance is achieved and
sustained.
It contains 11 targets for 2007 and a key challenge
for 2020. Six implementation groups have been set
up to prepare target strategies. The National
Implementation Forum, chaired by the Minister
for Tourism, Culture and Sport, meets biannually
to monitor strategies, assess their implementation
at local level, and evaluate their impact.
In July 2003 the Welsh Assembly Government
launched a consultation strategy, entitled Sport
and Active Recreation in Wales: Climbing Higher,
Dringo’n Uwch, covering the period to 2023. The
priorities of the strategy include:
■ to encourage people in Wales to be more
physically active;
■ to maximise the links between sport, active
recreation and the natural environment;
■ to encourage the development of agility,
balance, coordination and skill across a range
of activities; and
■ to achieve sporting success.
Organisation and administration
Sports Councils
Government responsibilities and funding for sport
and recreation are largely channelled through five
Sports Councils:
■ the United Kingdom Sports Council,
operating as UK Sport;
■ the English Sports Council, operating as Sport
England;
272
UK 2005
18 Sport
■ the Sports Council for Wales;
■ the Scottish Sports Council, operating as
sportscotland; and
■ the Sports Council for Northern Ireland.
UK Sport takes the lead on those aspects of sport
that require strategic planning, administration,
coordination or representation for the United
Kingdom as a whole. Its main functions include:
■ coordinating support to sports in which the
United Kingdom competes internationally
(as opposed to the four home countries
separately);
■ tackling drug misuse in sport;
■ coordinating policy for bringing major
international sports events to the United
Kingdom; and
■ representing UK sporting interests overseas
at international level.
All the Sports Councils distribute government and
Lottery funds. UK Sport focuses on elite sportsmen
and sportswomen, while the individual Sports
Councils are more concerned with the development
of sport at the community level by promoting
participation, giving support and guidance to
providers of sports facilities, and supporting the
development of talented sportsmen and women,
including disabled people. They also manage the
National Sports Centres.
Sports governing bodies
Individual sports are run by independent
governing bodies. Some have a UK or Great
Britain structure, others are constituted on a
regional basis. In Northern Ireland almost half of
the sports are part of an all-Ireland structure that
covers both Northern Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland. The functions of governing bodies include
drawing up rules, holding events, regulating
membership, selecting and training national
teams, and producing plans for their sports. There
are also organisations representing people who
take part in more informal physical recreation,
such as walking. Most sports clubs in the United
Kingdom belong to, or are affiliated to, an
appropriate governing body.
Governing bodies that receive funding from the
Sports Councils are required to produce Whole
Sports Plans (WSPs), from the grass roots to the
highest competitive levels. WSPs provide a
blueprint for each sport that indicates how agreed
sporting outcomes can be achieved. At UK level
there are ten Olympic sports with which the five
Sports Councils have agreed to adopt a ‘One Stop
Plan’ approach to help them to deliver sporting
success in elite competitions. A number of
international federations have their headquarters
in the United Kingdom: the Commonwealth
Games Federation and federations for badminton,
billiards and snooker, bowls, cricket, curling, golf,
netball, sailing, squash, tennis and wheelchair
sports.
Other sports organisations
Central Council of Physical Recreation
The Central Council of Physical Recreation
(CCPR) is the representative body for 270 national
sporting organisations, covering an estimated
150,000 voluntary sports clubs and 8 million
members. It aims to lead the development of a
sustainable and effective non-governmental and
voluntan- sector for sport and recreation by:
■ representing the interest of voluntary sport
and recreation;
■ working in partnership with the Government
and its agencies; and
■ providing high-quality sendees for its
members.
The Scottish Sports Association, the Welsh Sports
Association and the Northern Ireland Sports
Forum are equivalent associations to the CCPR.
Their primary aim is to represent the interests of
their members to the appropriate national and
local authorities, including the Sports Councils,
from which they may receive some funding.
British Olympic Association
The British Olympic .Association (BOA) comprises
representatives of the 35 national governing bodies
of Olympic sports. It organises the participation of
British teams in the Olympic Games, sets
standards for selection and raises funds. It is
supported by sponsorship and by donations from
the private sector and the general public, and
works closely with UK Sport.
The BOA contributes to the preparation of
competitors in the period leading up to the
Games, by arranging training camps and
programmes to support national governing bodies
and their athletes in areas such as acchmatisation,

London's Olympic bid
In May 2003 the Government announced its
support for London's bid to host the 2012
Olympic and Paralympic Games. The proposal will
include the building of sports facilities near
Stratford in east London. Transport links will be
improved by the completion of the second section
of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, scheduled for
2007, and the extension of the Docklands Light
Railway to the nearby City Airport (scheduled for
completion by the end of 2005). London will also
make use of venues such as Wimbledon, Lords,
ExCeL and Wembley Stadium (see page 276).
In May 2004, the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) announced a shortlist of five
cities - London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and
Paris - to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic
Games. The London Bid Company will submit
London's bid to the IOC by November 2004. The
IOC will announce the result in July 2005.
psychology and physiology. Its Olympic Medical
Institute at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow
provides medical services for competitors before
and during the Olympics. Its educational arm
aims to educate youngsters about the Olympic
Games and the Olympic movement. The BOA
will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2005.
Women in sport
UK Sport organises a UK Coordinating Group on
Women in Sport that aims to raise participation
by women in sport at all levels, and increase the
number of women involved in coaching,
managing and administering sport. The
Foundation promotes opportunities for women
and girls in sport and active recreation across the
United Kingdom. It is primarily funded by Sport
England and private sponsors, but remains
autonomous. Its activities include:
■ providing advice and information on up-to-
date research, policy and strategy
development, sources of funding, and
national and regional initiatives;
■ influencing national and regional
government, and sports council strategy and
policy to make sure that all policies, strategies
and programmes are equitable; and
■ collecting, developing and sharing examples
of best practice.
Sport for disabled people
Sport for disabled people is organised by a wide
range of agencies in the United Kingdom. Some
organisations promote the needs of people with
a particular type of disability across a range of
sports. These include the British Amputee and
Les Autres Sports Association, British Blind Sport,
British Wheelchair Sports Foundation, Cerebral
Palsy Sport and the United Kingdom Sports
Association for People with Learning Disability.
The British Deaf Sports Council organises
sporting opportunities for people with hearing
impairment and coordinates British interests at
the World Deaf Games.
In addition, the English Federation of Disability
Sport, Disability Sport Cymru, Scottish Disability
Sport and Disability Sport Northern Ireland are
responsible for the general coordination and
development of sport for disabled people.
A number of sports already have a degree of
integration: archery, athletics, cricket, cycling,
equestrianism, football, judo, powerlifting and
weightlifting, rugby union, sailing, swimming
and wheelchair tennis and table tennis. The
Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002
was the first major sports event in the world to
include an integrated programme for disabled
people.
The British Paralympic Association (BPA) was
established in 1989. It comprises 26 national
governing bodies and disability sport
organisations. It ratifies selection, and funds and
manages the Great Britain Paralympic Team in the
winter and summer Paralympic Games. The BPA’s
games programme is funded through sponsorship,
fundraising, Lottery funding, and donations from
the public and private sectors.
The separate World Class Performance
Programme of the BPA helps support the
preparation of Britain’s elite disabled athletes. It
provides sport science and medicine advice and
develops leading research into performance
preparation. In May 2002 UK Sport announced a
£1.7 million investment programme to support
the British team for the 2004 Paralympic Games in
Athens in September, including multi-sport
preparation camps, to be held twice a year, to help
the athletes experience similar conditions and
climate to those expected in Athens.

Funding
National Lottery
Of every pound spent on the National Lottery,
4.7 pence goes to sport. Between 1994, when the
National Lottery started, and July 2004 the Sports
Councils awarded 26,383 grants worth around
£2.5 billion. Money has gone to improve sporting
opportunities, provide new sporting facilities in
schools and elsewhere, support current and
potentially future elite performers, and to stage
major events. In projects to improve sporting
opportunity, over £1.4 billion of Lottery funds
have been invested in over 3,900 community
facilities in England since 1995; in Scotland, over
6,660 awards totalling more than £208 million
have been made by sportscotland to April 2004.
The Sports Council for Northern Ireland has made
about 1,800 awards, worth over £70 million.
Sponsorship
Many sports benefit from sponsorship, which may
take the form of financing specific events or
championships, such as cricket leagues or horse
races, or support for sports organisations or
individual performers. Football and motor sport
receive the largest amounts of private sponsorship.
Sponsorship is encouraged by a number of bodies,
including the Institute of Sports Sponsorship,
which comprises some 100 UK companies
involved in sponsoring sport. Sponsors in the
United Kingdom now invest more than £1 billion
annually in sport.
SportsAid
SportsAid raises funds to help encourage and
support young people and disabled people with
sporting talent. It receives a grant from Sport
England to cover administration costs, and has
regional branches throughout England as well as
sister organisations in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. Financial grants are provided on
an individual basis, with each application being
assessed on the criteria of talent and need. Those
receiving funds must usually be aged between 12
and 18; there is no age limit for disabled people.
Between 1975 and 2004, the charity distributed
over £20 million in grants.
From October 2004, SportsAid will be raising
additional funds to support the DCMS Talented
Athlete Scholarship Scheme (TASS). TASS will
provide scholarships and bursaries for young
people between the ages of 16 and 25 and develop
sporting links with higher and further education
institutions.
The Scottish Sports Aid Foundation, SportsAid
Cymru/Wales and the Ulster Sports and
Recreation Trust have similar functions.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts, set up by
the football pools promoters in 1991, has made
awards totalling nearly £350 million to schemes
benefiting over 100 sports, mainly for small-scale
projects. The Foundation is keen to promote the
interest and engagement of all, particularly the
young, in inclusive sporting and artistic pursuits.
Sports facilities
The United Kingdom has a range of sporting
facilities including 13 National Sports Centres,
operated by the individual Sports Councils. A
number of major facilities have been improved in
recent years, including the Millennium Stadium in
Cardiff, the Wimbledon tennis complex and several
football grounds. New facilities were built in
Manchester for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.
United Kingdom Sports Institute
The Sports Institutes of England, Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland work together to form the
United Kingdom Sports Institute (UKSI) network,
which aims to deliver world-class services and
facilities to athletes throughout the United
Kingdom. UK Sport plays a strategic lead role and
works closely with governing body performance
directors to discover and introduce the latest
performance-enhancing technology and
equipment through research and innovation. In
February 2004, it launched a Performance Lifestyle
programme, which is designed to help athletes
balance sport and personal commitments more
effectively.
The English Institute of Sport (FIS) provides
a network of training facilities in nine regional
multi-sport centres together with 35 satellite sites.
The network has been fully operational since the
end of 2003 and is currently helping athletes
drawn from 30 sports.

Wembley Stadium
The construction and operation of the new
national stadium at Wembley in London is the
responsibility of Wembley National Stadium Ltd, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the FA. The new
90,000-seat stadium will host events for football,
rugby league and athletics, as well as concerts. It
is scheduled for completion in 2006. The project
is estimated to cost about £757 million, of which
£161 million will come from public funding.
The design includes a 7,000-tonne retractable
roof that will be supported by a steel arch
weighing 1,750 tonnes, thus avoiding the need
for columns inside the stadium and improving
views for spectators. The arch is 135 metres high
and 315 metres long - said to be the longest
single roof structure in the world.
The UKSI network supported by sportscotland
comprises the Scottish Institute of Sport, which
opened its new base at Stirling in 2002, and six
area institutes. The centre of the UKSI network in
Wales is the Welsh Institute of Sport in Cardiff,
which is the premier venue in Wales for top-level
training and for competition in many sports.
The Sports Council for Northern Ireland is
working in partnership with the University of
Ulster to develop a Northern Ireland network
centre of the UKSI.
Services for high-performance athletes have been
provided through the Sports Institute for
Northern Ireland since July 2001. These include
strength and conditioning advice, physiotherapy
and injury management, sports medicine, sports
science, athlete career, and education and high-
performance planning. A capital investment
programme was being finalised in summer 2004
that will include facilities for athletes from a wide
range of sports.
Local facilities
Local authorities are the main providers of basic
sport and recreation facilities for the local
community, including indoor sports centres,
parks, lakes, playing fields, playgrounds, tennis
courts, natural and artificial pitches, golf courses
and swimming/leisure pools. Commercial facilities
include health and fitness centres, tenpin bowling
centres, ice-skating and roller-skating rinks, squash
courts, golf courses and driving ranges, riding
stables and marinas.
Many amateur clubs cater for indoor
recreation, but more common are those
providing outdoor sports facilities, particularly
for bowls, cricket, football, golf, hockey, rugby,
and tennis. The Government has enabled clubs
to apply for charitable status. For those clubs
that cannot, or do not wish to, become charities,
the 2002 Budget included a package of tax
measures giving clubs access to tax reliefs similar
to those available to charities if they register as
Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs) with
the Inland Revenue. The 2004 Budget expanded
the benefits available to CASCs to include the
80 per cent relief on business rates that charities
already receive.
The Government is allocating £60 million to
provide new or refurbished community sports
facilities in England through the Community
Club Development Programme over the period
2003/04 to 2005/06; £20 million of this comes
from the Capital Modernisation Fund, which is
aimed at improving the delivery of public services.
New rules governing the sale of playing fields
mean that £540 million has been invested in new
sports facilities since 2001. The Big Lottery Fund
(formed following a merger between the New
Opportunities Fund and the Community Fund in
early 2004) and Sport England are investing
almost £800 million in facilities for school and
community sport.
Support services
Coaching
The organisation SportsCoach UK provides a
comprehensive range of services for coaches in all
sports. Supported by the Sports Councils, it works
closely with sports governing bodies, local
authorities, and higher and further education
institutions. In 2003 some 36,000 coaches and
schoolteachers participated in its programmes.
In July 2002 the Coaching Task Force
recommended increasing the pool of talented
coaches in England and introducing a national
coaching certificate. The DCMS is taking forward
these recommendations by investing £28 million
over 2003/06 to establish a five-level UK Coaching
276
UK 2005
18 Sport
Certificate and introducing 45 coach development
officers and 3,000 community sports coaches
across England.
Volunteering
Nearly 6 million people volunteer in sport in the
United Kingdom and many clubs would not be able
to function without them. Sport England’s
Volunteer Investment Programme helps to improve
the management of the volunteer workforce in
sport through encouraging best practice. The
DCMS leadership and volunteering in school and
community sport programme, known as Step into
Sport, is investing £15 million between 2002/03 and
2005/06 in volunteering and leadership
programmes for young people. By the end summer
2004, the DCMS expected 69,000 young people
aged 14-25 would have taken Sports Leadership
awards, 21,000 would have run sports festivals for
primary school children and over 5,500 would have
started mentored community volunteering.
In Scotland, one of the key targets of Sport 21
2003-2007 is that Scotland should have 150,000
volunteers who are contributing to the development
and delivery of Scottish sport. An implementation
group that includes Volunteer Development
Scotland, the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations, sportscotland, the Scottish
Executive, the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities, SkillsActive Scotland and the Scottish
Sports Association has been established. It has
prepared a draft strategy that consists of seven ‘steps
to success’ to recruit these volunteers, which has
been endorsed by Scottish ministers. A number of
sub groups have been established to deliver specific
actions in the strategy in, for example, education
and training, research, and communication.
The recruitment and development of volunteers
is also one of the main priorities of Dragon Sport,
a Sports Council for Wales initiative aimed at
increasing extra-curricular and sports club
membership among 7- to 11-year-olds. Since the
scheme began, 423 schools have signed up and
132 extra-curricular clubs have been established.
Sports medicine
The UKSI provides medical services - principally
sports medicine and sports physiotherapy - along
with sports science, strength and conditioning and
Performance Lifestyle advice for athletes on the
World Class Programmes.
Boat Race anniversary
The famous 6.8-kilometre Boat Race on the River
Thames between crews from Oxford and
Cambridge Universities was run for the 150th
time in March 2004. The first race was held in
1829 in Henley. It then moved to London, initially
from Westminster to Putney, but due to
overcrowding in the centre of the capital the
universities found a new location between Putney
and Mortlake. Since 1856 it has been held every
year, except during the two World Wars.
The race has an estimated worldwide television
audience of 500 million. In 2004 the score stood
at 78 to Cambridge, 71 to Oxford, and one dead
heat in 1877. Cambridge won the 2004 race
and also holds the fastest time of 16 minutes and
19 seconds, achieved in 1998.
The Department of Elealth (DH), in partnership
with the DCMS, is proposing to develop and
recognise a new speciality - sport and exercise
medicine (SEM). SEM will consist of multi¬
disciplinary teams of specialists who:
■ promote a holistic approach to addressing
medical conditions and injuries in those who
wish to exercise;
■ prevent further injuries by providing advice
on the safe use of physical exercise in the
treatment and prevention of illness; and
■ promote general wellness through the
increased use of exercise and physical activity.
The DH plans to issue a consultation document
with proposals for establishing and recognising
this new speciality in autumn 2004.
Sports science
In addition to the medical services, the UKSI also
provides support in sports science through the
traditional three disciplines of physiology,
psychology and biomechanics, as well as through
support and advice in nutrition, technology,
performance analysis, and sociology.
Drug misuse
Sporting governing bodies and national
governments are working to eradicate drugs and
277
18 Sport
UK 2005
doping methods in sport under the auspices of the
World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The UK
Government is committed to the fight against drugs
in sport, and signed the Copenhagen Declaration
on Anti-Doping in Sport in March 2003, in which
it committed to adopting the World Anti-Doping
Code into sport’s rules and regulations.
The World Anti-Doping Code will harmonise
anti-doping activities and processes across
different countries and different sports, creating
one definitive set of anti-doping rules and
regulations covering testing procedures, banned
substances and disciplinary sanctions.
As part of its overall sporting excellence remit,
UK Sport acts as the UK national anti-doping
organisation, and is committed to promoting
ethically fair and drug-free sport that is delivered
through a drug testing programme.
Between 1999 and 2004, UK Sport has undertaken
29,114 tests across 50 sports. These showed that
98.5 per cent of athletes in the United Kingdom
tested clean of prohibited substances.
In February 2004, UK Sport launched a new
on-line database for reporting positive test results.
The database includes all findings that have been
through the entire disciplinary process from April
2003, and over time this will develop into a full
historical record of the testing programme. There
is also a drug information database which provides
guidance to athletes on any prohibited substances
that UK licensed medications may contain.

The United Kingdom has around 75,000 separate
species of plants and animals (excluding micro¬
organisms). The indigenous vegetation of much
of the country is deciduous forest dominated by
oak, lime, ash and beech, with pine locally
important in highland and some lowland areas.
However, almost all the vegetation in the UK
landscape has been affected in some way by
human activity stretching over thousands of
years (Table 19.1).
All native large carnivores, such as wolves and
bears, are now locally extinct, but small carnivores
such as foxes and stoats are common in most rural
areas, while many small mammals and birds are
widespread. The United Kingdom has six native
amphibian and six native reptile species, plus nine
introduced species. Both fresh and salt water
ecosystems contain a wide variety of fish. Data on
many species are being collected on a national
database - the National Biodiversity Network
(www.searchnbn.net).
The Government launched its sustainable
development strategy, A Better Quality of Life, in
1999 (see page 114). Changing Patterns, published
in September 2003, sets out the Government’s
framework for breaking the link between
economic growth and environmental degradation
and thus achieving sustainable consumption and
production. Changing Patterns was accompanied
by a consultation paper with proposals for 12
‘decoupling’ indicators.

Protecting countryside and wildlife
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Defra) is responsible for policy on the
environment, wildlife and the countryside in
England. It sponsors the Environment Agency

page 419). It also sponsors the Joint Nature
Conservation Committee (JNCC), a committee of
English Nature, the Countryside Council for Wales
and Scottish Natural Heritage, and administers the
England Rural Development Programme (see page
411).
The Countryside Agency is the statutory body in
England that aims to improve the quality of life
for people in the countryside and improve the
quality of the countryside itself. The Agency has
an annual budget of about £90 million and is
structured around six priority areas - villages,
services, enterprise, wider welcome (recreation
opportunities in the countryside), living
landscapes, and countryside for towns. English
Nature promotes the conservation of wildlife and
natural features, and provides advice to the
Government on nature conservation. Its total
budget in 2003/04 was £82 million.
In Rural Strategy 2004, issued in July, the
Government announced that a new integrated
agency for resource management, nature
conservation, biodiversity, landscape, access and
recreation would be established in England. It will
bring together elements of the work done by the
Countryside Agency, Defra’s Rural Development
Service and English Nature. As its establishment
will require primary legislation, the component
parts will operate in a confederation from April
2005, with each organisation responsible for
fulfilling its own statutory duties within that
partnership.
The devolved administrations in Wales and
Scotland sponsor similar bodies to those in
England. The Countryside Council for Wales
(CCW) has responsibilities for landscape and
nature conservation, and for countryside
recreation. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has
both the countryside and landscape powers of the
Countryside Agency and the nature conservation
duties and powers of English Nature. Like English
Nature, CCW and SNH are responsible for
providing advice and information to the
Government and the public on nature
conservation, for notifying land as being of special
interest due to its wildlife and geological features,
and for establishing National Nature Reserves. In
Northern Ireland, responsibility rests with the
Environment and Heritage Service (EHS), an
agency within the Department of the Environment
(DoE). The EHS protects and manages the natural
and built environment.
The JNCC is the statutory committee through
which English Nature, CCW and SNH exercise
their joint nature conservation functions. These
include: providing advice on the development
and implementation of policies that affect
nature conservation, both in Great Britain and
internationally; establishing common standards
for the monitoring of, and research into, nature
conservation; and analysis of the information
produced. At the international level, the JNCC
provides technical advice to the Government
and others to aid implementation of global
and European conservation obligations.
Voluntary organisations
Voluntary organisations are well represented in
conservation work. Although they are funded
largely by subscription, private donations and
entrance fees, many receive government support.
The National Trust, a charity established in 1895,
had over 3 million members in 2003/04. It owns
and protects places of historic interest and natural
beauty for the benefit of the nation. The Trust
cares for 248,000 hectares of land in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland and 965 kilometres of
coastline. The separate National Trust for Scotland,
also a charity, has over 250,000 members.
National Parks
National Park status recognises the national
importance of the area concerned in terms of
landscape, biodiversity and as a recreational
resource. The name National Park does not signify
national ownership - most of the land in such
parks is owned by farmers and other private
landowners. Each park is administered by an
independent National Park Authority.
The first National Parks - the Lake District and
the Peak District in England, and Snowdonia in
Wales - were designated in 1951. In 2004 there
were 12 such parks in England, Wales and
Scotland (see map in colour section); the Broads
area of East Anglia has equivalent status. The
largest is the Cairngorms, at 380,000 hectares,
which was opened in 2003.
In June 2004, the Government announced that the
New Forest will be designated a National Park; the
South Downs is being considered for designation.
A consultation leaflet was published in June 2004
to consider whether the Mountains of Mourne
280
UK 2005
19 The environment
area should become Northern Ireland’s first
National Park.
National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty (AONBs) in England and Wales are
designated by the Countryside Agency and the
CCW, subject to confirmation by the Secretary of
State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs or
the National Assembly for Wales. SNH advises the
Scottish Executive on the designation of National
Parks in Scotland.
Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty
The purpose of AONBs in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland is the conservation and
enhancement of the natural beauty of the
landscape, although many also fulfil a wider
recreational purpose. Designation started in
1956 with the Gower peninsula in south Wales;
the most recent addition was the Tamar Valley in
Cornwall in 1995. There are 50 AONBs covering
2.4 million hectares. Two new areas - Erne
Lakeland and Fermanagh Caveland - have been
proposed in Northern Ireland.
National Scenic Areas
In Scotland the 40 National Scenic Areas (NSAs)
are broadly equivalent to AONBs and cover 1
million hectares. They give special attention to the
best scenery in Scotland when new development is
being considered. Certain developments in these
areas are subject to consultation with SNH, which
can refer matters to the Scottish Executive in the
event of a disagreement.
Forest, regional and country parks
There are 18 forest parks in Great Britain, covering
nearly 300,000 hectares, which are administered by
the Forestry Commission. There are over 270
country parks in England recognised by the
Countryside Agency, 35 in Wales recognised by
CCW, and 36 in Scotland. Scotland also has four
regional parks. Country and regional parks in
Great Britain are administered by local authorities.
Northern Ireland has 11 country parks,
administered by the EHS or by local authorities. It
also has eight forest parks, three forest drives and
over 40 minor forest recreation sites, all of which
are administered by the Forest Service, an agency
of the Department of Agriculture and Rural
Development (DARD - see page 420).
Tree preservation
Tree Preservation Orders enable local authorities
to protect trees and woodlands. Once a tree is
protected, it is generally an offence to cut it down
or carry out most types of work to it without
permission. Courts can impose substantial fines
for breaches of such Orders. Replacement trees
must be planted where protected trees are felled in
contravention of an Order or are removed because
they are dying, dead or dangerous.
Over 100,000 hectares of woodland are included in
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs - see page
283). Organisations involved in protecting existing
woods and planting new areas of woodland include
English Nature, SNH and voluntary bodies such as
the Woodland Trust, which owns over 1,100 woods
across the United Kingdom covering 18,300
hectares.
Public rights of way and open country
England has about 190,000 kilometres of rights of
way,1 including 146,600 kilometres of footpaths
and 32,400 kilometres of bridleways. There are
15 long-distance walking routes in England and
Wales, designated as National Trails, and five Long
Distance Routes in Scotland (see map in the
colour section).
In England and Wales, local highway authorities
are responsible for asserting and protecting the
rights of the public to use and enjoy public rights
of way, and to ensure any obstructions occurring
on them are removed. In Scotland, this is done by
planning authorities.
Registered common land2 in England and Wales
totals nearly 550,000 hectares.' The open character
of commons has made them popular for informal
recreation, although significant areas (particularly
in the uplands) remain important for agriculture.
Around 80 per cent of common land is privately
owned. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000 (see page 282) gives the public a right of
access on foot to nearly all registered common land
in England and Wales.
1 Where the general public has legal title to go across someone
else's property.
2 The term 'common land' derives from the fact that certain people
held rights of common over the land. The different types of rights
of common signified different entitlements to the products of the
soil of the common - for example to the pasture, or to sand,
gravel or peat.
3 This total does not include some common land excluded from
registration such as the New Forest and Epping Forest.
281
19 The environment
UK 2005
Commons are largely unimproved and therefore
have high amenity and wildlife value; many are
protected by law and by nature conservation
designations. For example, around half of the
common land in England is found within National
Parks and about half is designated as SSSIs (see
page 283). Ministerial consent is usually required
to undertake work on commons or to enclose
areas by fencing.
The Common Land Policy Statement published by
Defra and the National Assembly for Wales in
2002 contained proposals for legislation relating to
the registration and protection of common land
and village greens. Defra plans to consult on a
draft Bill as soon as parliamentary time allows.
In England and Wales, the Countryside and Rights of
Way Act 2000 created a public right of access to
mountain, moor, heath, down and also to registered
common land. The Countryside Agency and the
CCW are preparing maps of the areas affected. The
phased introduction of the new right of access
started on a regional basis in September 2004.
When they come fully into force at the end of 2005,
it is estimated that some 1.2 to 1.8 million hectares
of land will have been opened up. An updated
Countryside Code was launched in July 2004 to
reflect the new rights of access. The Land Reform
(Scotland) Act 2003 established a right of
responsible access to land and inland water for
recreation and passage. Part one of the Act places
duties on local authorities to uphold the exercise of
access rights, to plan for a system of core paths, and
to establish local access forums for their areas. The
SNH has produced a Scottish Outdoor Access
Code setting out guidance on the rights and
responsibilities of landowners and those taking
access. The Scottish Parliament approved the Code
in July 2004.
The coast
Great Britain has approximately 17,820 kilometres
of coastline, including 163 estuaries, and is very
indented: nowhere is more than 125 kilometres
from tidal waters. Northern Ireland’s coastline is
approximately 539 kilometres. About 75 per cent
of Europe’s chalk coasts are in the United
Kingdom.
Local planning authorities are responsible for
planning land use at the coast; they also aim to
safeguard and enhance the coast’s natural
attractions, and have responsibilities for
conservation of areas of scientific interest. The
policy for managing coastal erosion and flooding
is determined by Defra and the devolved
administrations. Operational responsibility lies
with local authorities and, in England and Wales,
the Environment Agency.
Certain stretches of undeveloped coast of
particular beauty in England and Wales are
defined as Heritage Coast. There are 46 Heritage
Coasts, protecting 32 per cent (1,027 kilometres)
of the English coastline and 33 per cent (499
kilometres) of the coastline of Wales (see map in
the colour section).
The National Trust (see page 280), through its
Neptune Coastline Campaign, raises funds to
acquire and protect stretches of coastline of great
natural beauty and recreational value in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. The Coastal and
Maritime Partnership also brings together a wide
range of interests in Wales. The National Trust for
Scotland cares for more than 400 kilometres of the
Scottish coastline and protects other stretches
through conservation agreements.
Flood and coastal defence
Nearly 2 million properties in floodplains along
rivers, estuaries and coasts in the United Kingdom
are potentially at risk of flooding. A further 80,000
properties are at risk in towns and cities from
flooding caused by heavy downpours that
overwhelm urban drains. The United Kingdom
spent £800 million on flood management in
2003/04. The Environment Agency operates
a flood warning system to over 1.2 million
properties in England and Wales, which aims to
give people at least two hours’ notice of impending
flooding.
During 2002/03, Defra coordinated an appraisal of
the effect of all government policies on flood risk.
A new strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk
management will be launched in late 2004 or early
2005, to take a 10- to 20-year perspective.
Wildlife protection
All wild bird species in Great Britain, except for a
few pest and quarry species, are protected under
the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Certain
birds may be killed or taken at specific times of
year, or under a licence issued under the Act.
282
UK 2005
19 The environment
Other species of animals and plants are protected
under the Act when they are considered in danger
of extinction, or likely to become so endangered
unless conservation measures are taken, or when
protection is needed to comply with international
legislation. Similar provisions apply under the
Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. The
Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 amended
the 1981 Act in Scotland in respect of measures for
such species. The JNCC (see page 280) is required
to review Schedules 5 and 8 (protected animals
and plants, respectively) of the 1981 Act every five
years and to consult on the level of protection
given to these species.
Bird populations are good indicators of the state
of wildlife in the countryside, since they are widely
distributed and are near the top of the food chain.
There are concerns about the declines in certain
bird species, as modern land management
practices (particularly in agriculture) have altered
their habitats and reduced the food supply they
need for breeding or surviving the winter.
Defra is providing funding up to 2007 for agri¬
environment schemes to restore farmland habitats
(see page 411) and for the development of wild
bird indicators using information from annual
surveys run by the British Trust for Ornithology
(BTO) and other UK bird conservation agencies.
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (see page 284)
includes targets to reverse declines in bird
population. Twenty-six species are considered to
require action. The wild bird population index is
part of a set of biodiversity indicators while the
populations of UK woodland and farmland birds
(Figure 19.2) are a headline indicator of
sustainable development (see page 114).
Wildlife crime
Wildlife crime takes many forms, including theft
of eggs from birds of prey, illegal shooting,
trapping, poisoning, digging up of wild plants, and
the illicit trade in endangered species. Between
1998 and 2002, seizures under the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES, see opposite) in the United Kingdom
increased by 8 per cent.
Defra and the Scottish Executive together manage
a team of around 100 wildlife inspectors. Their
main roles are to verify information submitted in
support of applications to keep or trade in wildlife

Rural Affairs
species, and to check that people are complying
with the administrative controls contained in
wildlife legislation. There are also specialist
wildlife officers in almost every UK police force.
The Partnership for Action against Wildlife Crime,
chaired by the police and Defra, provides a forum
for communication and co-operation between the
statutory enforcement authorities and non¬
governmental organisations (NGOs) with an
active interest in wildlife law enforcement.
The National Wildlife Crime Intelligence Unit,
within the National Criminal Intelligence Service
(see page 205), provides law enforcement agencies
with the information they need to target and
disrupt wildlife crimes and the criminals involved.
It also acts as a focal point for the gathering and
analysing of intelligence on serious wildlife crime
at regional, national and international levels.
Much of UK law in relation to wildlife crime is
shaped by international regulations. CITES prohibits
trade in around 900 species and controls that of a
further 32,600. CITES is implemented in the United
Kingdom by the Control of Trade in Endangered
Species (Enforcement) Regulations 1997.
Habitat protection
Habitat protection is mainly achieved through the
networks of SSSIs in Great Britain, and Areas of
283
19 The environment
UK 2005
Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs) in Northern
Ireland. Sites are protected for their plants, animals
or geological or physiographical features. Some
SSSIs and ASSIs are of international importance
and have been designated for protection under the
EC Wild Birds and Habitats Directives or the
Ramsar Convention (see page 285). In March
2004, 63 per cent of assessed SSSIs in England
were in a favourable or recovering condition.
Conservation agencies in England and Wales have
powers to refuse consent for damaging activities
on SSSIs, to develop management schemes (in
consultation with owners and occupiers of SSSIs),
and to serve a management notice to require
works to be done where necessary. The maximum
penalty for deliberate damage to an SSSI is
£20,000 in a magistrates’ court, and unlimited
fines in the Crown Court. Under the Nature
Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004, the maximum
penalty in Scotland is £40,000. The Environment
(Northern Ireland) Order 2002 gives the EHS
similar powers in relation to ASSIs.
Charities play an important role in protecting
wildlife throughout the United Kingdom. The
Wildlife Trusts care for over 2,560 nature reserves
covering 82,000 hectares. Over 560,000 people
belong to the 47 independent trusts, which are
mainly based in England and Wales; Scotland is
covered by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. The Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), with
over 1 million members, manages 188 nature
reserves covering 127,911 hectares.
Biodiversity, species recovery and
reintroduction
The United Kingdom is one of 187 Parties to the
UN Convention on Biological Diversity Treaty,
agreed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 (see page
293). The Parties have agreed to develop national
strategies and programmes for the conservation
and sustainable use of biological diversity and to
ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits
from the use of genetic resources. The seventh
meeting of the Conference of the Parties took
place in Kuala Lumpur in February 2004. Issues
discussed included the role of protected areas in
the preservation of biological diversity, the transfer
of technology and the measures to achieve - by
2010 - a significant reduction in the rate of loss of
biodiversity.
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) is the
Government’s response to the Convention. It has
391 species action plans, 45 habitat action plans
and 162 local biodiversity action plans. A review
of UKBAP will be completed in 2005.
Defra published England’s biodiversity strategy,
Working with the Grain of Nature, in 2002. A
set of biodiversity indicators to monitor its
implementation, measure progress towards, and
contribute to international targets was published
in December 2003, together with the first annual
stocktake from the England Biodiversity Group.
The delivery of the Northern Ireland Biodiversity
Strategy, published in 2002, is coordinated by the
Northern Ireland Biodiversity Group. The strategy

developed by the Scottish Biodiversity Forum for
the Scottish Executive was launched in May 2004.
In Wales, the Assembly is advised by the Wales
Biodiversity Group.
The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (see page 399)
has been successful for many years in the
reintroduction of species. In August 2004, its
Millennium Seed Bank at Wakehurst Place, West
Sussex, held 13,000 species secured from around
the world. It also held seeds of all UK flora species.
The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE, see
page 399) promotes conservation programmes for
rare plants in Scotland and for coniferous trees
worldwide, maintaining genetically diverse
populations in cultivation at many sites as pools
for eventual reintroduction to the wild.
International action
In addition to the Convention on Biological
Diversity (see page 284), the United Kingdom is a
party to many international wildlife conventions
and EC Directives. The 1992 EC Habitats Directive
aims to promote biodiversity through the
conservation of natural habitats, wild flora and
non-avian fauna. Its key obligations are to select
and designate a network of sites - Special Areas of
Conservation (SACs) - and to provide stringent
protection for habitats and species linked to the
Directive. It is envisaged that these sites will make
a significant contribution to conserving the 169
habitat types and 623 species identified by the
Directive as being most in need of conservation in
a European context. In the United Kingdom, 76 of
the habitat types have been identified, as have 51
species. Along with the similar Special Protection
Areas (SPAs) set up under the earlier Birds
Directive, SACs form the UK component of the
Europe-wide Natura 2000 network.
Advice to the Government on which sites should
be SACs or SPAs has been provided by the
statutory conservation agencies (see page 280)
and coordinated by the JNCC. At 31 March 2004,
605 candidate SACs covering 2.5 million hectares
had been submitted and 242 SPAs covering
1.5 million hectares had been classified.
The Convention on Wetlands of International
Importance (the Ramsar Convention) is an
intergovernmental treaty covering all aspects of
wetland conservation and use. At April 2004, there
were 144 designated and 8 proposed Ramsar sites
in the United Kingdom. CITES seeks to ensure,
through a permit system, that trade in threatened
species is legal and not detrimental to the
conservation of the species concerned. The
Convention on the Conservation of Migratory
Species of Wild Animals (the Bonn Convention)
coordinates international action on a range of
endangered migratory species.
The United Kingdom is a member of the IUCN
(the World Conservation Union), the largest
nature conservation body in the world with a
membership of nearly 1,000 governmental and
non-governmental organisations. It helps societies
to conserve the integrity and diversity of nature
and to ensure that use of natural resources is
equitable and ecologically sustainable.
Land quality
Land quality in the United Kingdom is relatively
good, but faces pressure from a range of factors
including contamination, urbanisation, localised
erosion and declining organic content.
Contaminated land is the legacy of an industrial
age that generated wealth but also caused much
pollution. Government policy emphasises the
importance of voluntary action to clean up
contaminated land, and most attempts to clean up
sites occur when they are redeveloped. The
proportion of new homes built on previously
developed land is a headline indicator of
sustainable development (see page 114).
Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local
authorities are working to identify contaminated
land, and by June 2004, 73 sites in England and
Wales had been identified. Of these, 20 were
designated as special sites where the Environment
Agency is the lead regulator. The most common
pollutants at the sites were organic compounds
and metals. By March 2004, Scottish local
authorities had identified two sites as
contaminated; neither were special sites.
Many of the species identified in UKBAP depend
on the right type and quality of soil for their
survival, and a good balance of soil types is
required to support the existing range of
ecosystems, landscapes and agriculture. The
Government is committed to ensuring that soil
protection receives the same priority as air and
water. Defra published the First Soil Action Plan
for England in May 2004. This sets out a three-year
programme designed to ensure that soil will be
285
19 The environment
UK 2005
used and looked after in ways that get the best
from this resource. It was complemented by a
report on soils and a consultation on a strategy for
soil protection in England and Wales, published by
the Environment Agency in the same month.
Waste and recycling
Defra estimates that the United Kingdom produces
over 400 million tonnes of waste a year, the
majority of which comes from agricultural,
industrial and construction sources. Households
produce a considerable amount of waste - 88 per
cent of the estimated 29.3 million tonnes of
municipal waste in England in 2002/03.
Municipal and household waste were 1.8 per cent
and 1.0 per cent lower, respectively, in 2002/03
than in 2001/02. The proportion of household
waste that is recycled increased from 9 per cent
in 1998/99 to 14.5 per cent in 2002/03. Household
waste (amount and proportion recycled) and all
controlled waste4 are covered by a headline
indicator of sustainable development (see page
114). All English local authorities have targets for
household waste recycling and composting, and
Defra is offering grants totalling £20 million to
help them in 2004/05. Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have each developed their own
national strategies and specific targets.
The Environment Agency has begun a second
survey of industrial and commercial waste
production, with results expected by spring 2005.
The first survey, in 1998/99, reported annual
arisings of such waste of 75 million tonnes in
England and Wales.
Nearly half of waste from households, commerce
and industry is disposed of to landfill, a method
that makes little practical use of waste (although
landfill gas from some sites is used for energy
generation). In the case of municipal waste (Table
19.5), 16 per cent was recycled or composted in
England in 2002/03, but the majority, 75 per cent,
was disposed of in landfill.
Recent legislation is intended to improve the
amount of waste recycled:

a duty upon local authorities in England and

types of recyclable waste from every
household by the year 2010; and
■ the Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003
aims to help the United Kingdom deliver its
commitments to both the Kyoto Protocol (see
page 293) and the EC Landfill Directive. The
Act provides a legislative framework for
trading schemes that allow the required
reductions - whether in biodegradable5
municipal waste going to landfill or in
emissions of greenhouse gases to the
atmosphere - to be made where it is most
cost effective to do so.
By 2005, the Government aims to reduce the
amount of UK industrial and commercial waste
disposed of in landfill sites to 85 per cent of 1998
levels. In England, it aims to recycle or compost at
least 25 per cent of household waste by 2005/06,
increasing this to 33 per cent by 2015. Meeting
these targets would go some way towards fulfilling
4 Controlled waste comprises municipal/household waste, industrial
and commercial waste, and construction and demolition waste.
Non-controlled waste comes from agriculture, mining and
quarrying.
5 Biodegradable waste consists of material such as paper, food and
green waste, which produce methane - a powerful greenhouse
gas - as they degrade.

the Government’s obligation under the EC Landfill
Directive, which requires the United Kingdom to
reduce the landfilling of biodegradable municipal
waste to 35 per cent of its 1995 level by 2020.
The Waste and Resources Action Programme
(WRAP) aims to overcome market barriers to the
recovery and recycling of waste. In 2003, it gained
additional responsibilities following the review of
waste policy Waste not, Want not. The review
concluded that waste volumes in England would

between 2002 and 2020. WRAP is a not-for-profit
company limited by guarantee by Defra, the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and
the devolved administrations. The Waste
Implementation Programme was also set up by
Defra in response to the recommendations made
in Waste not. Want not. It aims to divert
biodegradable municipal waste away from landfill.
In February 2004, it launched two programmes,
worth £32 million, to encourage the take up of
new technologies for treating biodegradable
municipal waste.
The landfill tax credit scheme enables landfill site
operators in the United Kingdom to channel up to
6 per cent of their landfill tax liability into
environmental bodies for use in approved projects.
Examples include reclamation of polluted land,
research and education activities to promote
reuse and recycling, provision of public parks, and
restoration of historic buildings.
Wales
The Welsh Assembly Government’s waste strategy
includes targets for public bodies to reduce their
waste arisings by at least 10 per cent from the 1998
level by 2010, and targets for local authorities to
have 40 per cent of waste recycled/composted by
Recycling electrical equipment
At least 1 million tonnes of waste electrical and
electronic equipment (WEEE) from domestic and
commercial sources is discarded in the United
Kingdom every year and the Environment Agency
estimates that this waste stream is growing by 4 to
8 per cent a year. There are also concerns about the
high level of hazardous materials in such waste.
The EC Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment
Directive requires the United Kingdom to provide
collection facilities for such equipment. From
August 2005, producers will be responsible for
ensuring that the collected WEEE is treated and
that specified recycling targets are met. The related
EC Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous
Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment
Directive bans the sale, from July 2006, of new
electrical and electronic equipment containing
more than agreed levels of lead, mercury,
cadmium, hexavalent chromium and two classes of
flame retardants.
The Directives aim to reduce the disposal of WEEE
to landfill and to increase levels of recovery and
recycling by removing hazardous components
during treatment and ultimately during
manufacture. They cover a wide range of
equipment including televisions, power tools,
computers, kitchen appliances, electronic toys and
monitoring and control equipment.
Legislation is planned to implement the Directives
in the United Kingdom.

were 1.79 million tonnes, up by 4 per cent from
2001/02. The proportion that was recycled or
composted increased from 8.4 per cent in 2001/02
to 12.6 per cent in 2002/03. Twelve per cent of
household waste was collected for recycling/
composting. The Assembly-backed Strategic
Recycling Scheme has funds of £30 million for
reuse, recycling and composting projects in Welsh
communities. Between 2001 and 2005, the
Assembly gave grants of £63.5 million to local
authorities to help them develop sustainable waste
management practices.
Scotland
Scotland produced around 9 million tonnes of
waste in 2002/03. In 2001/02, 92 per cent of
municipal waste was landfilled and 7 per cent was
recycled. The National Waste Plan 2003 contains
targets to recycle or compost 25 per cent of
municipal waste by 2006, rising to 55 per cent
by 2020 and, by the same date, to reduce the
proportion of waste sent to landfill from 90 to
30 per cent. It also includes plans for segregated
kerbside recycling collection for nine out of ten
Scottish homes by 2020. A Strategic Waste Fund of
£230 million over the three years 2003 to 2006 will
assist local authorities implement Area Waste Plans.
Northern Ireland
The Department of the Environment’s Waste
Management Strategy for Northern Ireland sets
out a number of targets. These include: recovering
25 per cent of household waste by 2005, rising to
40 per cent by 2010; reducing the landfilling of
industrial and commercial wastes to 85 per cent of
1998 levels by 2005; and reducing the quantities of
biodegradable waste being landfilled to 75 per cent
of 1995 levels by 2010, rising to 50 per cent by
2013 and 35 per cent by 2020. In June 2004, the
independent Waste Management Advisory Board
published a review of the Strategy commissioned
by the DoE, with recommendations for the
implementation of its next phase.
Packaging
The EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging
Waste set targets that at least 50 per cent of UK
packaging waste should be recovered and at least
25 per cent recycled by 2001. Revised EU targets
have been set for 2008; the Government has
responded by setting new targets for 2004 to 2008
for regulated businesses. In 2003, the United
Kingdom recovered 5.37 million tonnes of
packaging waste - a recovery rate of 53.4 per cent.
Recycling facilities
Across the United Kingdom, recycling banks are
available for the public to deposit various waste
materials, including bottles, cans, clothes, paper
and plastics. In addition, some local authorities
provide kerbside collection of recyclable materials.
In 2003, 69 per cent of newsprint was recycled. In
comparison, 42 per cent of aluminium cans, 34
per of container glass and 6 per cent of plastics
were recycled in 2001, the most recent year for
which data are available for these materials.
Hazardous waste
There is an extensive framework of national and
EU legislation on the manufacture, distribution,
use and disposal of hazardous chemicals. Since
1996, the EC Hazardous Waste List that defines the
scope of the Hazardous Waste Directive has been
refined and increased in length.
International movements of hazardous waste are
controlled by the Basel Convention on the Control
of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous
Wastes and their Disposal. The United Kingdom is
a signatory of the Basel Convention Protocol on
Liability and Compensation.
The Hazardous Waste Forum was set up by the
Government in December 2002 to consider the
demands on industry made by existing and
forthcoming legislation and to consider targets for
hazardous waste reduction and recovery. In
December 2003, the Forum published an action
plan for the reduction and environmentally sound
management of hazardous waste.
A three-month consultation on the proposed
Hazardous Waste Regulations, covering the
movement of hazardous waste from the producer
to the disposal or treatment facility, was launched
in July 2004 in England. If adopted, the new
Regulations will replace the Special Waste
Regulations 1996 and introduce simpler procedures
for the management of hazardous waste, while
meeting the requirements of the EC Hazardous
Waste Directive. Similar consultations are planned
in Wales and Northern Ireland. The Scottish
Executive consulted on the revised Regulations in
2003, and the Special Waste Amendment (Scotland)
Regulations 2004 came into force in July.

EC End-of-life Vehicles Directive
Around 1.8 million end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) are
scrapped in the United Kingdom each year,
generating about 2 million tonnes of waste
material. About 74 to 80 per cent of the weight
of a typical ELV is reused or recycled. The
requirements of the EC ELV Directive include:
■ producers to limit the use of certain
hazardous substances in vehicles and promote
recyclability;
■ ELVs to be treated before dismantling,
recycling or disposal;
■ permits for facilities treating ELVs that have
not had pollutants removed; and
■ recovery and recycling targets to be met in
2006 and 2015.
In June 2003, the UK Government announced
that, until 2007, the 'last owner' of the vehicle
(and not the 'producer') would continue to have
responsibility for the cost of its treatment and
disposal. Parts of the Directive, including the
treatment provisions, were implemented in the
United Kingdom in regulations introduced in
November 2003. The Government is continuing to
consult on how to implement the Directive's other
requirements.
Litter and dog fouling
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any public
place in the open air or to dump rubbish except in
designated places. Local authorities have a duty to
keep public land free of litter and refuse, including
dog excrement, as far as is practicable. In 2002/03,
local authorities in England spent £456 million on
street cleansing and litter. They can issue £50 Fixed
Penalty Notices (FPNs) for litter and dog fouling
offences (£40 for dog fouling offences in
Scotland); the maximum fine, upon successful
prosecution if FPNs are not paid, is £2,500 for
littering and £1,000 for dog fouling (£500 in
Scotland). The Dog Fouling (Scotland) Act 2003
makes it an offence to fail to clear away and
dispose of the excrement appropriately.
ENCAMS is a charity that runs the Keep Britain
Tidy campaign and tackles issues such as litter,
Managing hazardous waste
From July 2004, the Landfill Directive makes it
illegal to dispose of hazardous waste with other
types of waste in the same section of a landfill
(greatly reducing the number of sites that can
accept hazardous waste). It also requires
hazardous waste to be pre-treated prior to
disposal and, from July 2005, this pre-treatment
must meet EC waste acceptance criteria.
Replacement of the Special Waste Regulations
with the Hazardous Waste Regulations will
increase the types and quantities of waste
classed as hazardous. Implementation of the ELV,
WEEE and RoHS Directives (see box opposite and
page 287) will also affect hazardous waste
management in the United Kingdom. Defra and
other organisations launched a new website in
July 2004 to provide information to those
affected by the changes.
fly-tipping, abandoned vehicles, dog fouling, gum,
graffiti and vandalism in the United Kingdom. It
is part-funded by the Government and works in
collaboration with local authorities and the private
sector. It conducts a continuous survey of local
environmental quality in England. Findings from
the second survey published in 2003 included
a 27 per cent reduction in dog fouling in 2002/03
compared with 2001/02, a marked increase in
chewing gum deposits and a significant rise in fast
food litter. Some 40 per cent of sites examined
were classed as either good or satisfactory, but 54
per cent of sites were considered unsatisfactory
and 6 per cent were poor.
Monitoring by the environment agencies, local
authorities, police and ENCAMS shows that the
incidence of fly-tipping (the illegal dumping of
waste) has increased since the introduction of the
landfill tax in 1996. The Environment Agency
estimates that fly-tipping incidents cost the local
authorities over £100 million a year to clear.
Household rubbish, food and drink containers,
vehicles and tyres were the most commonly
dumped materials.
The maximum penalty on successful prosecution
for fly-tipping (and other offences relating to
waste) is a fine of up to £20,000 in a magistrates’
court and up to five years’ imprisonment and/or
289
19 The environment

an unlimited fine in the Crown Court. In 2002/03,
the Environment Agency won 186 successful
prosecutions against fly-tippers. Similar penalties
exist in Scotland, where prosecutions normally
proceed before the sheriff courts. Defra is
developing a fly-tipping strategy to help improve
local environmental quality in line with the new
powers available to the authorities under the Anti-
Social Behaviour Act 2003 (see also page 302). The
Act requires local authorities and the Environment
Agency to submit monthly data on the type
and quantity of fly-tipping they deal with. The
Agency’s Internet-based reporting system,
Flycapture, went live in April 2004 and, by July,
over 94 per cent of local authorities in England
and Wales had registered to use it.
Historic buildings and monuments
In England, lists of buildings of special
architectural or historic interest are compiled by
the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
(DCMS) with advice from English Heritage. In
Wales and Scotland, buildings are listed by Cadw
(the Welsh Historic Monuments executive agency)
and Historic Scotland (an agency of the Scottish
Executive) respectively. In Northern Ireland, the
EHS has responsibility for historic buildings,
following consultation with the advisory Historic
Buildings Council and the local district council.
It is a criminal offence to demolish a listed building,
or alter or extend it in a way that affects its character,
without prior consent from the local planning
authority or - on appeal or following call-in — the
appropriate government minister. A local planning
authority can issue a building preservation notice to
protect for six months an unlisted building that it
considers to be of special architectural or historic
interest and that is at risk, while a decision is taken
on whether it should be listed.
There are proposals for a new system of heritage
protection which will create a single list of historic
sites and buildings in England. The new system is
being piloted by English Heritage at 15 sites,
including York’s Roman Walls, the Weld Estate in
Dorset, and at several Piccadilly Line Stations on
the London Underground.
English Heritage assesses known archaeological
sites in order to identify those that should be
afforded statutory protection. It makes its
recommendations to the DCMS, which maintains
the schedule of ancient monuments.6 The number
of entries tends to fluctuate as some of those sites
considered less important may be ‘descheduled’,
while others are added.
Similar arrangements exist to identify buildings
and ancient and historic monuments eligible for
statutory protection in Wales and Scotland. In
Northern Ireland, the EHS assesses all known
archaeological sites to identify those that should be
protected. It then makes recommendations to the
Historic Monuments Council and also maintains
the schedule.
English Heritage is responsible for the
maintenance, repair and presentation of 410
historic properties in public ownership or
guardianship. It gave grants of £39 million in
2002/03 for the repair of other important ancient
monuments and historic buildings. Most English
Heritage properties are open to the public, and
there were nearly 5.5 million visits to staffed
properties in 2002/03. Government funding for
English Heritage in 2004/05 is £122 million.
Cadw and Historic Scotland, which perform
similar functions, care for 129 and over 330
monuments respectively. There were nearly
3 million visitors to Historic Scotland’s properties
where admission is charged in 2003/04 and over
1 million visitors to monuments in Wales in
2002/03. The DoE in Northern Ireland has 181
historic monuments in state care or guardianship,
managed by the EHS. These received an estimated
150,000 visits in 2002.
Local planning authorities have designated more
than 8,000 conservation areas of special
architectural or historic interest in England and
there are 513 in Wales, around 600 in Scotland and
58 in Northern Ireland. These areas receive
additional protection through the planning
system, particularly over the proposed demolition
of unlisted buildings.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund helps
towards the cost of acquiring, maintaining or
preserving land, buildings, objects and collections
that are of outstanding interest and of importance
to the national heritage. In addition, its trustees

are responsible for distributing the heritage share
of the proceeds from the National Lottery (see
page 275). By March 2004, the Heritage Lottery
Fund had made more than 14,500 decisions across
the United Kingdom, worth over £2.9 billion.
Many of the royal palaces and all the royal parks
are open to the public; their maintenance is the
responsibility of the DCMS and Historic Scotland.
Historic Royal Palaces, the Royal Household and
the Royal Parks Agency carry out this function on
behalf of the Secretary of State in England.
World Heritage sites
The World Heritage List was established under the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation’s (UNESCO) 1972 World Heritage
Convention in order to identify and secure lasting
protection for sites of outstanding universal value.
There are 26 UK World Heritage sites (see map at
the end of the first colour section), including three
in Overseas Territories - St George in Bermuda,
Henderson Island, and Gough Island wildlife
reserve. The latest area to gain World Heritage
status in the United Kingdom was Liverpool’s
waterfront and commercial centre, in July 2004.
Great Britain's historic canal network
There are over 4,820 kilometres of fully navigable
inland waterways in Great Britain. British
Waterways (see page 341) is responsible for
caring for and managing 75 per cent of them. Its
network of canals and rivers includes 2,555 listed
structures and buildings, and 69 scheduled
ancient monuments, including three sites on
English Heritage's Buildings at Risk register.
In 2002/03, British Waterways spent £83.6
million on major repairs and renovation of its
canals. Projects included the restoration of a
unique counterweighted lift bridge on the
Huddersfield Broad Canal.

Air and the atmosphere
Air quality
Air quality in the United Kingdom has improved
considerably since the infamous London smogs of
the 1950s, due to the replacement of coal by
electricity and natural gas for domestic heating,
tighter regulation7 and structural changes in
industry, and the introduction of progressively
more stringent standards for vehicle exhaust
emissions. For example, emissions of carbon
monoxide (CO) fell by 56 per cent between 1990
and 2002, while those for sulphur dioxide (SO,)
fell by 73 per cent.
Under the provisions of the Environment Act 1995,
the Government is required to publish an Air
Quality Strategy setting out its policies for
managing ambient air quality in the United
Kingdom, particularly in relation to reducing air
pollution and any remaining risks to people’s
health and the natural and built environment. The
current strategy contains air quality standards and
objectives for nine pollutants of particular concern
to human health: nitrogen dioxide, PM|()
(particulate matter less than 10 microns in
diameter), SO,, CO, ozone, lead, benzene, 1,3-
butadiene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs).
In February 2003, Defra and the devolved
administrations introduced tighter objectives for
benzene, CO and PM10, and an objective for PAHs
for the first time. These are the same throughout
the United Kingdom except for benzene and PM1().
A tougher PM10 objective than elsewhere was
proposed for Scotland because air quality there is
generally better; conversely, a less stringent
objective was proposed for London. Similarly,
tighter benzene objectives were set for Scotland
and Northern Ireland than for England and Wales.
Monitoring air quality
The United Kingdom has an automatic air quality
monitoring network with 120 sites in both urban
and rural areas (as at March 2004) covering much
of the country. In general there has been a long¬
term decline in the number of air pollution days,
largely because of the reduction in particles and
7 Information on air pollution legislation is given on page 302.
291
19 The environment
UK 2005
S02, but fluctuations from one year to another can
occur because of differences in weather conditions.
In 2003, air pollution in the United Kingdom was
recorded as moderate or higher on an average of
50 days per monitoring site in urban areas; this
compared with 20 days in 2002, and 59 days when
the series started in 1993. In rural areas, air
pollution was recorded as moderate or higher on
61 days on average per site in 2003 compared with
30 days in 2002. Days of moderate or heavy air
pollution are a headline indicator of sustainable
development - see page 114.
The main causes of moderate or higher air
pollution at urban sites are ground level ozone and
PM10. Ground level ozone is formed from
photochemical reactions of other pollutants such
as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) - for example solvents used
in industry, domestic products and dry cleaning,
fumes at petrol pumps, and paints. Pollution
caused by PM10 and SO, has fallen significantly
since 1993, leaving ozone as the principal cause of
pollution in urban areas.
Air Quality Bulletins provide the public with
hourly updates of air pollution data from the
national monitoring network. These give the
concentrations of the main pollutants, together
with a forecast. The information features on
television and radio weather reports, and appears
in many national and local newspapers.
Information can also be accessed through the
United Kingdom’s Air Quality Archive website
(www.airquality.co.uk).
Vehicle emissions
Measures to reduce pollution from road transport
are seen as vital to achieving the objectives set out
in the UK Air Quality Strategy. Progressively
tighter standards for fuels and vehicle emissions
mean that urban road transport emissions of CO,
NOx and particulates are projected to fall by
around 70 per cent between 1995 and 2015.
Vehicle emissions standards are governed by a series
of EC Directives enforced in the United Kingdom
under the Motor Vehicles Construction and Use and
Type Approval Regulations. All new petrol-engine
passenger cars are fitted with catalytic converters,
which typically reduce emissions by over 75 per
cent. These measures to reduce emissions from new
vehicles have been accompanied by improvements
in fuel quality with, for instance, reductions in
components such as benzene and sulphur and the
phasing out of leaded petrol.
Compulsory testing of vehicle emissions is a key
element in the UK strategy for improving air quality.
Metered emission tests and smoke checks feature in
the annual ‘MoT roadworthiness test. Enforcement
checks carried out at the roadside or at operators’
premises also include a check for excessive smoke.
Local councils in England and Wales with
designated Air Quality Management Areas have the
power to use roadside testing to enforce vehicle
exhaust emissions standards in those areas. Similar
powers are available to all Scottish local authorities
and the National Assembly for Wales is consulting
on extending them to local authorities there.
Transboundary air pollution
The pollutant gases SQ2 (mainly from power
stations), NOx (from road transport and power
stations), and ammonia (NH3 - mainly from
livestock) can be carried over long distances before
being deposited directly onto vegetation and soil
or being washed out as acid rain. Acidification
results when sensitive ecosystems are not capable
of neutralising the deposited acidity. In the United
Kingdom, the ecosystems that are most sensitive to
acidification are located in the northern and
western uplands. High levels of acid deposition
have a damaging effect on soils, freshwater, trees
and buildings.
The United Kingdom is a party to the UNECE
(United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe) Convention on Long Range
Transboundary Air Pollution, set up in 1979 in
response to evidence that acidification of lakes in
Scandinavia was linked to emissions of S02 from
other countries in Europe, including the United
Kingdom. Under the Convention, there have been
a number of protocols to reduce emissions of
acidifying pollutants.
The latest Gothenburg Protocol, signed in 1999,
tackles the problems of acidification,
eutrophication8 and ground-level ozone
(photochemical or summer smog). Under the
Protocol, the United Kingdom agreed annual
emission ceilings, to be achieved by 2010, of 625
kilotonnes for SO,, 1,181 kilotonnes for NOx,
297 kilotonnes for NH3, and 1,200 kilotonnes for
VOCs. Emission levels for 2002 are given in
Table 19.6.

Alongside the Gothenburg Protocol, the EC
National Emission Ceilings Directive is intended
to tackle the harmful effects to human health and
the environment from transboundary air
pollution. Regulations came into force in the
United Kingdom in January 2003, setting ceilings
for 2010 for the same four pollutants. The United
Kingdom is committed to further cuts in SO, and
NOx emissions, reducing the ceilings to 585
kilotonnes and 1,167 kilotonnes respectively.
Road transport and power stations are two of the
most important sources of air pollutants in the
United Kingdom. In 2002, road transport
accounted for 59 per cent of CO emissions and
45 per cent of NO>; emissions, while power
stations accounted for 68 and 24 per cent of S02
and NOx emissions respectively.
Climate change
Several gases naturally present in the atmosphere
keep the Earth at a temperature suitable for life by
trapping energy from the Sun - the ‘greenhouse’
effect. However, emissions from human activities
are increasing the atmospheric concentrations of
several greenhouse gases, causing global warming
and climate change.
Global climate data analysed by the Hadley Centre
(part of the Met Office) shows that 2003 was the
third warmest year after 1998 and 2002 in the 143-
year records. The ten warmest years on record
have all occurred since the beginning of the 1990s.
On the hottest day of 2003, the temperature
reached 38.5°C at Brogdale, near Faversham in
Kent, breaking the previous UK record by 1.4°C.
During 2002/03, Defra’s Global Atmosphere
Division commissioned research worth £12
million on climate change and stratospheric ozone
depletion. Research at the Hadley Centre is
focused on improving climate predictions and
investigating the causes of climate change. Recent
results from its climate model suggest that if
greenhouse gas emissions remain high, there will
be a rise in average global temperature of 4.5°C
over the next 100 years; but if emissions fall
sufficiently, the temperature rise will be 2°C.
The first international action dealing with climate
change dates from the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.
The resulting UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1994
and called for the stabilisation of greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that
would prevent dangerous man-made interference
with the climate system. By 2004, 188 governments
(including the European Union) were Parties to
the Convention. The tenth Conference of the
Parties (COP) will be held in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, in December 2004.
At the third COP held at Kyoto in 1997, Parties
agreed legally binding targets for developed
countries to reduce emissions of the basket of six
main greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO,),
methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N,0),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons
(PECs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). The Kyoto
Protocol committed developed nations to a 5.2 per
cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below
1990 levels by 2008-12. The European Union
subsequently agreed to a collective reduction of
8 per cent by that date, which was shared out by
Member States to reflect national circumstances.
The UK Government and the devolved
administrations intend to move towards a
domestic goal of a 20 per cent cut in CO,
emissions between 1990 and 2010. The energy
White Paper published in February 2003 (see page
440) accepted the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution’s recommendation that
the United Kingdom should aim to reduce C02
emissions by 60 per cent from current levels by
about 2050.
The United Kingdom is on course to meet its
target under the Protocol of a reduction of 12.5
293
19 The environment
UK 2005
per cent by 2008-12. The baseline used is the sum
of the 1990 totals for C02, CH4, N20 and the 1995
totals for HFCs, PFCs and SF6. Emissions of the
basket of greenhouse gases, weighted by global
warming potential, fell by 14 per cent between
the 1990 baseline and 2003 (Figure 19.7). The
most significant greenhouse gas emitted by
the United Kingdom is C02, followed by CH4
and N20. Total emissions of C02 in the United
Kingdom in 2003 were provisionally estimated at
152.5 million tonnes. This is about 7 per cent
lower than in 1990, but 1.5 per cent higher than
in 2002, largely due to greater use of coal for
electricity generation and a decrease in net
imports of electricity from the continent. The
increase partly reverses the 3.5 per cent reduction
in the previous year. Emissions of C02 and the
basket of greenhouse gases together form one of
the headline indicators of sustainable development.

The integrated package of policies and measures
contained in the UK climate change programme
includes the climate change levy, which applies to
sales of electricity, coal, natural gas and liquefied
petroleum gas to the non-domestic sector (see
page 441). This aims to encourage business energy
efficiency and is expected to save at least
5 million tonnes of carbon emissions by 2010. The
package also includes a target to deliver 10 per
cent of the United Kingdom’s electricity from
renewable sources of energy by 2010.
Emissions trading
Emissions trading schemes - another key element
of the European Union and United Kingdom
climate change programmes - are designed to
allow businesses to reduce their emissions of
greenhouse gases in the most economically
efficient way. The UK scheme, launched in 2002,
was the world’s first economy-wide greenhouse gas
emissions trading scheme. It works by giving
individual companies and installations a cap,
which when added together forms an overall
emissions cap for the trading scheme. Participating
companies can meet their individual obligation by:
 R«i=
Transport and climate change
Transport contributes about a quarter of C02
emissions in the United Kingdom. Road transport
accounts for 85 per cent of this, with cars
providing around half of all transport emissions.
Between 1970 and 2002, road traffic increased
by 142 per cent, outstripping growth in the
economy - gross domestic product increased by
107 per cent over the same period. Carbon
dioxide emissions attributable to road transport
were 130 per cent higher in 2001 than in 1970.
The Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution's special report on the environmental
effects of civil aircraft in flight, published in 2002,
stressed that emissions from aircraft are likely to
be a major contributor to global warming if the
present increase in air traffic continues unabated.
Passenger-kilometres flown from UK airports
more than doubled from 125 billion in 1990 to
260 billion in 2000. By 2050, the International
Panel on Climate Change believes that aviation
will produce up to 15 per cent of man-made
global warming. The Government is seeking to
balance the economic benefits of air transport
against the environmental impact and a White
Paper, The Future of Air Transport {see page
341), was published in December 2003.

■ reducing their own emissions to the target
level;
■ reducing their emissions below their target
and selling or banking the excess ‘emissions
allowances’;
■ letting their emissions remain above target
and buying emissions allowances from other
participants.
Across the whole scheme, those with low-cost
emission reduction opportunities tend to sell
allowances to those with higher cost options,
thereby minimising the overall cost of delivering a
set of environmental benefits.
Thirty-two organisations, including some of the
largest businesses, participate directly in the UK
scheme and have legally binding targets to reduce
their emissions against 1998-2000 levels. The
scheme is also open to around 5,000 further
companies with Climate Change Agreements. The
Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003 (see page
286) contains provisions to develop the statutory
framework for emissions trading schemes.
The ozone layer
Stratospheric ozone is a layer of gas about 15 to
50 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, which
protects it from the more harmful effects of solar
radiation. UK scientists first discovered ozone
losses over much of the globe - including a ‘hole’
in the ozone layer over Antarctica - in 1985. The
hole has been growing, reaching a record 29
million square kilometres in 2000; after a slight
decrease to 27 million square kilometres in 2001,
it increased almost to the 2000 level in 2003 (the
variation in size is due to meteorological factors).
Similar, but less dramatic, thinning of the ozone
layer occurs over the North Pole each year.
Ozone depletion is caused by man-made
chemicals containing chlorine or bromine,
such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), methyl
bromide, carbon tetrachloride and halons.
In an effort to repair this damage, over 170
countries have ratified the Montreal Protocol, an
international treaty for the protection of the
stratospheric ozone layer. This is enforced in the
United Kingdom by an EC Regulation. The
implementation of the Protocol has reduced the
emissions of ozone depleting substances, although
it will be some time before the full impact is felt.
EU Emissions Trading Scheme
The EU Emissions Trading Scheme will commence
on 1 January 2005. The first phase runs from
2005-07 and the second phase from 2008-12
(to coincide with the first Kyoto Commitment
Period). Over 1,000 installations within the
United Kingdom are covered by the Scheme and
all are required to hold a greenhouse gas
emissions trading permit. Each Member State
must set a 'cap' on emissions of C02 and
permitted installations will be allocated
allowances (similar to quotas) that they can trade
to help them meet their emissions reduction
targets.
Full compliance with the Protocol is likely to result
in the recovery of the ozone layer within the next
50 years.
Noise
Focal authorities have a duty to inspect their areas
for ‘statutory nuisances’ including noise nuisance
from domestic premises, vehicles, machinery or
equipment in the street, industrial/commercial
premises, road works, and construction and
demolition sites. They must take reasonable steps
to investigate complaints and serve a noise
abatement notice where it is judged to be a
statutory nuisance.
According to the Chartered Institute of
Environmental Health, domestic premises were the
most common source of noise complaints,
accounting for some 224,500 such incidents out of
a total of 305,090 reported to local authorities in
2002/03 in England and Wales. From 9,230 notices
served in this period, there were 665 prosecutions
and 452 convictions.
Defra is responsible for developing government
policy on neighbourhood noise (noise other than
in the workplace) and other statutory nuisance.
This includes developing a national ambient noise
strategy and implementing the EC Environmental
Noise Directive. Other government departments
are responsible for reducing emissions from
specific noise sources and for other noise and
nuisance issues - for example, the Department for
295

UK 2005
Transport covers noise emissions from civil
aviation, vehicles and railways.
Radioactivity
Most radiation to which the UK population is
exposed occurs naturally (for example from the
radon gas given off by some rock formations,
particularly granite). Man-made radiation
represents about 15 per cent of the total exposure,
mostly from medical sources such as X-rays. The
keeping and use of radioactive materials are subject
to stringent control by the Environment Agency, the
Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) or
the Chief Radiochemical Inspector in Northern
Ireland. The Health and Safety Executive
(HSE - see page 158) is responsible for regulating
safety at civil nuclear installations. The National
Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) advises on
health risks posed by radiation and how to guard
against them.
Radioactive waste management
The United Kingdom has over 100,000 tonnes of
solid, long-lived radioactive waste in storage. This
will rise to over 500,000 tonnes over the next
century as nuclear reactors and other facilities
come to the end of their lives and are
decommissioned. All solid radioactive waste in the
United Kingdom is either disposed of in suitable
facilities on land or safely stored pending a
decision on how it is to be managed.
Radioactive waste varies widely in nature and level
of activity, and the methods of current
management reflect this. Most solid waste of low
radioactivity is disposed of at the shallow disposal
facility at Drigg in Cumbria. Small quantities of
very low-level waste are disposed of at authorised
landfill sites. Some intermediate-level waste is
stored at nuclear licensed sites (usually where it
is generated), but most of the UK inventory is at
Sellafield in Cumbria. High-level or heat¬
generating waste is stored in either raw (liquid)
or vitrified (glass-like) form.
In 2001, the Government and the devolved
administrations started a major programme of
consultation and research, Managing Radioactive
Waste Safely, to decide policy for the management
of higher activity wastes in the United Kingdom.
After a consultation exercise, the Government set
up an independent body, the Committee on
Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM), in
2003 to oversee a review of the long term options.
This review will include a programme of public
debate backed by research and CoRWM will make
its recommendations to the Government in 2006.
International commitments
An EC Directive lays down basic standards for the
protection of the health of workers and the public
against the dangers arising from ionising
radiation. The provisions of the Directive are
implemented in the United Kingdom through a
number of Acts. The Radioactive Substances Act
1993 provides the legislative framework for the
regulation of radioactive waste. The United
Kingdom is also a contracting party to the
International Joint Convention on the Safety
of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of
Radioactive Waste Management.
The contracting parties to the Oslo and Paris
Convention on the Protection of the Marine
Environment of the North East Atlantic (OSPAR),
including the United Kingdom, have agreed to
reduce radioactive discharges to the North East
Atlantic in the period to 2020. The UK Radioactive
Discharge Strategy 2001-2020 sets out how the
United Kingdom will implement this agreement.
Water
Freshwater environment
Freshwater habitats in the United Kingdom
include rivers, lakes and ponds, and wetlands such
as fens, bogs and reedbeds. Many invertebrates and
all amphibians native to the United Kingdom are
dependent on these habitats, and there are 38
native species of freshwater fish. A comprehensive
survey of the fish populations in the rivers,
streams and lakes in England and Wales, Our
nations’ fisheries, was published by the
Environment Agency in May 2004. Two threatened
mammals, the European otter and the water vole,
depend on aquatic habitats as do a large number
of bird species, including the bittern (a UKBAP
priority species).
Despite rainfall being fairly well distributed
throughout the year in the United Kingdom (see
page 3), there are limited natural and man-made
capacities for storage, and the high population
density means there is relatively little water per
person. Available resources of water include rivers,
296
UK 2005
19 The environment
reservoirs and underground aquifers.9 The
Environment Agency’s strategy for water resource
management considers both environmental and
socio-economic factors (see chapter 28).
Marine environment
The seas around the United Kingdom support
a wide variety of plants and animals, and are a
source of both food and fuel. It is estimated that
around 50 per cent of the United Kingdom’s
biodiversity is to be found in the sea. However,
marine life and the food chain can be put at risk
by pollution, overfishing and other activities.
Defra and the devolved administrations have
responsibility for protecting the United Kingdom’s
seas and coastal waters.
Publication of the Government’s first marine
stewardship report, Safeguarding our Seas, was
followed later in 2002 by a consultation document
Seas of Change. This formed the basis for discussion
on how to provide a conservation and sustainable
development approach to managing the seas. The
Government expects to produce further marine
stewardship reports every three to five years. English
Nature is developing a maritime strategy to help
implement the Government strategy set out in
Safeguarding our Seas and the biodiversity strategy
for England, Working with the Grain of Nature (see
page 285).
In July 2004, the Government published Review of
Marine Nature Conservation, which recommends
an integrated framework for the management of
the UK marine environment. Coastal and marine
SACs around the United Kingdom have been
identified and forwarded to the European
Commission for approval. The Scottish Executive
is consulting on a framework for Scotland’s
marine environment.
Government policy is not to permit any deposit
of waste in the sea when there is a safe land-based
alternative, unless it can be demonstrated that sea
disposal is the best practicable option. The only
wastes routinely considered for deposit in the sea
are dredged material from ports and harbours,
and small quantities of fish waste.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (see page
339) is responsible for dealing with spillages of

oil or other hazardous substances from ships at
sea. The Agency has an Enforcement Unit at its
headquarters in Southampton for apprehending
ships making illegal discharges of oil and other
pollutants off the UK coast. In England, the
maximum fine for pollution from ships is
£250,000 in cases heard in magistrates’ courts.
Water quality
River water quality is a headline indicator of
sustainable development (see page 114). The
United Kingdom is changing the way quality is
measured to ensure consistency with the new
challenge of improving the ecological quality of
water in the United Kingdom under the EC Water
Framework Directive.
The chemical and biological quality of UK rivers
has improved significantly in the past 10 to 15
years, primarily due to reduced pollution from
point sources such as sewage treatment works and
industry. However, the rate of improvement has
levelled off and threats to the ecological quality of
rivers and other water bodies from excess
nutrients, siltation, and organic pollution from
agricultural (see page 299) and non-agricultural
diffuse sources are difficult to track and control.
Using water quality assessment criteria, it is
estimated that 95 per cent of rivers in the United
Kingdom were of good or fair chemical quality in
2002, and 75 per cent of monitored rivers in 2002
were of good chemical quality.10 Only 3.2 per cent
of Scottish rivers were classed as poor quality in
2003, but the reduction of 155 kilometres in the
net length of poor quality rivers was partly due to
unusually dry weather.
There has been some progress in addressing
nutrient pollution. In 2002, 54 per cent of rivers in
England and Wales had high concentrations of
phosphate compared with 64 per cent in 1990,
while 29 per cent of rivers had high concentrations
of nitrate compared with 32 per cent in 2000 and
30 per cent in 1995.
The Water Act 2003 updates the framework for
abstraction licensing, promotes greater water
conservation and planning for the future by water
companies, and makes changes to the regulatory

environment (see page 457). Apart from certain
exceptions, the Act applies to England and Wales.
Its implementation is subject to Commencement
Orders (the first one was signed in March 2004),
with different provisions becoming effective at
different times. For example, licensing changes
take effect by 1 April 2005, drought plans to be
produced by each company providing water
services become statutory in 2005 and water
resources plans become statutory in 2007/08.
In Scotland, the Wbfer Environment and Water
Services (Scotland) Act 2003 introduced a ‘source-
to-sea’ planning framework for river basin
management designed to reduce levels of pollution
and protect water resources and habitats associated
with rivers and lochs. It includes provision for the
protection of the environment through regulations
on water pollution, the abstraction of water,
engineering works and fish farming.
About 96 per cent of the UK population live in
properties connected to a sewer, and the waste
water from the majority of these properties is
given secondary treatment" or better. Investment
in the sewerage system and improving sewage
treatment standards continue to build on the
treatment improvements in the largest sewage
works, and are expected to deliver further
improvements, including at least secondary
treatment for smaller remaining significant
discharges, by the end of 2005.
Discharges to inland, coastal and
groundwaters
All discharges to water in the United Kingdom are
regulated. In England and Wales, the Environment
Agency controls water pollution by issuing legally
binding documents, known as consents, for all
effluent discharges into controlled waters
(groundwaters, inland and coastal waters). The
effluent quality is monitored against the
conditions set within the consents.
The Agency maintains public registers containing
information about water quality, performance and
compliance, consents, authorisations and
11 The preliminary treatment of sewage involves screening to
remove rags, grit and other solids. Primary treatment involves a
physical and/or chemically enhanced settlement of suspended
solids not removed by preliminary treatment. Secondary
treatment involves 'biological' treatment - using bacteria to
break down the biodegradable matter in waste water.
monitoring. Trade effluent discharges to public
sewers are controlled by the water companies.
In 2003, the Environment Agency substantiated
almost 30,000 pollution incidents to water, land
and air in England and Wales. Of these, 779
incidents had a serious impact on water, a decrease
of 10 per cent on the previous year (see Table
19.8). The sewage and water industry, and
agriculture are the most common sources of such
serious water pollution incidents.

In Scotland, controlling water pollution is the
responsibility of SEPA: appeals are dealt with by
the Scottish Executive and trade effluent discharges
to the public sewer are controlled by Scottish
Water. In 2002/03, SEPA recorded and investigated
1,409 water pollution incidents, of which 335 were
classified as significant; although the number of
incidents fell by 30 per cent from 2001/02,
significant incidents increased by 79 per cent
The EHS is responsible for pollution prevention
and control in Northern Ireland, including issuing
discharge consents for trade effluent and sewage
discharges not connected to the public sewer.
Discharges from waste water treatment works are
controlled by the Department for Regional
Development’s Water Service. The EHS also
undertakes pollution incident response in
Northern Ireland. A total of 2,500 reports of water
pollution were made to the EHS in 2003, of which
1,552 were substantiated.
Under the Groundwater Regulations 1998 certain
listed dangerous substances may be disposed of to
land only after investigation and authorisation.
298
UK 2005
19 The environment
The Regulations also give the Environment Agency
and SEPA powers to control or stop activities that
might indirectly cause groundwater pollution.
Similar legislation applies in Northern Ireland,
where the prior investigation and authorisation of
disposals is undertaken by the EHS.
Diffuse pollution from agriculture
Diffuse pollution from agriculture is seen as the
single biggest problem facing water quality in the
United Kingdom over the next ten years.
Agricultural nutrients, pesticides, veterinary
medicines, microbes from livestock manure, and
soil erosion from farmland can all cause water
pollution. Defra and the devolved administrations
are considering measures to tackle this problem as
part of the improvements to the quality of inland
and coastal waters needed to meet the requirements
of the EC Water Framework Directive.
One aspect of this wider problem is nitrate
pollution arising from the application of inorganic
fertiliser, livestock manures and other organic
wastes on farmland. Approximately 70 per cent of
nitrate enters water from agricultural land. The
designation of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs),
under the EC Nitrates Directive, is intended to
reduce or prevent this pollution. An area is
designated as an NVZ when the nitrate
concentrations in its ground or surface water
exceed, or are likely to exceed, 50 mg/litre or where
eutrophication is a (potential) problem.
Farmers in NVZs are required to implement an
Action Programme of measures that promote best
practice in the use and storage of fertiliser and
manure, and build on the guidelines set out in the
Code for Good Agricultural Practice for the
Protection of Water.
In 2002, 55 per cent of England, 3 per cent of
Wales and 14 per cent of Scotland were designated
as NVZs. In 2003, Northern Ireland announced
four new NVZs to address elevated nitrate levels in
groundwaters. In view of the widespread
eutrophication of its surface waters, Northern
Ireland is consulting on a proposal to apply an
Action Programme.
Bathing waters and coastal sewage
discharges
Bathing water quality is influenced by natural
factors (such as temperature, salinity and
sunlight), discharges from coastal sewerage
treatment works, storm water overflows, river-
borne pathogens (that is, pollutants that could
affect human health), and run-off from urban and
agricultural land. Over recent years, the overall
quality of UK bathing waters has continued to
improve and, in 2003, 98 per cent of coastal
bathing waters and all inland bathing water
complied with the EC Bathing Waters Directive’s
imperative standards for coliforms.
The Scottish Executive aims to meet European
standards at all 60 Scottish bathing waters. It has
identified nine bathing waters as sensitive under
the EC Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.
The National Assembly for Wales has identified 24
Welsh bathing waters, Defra has declared 180 such
coastal areas in England, and there are 16
identified bathing waters in Northern Ireland.
The identification confirms that advanced
treatment has been or will be provided to
discharges into the bathing waters from local
sewage treatment works. In 2004, ENCAMS
(see page 289) gave Seaside Awards to 375 UK
beaches for meeting appropriate standards of
water quality and beach management compared
with 317 in 2003. The Awards are given to
beaches that: comply with the EC Bathing
Waters Directive mandatory standards; are
clean, safe and well managed; and provide
appropriate information about water quality.
The European Blue Flag Campaign is an initiative
of the Foundation of Environmental Education
in Europe and is administered in the United
Kingdom by ENCAMS. To be considered, a beach
must have attained the guideline standard of the
EC Bathing Waters Directive before being assessed
for 24 other criteria, including beach cleanliness,
dog control, wheelchair access, the provision of
life-saving equipment and other facilities. In 2004,
123 UK beaches were awarded a Blue Flag,
compared with 105 in 2003.
Total inputs to the sea from rivers and discharges
are reported to OSPAR (see page 296) and there
are international commitments to reduce the loads
of hazardous substances and nutrients.
Business and the consumer
Business has an important role to play in
environmental matters. A Defra survey found that
299
19 The environment
UK 2005
UK industry12 spent an estimated £2.6 billion on
environmental protection in 2002, representing
approximately 0.4 per cent of total turnover, or
just over £700 per employee. This is spending by
companies where the primary aim is to reduce
environmental pollution caused during normal
operations, for example reducing emissions to air
or water, to dispose of waste materials, to protect
soil and groundwater or to prevent noise.
Envirowise is a government-funded programme
offering free, independent advice to UK companies
on practical ways to minimise waste and increase
profit. It works in partnership with the Carbon
Trust (see page 454), which supports energy
efficiency measures.
Other government initiatives to encourage
environmentally sound practices include:
■ the Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment, which provides a forum for
government and business to discuss
environmental issues;
■ the DTTs Technology Programme, which
aims to help businesses exploit technologies
by providing some of the funding and sharing
some of the risk in taking new and innovative
technologies to market; and
■ the Advisory Committee on Consumer
Products and the Environment, which advises
the Government on policies to reduce the
environmental impacts associated with the
production and consumption of goods and
services.
Environmental management systems
An environmental management system provides
organisations with a means to help them control
and minimise the impact of their products,
services and activities on the environment.
Recognised models include the international
management system ISO 14001, and the EU Eco-
Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). The
latter is based on ISO 14001, but additionally
requires the reporting of environmental
performance. Both require auditing by an
accredited independent third party. In the United
Kingdom, accreditation is provided by the UK
Accreditation Service.
12 Results relate to spending by extractive, manufacturing and
energy supply industries. They do not include spending by the
environment industries such as waste management, water and
sewerage.
In 2003, the British Standards Institution (see page
391) published a new British Standard, BS8555,
designed primarily for small and medium-sized
enterprises. It allows companies to implement
environmental management in stages, to
eventually achieve full certification under ISO
14001 or EMAS.
Environmental labelling
UK consumers often rely on the information given
on product labels when trying to choose
environmentally friendly goods. To help them, the
Government encourages accurate and relevant
environmental labelling, as part of an integrated
approach to reduce the environmental impact of
consumer products. The mandatory EU A-G
energy label on household appliances indicates
how efficient a product is, with A’ being most
energy efficient and ‘G’ least energy efficient.
Through Defra, the Government also administers
the voluntary EU ecolabelling award scheme. The
voluntary Green Claims Code sets out guidance
for businesses that make environmental claims
about their products, and provides an
introduction to the international standard on
environmental labelling, ISO 14021. Defra’s
Market Transformation Programme aims to
encourage the take-up of more energy efficient
domestic appliances. Among other areas, it covers
technical standards, consumer product
information, and minimum standards.
Responsibility for environmental
affairs
General government expenditure on
environmental protection increased by 2.8 per cent
in 2003, to £5.4 billion. This included £3.2 billion
on waste management (mainly through local
authorities), £0.6 billion on nature conservation,
and £0.3 billion on waste water management.
The Environment Agency is a non-departmental
public body, accountable to ministers, which aims
to protect and improve the environment in
England and Wales. With a budget of about £800
million in 2003/04, it is responsible for regulating
and controlling pollution, managing water
resources, and improving flood defence. It also
carries out conservation work, and manages and
maintains fisheries and some waterways. SEPA
carries out many of the same responsibilities in
300
UK 2005
19 The environment
Scotland, while in Northern Ireland,
environmental protection is the responsibility of
the Environment and Heritage Service. The three
agencies work closely together - for example,
producing joint technical guidance.
Many local authorities, voluntary organisations
and charities are also involved in environmental
conservation and protection.
Pollution control
Central government and the devolved
administrations make policy, promote legislation
and advise pollution control authorities on policy
implementation. Local authorities are responsible
for:
■ collecting and disposing of domestic waste;
■ keeping the streets clear of litter;
■ controlling air pollution from domestic
premises and, in England and Wales, from
many industrial premises;
■ reviewing, assessing and managing local air
quality; and
■ controlling noise and general nuisance.
Environmental legislation
Conservation and the countryside
The primary conservation legislation in Great
Britain is the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981,
which provides for a range of measures to protect
plants and animals from damage and destruction.
Similar provisions apply under the Wildlife
(Northern Ireland) Order 1985.
The 1981 Act was strengthened by the Countryside
and Rights of Way Act 2000, which gave ministers
and departments in England and Wales a statutory
duty to have regard to the conservation of
biological diversity in carrying out their functions,
and contained new measures for the conservation
and protection of habitats and wildlife. The Nature
Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 placed a duty on
public organisations to promote biodiversity,
strengthened the protection of SSSIs (see page
283) and provided for new measures to tackle
wildlife crime and protect fossils in Scotland.
Waste management
Waste management (see pages 286-89) in Great
Britain is governed by the Environmental
Protection Act 1990 (as amended) and the Waste
Management Licensing Regulations 1994 - similar
legislation exists in Northern Ireland. A licence is
required by anyone wanting to deposit, recover, or
dispose of waste. Licences are issued by the
Environment Agency, SEPA and EHS. A duty of
care requires waste producers, and anyone else
with responsibility for waste, to take all reasonable
steps to keep their waste safe. If they give their
waste to someone else, they must be sure that
those people are authorised to take it and can
transport, recycle or dispose of it safely. Failure to
comply with either the licensing requirements or
a duty of care is an offence.
Local authorities are responsible for the collection
and disposal of all household waste and some
commercial waste. In ‘two-tier’ areas (see page 9),
district councils are responsible for collection, and
county councils for disposal, while in unitary areas
the council has both roles.
The disposal of radioactive waste in the United
Kingdom is regulated by the Radioactive
Substances Act 1993. This Act makes the
Environment Agency in England and Wales and
SEPA in Scotland responsible for regulating the
safe use and storage of radioactive materials and
the management of waste. The DoE regulates
radioactive waste in Northern Ireland.
Industrial pollution control
Certain industrial processes require authorisation
from the appropriate regulator before they can
operate. The Pollution Prevention and Control
(PPG) regime, which implements the EC
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control
(IPPC) Directive, is being phased in and will be
fully established by 2007. It replaces Integrated
Pollution Control (IPC). Under both systems,
regulators are required to ensure that pollution
from industry is prevented or reduced through the
use of best available techniques, subject to
assessment of costs and benefits. Less polluting
processes are regulated only in respect of their
emissions to air. Under the new PPC regime, Local
Air Pollution Prevention and Control (LAPPC) is
replacing Local Air Pollution Control (EAPC).
Similar, but slightly different systems for
301
19 The environment
UK 2005
implementing the IPPC Directive apply in the
different parts of the United Kingdom.
Under PPG, the issuing of integrated permits will
apply to more industrial activities than previously.
These include animal rendering, the food and
drink industry, and intensive livestock
installations. Regulators are also required to take
into account a wider range of environmental
impacts (including noise, energy efficiency and site
restoration) when issuing integrated permits.
The IPPC Directive requires the publication of the
European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER), an
inventory of chemical emissions and sources from
across Europe. The Pollution Inventory for
England and Wales, administered by the
Environment Agency, and the Scottish Pollution
Release Inventory provide Internet-based data for
the EPER.
Air pollution
Ambient air pollution (see pages 291-95) is
controlled and regulated by several different pieces
of legislation, depending on the source of
emissions. Industrial processes with the potential
for producing pollutants are subject to regulation
under IPG and IPPC (see above). Processes with a
significant but lesser potential for air pollution
require approval, in England and Wales from local
authorities, in Scotland from SEPA, and in
Northern Ireland from the Industrial Pollution
and Radiochemical Inspectorate or relevant
district council, depending on the process. Local
authorities also control emissions of dark smoke
from commercial and industrial premises, and
implement smoke control areas to deal with
emissions from domestic properties.
Noise
In Great Britain, the primary legislation used to
take action against the producers of noise (see
pages 295-96) that causes nuisance is the
Environmental Protection Act 1990. Under the
Housing Act 1996, local authorities in England and
Wales have powers to deal with anti-social
behaviour by tenants, including noise. In Scotland,
action against noisy neighbours is taken under
earlier legislation. The Crime and Disorder Act
1998 introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders
(see page 290) in England, Scotland and Wales,
which can be used against any person who is
causing harassment, alarm or distress to others,
including noise nuisance. An EC Directive specifies
the maximum noise level of certain new
equipment for use outside.

Housing 304 Regeneration
Land use planning 315
The United Kingdom is a relatively densely
populated country with 246 people per square
kilometre in 2003. At the time of the 2001 Census
there were almost 24.5 million households.
Compared with 1991, the average household size
had declined from 2.51 to 2.36 people.
Increasing demand for housing and a period of
relatively low interest rates have led to a buoyant
UK housing market. In 2003, the average UK
dwelling price was £155,500, 16 per cent higher
than in the previous year and almost two and a
half times the average price ten years earlier.
The combination of a growing population and
the declining size of households places increasing
pressure on land use. Throughout the United
Kingdom a number of programmes continue to
work to regenerate areas which have been in
decline and are in need of investment.
Housing
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)
has responsibility for determining housing policy
in England and supervising the housing
programme. Responsibility for housing policy in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland rests with
the devolved administrations. They work with
local authorities, or the Northern Ireland Housing
Executive (NIHE) in Northern Ireland, and with
the private and voluntary sectors. Local authorities
and the NIHE are responsible for preparing local
housing strategies. Social housing (housing at
below market rent) is provided by local
authorities, registered social landlords (RSLs, see
page 310) - most of which are housing
associations — and registered housing associations
(RHAs) in Northern Ireland. RSLs are registered
by the Housing Corporation (in England), the
Welsh Assembly Government and Communities
Scotland, through which bodies they also receive
government funding. In Northern Ireland, the
Housing Division of the Department for Social
Development registers RHAs, funds the NIHE and
the housing association movement, and has
regulatory powers over both.
The Sustainable Communities Plan (Sustainable
Communities: Building for the Future), published in
February 2003, set out a 15- to 20-year
programme of action that included £22 billion of
investment to improve housing and communities
in England between March 2004 and May 2006. In
July 2004 the Government announced a further
£16 billion for the Plan during the period 2006/07
to 2007/08.
To meet the demand for affordable housing in the
South East, the Plan identified four growth areas
where land can be accessed relatively inexpensively
so that large numbers of homes can be built. The
areas are Ashford in Kent; Milton Keynes and the
South Midlands; the corridor from London to
Stansted and Cambridgeshire; and the Thames
Gateway, a 64-kilometre strip of land covering
parts of east London, south Essex and north Kent.
In July 2003, the Government committed
£446 million over three years for projects in
priority areas within the Thames Gateway. This is
expected to generate additional funds and to help
produce an extra 200,000 homes by 2016.
The ODPM estimates that almost 1 million homes
in the North of England and the Midlands are
affected by low housing demand, leading in some
areas to homes being abandoned. Low demand
areas are characterised by limited market choice,
the departure of economically active households,
poor facilities and inadequate local services. Both
social and private sector housing are affected. Nine
such areas have been identified as ‘market renewal
pathfinders’. The Plan will provide £500 million to
these areas between 2003/04 and 2005/06 as the
first stage of a long-term programme to tackle
failing housing markets through widespread
304
UK 2005
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
demolition and rebuilding. The level of funding
will increase beyond 2006 and the Government
has announced that over £450 million will be
invested in the pathfinders and other areas of low
demand in 2007/08.
A new Key Worker Living programme was
introduced in April 2004, to help key workers
obtain housing within a reasonable distance of
their workplace in areas of England where high
house prices are undermining recruitment and
retention. Eligible workers include teachers, police
officers, nurses and other essential health workers,
social workers and staff in the prison and
probation services. The scheme offers four options
to help key workers into home ownership or
shared ownership, upgrade to family homes, or
rent at affordable levels. The programme replaces
the Starter Home Initiative, which helped over
10,000 key workers to buy their first home during
the three years it operated. Key Worker Living
has a two-year budget of £690 million and is
expected to help up to 16,000 key workers over
three years.
In December 2003 a Housing Bill was introduced.
The main areas of legislation for England and
Wales set out in the Bill are:
■ replacing the existing housing fitness standard
with a new Housing Health and Safety Rating
System (see page 311);
■ introducing a mandatory licensing scheme for
larger, higher-risk houses in multiple
occupation and discretionary powers for local
authorities to license smaller multi-occupied
properties;
■ providing local authorities with new powers
to license private landlords in areas
experiencing low housing demand or
anti-social behaviour;
■ requiring sellers of residential property, or
their agents, to assemble a home information
pack for buyers and sellers which is available
when the property is marketed;
Review of housing supply
A review was set up in 2003 by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer and the final report, Delivering
Stability: Securing our Future Flousing Needs, was
published in March 2004. It concluded that the
number of homes being built in the United Kingdom
is not keeping pace with demand and is adversely
affecting the local economy. Only 175,000 dwellings
were built in 2001, the lowest number since the
Second World War. Between 1971 and 2001, UK
house prices rose by 2.4 per cent a year in real
terms, compared with the European Union average
of 1.1 per cent. Housing supply has remained
unresponsive and, as a result, growing numbers of
new households cannot afford to buy. Weak supply
has also reduced labour mobility and contributed to
an increase in homelessness.
The review suggested that the number of private
sector homes built in England each year would need
to be 70,000 above the current level in order to
reduce the trend in real house prices to 1.8 per cent.
An increase of 17,000 in the annual supply of social
housing would be needed to keep pace with the
needs of new households, and up to 9,000 above
this rate to reduce the backlog of existing need. The
review recommended that:
■ the Government should set a goal for improved
market affordability (using, for example, a ratio of
house prices to earnings or incomes);
■ planning bodies should take account of market
signals, such as prices and affordability, when
setting housing targets and allocating land;
■ regional planning boards and housing boards
should be merged into regional planning
executives;
■ local authorities should be given incentives to
support development; and
■ the housebuilding industry should invest more in
skills, improve customer satisfaction and develop
sites more quickly.
The Government has accepted the need for an
affordability goal and is weighing the need for
increased development against the social and
environmental implications. It has announced that by
2007/08 there will be 10,000 extra social rented
homes built each year compared with 2004/05.
305
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
UK 2005
■ tightening some of the rules relating to the
Right to Buy scheme (see page 309); and
■ enabling the Housing Corporation and
National Assembly for Wales to pay grants to
developers and housebuilders to develop
affordable housing.
Supporting People
Supporting People programmes were introduced
across the United Kingdom in April 2003. They
are designed to deliver housing-related support
services to vulnerable people, such as the
homeless, older people, people with mental health
problems or physical disabilities, and victims of
domestic violence. The aim is to prevent crises
such as hospitalisation, institutional care or
homelessness, by providing early support when it
is most effective, so that vulnerable people can live
independently in the community.
In England, 150 administering authorities received
£1.8 billion in Supporting People grants in the first
year. These authorities run the programmes
through partnerships with local housing and social
services, as well as the health and probation
services. The programmes provide housing-related
support to over 1.2 million vulnerable people.
In Wales, local authorities administer Supporting
People funds for the elderly and those people
receiving a care service. The Welsh Assembly
Government retains a grant scheme to pay for
other forms of supported housing.
The Scottish Executive allocated £421 million to
local authorities for the Supporting People
programme in 2003/04. Housing support services
are monitored through registration by the Scottish
Commission for the Regulation of Care.
In Northern Ireland the Supporting People
programme is administered by the NIHE, in
partnership with the four Health and Social
Services Boards and the Probation Board. It has an
annual budget averaging £51.5 million from
2004/05 to 2006/07.
Housing stock and housebuilding
In 1951 there were 14.1 million dwellings in the
United Kingdom. By 2003 the number had
increased to 25.6 million. Housebuilding peaked in
1968 when total completions amounted to 426,000
dwellings, 53 per cent by private enterprises and
47 per cent by the social sector (primarily local
Extra care housing
Funding was allocated for 16 schemes providing
1,420 extra care housing places in England during
2004/05, the first year of the Extra Care
Housing Fund. The Fund makes available
£87 million over two years. Extra care housing
offers flexible care, with 24-hour support from
social care and health teams. People living in these
facilities have their own private flat or bungalow
with access to meals, domestic support, leisure
facilities, and nursing care where necessary.
authorities). By comparison there were 183,900
dwellings completed in 2002/03, of which
89 per cent were by private enterprise. RSLs
(predominantly housing associations) now
dominate building in the social sector, and in
2002/03 accounted for 99 per cent of such
completions (see Figure 20.1). Local authorities
and the NIHE are no longer major developers of
new social housing, but they still play an
important role as landlords.
The types of dwelling built have changed over the
last century. Terraced housing was the norm
before the First World War and over a third of the
current stock of this type of housing dates from
before 1919. Between 1919 and 1944 there was
an expansion in the number of semi-detached
dwellings. After 1965 the private sector began to
build more detached houses, while large numbers
of purpose-built flats were provided in the public
sector. Figure 20.2 illustrates the mix of
accommodation in 2002/03.
To minimise greenfield development (that is,
building on land that has not previously been
developed) and to encourage urban regeneration,
the Government wishes to see unoccupied homes
brought back into use. The number of empty
homes in England fell from 869,000 in 1993 to
720,000 in 2003. Eighty-five per cent of vacant
dwellings are privately owned, with about half
of these vacant for at least six months. In May
2004 the Government announced that it would
introduce amendments to the Housing Bill (see
page 305) aimed at bringing the 300,000 long¬
term empty homes in England back into
productive use. The proposed changes would allow
councils to apply to make Empty Homes
Management Orders on long-term empty

properties where there is a strong case for doing
so. The owner of the property would retain legal
ownership and be entitled to any rental income
generated by the local authority after deduction of
its relevant costs, for example in carrying out
renovation work.
Home ownership
Between 1991 and 2003 the number of owner-
occupied dwellings in the United Kingdom
increased by 33 per cent to 18.0 million, while the
number of rented dwellings increased by around
15 per cent to 7.6 million. Northern Ireland had the
highest proportion of owner-occupied dwellings in
2003, and Scotland the lowest (Table 20.3).
The average price of dwellings bought and sold in
the United Kingdom in 2003 was £155,500 (Figure
20.4), although there were marked regional
variations, with buyers in London and the South
East paying the most. However, in 2003, the North
East and the East Midlands recorded the largest
percentage increases (Table 20.5).
Mortgage loans
A feature of UK home-ownership is the relatively
high proportion of homes purchased with a
mortgage. About three-quarters of house purchases
are financed in this way. In 2003, 71 per cent of
such loans were obtained through banks and 14 per
cent through building societies, with 15 per cent
through other specialist mortgage lenders.

There are a variety of types of mortgage, the two
most common being repayment and interest-only.
With repayment mortgages, the debt and the
interest are both repaid during the life of the
mortgage (typically 25 years). Around 71 per cent
of all new mortgages were standard repayment
mortgages in 2003. Interest-only mortgages,
usually involving endowment policies, ISAs
(individual savings accounts, see page 469) or
personal pensions, account for the bulk of other
mortgages. Since the late 1980s there has been a
decrease in the popularity of endowment
mortgages because of the possibility that
investments may not grow fast enough to repay
the capital borrowed. In 1988, 83 per cent of new
mortgages for house purchase were endowment
mortgages, by 2003 this had fallen to 5 per cent.

Flexible mortgages are a type of repayment
mortgage designed to respond to changing
working patterns and incomes over the lifetime
of the loan. Borrowers are given the options of
making overpayments or underpayments, as well
as taking payment breaks. Flexible mortgages have
been growing in popularity and 73 per cent of new
mortgages in 2003 had at least one flexible feature.
In the first quarter of 2003 UK base rates (see page
346) fell to their lowest level since the early 1960s.
308
UK 2005
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
However, due to rising house prices, first-time
buyers accounted for 33 per cent of loans for
house purchases during this period, the lowest
since records began in 1969. By the fourth quarter
of 2003 first-time buyers accounted for 28 per cent
of loans, illustrating the affordability gap for
would-be homeowners. In response to rising
house prices, the base rate was increased during
2004 reaching 4.75 per cent by August 2004.
There were over 25,000 new equity release
mortgages advanced in the United Kingdom in
2003, 55 per cent more than in the previous year.
These funds are commonly used by elderly
homeowners to pay for day-to-day living expenses,
home repair and improvement, or episodes of care.
Low-cost home ownership
Since the 1980s the increase in the proportion of
dwellings that are owner-occupied has in part
been due to government schemes aimed at helping
lower-income households into home ownership.
In England these include the Right to Buy, Right
to Acquire and Voluntary Purchase Grants, which
offer tenants in social housing a discount against
the market value of the homes they rent if they are
eligible and wish to buy them. More than 650,000
local authority dwellings were sold into home
ownership between 1990/91 and 2002/03. In order
to tackle exploitation and profiteering, particularly
in areas of high demand and rising prices, the
Housing Bill (see page 305) proposes some
changes to the Right to Buy scheme, including
extending to five years both the qualification
period and the period after sale during which
landlords can require repayment of discount. This
follows a reduction in the maximum discount
available to tenants in 41 areas in March 2003.
A number of other schemes support low-cost
home ownership by enabling people to part buy
and part rent a home (shared ownership),
providing equity loans or making grants available
to tenants of social housing who wish to buy a
home in the private sector. The Home Ownership
Task Force, which reported in November 2003, was
set up by the Government to examine how people
in housing need in England could be helped to
meet their aspirations to own their own home.
The Government has accepted most of the
recommendations and they are being
implemented. These include better information
and advice and changes to existing schemes to
meet purchasers’ needs.
The Miles Review
Only a quarter of mortgage lending in the United
Kingdom is on fixed (as opposed to variable)
rates, a much lower proportion than in many
other countries. Very few of these mortgages are
fixed for more than two or three years. In April
2003, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
announced a review to identify the factors
underlying the low take-up of fixed rate
mortgages. Reporting in March 2004, the Miles
Review recommended that:
■ lenders should make their full range of
mortgage products available to all borrowers;
■ mortgage advisers should help people assess
risk by presenting 'what if calculations,
indicating the scale of variability in interest
rates; and
■ lenders should include a leaflet setting out the
current mortgage rates on all their products
when issuing annual statements.
The review considered that these proposals,
combined with the removal of certain legislative
and regulatory barriers for banks and building
societies, would help shift the balance away from
short-term deals to ten-year fixed rate loans.
In Wales, local authorities and housing
associations operate a low-cost home ownership
scheme allowing purchasers to buy a home for
70 per cent of its value (50 per cent in rural areas).
The balance is secured as a charge on the property.
Communities Scotland administers a Housing
Association Grant for low-cost home ownership.
This is used to bridge the shortfall between the
cost of provision and locally assessed market
value. Communities Scotland also administers
a Grant for Rent and Owner Occupation, the
purpose of which is to widen the choice of
housing for those seeking to become homeowners.
The grants are targeted at areas of wholly social
sector housing and areas of high demand.
In Northern Ireland, over 108,000 NIHE tenants
had bought their homes between October 1979
and March 2003. The Northern Ireland Co-
ownership Housing Association administers a ‘buy

half, rent half’ (shared ownership) scheme which,
between April 1978 and June 2003, had helped
17,600 people become homeowners.
Rented housing
In 2003, 20 per cent of UK dwellings were rented
from the social sector (local authorities and
housing associations), while 10 per cent were
rented privately (Table 20.3, page 308).
Social housing
Much of the Government’s expenditure on social
housing is provided as subsidies to UK local
authorities to help pay for the costs of nearly
3.5 million rented council homes. More than
2,000 housing associations provide a further
1.7 million units of social housing.
Since the late 1980s, Government policy has aimed
to promote a wider range of social landlords
through stock transfers. In England, a Large Scale
Voluntary Transfer (LSVT) Programme has been
running since 1988. By April 2004, almost 820,000
dwellings had been transferred from local
authorities to RSLs with the support of tenants
and the approval of the Secretary of State.
RSLs are the major providers of new subsidised
homes for those in housing need. They range from
almshouses to large housing associations
managing thousands of homes. They include
LSVT and local housing companies set up to own
and manage council homes transferred from local
authorities.
The Housing Corporation, which regulates housing
associations in England, gives capital grants to
provide homes for rent and for sale, primarily from
the Approved Development Programme (ADP). The
Planned ADP budget for 2004/05 is £1.6 billion.
The Housing Inspectorate, based at the Audit
Commission, is responsible for inspecting the
housing services of local authorities and housing
associations in England. It reports the results of its
housing association inspections to the Housing
Corporation, as the statutory regulator.
Local authorities in Wales own around 200,000, or
about 14 per cent, of all Welsh homes. By law they
have to manage their own stock efficiently and, in
consultation with their tenants, address housing
Housing and Employment Mobility
Service
A new Housing and Employment Mobility Service
(HEMS) will be introduced in 2005, with the aim
of improving housing and employment mobility
throughout the United Kingdom. It will help
tenants move around the country by providing
information about jobs and housing opportunities
in other areas. There will be three elements:
■ services for social landlords, their tenants and
applicants, to help people find new homes;
■ website information about local areas,
covering access to housing, neighbourhoods
and jobs; and
■ web access to information on vacancies in
social housing.
HEMS is a joint project between the ODPM,
Jobcentre Plus, the Scottish Executive, the Welsh
Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly.
Existing housing mobility services run by LAWN
(London Alliance West and North), which helps
tenants to move out of London, and HOMES
(Housing Mobility and Exchange Services) will
continue to operate until HEMS is in place.
needs and demands. The Housing Bill (see page
305) provides for a Social Housing Ombudsman
for Wales, to investigate complaints against RSLs.
Communities Scotland is responsible for the
regulation and inspection of both RSLs and local
authority landlords. In 2004/05 it plans to invest
£284 million in housing projects, helping to
complete more than 4,600 new and improved
homes and allowing work to start on another
5,350, mainly for rent through housing
associations.
The NIHE, the strategic housing authority, is the
landlord of 102,000 properties, nearly one-third of
rented properties in Northern Ireland. It assesses
the need for, and arranges the supply of, social
housing. The Government’s contribution to
housing of £370 million in 2004/05, supplemented
by rental income and capital receipts, meant that
gross resources available were £710 million. An
additional £25 million was available from private
finance to build new social housing. The NIHE has

20 Housing, planning and regeneration
continued to transfer its new-build programme to
registered housing associations. The 2004/05
programme will provide 1,300 new homes.
Private renting
During the past 60 years the size and nature of the
UK private rented sector has changed. Before the
Second World War 57 per cent of the population
lived in private rented accommodation. Most
tenancies were unfurnished, subject to rent control
and occupied by the same tenants for many years.
For many people today, private renting is a more
temporary tenure, occupied by those such as
students and young professionals who may need to
move frequently, and by people who are saving to
buy. There are, in addition, people who have no
other option because they cannot afford to buy and
do not qualify for social rented accommodation. In
2002/03 just over a fifth of households in the
private rented sector in England received rent
assistance in the form of housing benefit.
‘Assured’ and ‘shorthold’ (in Scotland, ‘short
assured’) tenancies are the most common forms of
arrangement for letting houses and flats by private
landlords. If the tenancy is shorthold, the landlord
can regain possession of the property six months
after the beginning of the tenancy (or at the end
of an agreed fixed term if that is longer than six
months), provided that he or she gives the tenant
two months’ notice requiring possession. If the
tenancy is assured, the tenant has the right to
remain in the property unless the landlord can
prove to the court that he or she has grounds for
possession, and the landlord does not have an
automatic right to repossess the property when the
tenancy comes to an end. In both types of tenancy
the landlord can charge a full market rent.
The National Approved Lettings Scheme is a
voluntary accreditation scheme for private sector
landlords in England that aims to promote best
practice among lettings agencies. It sets minimum
standards for service and financial probity of
agents in handling clients’ money.
Improving existing housing
The Government defines a decent home as one
that:
■ meets the current statutory minimum
standard for housing, which at present is the
‘fitness standard’;
■ is in a reasonable state of repair;
■ has reasonably modern facilities; and
■ provides a reasonable degree of thermal
comfort through effective insulation and
efficient heating.
The 2001 English House Condition Survey found
that 7.0 million dwellings (33 per cent) failed to
meet the decent home standard in 2001. This had
fallen from 9.4 million (46 per cent) in 1996.
Households that rent privately, people who live
alone, ethnic minorities and households with no
one in full-time employment are most likely to be
living in non-decent homes.
The Government intends to reform the legislation
on housing fitness for England and Wales. The
current statutory housing fitness standard (set out in
the Housing Act 1985) is based in part on criteria
first introduced approximately 80 years ago. To
reflect a more modern approach to health and safety
hazards in the home, the Government has developed
the Housing Health and Safety Rating System
(HHSRS) and included measures in the Housing
Bill (see page 305). Subject to legislation, local
housing authorities will in future base enforcement
decisions on assessments of 29 categories of housing
hazard covered by the HHSRS.
Disabled people in all tenures can apply for grants
so that they can continue to live independent lives
in their own homes. The Disabled Facilities Grant
(DFG) is allocated to eligible applicants through
local authorities in England and Wales, and pays
for essential adaptations to the home.
Following recommendations from the Housing
Improvement Task Force (see page 312) and a
consultation paper on Modernising Scotland’s
Social Housing (see page 312) Scottish ministers
announced the Scottish Housing Quality Standard
in February 2004. To meet this standard a house
must be energy efficient; free from serious
disrepair; healthy, safe and secure; provided with
modern facilities and services; and comply with
the existing statutory tolerable standard.
Private housing
Local authorities in England and Wales have wide
discretionary powers to help homeowners and
tenants to repair, improve and adapt their
properties and to assist in the regeneration of
communities. Assistance can include grants, loans
and equity release schemes. In 2002/03, local
311
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
UK 2005
authorities in England used these powers to fund
around £259 million of repairs for some 68,000
homeowners and tenants.
Local authorities have similar powers in Scotland.
In October 2003 the grants system was modified
to target help to people on the lowest incomes
and encourage homeowners to carry out priority
work. The Scottish Executive set up a Housing
Improvement Task Force in 2001 to examine the
issues affecting the condition and quality of
private sector housing and the process of buying
and selling houses in Scotland. Its final report,
Stewardship and Responsibility: A Policy Framework
for Private Housing in Scotland, was published in
March 2003.
In Northern Ireland, funding is allocated through
the house renovation grants scheme, administered
by the NIHE, on a similar basis to that in England.
In rural areas of Northern Ireland, financial
assistance to replace isolated dwellings that cannot
be restored is also available.
Social housing
Most capital expenditure on local authority housing
goes towards major repairs and renovations. The
number of non-decent homes in the social sector in
England fell from 2.3 million in 1996 to 1.6 million
in 2001. The main reason why these homes failed
the standard was a failure to provide a reasonable
degree of thermal comfort. In 2000 the
Government set a target to bring all social housing
in England up to the decent standard by 2010.
The Government is adopting three ways of
securing additional investment in council-owned
housing:
■ stock transfer to RSLs (see page 310);
■ management companies set up by local
authorities, but operating independently, with
responsibility for management of their
housing stock; and
■ private finance initiatives (PEI, see below).
The Sustainable Communities Plan (see page 304)
announced funding of £2.8 billion over three years
from 2003/04 to improve council housing and
£685 million of PEI credits. The PEI for local
authority housing uses private sector funding to
refurbish or re-provide council houses and
thereafter to provide housing services, with tenants
remaining tenants of the local authority. By
September 2003 there were two signed Housing
Revenue Account PEI pathfinders’ and 14 at
various stages of procurement, with the aim of
refurbishing a total of 25,000 council houses
across England.
In 2003 the Scottish Executive published a
consultation paper. Modernising Scotland’s Social
Housing. The main proposals included:
■ developing a national social housing standard
to deliver minimum quality standards to all
tenants of social landlords in Scotland;
■ continuing commitment to community
ownership to ease the transfer of further
council stock to RSLs and release money for
future investment; and
■ extending the ‘prudential borrowing regime’
to local authority housing capital investment.
When it announced the Scottish Housing Quality
Standard in February 2004 (see page 311), the
Executive set a target date of 2015 for local
authorities and RSLs to meet the Standard.
Rural housing
The Housing Corporation finances a special rural
programme in England to build houses in villages
with a population of 3,000 or less. The Sustainable
Communities Plan (see page 304) included a
government target for the Corporation to provide
3,500 affordable homes in small villages between
2004/05 and 2005/06. This was in addition to the
target of 1,600 for 2003/04. The plan also included
measures to make it easier for local authorities to
limit the resale of ex-council housing in rural areas
so that it is reserved for local people.
The National Assembly for Wales supports the
development of housing in rural areas if it is a
strategic priority for the local authority.
The Scottish Executive’s Rural Housing Investment
Programme provided 1,450 new and improved
homes across Scotland in 2003/04 and aims to
approve a further 1,400 in 2004/05. A £10 million
Special Rural Development Programme for
affordable housing was announced in 2003. Funding
will be allocated over 2004/05 and 2005/06.
In Northern Ireland, between 2001/02 and
2003/04, 363 new social rented homes were
provided in rural areas outside district and larger
towns. Disrepair and housing unfitness in the
private sector is tackled through the house
312
UK 2005
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
renovation grants scheme (see page 312). During
2003/04, just over 900 properties outside the main
cities benefited from renovation grant assistance,
while around 200 private dwellings were provided
through replacement grant aid.
Growing numbers of people are buying second
homes or purchasing property as an investment
(see box), and this has contributed to rising house
prices in some rural areas, leading to concern that
many young people and those on low incomes are
unable to buy. Local authorities in England have
been given powers to reduce the council tax
discount on second homes. From April 2004 they
can charge up to 90 per cent council tax for
second homes and up to 100 per cent for long¬
term empty homes. Welsh local authorities can
levy 100 per cent council tax on second homes.
Scottish local authorities will be able to charge up
to 90 per cent from April 2005.
Second homes
In 2002/03 an estimated 175,000 households in
England had a second home that was also in
England. Most of these households (89 per cent)
owned rather than rented the second home.
Although around half had acquired it for
holidays, weekends or retirement, there were
other uses such as working or studying away
from the main home. An estimated additional
81,000 households held a second home purely as
an investment. Such properties are often let to
holidaymakers or full-time tenants.
Homelessness
Local housing authorities in England and Wales
have a statutory duty to ensure that suitable
accommodation is available for applicants who are
eligible for assistance, have become homeless
through no fault of their own, and who fall within
a priority need group (this is the ‘main homeless
duty’). Priority need groups include families with
children, and households that include someone
who is vulnerable, for example because of
pregnancy, domestic violence, old age, or physical
or mental disability.
Where applicants are homeless but not owed the
main duty (for example, because they do not fall
within a priority need group) the housing
authority must assess their needs and ensure that
they are provided with advice and assistance in
their own attempts to find accommodation.
Authorities also have a general duty to ensure that
advice about homelessness and the prevention of
homelessness is available free of charge to
everyone in their district. In most areas, such
advice is available from housing aid centres,
Shelter (a charity that offers housing advice to
homeless and badly housed people), Citizens
Advice and other local agencies.
Local authorities in England and Wales also have
a duty to carry out reviews of homelessness within
their area at least every five years and produce
strategies for tackling and preventing it. The first
strategies were published in July 2003.
The number of households accepted as homeless
by local authorities in England increased by 5 per
cent to 137,000 during 2003/04. Figure 20.6 shows
the trend in the number of homeless households
in temporary accommodation in recent years.
There were just over 97,000 such households at the
end of 2003/04, about 7 per cent of which were in
bed and breakfast (B&B) accommodation.

Some £260 million is being invested over the three
years to 2005/06 to help English local authorities
sustain reductions in rough sleeping; end the use
313
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
UK 2005
of B&B hotels as a form of temporary
accommodation for homeless families with
children; and develop new ways of tackling
homelessness. The Homelessness (Suitability of
Accommodation) Order 2003 means that local
authorities can no longer place families with
children in B&B for longer than six weeks.
Domestic violence accounted for 13 per cent of
local authority homelessness acceptances in
England in 2003/04. Funding of £18.8 million was
provided to build and develop more refuges to
help women and children fleeing violent partners.
The money was used in partnership with local
refuge groups, RSLs and local authorities. There
Moving home
According to the 2001 Census, one in eight
people in England and Wales had moved house
during the previous year. Mobility was highest in
the south-east of England, particularly Inner
London where 4 per cent of the population had
moved in from other parts of the United
Kingdom, 5 per cent had left, and almost 9 per
cent had moved within the area.
Private rented accommodation is by far the most
transient form of tenure, favoured by students,
under-25s, and single people. Data from the
2002/03 Survey of English Housing showed that
over half of all tenants renting private furnished
accommodation had been in their home for less
than a year. In contrast more than half of those
who owned their homes outright had been in the
same home for over 20 years.
The most common reason why established
households move is larger accommodation (19
per cent). Other reasons are job-related (12 per
cent), to go to a better area (12 per cent), and
divorce or separation (9 per cent). While 32 per
cent of those in privately rented furnished
accommodation moved 50 miles or more, or
abroad, only 4 per cent of those in
accommodation rented from a council did so. To
make it easier for those in social sector housing
to move, a Housing and Employment Mobility
Service will be launched in 2005 (see page 310).
will be further funding totalling £13.3 million in
2004/05 and 2005/06.
In Wales, the National Homelessness Strategy and
action plan were published in 2003. The strategy
identified 23 objectives to be covered within local
homelessness strategies. Assembly funding for
voluntary sector schemes aimed at tackling
homelessness and rooflessness in Wales has
increased from £650,000 in 1999/2000 to
£4.9 million in 2004/05.
Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar
legislation on homelessness to that in England and
Wales. The Scottish Executive allocated funds of
£127 million for the period 2003/04 to 2005/06 to
deliver the recommendations of the Homelessness
Task Force that reported in 2002. The Homelessness
(Scotland) Act 2003 took forward the legislative
recommendations and set a target that by 2012
all homeless people will be entitled to permanent
accommodation. The Act widened the priority
need categories, relaxed the local connection
requirement and introduced greater help to
intentionally homeless people. It also requires
landlords to inform local authorities of
repossession cases so that early action can be taken
to prevent homelessness.
In Northern Ireland there were 17,150 applications
under the homeless persons legislation during
2003/04, and almost 8,600 acceptances, much the
same as the previous year. The Homelessness
Strategy for Northern Ireland, published by the
NIHE in 2002, focuses on helping people avoid
homelessness, helping people out of homelessness
and supporting people when they get a home.
People sleeping rough
The Rough Sleepers Unit (RSU), established in
1999, was set the target of reducing rough sleeping
in England from a baseline of 1,850 in 1998 to as
near to zero as possible - and by at least two-
thirds - by 2002. By December 2001 the latter
target had been met. The Homelessness and
Housing Support Directorate at ODPM, which has
taken on the work of the RSU, works with local
authorities to sustain the reduction. In June 2003
an estimated 500 people were sleeping out on any
single night - the lowest level recorded.
Over the three years to 2004, £3.5 million was
made available to support projects whose aim was
to reduce the number of people sleeping rough in
314
UK 2005
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
Wales. In Scotland, the number of rough sleepers
fell by a third between May 2001 and October
2003. This programme was allocated £4 million in
capital funding between 2002 and 2004 and will
also receive £9.5 million a year in revenue funding
up to 2006. Between 2003 and 2006 investment
of £100 million will fund the replacement of
Glasgow’s outdated homeless hostels with more
suitable accommodation and support services.
Asylum seekers
Asylum seekers may be able to obtain housing
through the National Asylum Support Service
while their claim is being processed. People who
are subsequently granted refugee status or
humanitarian protection or discretionary leave to
remain are entitled to claim housing benefit (see
page 173) and to apply for social housing.
Land use planning
In Great Britain land use planning is the direct
responsibility of local authorities. They prepare
development plans and determine most planning
applications. The ODPM and the devolved
administrations have responsibility for the
operation of the system. They issue national
planning policy guidance, approve structure plans
(except in Wales where unitary authorities have
this role), decide planning appeals and determine
planning applications that raise issues of national
importance. In England the ODPM operates
through the Government Offices for the Regions
(GOs, see page 12) and the Planning Inspectorate.
In Northern Ireland, the Department of the
Environment (DoE) functions as the single
planning authority. The Planning Service, an
executive agency within the DoE, is responsible for
operational planning, issuing policy and guidance,
determining planning applications and preparing
development plans.
England
There are just over 400 planning authorities in
England - including county councils, district
councils, unitary authorities and National Park
authorities. The first planning laws were enacted
in 1909 and the modern system dates from the
Town and Country Planning Act 1947 and
subsequent legislation in 1990 and 1991. The
Government’s national policy is set out in 25
Planning Policy Guidance notes (PPGs) - covering
issues such as housing, transport, sport and
recreation - and in 15 Minerals Policy Guidance
notes (MPGs) as well as in other guidance. The
PPGs are gradually being revised and replaced
with Policy Planning Statements (PPSs).
There are several tiers to the planning system.
Central government issues national planning
guidance to local authorities and also Regional
Planning Guidance (RPG) based on advice from
regional planning conferences. In two-tier local
authorities (see page 9) the upper-tier (county
councils) produce ‘structure plans’, indicating
where development should be focused, while the
lower-tier (such as district councils) produce
‘local plans’ with more detailed and site-specific
information. Local authorities decide individual
planning applications with reference to these
plans. In London the Mayor has responsibility for
production of a ‘spatial development strategy’
covering development, regeneration and transport
issues in the capital.
The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 is
intended to make the planning system fairer, faster
and more predictable by simplifying the way
decisions are made. The Act applies to Wales as
well as England, with specific sections for the
different development planning arrangements in
the two countries.
Provisions included in the Act aim to:
■ simplify planning development with a new
two-tier system whereby Regional Spatial
Strategies are prepared by each English region
and Local Development Frameworks (see
page 317) by unitary and district councils;
■ introduce a requirement for local planning
authorities to consult with local communities;
■ speed up the process for major infrastructure
projects requiring a decision by central
government;
■ introduce Business Planning Zones to aid
regeneration by encouraging investment and
fast-tracking developments in areas where
jobs are needed most; and
■ make the compulsory purchase system faster
and clarify local authority powers to acquire
land for planning and regeneration.
Most of these provisions will come into force in
late 2004.

20 Housing, planning and regeneration
UK 2005
A draft Planning Policy Statement 1 (PPS1 -
Creating Sustainable Communities) was issued
in February 2004 for consultation. It states the
policies and principles that will support the
reformed planning system, ft urges planners to
integrate economic, social, environmental and
resource factors; to support development
proactively rather than simply regulate and
control; to set clear visions for communities;
and to promote community participation. The
Statement sets out the importance of building
well-designed homes, offices, factories and leisure
facilities that will benefit the community and
stand the test of time.
Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing (PPG3)
sets out the Government’s planning policies for
housing in England. It encourages planning
authorities to recycle brownfield (previously
developed) sites within urban areas, bring empty
homes back into use and convert existing
buildings in preference to the development of
greenfield sites. It also encourages planning
authorities to use land more efficiently; assist with
the provision of affordable housing in both rural
and urban areas; and promote mixed-use
developments that integrate housing with shops,
local services and transport.
The Government’s national target is that, by 2008,
60 per cent of additional housing in England
should be provided on brownfield land or by
re-using existing buildings. In 2003, 66 per cent
of new housing was built on such land.
Sustainable development for rural areas
A draft PPS for rural areas (PPS7) was published
in September 2003. It describes how planning
policies can help raise the quality of rural life by:
■ revitalising country towns and villages;
■ supporting wide-ranging economic activity;
■ improving the availability and viability of
community services and facilities;
■ meeting rural needs for affordable housing;
■ assisting farmers and equestrian enterprises;
■ providing tourism and leisure facilities so that
rural areas can be enjoyed by everyone; and
■ protecting the landscape, wildlife and
biodiversity.
Wales
Issues covered in Planning Policy Wales, published
in 2002, include: keeping development away from
flood risk areas; the possible establishment of the
first Green Belt areas; development of land and
buildings in a way that creates a more accessible
environment, particularly for people with limited
mobility; guidance on the sustainable use of
previously developed land beyond housing needs
alone; encouraging both rural and farm
diversification; and proposals to relax the control
of developments in the open countryside so that
development on farm complexes can be permitted
in certain circumstances.
In 2002, the Minister for Environment launched
a programme to improve the planning system in
Wales. Based on proposals in Planning: Delivering
for Wales, the programme involves the Welsh
Assembly Government working with the 25 local
planning authorities and the Planning
Inspectorate in Wales to ensure that the planning
system is open, fair and transparent; delivers
improved quality and speed; and integrates with
other plans and processes.
Scotland
There are 33 planning authorities in Scotland
comprising 32 local authorities and the Loch
Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority.
The Cairngorms National Park is also a planning
authority in relation to certain functions.
Legislation for planning policy in Scotland is
contained in the Town and Country Planning
(Scotland) Act 1997. Scottish Planning Policies
(SPPs) provide statements of Scottish Executive
policy on nationally important land use and other
planning matters, supported where appropriate
by a locational framework. SPPs will gradually
replace National Planning Policy Guidelines
(NPPGs) by 2007. By August 2004 there were
five: on the planning system, economic
development, housing, flooding, and transport
and parking.
Following a review of strategic planning (see also
page 317), Scotland’s first National Planning
Framework was published in April 2004. It aims
to guide the spatial development of Scotland and
provide a context for development plans and
planning decisions. In particular, it covers:

■ the need for coordinated action in the West

■ the importance of investment in the East
Coast transport infrastructure;
■ the role of Ayrshire and the South West as
a gateway; and
■ promoting economic diversification and
environmental stewardship in rural areas.
Northern Ireland
The Planning Service in Northern Ireland has
embarked on a programme of change. In 2002,
Modernising Planning Processes, presented
proposals for improving the planning system. The
Implementation Plan, launched in February 2003,
identifies specific issues and actions the Planning
Service intends to take by the end of 2005 to
modernise and improve the development control
process, the formulation of planning policy for
Northern Ireland and the preparation of
development plans for local council areas.

Development plans help to shape land use and
provide a framework for consistent decision¬
making. Planning applications are determined in
accordance with relevant development plan
policies unless ‘material considerations’ indicate
otherwise. Provisions in the Planning and
Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (see also page 315)
require unitary and district councils in England to
prepare Local Development Frameworks (LDFs).
LDFs will replace structure plans, local plans and
unitary development plans and contain:
■ a statement of core policies setting out the
local authority’s approach to development;
■ a statement of community involvement
setting out the planning authority’s policy for
involving the community in the development
and revision of LDFs and in significant
development control decisions;
■ site-specific policies and proposals, including
area action plans for smaller local areas; and
■ a map showing designations such as
conservation areas, sites for particular future
land uses or developments and locations of
any proposed or actual area action plans.
Local planning authorities will be able to produce,
by agreement, joint LDFs between two or more
districts and between two or more districts and
counties, under a joint committee. The continuous
updating and review of LDFs will become a
requirement for all local authorities.
To ensure that all local authorities have LDFs in
place, the Government is providing £350 million
between 2003/04 and 2005/06 through the
Planning Delivery Grant. The grant is
performance-based and from 2004/05 is being
allocated to local authorities that have made
significant improvements in their handling of
development control planning applications, plan
making, housing delivery in high demand areas,
location of Enterprise Areas, and appeals. These
criteria build on those for 2003/04, which included
additional funding for the growth areas and areas
of high housing demand. Funding is also being
allocated to the regional planning bodies for their
work on new regional spatial strategies and
reviews of existing planning guidance.
The Act includes specific clauses for Wales
covering the introduction of Local Development
Plans (LDPs), which will replace Unitary
Development Plans. LDPs will be subject to
independent examination, with local planning
authorities being obliged to act on any
recommendations of the inspector before formally
adopting the plan. The Welsh Assembly
Government will have the power to intervene in
the production of an LDP, before adoption, if it
felt the plan was unsatisfactory.
In Scotland, development plans are prepared by
local authorities and consist of structure and local
plans. In the case of National Parks, the Park
Authorities have responsibility for the preparation
of a National Park Plan and for local planning, and
are statutory consultees on structure planning for
the area. Following the Review of Strategic
Planning (see page 316), the Scottish Executive
outlined a new approach to development planning.
It proposed that in the four main cities (Aberdeen,
Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow), there should be
two tiers of development plan: a City Region Plan
(GRP) and an LDP. Elsewhere there should be a
single tier LDP. Councils not involved in a GRP
should include an explanation of their strategy
in the LDP. Certain aspects of the modernisation
programme will require legislative change that will
be taken forward through a Planning Bill.

UK 2005
The Scottish Executive’s Planning Audit Unit
works with planning authorities to establish best
practice in development control and development
planning, and to highlight areas where
improvements could be made to processes and
services. By August 2003 two-thirds of Scottish
councils had conducted a planning audit.
In Northern Ireland, the Modernising Planning
Processes Implementation Plan of February 2003
(see page 317) will reduce the number of
development plans by grouping local council areas
together, and will provide complete development
plan coverage by the end of 2006.
The Planning Portal
The Planning Portal {vmw.planningportal.gov.uk)
is a website for all aspects of planning in England
and Wales. Users can:
■ read planning news;
■ see if planning permission is needed and how
to obtain it;
■ access development plans, regulations and
guidance notes on which application and
appeals procedures are based;
■ find out about planning in their area; and
■ make on-line planning applications to some
local authorities.
A national e-government project, PARSOL
(Planning and Regulatory Services Online), is
being funded by the Government to help local
authorities ensure that they can receive and
process planning applications online by 2005.
Development control
Development control is the process for regulating
the development of land. Most forms of
development, such as the construction of new
buildings, alterations to existing buildings or
changes of land use, require permission from the
relevant planning authority. Applications are dealt
with on the basis of the development plans and
other material considerations, including national
and regional guidance.
In 2003/04 district planning authorities in England
received 675,000 applications for permission, and
made 625,000 decisions, granting permission to
84 per cent of applications. Householder
developments accounted for 54 per cent of all
decisions in 2003/04, compared with 12 per cent
for new dwellings and 15 per cent for commercial
and industrial developments. Other decisions
involved listed buildings or conservation areas,
advertisements, or change of use.
Planning authorities in Scotland received 51,330
applications for permission in 2003/04 and
granted permission to 94 per cent of these.
In 2003/04, 75 per cent of all planning decisions
in England were made within the statutory eight-
week period. The Government’s target is for 80 per
cent of applications to be dealt with within this
period. Similar targets apply in Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland.
In England, Wales and Scotland, certain planning
applications are referred for decision to the
Secretary of State, the Welsh Assembly, or Scottish
ministers, rather than being decided by the local
planning authority. In general, this only occurs
where the planning issue is of more than local
importance. A small number are referred to a
public inquiry, such as the Terminal 5 inquiry at
London Heathrow Airport, which concluded with
government approval for the project.
If a local authority refuses to grant planning
permission, grants it with conditions attached or
fails to decide an application within eight weeks
(or two months in Scotland), the applicant has a
right of appeal to the Secretary of State, the Welsh
Assembly or Scottish ministers.
The Planning Inspectorate serves both the Deputy
Prime Minister in England and the National
Assembly for Wales on appeals, development plans
and other casework on planning, housing, the
environment, highways and related legislation. It
provides information and guidance to appellants
and other interested parties about the appeal
process. In 2003/04, nearly 19,000 planning appeal
cases were determined in England and Wales.
The Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit
is responsible for the determination of most
planning appeals and organises public local
inquiries into planning proposals and related
matters. Just under 1,000 cases were determined
in Scotland in 2003/04. The Executive is consulting
on proposals to broaden the right of appeal and is
318
UK 2005
20 Housing, planning and regeneration
considering measures to improve the inquiry
process. In Northern Ireland, the applicant has
the right of appeal to the Planning Appeals
Commission. Major planning applications can be
referred to a public inquiry in certain
circumstances.
Green Belts
Green Belts are areas of land that are protected
from development. The aim is to control the
sprawl of large built-up areas, prevent towns from
merging with one another, preserve the heritage
of historic towns and encourage the recycling of
derelict and other urban land, thereby
encouraging urban regeneration. Not all Green
Belt land is countryside. It can cover small villages
comprising a mixture of residential, retail,
industrial and recreational land as well as fields
and forests. Development on Green Belts is only
permitted under exceptional circumstances.
In 2003, there were 14 separate designated Green
Belt areas in England, amounting to 16,700 square
kilometres (about 13 per cent of the land area).
This is an increase of 190 square kilometres since
1997. The Sustainable Communities Plan (see page
304) includes a government commitment to
maintain or increase the area of land designated
as Green Belt in each English region.
In Scotland there are seven Green Belt areas
totalling 1,590 square kilometres. A further three
are approved in principle at St Andrews,
Dunfermline and Perth. Following research
showing a high degree of support for Green Belts,
a new SPP is being prepared and will be published
in draff form in 2005.
There are 2,450 square kilometres of Green Belt
in Northern Ireland, about 18 per cent of the total
land area. There are no Green Belts at present in
Wales, but their creation is under consideration.
Regeneration
Regeneration policies aim to enhance both the
economic and social development of communities
through a partnership between the public and
private sectors, with a substantial contribution
from the latter. They support and complement
other programmes tackling social and economic
decline, and initiatives such as Sure Start (see page
167), the Crime and Disorder Reduction
Partnerships (see page 206) and the work of the
Social Exclusion Unit (see page 112). Run-down
areas in the United Kingdom benefit from
European Union (EU) Structural Funds, which
assist a variety of projects in the least prosperous
industrial, urban and rural areas of the EU. Over
£10 billion of Structural Funds, including £3
billion covering Objective 1 areas (see page 358),
have been allocated to the United Kingdom for the
period 2000-06.
England
In England, the nine Regional Development
Agencies (RDAs, see page 13) set out priorities for
regeneration and ensure that new programmes
enhance and complement those already in place.
RDA strategies, alongside RPG overseen by GOs,
provide a regional framework for economic
development and regeneration.
The Department of Trade and Industry is the lead
sponsor of the RDAs, with the GOs responsible for
day-to-day issues. The ODPM, with a number of
other departments, is responsible for financing
RDAs and ensures that they consider regeneration
when implementing their regional strategies. RDAs
will support regeneration schemes from a single
budget worth £2 billion in 2005/06. They are
required to deliver targets set collectively by
government departments.
English Partnerships (EP) is sponsored by the
ODPM. EP and the RDAs form the Government’s
main regeneration agencies. EP is a key
contributor to delivering the Sustainable
Communities Plan (see page 304) and seeks to
create new jobs and investment through
sustainable economic regeneration and
development in the English regions. EP’s funding
programme increased from £163 million in
2003/04 to £179 million in 2004/05 and 2005/06.
EP has responsibility for: the Greenwich Peninsula;
the National Coalfields Programme; Millennium
Communities; support for urban regeneration
companies (URCs, see page 320); the English
Cities Fund; the National Land Use Database; the
production and maintenance of a national
brownfield strategy; and a register of surplus
public sector land. It worked alongside the
Forestry Commission and the Environment
Agency to create a Land Restoration Trust,
operating from 2004, to provide for the long-term
sustainable management of cleaner and safer
public open space and forestry across England.

Neighbourhood renewal
In 2001, New Commitment to Neighbourhood
Renewal: A National Strategy Action Plan set out
the Government’s plans for delivering economic
prosperity, safe communities, high-quality
education, decent housing and better health to the
poorest parts of the country. At the national level
the plan is implemented by the Neighbourhood
Renewal Unit in the ODPM.
Funding is provided through a number of
programmes, including the Neighbourhood
Renewal Fund (NRF) and the New Deal for
Communities. By 2008, the NRF will have
provided £2.9 billion extra resources for 88 of the
most deprived local authority districts in England.
New Deal for Communities has been operating
since 1998 and since 1999 has covered 39
neighbourhoods across England. It is a ten-year
programme with funding of £2 billion. In each
area, partnerships have been established between
local communities, service providers and other
agencies. Each partnership covers a
neighbourhood of between 1,000 and 4,000
households and has between £30 million and
£60 million to spend over ten years.
Urban renaissance
In February 2004 the Government announced
measures to bring about a renaissance in cities in
the North of England and to spread growth into
the wider regional economy. Making it Happen:
The Northern Way contains plans to develop the
concept of a ‘Northern Growth Corridor and to
work with RDAs and regional planning bodies to
make the most of the transport infrastructure and
to bring economic performance in the North up to
the national average. The Government is providing
finance through the Elousing Market Pathfinder
Fund, the Coalfields Enterprise Fund, and money
for urban parks and green spaces.
A Tale of Eight Cities, published in April 2004,
reported on progress in revitalising the eight core
English cities: Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds,
Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham
and Sheffield. A full report is planned in 2005.
Urban regeneration companies
The first URCs were formed in England in 1999.
They are independent partnerships established by
local authorities, RDAs, EP and the private sector
to produce strategies on physical and economic
regeneration. Although the emphasis is on physical
and economic regeneration, each URC has
produced a strategy that covers more, and that
reflects local circumstances. By May 2004 16 URCs
had been established in England, and one each in
Wales and Northern Ireland. Three URCs were
announced in Scotland in June 2004.
Parks and open spaces
Published in 2002, Living Places - Cleaner, Safer,
Greener, highlighted litter, graffiti and fear of
crime as the reasons people do not always make
use of public spaces. These issues are the subject of
a five-year improvement programme. Additionally,
in February 2003, the Government announced
funding of £201 million to improve parks and
public spaces. The Commission for Architecture
and the Built Environment (CABE) is receiving
£18 million of this funding over three years; part
has been used to set up a green spaces unit (CABE
space) with the aim of ensuring good quality
design, management and maintenance of public
spaces.
Rural regeneration
Although most problems arising from dereliction
and unemployment occur in urban areas, some
rural areas have also been affected by declining
employment in traditional sectors such as mining,
agriculture and defence establishments. Even in
areas that appear relatively prosperous, some
individuals are disadvantaged by poor local
services, poor public transport and low wages or
seasonal unemployment.
The RDAs outside London are responsible for
rural regeneration. The Countryside Agency (see
also page 280) promotes and advises on
conserving and enhancing the countryside, on
access to the countryside for recreation, and on the
economic and social development of England s
rural areas. It also administers a number of grants
designed to help meet village needs for transport,
shops or other services.
Wales
Following the reduction in steelmaking capacity
and consequent redundancies, announced in 2001,
the Welsh Assembly Government provided
funding of £76 million to help stimulate the
regeneration of the affected communities. Projects
include the reopening of the Ebbw Vale railway
line to passengers, a Community Learning
Network and a URC for Newport.

Wales is receiving up to £1.3 billion from the EU
to fund a variety of programmes until 2006. These
include Objective 1 Funds (see page 358) for West
Wales and the Valleys. By March 2004 some £700
million had been allocated to over 1,000 projects
in Wales. The programmes are aimed at
developing a stronger, more sustainable economy,
better infrastructure, a more highly skilled
workforce, and the regeneration of urban and
rural communities.
Communities First is an area-based regeneration
programme in the 100 most deprived electoral
wards, and in other communities with pockets of
deprivation. The programme emphasises the
involvement of local people in decision-making
through a community-based partnership. The
Welsh Assembly Government has allocated
£152 million to this programme between 2001 and
2006.
The Welsh Development Agency’s (WDA’s)
regeneration programmes include physical and
environmental regeneration activities, such as land
reclamation and environmental improvements;
activities to provide site development work to
assist with business infrastructure; and support for
community initiatives, such as the Market Towns
Initiative and the Small Towns and Villages
programmes.
North Pembrokeshire and South
Ceredigion
The North Pembrokeshire and South Ceredigion
Regeneration Plans were announced in March
2003. Both areas suffered major job losses with
the closures in 2002 of clothing factories in
Fishguard and Cardigan. The plans aim to boost
the long-term prosperity of the area, and are
being taken forward by a range of public and
private sector partners including Pembrokeshire
and Ceredigion County Councils, the WDA,
Education and Learning Wales, the Welsh Tourist
Board and local business and community groups.
In total, £60 million, including £10 million from
the Welsh Assembly, will be invested over three
years. The plans include the redevelopment of
Fishguard and Cardigan town centres and the
establishment of a research and technology park
at Aberporth.
Scotland
The Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP), established
in 1999, involves 48 local partnerships tackling the
problems that disadvantaged groups and
communities face across Scotland. The SIPs are
multi-agency partnerships, consisting of all
relevant local public agencies, the voluntary and
private sectors, and representatives from the
community. They were supported over three years
from 2001/02 by £169 million from the Social
Inclusion Partnership Fund. From March 2005,
SIPs will be integrated with Community Planning
Partnerships.
Scottish Enterprise is the main economic
development agency for lowland Scotland. It
consists of a national office and 12 local enterprise
companies. Highlands and Islands Enterprise and
its ten local enterprise companies cover the rest of
Scotland. Communities Scotland (see page 309)
also has a responsibility for regeneration. It works
closely with a number of partners, in particular
local authorities.
Northern Ireland
The Department for Social Development (DSD)
has a lead role in addressing social need and social
inclusion in Northern Ireland. It does this through
its main business areas - housing, social security,
child support, urban regeneration and community
development - using a combination of public and
private sector investment as well as contributions
from EU Structural Funds (see page 357) and the
International Fund for Ireland.
Physical development schemes are the main
elements of urban regeneration policy in Northern
Ireland. Frequently used initiatives are:
■ Urban Development Grants, which aim to
encourage physical and economic
regeneration in targeted areas and seek to
promote job creation, inward investment and
environmental improvement through the
development of vacant, derelict or underused
land and buildings;
■ Comprehensive Development Schemes, which
contribute to the regeneration of
disadvantaged areas through development or
redevelopment; and
■ Environmental Improvement Schemes, which
help to improve the appearance of public
spaces in town and city centres across
Northern Ireland.

British residents travelled on average 11,000
kilometres within Great Britain in 2003, 53 per
cent further than in the early 1970s. Although the
number of trips' has increased slightly - from 956
a year in 1972/1973 to 990 in 2003 - the average
trip length has grown by almost 50 per cent, from
7.6 kilometres to 11.1 kilometres. In Northern
Ireland, residents travelled on average about 9,310
kilometres in 2001-2003, each person making an
average of 960 journeys every year.
Travel by car or van accounts for the majority of
passenger mileage in Great Britain - 85 per cent
in 2002 (Table 21.1). In 2003, 46 per cent of
households had access to one car, 26 per cent to
two or more cars, whereas 27 per cent had no car.
In Northern Ireland, 83 per cent of the total
distance travelled was by car or van in 2001-2003:
44 per cent of households had access to one car, 29
per cent to two or more cars, while 27 per cent had
no car.
Leisure was the most common reason for travel in
Great Britain in 2003, accounting for 31 per cent of
all trips and 41 per cent of total distance travelled.
Shopping accounted for 20 per cent of trips and
12 per cent of total distance travelled, while
commuting accounted for 15 per cent of trips but
19 per cent of distance travelled. In Northern
Ireland, leisure accounted for 26 per cent of all
journeys made and 31 per cent of the total distance
travelled in 2001-2003. Shopping represented
20 per cent of journeys and 15 per cent of total
distance travelled, while for commuting and
business travel the figures were 19 and 29 per cent,
respectively. There have been reductions in the
fatality rates of accidents involving most forms of
transport since the 1980s (Table 21.2).
1 A trip is defined as a one-way course of travel having a single
main purpose. Outward and return halves of a return trip are
treated as two separate trips. A trip cannot have two separate
purposes, so if this involves a mid-way change of purpose then it
is split into two trips.

Roads
The length of the road network in Great Britain
in 2003 was 392,321 kilometres. Motorways
accounted for 3,476 kilometres (0.9 per cent of
the total), and trunk roads (which have been
affected in England since 2001 by the ‘detrunking’
programme) for 9,340 kilometres, or 2.4 per cent.
However, motorways carried 19 per cent of all
traffic, and trunk roads another 14 per cent.
Combined, they carried 62 per cent of all goods
vehicle traffic in Great Britain. In Northern
Ireland the road network totalled 24,887
kilometres in April 2004, of which 114 were
motorway.

Motor vehicles
The number of licensed vehicles on Great Britain’s
roads at the end of 2003 was 31.2 million, an
increase of 2.1 per cent on 2002, with private cars
accounting for 80 per cent of the total (Table
21.3) . There were 794,000 licensed vehicles on
Northern Ireland roads at the end of 2002, a
3.3 per cent increase on 2001.
Despite the increase in the number of cars in
recent years, in 2001 there were fewer passenger
cars per 1,000 population in the United Kingdom
than the European Union (EU) average (Figure
21.4) - 464 compared with 488.

Driver and vehicle licensing
The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Great
Britain and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern
Ireland are responsible for issuing driving licences
and for registering and licensing vehicles. All
vehicles must be licensed before they can be driven
on public roads and drivers must hold either a full
or (in the case of learner drivers) a provisional
licence. There were 32.1 million driving licence
holders in Great Britain in 2002, representing
71 per cent of all adults.
Driving standards
Driving tests in Great Britain are conducted by the
Driving Standards Agency (DSA), the national
driver testing authority. In 2002/03, 1.3 million car
tests were conducted. To obtain a full driving
licence, new drivers of motor vehicles must pass
a computer-based touch screen theory test and a
practical test. The pass rate for the driving test has
fallen, from 50 per cent in 1992 to 43 per cent in
2002/03. The DSA also supervises a statutory
register for approved driving instructors,
compulsory basic training for all learner moped
and motorcyclists, and a voluntary register for
instructors of large goods vehicles. In Northern
Ireland, the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency
(DVTA) is responsible for driving tests. Almost
50,000 tests were taken in 2002/03, with an overall

100th anniversary of registration and
licences
The Motor Car Act 1903, which came into force
on 1 January 1904, required all motor vehicles in
the United Kingdom to be registered and to carry
number plates, displayed in a prominent position,
and for all drivers to be licensed annually. County
councils and county borough councils were made
registration and licensing authorities. The vehicle
registration fee was 20 shillings (£1) and the
driver's licence fee 5 shillings (25p).
v J
pass rate of 48 per cent. For the theory test, the
pass rate was 68 per cent.
The minimum ages for driving in the United
Kingdom range from 16 for invalid carriages and
mopeds to 21 for medium/large sized vehicles,
minibuses and buses.
Vehicle standards
Before most new cars and goods vehicles are
allowed on the roads, they must meet safety and
environmental requirements, based primarily on
standards drawn up by the EU. The Vehicle
Certification Agency is responsible for ensuring
these requirements are met through a process
known as ‘type approval’.
Vehicles are subject to annual roadworthiness,
or ‘MOT’, tests, which in Great Britain are the
responsibility of the Vehicle and Operator Service
Agency (VOSA). VOSA also uses roadside and
other enforcement checks to ensure that drivers
and vehicle operators comply with legislation.
In Northern Ireland the DVTA is responsible for
vehicle testing.
New vehicle and fuel technologies
Road transport accounts for around 85 per cent
of the transport sector’s carbon emissions, which
in turn account for about 21 per cent of total
UK emissions. The Powering Future Vehicles
(PFV) strategy, launched by the Government in
2002, and the 2003 energy White Paper, Our
energy future - creating a low carbon economy
(see chapter 28), both seek to reduce the negative
effects of traffic.
The PFV strategy sets out the twin objectives of
promoting the development, introduction and
take-up of low-carbon vehicles and fuels, and
ensuring the involvement of industry in the new
technologies. It also sets government targets for sales
of low-carbon vehicles. The strategy provides fiscal
and grant incentives for consumer and business
take-up of cleaner, more efficient vehicles and fuels;
and research, development and demonstration
funding for new technologies. The Energy White
Paper built on this strategy, highlighting the
significant contribution that vehicle and fuel
technologies, such as renewable hydrogen and
biomass-based fuels, could make to long-term
reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide.
Traffic and congestion
Road traffic is one of the Government’s headline
indicators of sustainable development (see page
114). In 2003 motor vehicle traffic levels in Great
Britain were an estimated 0.8 per cent higher than
in 2002, reaching 490 billion vehicle-kilometres
(Table 21.5). Figure 21.6 shows road traffic by
vehicle type. Since 1993 total motor vehicle traffic
volumes have increased by nearly 19 per cent.
Road traffic intensity, however, fell by 12 per cent
between 1990 and 2003.
The Department for Transport (DfT) has been
improving its congestion monitoring capability
through developing more detailed and varied
data sources. Journey time information is being
gathered from a variety of data sources, such as
MIDAS induction loops on the most congested
motorways, TrafficMaster Automatic Number
Plate Recognition cameras on all-purpose trunk
roads, roadside sensors, and data from global
positioning systems (GPS) tracking devices in
vehicles. The data sources being developed will

enable the DfT to produce detailed reports on the
pattern and location of congestion, identify
congestion hot-spots and assess the impact of
efforts to tackle the problems. The information
will be available for use by the DfT, the Highways
Agency (see page 331), Transport Direct (see
under traffic information) and local authorities.
Traffic management schemes aim to reduce
congestion by means of bus lanes and other bus
priority measures, ‘red routes’ with special stopping
controls, and parking controls. The DfT is
developing indicators of congestion taking into
account delay, journey time reliability and severe
congestion. Targets based on these indicators will be
in place by July 2005. The Traffic Management Act
2004 creates measures to tackle congestion caused
by incidents on motorways and badly managed
work by utility companies and local authorities.
The Act will help local councils and the Highways
Agency to manage roads more effectively, and cut
out some of the unnecessary disruption that holds
up people’s journeys.
Congestion charging
Under the Transport Act 2000, local authorities in
England and Wales can introduce road user
charging or workplace parking levy schemes to
help manage congestion. For at least the first ten
years of a scheme, the net revenue must be used to
fund local transport improvements. Authorities
must consult local people and businesses, make
improvements to local transport and obtain
ministerial approval before a scheme can start.
The first UK congestion charging scheme began in
2002, in the historic centre of Durham. After one
year’s operation, vehicle traffic in the zone had
fallen by 85 per cent. The revenue is being used
to fund improvements to the city’s bus services.
The Mayor of London introduced a congestion
charging scheme in central London in 2003. The
charging zone covers 21 square kilometres, with
174 entry and exit points around its boundary.
Extension of the scheme to parts of west London
is under consideration.
After the first year of operation:
■ there were some 110,000 congestion payments
a day;
■ congestion within the zone had fallen by
30 per cent, meeting the original aim of the
scheme;
■ traffic levels entering the zone had fallen by
18 per cent during charging hours, with a
33 per cent reduction for cars;
■ disruption to bus services in and around the
charging zone had fallen by up to 60 per cent;
and
■ there had been a year-on-year increase of
29,000 bus passengers entering the zone
during the morning peak period.
Traffic information
The Highways Agency’s national Traffic Control
Centre (TCC), based in Birmingham, became
operational in 2004. It collects information on the
strategic road network, setting the on-road
variable message signs to give drivers route advice,
and keeping the travel news on radio, television,
the Internet and other organisations updated in
real time. During 2004, further services were
added including the relaunch of the Highways
Agency’s website (www.highways.gov.uk) and the
introduction of a real time traffic information site
called Traffic England. An automated telephone
service is also planned to provide the latest
information on traffic conditions across the
strategic road network. Transport Direct, a
comprehensive, user-friendly travel information
service, is due to be formally launched towards the
end of 2004. It will provide travellers with
integrated travel planning, live travel news and
links to Internet retailers and ticketing services.

UK 2005
21 Transport
The initial service will cover travel by car, train,
coach, bus and tram, and domestic flights, with
walking links between interchanges. Further
enhancements are planned. Under a three-year
contract worth £15 million, an Atos Origin-led
consortium is responsible for overall project
management including the design, build and
managed service operation of the portal.
In Northern Ireland, the Roads Service, an
executive agency of the Department for Regional
Development, operates the Traffic Information
and Control Centre, providing real time and travel
information, and strategic management and
control of traffic on both urban and inter-urban
networks.
Road safety
The number of people killed on roads in Great
Britain was 2 per cent higher in 2003 than in 2002,
but 2 per cent lower than the baseline average for
1994-98 (Table 21.7). The number of people
seriously injured in 2003 was 6 per cent lower
than in 2002 and 24 per cent lower than in
1994-98.

Northern Ireland has the highest rate of road
traffic accident casualties in the United Kingdom.
In 2002 the rate per 100,000 population was 702,
compared with rates of 543, 490 and 381
respectively in England, Wales and Scotland.
In 2002/03, 158 people were killed on roads in
Northern Ireland, five more than in 2001/02;
however, the number of people seriously injured
was 1,487, 9 per cent fewer than in 2001/02.
Total casualties fell by 8 per cent in 2002/03
to 11,546 and road traffic injury accidents
by 8 per cent to 6,569.
Government targets for improving road safety
by 2010, compared with the average level for
1994-98, are:
■ a 40 per cent reduction in the number of
people killed or seriously injured in road
accidents;
■ a 50 per cent reduction in the number of
children killed or seriously injured; and
■ a 10 per cent reduction in the slight casualty
rate (expressed as the number of people
slightly injured per 100 million vehicle-
kilometres).
To help meet these targets, more 20 mph (32km/h)
zones around schools and in residential areas have
been created and road safety education is
provided, for example through a network of child
pedestrian training schemes.
Home Zones are residential streets where the road
space is shared between drivers of motor vehicles
and other road users, with the wider needs of
residents (including people who walk or cycle, and
children) in mind. Their aim is to change the way
that streets are used and to improve the quality of
life for local residents by making them for people
as well as for traffic. There were initially eight pilot
projects in England, one in Wales, four in Scotland
and one in Northern Ireland. Subsequently,
a £30 million Home Zones Challenge fund was
established in England in April 2001 and 61
schemes were selected from 237 bids received in
January 2002. These included wholly new zones
as well as extensions to the pilot schemes.
The ‘Dealing with Disadvantage’ initiative forms
part of the Government’s response to the revised
target set to reduce road deaths in areas of social
exclusion. For the first phase of the project in
2002, ten authorities were selected in the Greater
Manchester area that have particularly acute child
pedestrian accident problems, and are classified as
deprived districts according to Neighbourhood
Renewal Unit (see page 320). Comprehensive
strategies are being developed to reduce casualty
rates in disadvantaged areas faster than across the
local authority as a whole. Authorities have been
encouraged to consider broad-based solutions and
to work in partnership with a range of local
interested parties. Funding of £17.6 million was
made available nationally over three years.
Under the first phase of an EC Directive, new cars
and car-derived vans up to 2.5 tonnes will need to
327
21 Transport
UK 2005
have approved pedestrian protection from 2005.
They will be subjected to a series of technical tests
which would indicate how they would interact
with a pedestrian in an accident. Further measures
are expected to apply to new models from 2010.
The aim of the Directive is to reduce serious and
fatal pedestrian injuries by up to 20 per cent, once
both phases have been fully implemented.
Motoring offences
Police, traffic wardens and parking attendants
dealt with a record 11.8 million motoring offences
in England and Wales during 2002, 11 per cent
higher than in 2001. This represented 425 offences
per 1,000 licensed vehicles, compared with 343 per
1,000 in 1992. The previous highest rate over the
last decade was in 1997, at 403 per 1,000 vehicles.
Of the total offences in 2002, 55 per cent were
penalty charge notices issued by local authority
parking attendants, 26 per cent were fixed penalty
notices issued by the police (including traffic
wardens) while a further 18 per cent were dealt
with by court proceedings.
Obstruction, waiting and parking offences
together accounted for 7.6 million offences in
2002, while speed limit offences accounted for
1.7 million.
Traffic cameras provided evidence for 1.5 million
motoring offences dealt with in England and Wales
in 2002, 40 per cent higher than in 2001, of which
94 per cent were speeding offences. Research carried
out for the DfT suggests that between April 2000
and March 2002 there was an average 35 per cent
reduction in people killed or seriously injured in
road accidents at sites where speed cameras were
in operation. The number of vehicles speeding at
camera sites was on average 67 per cent lower than
at comparable sites without cameras.
Road haulage
Most freight in Great Britain is carried by road,
which in 2002 accounted for 82 per cent of goods
by tonnage and 62 per cent in terms of tonne-
kilometres.
An operator’s licence is required for heavy goods
vehicles (HGVs) in the United Kingdom - these
are vehicles over 3.5 tonnes gross weight. There
were 426,000 licensed HGVs in Great Britain at
the end of 2003, 16 per cent of which had gross
weight of over 38 tonnes. About 84 per cent of the
105,000 operator licences in issue are for fleets of
five or fewer vehicles. In Northern Ireland, 20,000
HGVs were registered in 2002.
Freight traffic by HGVs in Great Britain amounted
to 152 billion tonne-kilometres in 2003, the same
as in 1998, but 18 per cent higher than in 1993.
By commodity, 28 per cent of this traffic was
identified as food, drink and tobacco. Road
hauliers are tending to use larger vehicles carrying
heavier loads - 88 per cent of traffic (tonne-
kilometres) in 2003 was moved by vehicles of over
25 tonnes gross weight. In Northern Ireland,
freight traffic by HGVs in 2002 amounted to over
48 million tonnes, up almost 7 million tonnes
since 1998.
International road haulage has continued to grow
steadily. In 2003 almost 2.6 million road goods
vehicles or unaccompanied trailers - 471,000 of
which were powered vehicles registered in the
United Kingdom - travelled to mainland Europe
by ferry or the Channel Tunnel, 2.6 per cent more
than in 2002. Almost 60 per cent of traffic was
from Dover Strait ports (Dover, Folkestone,
Ramsgate and the Channel Tunnel), with a further
34 per cent from North Sea ports. In total,
international road haulage by UK-registered HGVs
amounted to 11.7 billion tonne-kilometres in
2003, 94 per cent of which was with the EU.
The Government’s aims for the freight industry
are to facilitate the continuing development of a
competitive and efficient sector, while reducing the
impact that moving freight has on congestion and
the environment. This includes encouraging
freight traffic to be shifted from road to rail or
water where this makes sense, offering financial
support where appropriate. Water freight grants
are designed to encourage a shift of freight
currently travelling by road to water, or to prevent
freight on water from switching to road. The
grants assist companies with the costs of new
or improved freight handling facilities or other
capital investments.
Bus and coach services
In 2002/03 travel on buses and coaches in Great
Britain increased by 1 per cent to 46.9 billion
passenger-kilometres - 22.9 billion were on local
buses and 24.0 billion on non-local buses and
coaches. Over 4.4 billion passenger journeys were
made on local bus services, 3 per cent more than
in the previous year and 5 per cent above the low
point of 4.2 billion in 1998/99. The number of bus
328
UK 2005
21 Transport
passenger journeys in London has grown
substantially since the mid-1990s, reaching 1.5
billion in 2002/03, an 8 per cent increase on the
previous year, 21 per cent higher than in 1998/99
and 38 per cent higher than in 1993/94. Nearly 35
per cent of all passenger journeys on local buses
occurred in London. Outside London, however,
there was a slight fall in the number of passenger
journeys in England in 2002/03. There was
increased bus use in the rest of the United
Kingdom in 2002/03. In Scotland, passenger
journeys rose by 1 per cent to 445 million, in
Wales, they grew by 5 per cent to 109 million, and
in Northern Ireland, 66 million bus passenger
journeys were made, 1 per cent more than in the
previous year.
The Government’s target for local public transport
use (buses and light rail) in England, as amended
by the 2004 Spending Review, is to increase use by
more than 12 per cent from 2000 levels by 2010,
with growth in every region.
In 2002/03 there were 16,400 double-deck buses in
the Public Service Vehicle (PSV) fleet in Great
Britain, 22 per cent fewer than in 1992/93 and
32 per cent fewer than in 1987/88, although there
was a small increase of 400 in 2002/03. The
number of single-deck buses also increased slightly
to 43,200. Vehicles of low-floor design accounted
for 14,100 PS Vs in 2002/03 compared with only
5,100 five years earlier. There were 19,700 coaches
in stock. In Northern Ireland there were around
1,450 buses in service with ‘Translink’ in
2002/03.
Operators
Almost all bus services in Great Britain are
provided by private sector concerns, apart from 17
local authority owned bus companies. Transport
for London (TfL) coordinates bus sevices in the
capital and manages over 700 bus routes operated
by about 25 private sector companies under
contract as well as its own bus company, trading as
East Thames Buses.
The five largest bus operators in Great Britain also
run rail services and some have expanded into
transport services in mainland Europe as well as in
North America, Australia and New Zealand.
In Northern Ireland almost all road passenger
services are operated by subsidiaries of the
publicly owned Northern Ireland Transport
Holding Company (NITHC), under the brand
name ‘Translink’. Citybus operates services in
Belfast, with Ulsterbus running most of the
services in the rest of Northern Ireland.
Services
Most local bus services are provided commercially,
although local authorities may subsidise services
that are not commercially viable but are
considered socially necessary, such as those
operating in the evenings and on Sundays. Outside
London, nearly 19 per cent of local bus services in
Great Britain (in terms of vehicle-kilometres
operated) were subsidised in 2002/03. Local bus
fares in Great Britain increased by 1 per cent in
real terms (after allowing for inflation) in 2002-03.
Average fares in London, however, fell by 4 per
cent as TfL maintained its flat-fare structure with
no fare rises in real terms. Overall, bus fares have
risen by 19 per cent in Great Britain over the ten
years to 2002/03, while those in London have risen
by 7 per cent.
Local authorities in England and Wales are
required to develop bus strategies as part of their
Local Transport Plans (LTPs, see page 342).
Outside London, statutory backing also exists for
‘bus quality partnerships’ and ‘quality contracts’
between local authorities and bus operators.
Authorities have powers to promote joint ticketing
and to work with Train Operating Companies on
bus/rail ticketing. In Scotland, local authorities are
expected to set out their plans for bus services in
their Local Transport Strategies.
Bus priority measures, such as bus lanes, are
becoming more extensive, and in some areas
guided busways (with buses travelling on
segregated track) are being adopted. Park and ride
schemes - in which car users park on the outskirts
of towns and travel by bus to the centre - are
increasingly being used to relieve congestion, with
around 70 new or improved schemes envisaged in
England in the period 2003/04 to 2005/06.
A number of schemes provide funds for
improving local bus services. The Rural Bus
Subsidy Grant (RBSG) in England has funding of
£51 million for 2004/05. Introduced in 1998/99, it
supported around 2,000 rural bus services in 2004
and can be used to operate new and enhanced
services in rural areas with populations of less
than 25,000. The Welsh Assembly Government is
allocating more than £8 million to local
authorities in 2003/04 under its Local Transport
329
21 Transport
UK 2005
Services Grant to increase the number and range
of subsidised bus services and to support
community transport projects, while in Scotland,
the Executive’s Rural Transport Fund has provided
for over 400 new or improved rural bus services
since its introduction in 1998/99.
In January 2004 the annual Rural Bus Challenge,
in which local authorities bid for project funding,
resulted in awards totalling £20 million to 42
projects proposed by local authorities throughout
rural England, while the Urban Bus Challenge
competition also awarded £20 million to 40 urban
schemes, in order to help tackle urban deprivation
and social exclusion.
Local authorities in England are required by law to
offer, as a minimum, half-price bus travel
concessionary schemes for the elderly and disabled.
Nearly all (94 per cent in 2001) offered a half-fare
concessionary scheme. The remainder either had
flat-fare schemes or schemes offering free travel,
such as in London. Local authorities generally
require proof of residency in the area before issuing
a concessionary fare permit. Travel on local bus
services in Wales is free for pensioners and disabled
people, while in Scotland, there is a national
minimum standard of free off-peak local bus fares
for elderly and disabled people. Travel on public
transport in Northern Ireland is free for blind
people and for everyone over the age of 65, while
people with a range of specified disabilities travel
at half fare. Concessionary fare reimbursement
for local bus services in Great Britain amounted
to £495 million in 2002/03, compared with
£2,599 million in payments by passengers.
Coaches account for much of the non-local
mileage operated by PSVs, which in total
amounted to 1,590 million vehicle-kilometres in
2001/02. Organised coach tours and holiday
journeys account for about 60 per cent of coach
travel in Great Britain. High-frequency scheduled
services, run by private sector operators, link many
towns and cities, and commuter services run into
London and some other major centres each
weekday. National Express has the only scheduled
national coach network. It carries more than
12 million passengers every year to over 1,200
destinations throughout Great Britain.
Taxis and private hire vehicles
There were an estimated 72,500 licensed taxis in
Great Britain at the end of 2002, and 6,900 in
Northern Ireland. In London (which has over
20,000 ‘black cab’ taxis) and several other major
cities, taxis must be purpose-built to conform to
strict requirements. In many districts, taxi drivers
have to pass a test of their knowledge of the area.
Private hire vehicles (PHVs or ‘minicabs’) have
increased in number in recent years and there were
an estimated 89,000 PHVs in Great Britain, and
around 2,500 in Northern Ireland in 2002. PHVs
can only be pre-booked through a licensed
operator and cannot ply for hire in the street. In
London, the role of the Public Carriage Office
(PCO) has been extended to include the licensing
of private hire operators, drivers and vehicles as a
result of the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act
1998, implementation of which began in January
2001. Over 2,000 operators have applied for
licences and it is estimated that there are about
40,000 drivers and a similar number of vehicles.
All PHV drivers now have to meet PCO licensing
standards to trade legally in the capital.
Cycling and motorcycling
After decades of decline, the use of two-wheeled
transport in Great Britain has stabilised, albeit at
a low level. In 2002, motorcycles and pedal cycles
each accounted for 1 per cent of total passenger-
kilometres travelled in Great Britain. Following a
revival of interest in motorcycling, the number of
licensed motorcycles, scooters and mopeds was
just over 1 million at the end of 2003. This was the
highest figure since 1986 and compares with a low
of 594,000 in 1995. Northern Ireland had 17,600
licensed motorcycles, scooters and mopeds at the
end of 2002.
The National Cycle Network, including links,
provided over 13,000 kilometres of cycling and
walking routes throughout the United Kingdom in
2003. By 2005 this will be extended to 16,000
kilometres. About one-third of the Network is on
paths that are free from motor traffic, with the
remainder using quiet lanes or traffic-calmed
roads in towns and cities. An estimated 126
million trips were made on the Network in 2003,
representing a year-on-year increase of 10 per cent
in cycle use. Around 46 per cent of users were
cyclists and 53 per cent pedestrians. The network
is coordinated by the transport charity Sustrans.
Walking
People in the United Kingdom are walking less
than in the past, with fewer journeys on foot and
330
UK 2005
21 Transport
many more by car. The UK Government and
devolved administrations wish to reverse this
trend, and expect local authorities to give more
priority to walking. Almost all local authorities
include walking strategies in their LTPs and
Strategies (see page 342). Many have set targets to
encourage walking by means of a variety of
initiatives, for example improving pavement and
footway maintenance, removing obstructions,
improving pedestrian crossings and creating 20
mph (32 km/h) zones.
The average distance walked per person in Great
Britain in 2003 was 309 kilometres, a 3 per cent
fall from the figure in 1992/1994, and now
accounts for 2.8 per cent of the total distance
travelled. The number of walking trips per person
in 2003 was 245 - 172 of these were under 1.6
kilometres - averaging just over 1 kilometre per
trip; this compares with 306 trips with an average
length of just under 1 kilometre in 1992/1994.
Since 1992/1994 the proportion of primary-aged
children walking to school has declined from 61
to 53 per cent, with an increase from 30 to 39 per
cent in the numbers being driven to school. For
secondary school pupils there was a similar shift
from walking to car use.
Safe routes to school projects
(www.saferoutestoschool.org.uk) aim to make it
easier for children to walk and cycle to school.
They combine practical measures, such as
redesigns of roadspace to provide for cyclists and
pedestrians and 20 mph speed limits near schools,
with educational measures, for example cycle
training for children, and an emphasis on the
health benefits of walking and cycling.
The road programme
The Highways Agency is an executive agency of the
DfT and is responsible for operating, maintaining
and improving the road network of motorways
and trunk roads in England. In London,
responsibility for all major roads except
motorways lies with the Greater London Authority
(see page 10). In Wales and Scotland,
responsibility for the motorway and trunk road
network rests with the devolved administrations.
The Highways Agency managed 8,255 kilometres
of motorway and trunk roads in 2003/04. This
figure is declining and reflects the ongoing transfer
of‘non-core’ roads - those carrying mainly local
traffic - to local highway authorities, a process
which is expected to be completed by March 2006.
In addition, local authorities have a budget of
£2.7 billion in 2004/05 for maintaining non-trunk
roads. The Welsh Assembly Government is the
highway authority for 1,708 kilometres of
motorways and trunk roads in Wales. Three major
projects are due for completion in 2004/05. In
Scotland, the motorway and trunk road network
extends to almost 3,500 kilometres, around 6 per
cent of the total road network, but carries almost
a third of the total vehicle mileage. The motorway
and trunk road programme for 2004/05 will cost
£254 million for a number of major improvement
projects, including the completion of the M74 in
Glasgow, trunk road maintenance and structural
repairs.
The Highways Agency’s 2004/05 programme
includes expenditure of £730 million on
maintaining the network and £508 million on
major improvements to the network. A £5.5 billion
package of major national and local transport
measures was announced for England in
December 2002. A further £7 billion (£4 billion of
which is allocated ten-year plan money - see page
342) of funding for improvements to some of
England’s most congested roads was announced in
July 2003. This funding is intended to ensure that
better use is made of existing roads, for example
by building new capacity along particularly busy
stretches and making improvements to public
transport. Key elements include widening sections
of the M25, Ml and M6 motorways.
The M6 Toll, the first toll motorway in the United
Kingdom, opened in December 2003. Operated by
Midland Expressway, a private sector company, the
43-kilometre, three-lane road bypasses the busiest
section of the existing M6 in the West Midlands,
one of the most congested roads in Western
Europe. Average daily traffic was over 55,000
vehicles by July 2004. In August 2004, the Toll road
reached its landmark 10 millionth customer
triggering the end to introductory discounted toll
rates. A new option for relieving congestion on the
M6 between Birmingham and Manchester in the
form of a second toll Expressway, as an alternative
to widening the M6, was announced in July 2004.
Railways
Network Rail is responsible for operating all
railway track and infrastructure in Great Britain.
It owns and maintains 34,000 kilometres of track
331
21 Transport
UK 2005
used by the train and freight operating companies.
Its assets also include 40,000 bridges and tunnels,
2,500 stations, 1,000 signal boxes and 9,000 level
crossings. It is a company limited by guarantee,
that is, a private company operating along
commercial lines, but without shareholders.
It aims to make surpluses from its operations that
are reinvested into maintaining and upgrading the
rail infrastructure. Northern Ireland Railways,
operating as part of the Translink brand, serves
58 passenger stations and operates a network of
about 342 kilometres of track.
Most railway services in the United Kingdom are
operated by the private sector, although Northern
Ireland Railways is a wholly owned subsidiary of
the NITHC (see page 329). Apart from 17 major
stations operated directly by Network Rail, nearly
all stations and passenger depots are leased to the
25 passenger Train Operating Companies (TOCs)
that run passenger services under franchise. There
are also a number of small open-access operators,
such as Hull Trains, running passenger services not
provided under franchise agreements. Franchise
lengths vary from two to fifteen years. The
standard duration of new franchises is seven to ten
years. Most of the TOC franchisees are large
transport concerns also operating bus and coach
services (see page 329).
The TOCs, such as Virgin West Coast/
Crosscountry, Midland Mainline and ScotRail,
lease their rolling stock from three rolling stock
companies: Angel Trains, HSBC Rail and
Porterbrook Leasing. Freight services are run by
four companies (see page 334), and there are a
number of infrastructure maintenance companies.
Rail regulation and strategy
Great Britain’s railways are currently regulated by
two organisations: the Strategic Rail Authority
(SRA) and the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR).
The two bodies have common statutory purposes
but different powers to achieve them. The SRA
is subject to directions and guidance from the
Government, while the ORR is independent.
As well as providing overall strategic direction and
leadership to the rail industry, the SRA lets and
manages passenger franchises, develops and
sponsors major infrastructure projects, manages
freight grants, and is responsible for some aspects
of consumer protection. Government support to
Bicentenary of the railway
There were several important railway
anniversaries in 2004. These have been
celebrated at events throughout 2004 with the
centrepiece being 'RailFesf, a nine-day festival
held in May/June at the National Railway
Museum in York. Among the anniversaries were:
■ 400 years since the construction of the first
recorded tramway system in Great Britain -
a wagonway for transporting coal -
in Nottinghamshire;
■ 200 years since the construction of the first
steam-powered locomotive by Cornish
engineer Richard Trevithick. The engine was
used to transport iron from the Penydarren
Ironworks in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales to
the local canal;
■ 100 years since the steam locomotive City of
Truro unofficially exceeded 100 mph (162
km/h) on a stretch of line in Somerset;
■ 100 years since the first electric main line
service opened, between Liverpool and
Southport;
■ 50 years since British Rail opened its first
electrified inter-city main line service, between
Manchester and Sheffield; and
■ 50 years since the last express steam
locomotive was built in the United Kingdom.
the rail industry amounted to approximately
£3.8 billion in 2003/04.
The ORR was established in July 2004 as successor
to the Office of the Rail Regulator. Its principal
function is to regulate Network Rail’s stewardship
of the national network. It also licenses operators
of railway assets, approves agreements for access
by operators to track, stations and light
maintenance depots, and enforces domestic
competition law.
Rail safety
Although there were a number of fatal rail
accidents between 1997 and 2002, there is evidence
that overall trends in railway safety are improving
(Table 21.2). Health and Safety Executive (HSE,

Rail review
In July 2004 the Government published a White
Paper, The Future of Rail, following a review of
the structure of Great Britain's railways. The
review considered the structural and
organisational changes needed to enable the rail
industry to deliver for its customers, as well as
looking at the regulation of safety and the
progress being made by the industry in improving
performance and controlling costs.
The key changes outlined in the White Paper are:
■ the Government will take charge of setting
the strategy for the railways - it will set the
level of public expenditure and take the
strategic decisions on what this should buy.
This means that the SRA will be wound up,
and its strategic responsibilities and financial
obligations will pass to the Secretary of State
for Transport;
■ Network Rail will be given clear responsibility
for operating the network and for its
performance;
■ track and train companies will work more
closely together. The number of franchises will
be reduced and they will be aligned more
closely with Network Rail's regional structure;
■ there will be increased local decision-making
and more clarity of roles and responsibilities;
■ the ORR will cover safety as well as
performance and cost, and will acquire
responsibility for safety regulation from the
Health and Safety Executive; and
■ a deal for freight that will enable the industry
and its customers to invest for the long term.
The Government will implement these changes as
quickly as possible, working in partnership with
the industry.
see page 158) figures for Great Britain show that in
2002/03 there were 75 significant train incidents
(that is, most collisions and derailments occurring
on, or affecting, passenger trains), 17 fewer than in
2001/02. However, ten people were killed in train
accidents in 2002/03 - seven as a result of the
derailment of a passenger train at Potters Bar
(Hertfordshire) in May 2002 - compared with
five in 2001/02. Measures being taken to improve
the safety of the railway network include:
■ establishment of the Rail Safety and
Standards Board to lead and facilitate the
railway industry’s work to achieve continuous
improvement in health and safety
performance;
■ fitting the train protection and warning
system (TPWS) to the national network by
the end of 2003;
■ fitting the new European automatic train
protection (ATP) system to lines on the
European high-speed network as they are
upgraded;
■ investment in new rolling stock, enabling the
withdrawal of all remaining slam-door trains
by 2005; and
■ the development of a new national safety plan
to improve safety management and ensure
best practice.
Passenger services
The passenger network (see map in the colour
section) comprises an inter-city network, linking
the main city centres of Great Britain; local and
regional services; and commuter services in and
around the large conurbations, notably London
and the South East. Passenger traffic continues
to grow (Table 21.8) and on the national railways

rose by 3 per cent to 40.9 billion passenger-
kilometres in 2003/04, representing 1,014 million
passenger journeys, the highest number since the
1960s. In Northern Ireland, the main routes run
from Belfast to Londonderry and from Belfast
south to the border with the Republic of Ireland
and on to Dublin. Northern Ireland Railways
handled 6.5 million passenger journeys in
2003/04.
According to the SRA’s Public Performance
Measure, an average of 81 per cent of scheduled
services arrived on time in 2003/04, 2 percentage
points higher than in 2002/03.
Freight
Rail freight traffic in Great Britain grew by 1 per
cent in 2003/04 to 18.9 billion tonne-kilometres,
representing 88.9 million tonnes of freight lifted
(by weight). There were 416,000 freight train
journeys in 2003/04, 11 per cent more than in the
previous year. Most traffic by volume is in bulk
commodities, mainly coal, coke, iron and steel,
building materials and petroleum. The two largest
operators are EWS (English, Welsh & Scottish
Railway), which also runs trains through the
Channel Tunnel; and Freightliner, which operates
container services between major ports and inland
terminals. The other two operators are Direct Rail
Services (DRS) and GB Railfreight.
The Government and the devolved
administrations are keen to encourage more
freight to be moved by rail, to relieve pressure on the
road network and to bring environmental benefits.
Grants are available to encourage companies to
move goods by rail or water rather than by road.
The Welsh Assembly Government operates the
Freight Facilities Grant scheme in Wales and
provided funds for two schemes in 2003/04.

The Royal Train
A new locomotive responsible for hauling the
Royal Train was unveiled on 18 February 2004.
Painted in the official Royal Train colour, Royal
Claret, it was named The Queen's Messenger. The
first Royal Train ran on 13 June 1842, transporting
Queen Victoria from Slough to London
(Paddington) on a journey taking 25 minutes.
Channel Tunnel
The Channel Tunnel, which had its tenth
anniversary in 2004, is operated by the Anglo-
French group Eurotunnel, under a concession from
the UK and French Governments. As well as
managing the infrastructure of the Channel Tunnel
- tunnels, terminals and track — Eurotunnel
operates a drive-on, drive-off shuttle train service,
with separate shuttles for passenger and freight
vehicles, between terminals near Folkestone (Kent)
and Calais. In 2003 the service carried nearly
2.3 million cars (down 2 per cent on 2002), nearly
1.3 million goods vehicles (up by 4 per cent) and
72,000 coaches (unchanged). Volumes of cars and
coaches have been falling in recent years, while
goods vehicle numbers have continued to increase.
Eurostar high-speed train services are operated
jointly by Eurostar (UK) Ltd, SNCF (French National
Railways) and SNCB (Belgian National Railways)
under the commercial direction of Eurostar Group
Ltd. Services connect London (Waterloo) and Paris
or Brussels. Trains also serve Ashford International
(Kent), Calais, Lille, Disneyland Paris, Moutiers
and Bourg St Maurice in the French Alps (in the
winter) and Avignon (in the summer). Eurostar
carried 6.3 million passengers in 2003.
Channel Tunnel Rail Link
The first section of the 109-kilometre Channel
Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL), between the Channel
Tunnel terminal and Fawkham Junction (Kent),
opened in September 2003. Eurostar trains are
now able to travel in the United Kingdom at
speeds of up to 186 mph (300 km/h). This has
reduced the fastest journey between London and
Paris to 2 hours 35 minutes, and between London
and Brussels to 2 hours 15 minutes.
Construction work on the second section, to a new
international terminal at London St Pancras, is
due for completion in 2007. When this section is
complete, Eurostar journey times to and from the
continent will be reduced by a further 20 minutes.
High-speed domestic services will also operate
from Kent to London and new international
stations will be built at Stratford (east London)
and Ebbsfleet (Kent). The total cost of the CTRL
project is forecast to be £5.2 billion.

stations on over 408 kilometres of track. It is run
by London Underground Ltd (LUL), which is part
of TfL (see page 342). In 2003/04, 948 million
passenger journeys were made on the network.
The Glasgow Underground, the only other such
UK system, and the world’s third oldest, opened
in 1896 with 15 stations, and operates on a
10-kilometre circle in central Glasgow.
Responsibility for maintaining and upgrading
LUL’s infrastructure is with the private sector
under a public-private partnership (PPP - see
page 370), while LUL continues to have
responsibility for safety and for operating
passenger services across the network. Under the
PPP, three infrastructure companies (Infracos) -
Tube Lines, Metronet Rail BCV and Metronet SSL
- work under contract to LUL for a 30-year
period starting in April 2003. Ownership of LUL’s
assets - trains, stations, track and tunnels -
remains in the public sector; the Infracos lease
these assets for the period of the contracts. The
PPP will enable many billion pounds to be
invested in the Underground’s infrastructure over
the 30 years.
Light railways and tramways
In spring 2004 seven modern tram and light rail
services were in operation (Table 21.9).
A 4.4-kilometre extension to the Docklands Light
Railway in London is expected to be completed by
late 2005, and a further 2.5-kilometre extension
under the River Thames to Woolwich has won
government approval.

Heritage railways
There are over 100 passenger heritage railways,
often connected with the preservation of steam
locomotives. Services are mostly operated by
volunteers and cater mainly for tourists and
railway enthusiasts. Some run on the tracks of
closed British Rail routes. Examples include:
■ the Snowdon Mountain Railway in north
Wales, opened in 1896, which carries visitors
to within 20 metres of the summit;
■ the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway
in Kent, opened in 1927, using the 15-inch
gauge (38 centimetres) and running for 22
kilometres. In its early years it was known as
the ‘Smallest Public Railway in the World’;
■ the Strathspey Railway in the Central
Highlands of Scotland, which uses existing
standard gauge track. The first stage between
Aviemore and Boat of Garten opened in 1978
and an extension to Grantown-on-Spey is
being explored; and
■ the 3-foot narrow gauge (just under 1 metre)
Giant’s Causeway & Bushmills Railway in
Antrim, Northern Ireland, which opened in
2002. A little over 3 kilometres long, it links
the World Heritage site with the Old
Bushmills whiskey distillery.
Air travel
As well as the modern tram networks there are
much older systems still in operation, including
Blackpool (Lancashire), which opened in 1885,
and the Great Orme tramway at Llandudno (north
Wales), dating back to 1902. Heritage tramways
run at Beamish (Co Durham), Crich (Derbyshire)
and Seaton (Devon).
Between 1993 and 2003 the number of passengers
joining or leaving aircraft at UK airports increased
by 77 per cent to 176.9 million. Cargo (excluding
mail and passengers’ luggage) rose by 62 per cent
to 2.15 million tonnes. Aircraft landings and take¬
offs increased by 44 per cent to 1.67 million. These
figures exclude double counting of domestic

passengers, so that those who take off from one
UK airport and land at another UK airport are
only counted once.
According to the DfT, these trends look set to
continue; the number of air passengers is forecast
to grow by around 4 per cent a year over the next
decade, and the freight market by 7 per cent (see
page 337). The number of UK residents going
abroad by air has grown rapidly (Figure 21.10),
from 25.4 million visits in 1993 to 47.2 million
in 2003.

Airlines
British Airways is one of the world’s largest
international airlines. In August 2004 its
worldwide network covered 158 destinations in
74 countries. Its main operating bases are
London’s two main airports, Heathrow and
Gatwick.

The longest established UK air route
On 29 March 2004 Southampton Airport
celebrated 70 years of air services between
Southampton and Jersey. This air link is believed
to be the longest established UK air route still in
existence. In 1934, Commander Charles
Eckersley-Maslin piloted the first flight to Jersey.
The plane was a de Havilland Dragon Rapide
DH84 aircraft, operated by Jersey Airways.
Passengers were charged £3 for the return
Southampton/Portsmouth and Jersey flight.
British Airways was one of the founders of the
‘Oneworld’ alliance of nine airlines, offering
customers an extensive worldwide route network
and a wide range of benefits. Together, in August
2004, these airlines offered travel to 562 scheduled
destinations in 131 countries, with over 8,500
flights every day.
At the end of 2003 there were 921 aircraft in
service in the UK airline fleet, 27 per cent more
than in 1993.

100,000 passengers in 2003. The total number of
passengers at UK civil airports was a record
200.0 million in 2003, a 6 per cent increase on
2002 and 78 per cent higher than in 1993. Freight

Heathrow is the world’s busiest international
airport and accounted for 63.2 million passengers
(excluding those in transit) in 2003, 32 per cent of
UK passengers in 2003, while Gatwick, the world’s
busiest single runway airport, accounted for
29.9 million passengers, 15 per cent.
All UK airports used for public transport must be
licensed by the CAA for reasons of safety.
Stringent requirements, such as adequate
firefighting, medical and rescue services, have to
be satisfied before a licence is granted.
Ownership and control
BAA is the largest global commercial airport
operator. It handled 131 million passengers at its
seven UK-owned airports - Heathrow, Gatwick,
Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and
Southampton - in 2003. Overseas, it has
management contracts or stakes in ten airports
In Scotland, Highland and Islands Airports Ltd
(HIAL) manages and maintains ten airports and
in 2003 handled around 864,000 passengers. These
airports receive considerable investment from the
Scottish Executive to ensure the continued
provision of‘lifeline’ services to remote areas.
Airport development
Following extensive public consultation, a White
Paper, The Future of Air Transport, was published
in December 2003. This set out the framework for
the development of air transport over the next 30
years in the regions of England as well as in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, aiming to balance
the economic benefits against the environmental
impact. Since the 1970s there has been a fivefold
increase in air travel; half the population now flies
at least once a year, and many fly more often.
Forecasts suggest that demand could be between
two and three times current levels by 2030.
In addition, air freight has doubled in the last ten
years; one-third by value of all goods exported
337
21 Transport
UK 2005
goes by air. The key conclusions of the White
Paper are:
■ two new runways to be built in the South East
of England by 2030, the first at Stansted (by
2011 or 2012) and the second at Heathrow
(within the 2015 to 2020 period), provided
they meet strict environmental conditions;
■ growth to take place at other UK airports,
including extending existing runways,
providing additional runways, and developing
terminal and other facilities; but
■ no new airports to be constructed in central
Scotland, south-east Wales, the Midlands, the
South East or the South West, although
existing facilities in these areas should be
expanded.
BAA is investing £8.6 billion of capital expenditure
in its three airports in the South East of England
over an 11-year period up to 2014. Around
£7 billion of this will be at Heathrow, including
£4.2 billion on the Terminal 5 project. The new
terminal is on schedule to open in 2008 and will
increase Heathrow’s passenger handling capacity
by 30 million passengers a year. At Gatwick, BAA
is spending about £840 million on infrastructure
to raise current traffic levels by a third to
40 million a year by 2014. This includes the
£100 million Pier 6 project which contains the
world’s biggest air passenger bridge, large enough
to allow a Boeing 747-400 to pass underneath.
BAA is also investing £660 million to cater for
the rapid growth of low-cost carriers at Stansted
Airport. An application will be submitted in 2005
to allow expansion from the current limit of 25
million to around 35 million passengers a year.
Air traffic control
National Air Traffic Services (NATS) provides air
traffic control services to civil and military aircraft
flying in UK airspace, and in the eastern North
Atlantic and western North Sea. It operates under
contract to the airport operators at 14 UK
airports, including all seven BAA airports, and also
provides an approach radar service to three others.
In addition NATS provides air control services to
QinetiQ (the greater part of the former Defence
Evaluation and Research Agency) at the Larkhill
(Wiltshire) and Aberporth (Ceredigion) Ministry
of Defence test ranges. NATS is a PPP (see page
370), in which the Government’s partners are a
consortium of seven UK airlines known as the
Airline Group, and BAA. The CAA retains
responsibility for air safety regulation, and also
regulates NATS air traffic control charges.
Figures for 2003 indicate that NATS handled a
record number of flights, with proportionately
fewer delays. A total of 2.08 million flights used
UK airspace in 2003, an increase of 4 per cent on
2002. Over 95 per cent of flights experienced no
traffic control delay, up from 87 per cent in 2002.
The average delay fell from 2.58 minutes in 2002
to 0.74 minutes in 2003.
En route air traffic management services to aircraft
flying over the United Kingdom are provided from
the following centres:
■ London Area Control Centre at Swanwick,
Hampshire;
■ London Terminal Control Centre at West
Drayton, Middlesex;
■ Scottish Area Control Centre and Oceanic
Control Centre at Prestwick, Ayrshire; and
■ Manchester Area Control Centre at
Manchester Airport.
The Oceanic Area Control Centre provides
services to aircraft flying the North Atlantic.
In the long term, all NATS’ en route operations
will be carried out from Swanwick and a new
centre at Prestwick, which is expected to be in full
operational service by 2009.
The first phase of a £1 billion investment plan -
the replacement of its entire UK radar network
- was announced by NATS in 2003. The planned
investment will replace much of the UK air traffic
control infrastructure, and is intended, among
other things, to enable the company to handle
a projected 50 per cent increase in flights, from
2 to 3 million, by 2010/11.
Air safety
The Safety Regulation Group of the CAA is
responsible for the day-to-day safety regulation of
UK airlines, airports and air traffic control, and for
issuing airworthiness and maintenance approvals
on behalf of the European Aviation Safety Agency.
On the basis of either European or UK law, it must
be satisfied that aircraft are properly designed,
manufactured, operated and maintained; that
airlines are competent; that flight crews, air traffic
controllers and aircraft maintenance engineers are
fit and competent; that licensed aerodromes are
safe to use; and that air traffic services and general
338
UK 2005
21 Transport
aviation activities meet required safety standards.
All aircraft registered in the United Kingdom must
be granted a certificate of airworthiness by the
CAA before being flown. Of the 17,012 registered
on 1 January 2004, 32 per cent were not currently
certificated, 26 per cent had transport category
passenger status, 24 per cent permit to fly status
and 15 per cent private status.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is
part of the DfT and is responsible for the
investigation of civil aircraft accidents and serious
incidents within UK airspace and those that occur
overseas to aircraft registered or manufactured in
the United Kingdom. In 2003 the AAIB was
involved in the investigation of 467 civil aviation
accidents or incidents worldwide and provided
technical assistance to military aircraft accident
investigations on six occasions.
Shipping and ports
An estimated 95 per cent by weight (75 per cent
by value) of UK foreign trade is carried by sea.
The UK-registered fleet declined considerably in
tonnage terms between 1975 and 1997, but
strategies to promote UK shipping have resulted
in a threefold increase in tonnage since then. Total
international revenue earned by the UK shipping
industry in 2003 was £5.0 billion. Freight revenue
accounted for £3.7 billion (£2.9 billion on dry
cargo and passenger vessels and £0.8 billion on
tankers and liquefied gas carriers). The remaining
revenue came from passengers and from charter
receipts.
There were 649 UK-owned trading vessels of
100 gross tonnes and over at the end of 2003,
with a total deadweight of 15.0 million tonnes, an
increase of 2.7 million tonnes on 2002. There were
149 vessels totalling 5.5 million deadweight tonnes
used as oil, chemical or gas carriers, and 453
vessels totalling 9.3 million deadweight tonnes
employed as dry-bulk carriers, container ships and
other types of cargo ship. In addition, there were
47 passenger ships with deadweight of 0.1 million
tonnes. In all, 77 per cent of UK-owned vessels are
registered in the United Kingdom, the Channel
Islands, the Isle of Man (see page 7)or UK
Overseas Territories (see page 77) such as
Bermuda.
Cargo services
Nearly all scheduled cargo-liner services from the
United Kingdom are containerised. UK tonnage
serving these trades is dominated by a relatively
small number of companies. Besides the carriage
of freight by liner and bulk services between the
United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, many
roll-on, roll-off services carry cars, passengers and
commercial vehicles.
Passenger services
Provisional figures for 2003 show that there were
26.5 million international2 sea passenger journeys
to and from the United Kingdom, 8 per cent fewer
than in 2002. There were 14.6 million journeys
through Dover (55 per cent of the total) with a
further 3.1 million through Portsmouth, the
second largest port for international sea passenger
traffic, and 2.3 million through Holyhead.
Domestic3 sea passenger journeys totalled
3.8 million. It is estimated that a further 18
million passengers were carried on ferry services
to offshore islands such as the Isle of Wight,
Orkney, Shetland, and the islands off the west
coast of Scotland.
Branson sets cross-Channel record
On 14 June 2004 Sir Richard Branson set the
record for the fastest ever crossing of the English
Channel by an amphibious vehicle, crossing the
Channel in 1 hour, 40 minutes and 6 seconds,
beating the previous record of six hours set by
two Frenchmen.
P&O Ferries is the largest UK ferry operator, with
a fleet of over 40 ships operating on 15 routes
around the UK coast. Cross-Channel services are
operated by roll-on, roll-off ferries, high-speed
catamarans and high-speed monohulls.
Maritime safety
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is
an executive agency of the DfT and is responsible
throughout the United Kingdom for
implementing the Government’s maritime safety
policy. This includes coordinating search and
rescue at sea through HM Coastguard (see below),

Queen Mary 2
Following its naming by The Queen on 8 January
2004, the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary 2
took place on 12 January, when the liner sailed
from Southampton to Fort Lauderdale in the
United States. At 345 metres long, 72 metres
high and with accommodation for 2,620
passengers on 19 decks, it is the world's biggest
ever passenger ship.
and checking that ships meet UK and
international safety rules. It works to prevent loss
of lives at the coast and at sea, to ensure that ships
are safe, and to prevent coastal pollution. During
2003/04, 112 foreign ships were under detention in
UK ports after failing safety inspection, compared
with 132 in 2002/03.
HM Coastguard is one of the four emergency
services in the United Kingdom and is divided
into three regions - Eastern, Wales and West of
England, and Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Each region has a number of Maritime Rescue
Coordination Centres and Sub Centres, from
which it coordinates the response to maritime
incidents. HM Coastguard can call upon its own
helicopters, cliff and mud rescue teams; lifeboats
of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (see
page 114) and other volunteer lifeboats; aircraft,
helicopters and ships from the Armed Forces; and
merchant shipping and commercial aircraft.
In 2003 a total of 5,689 persons were rescued and
316 lives were lost (including suicides and bodies
recovered where the actual cause of death was
unknown), indicating that 94.4 per cent of persons
involved in life threatening situations were
rescued.
Several locations in UK waters are potentially
hazardous to shipping. There are around 1,300
marine aids to navigation around the UK coast,4
including 350 lighthouses and over 700 buoys.
Responsibility for these rests with three lighthouse
authorities. Measures to reduce the risk of
collision include the separation of ships into
internationally agreed shipping lanes. This applies,

Channel Islands and Gibraltar.
for example, in the Dover Strait, one of the world s
busiest seaways, which is monitored by radar from
the Channel Navigation Information Service at the
MCA’s Dover base.
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch
(MAIB) is part of the DfT and examines and
investigates all types of marine accidents to or on
board UK ships worldwide, and other ships in UK
territorial waters. In 2003 the MAIB received 1,522
accident and incident reports, of which 689 were
accidents to ships, 631 accidents to people and 202
hazardous incidents (near misses). During the
year, 15 full investigations were started.
Ports
There are over 100 ports of commercial
significance in the United Kingdom, while several
hundred small harbours cater for local cargo,
fishing vessels, island ferries or recreation. Ports
fall into three categories: those owned and run by
boards constituted as trusts; those owned by local
authorities; and company-owned facilities.
The largest UK ports group, Associated British
Ports (ABP), owns and operates 21 ports in
England, Wales and Scotland, including the major
ports of Grimsby and Immingham, Southampton,
Hull, Port Talbot, Ipswich, Newport,
Cardiff, Goole and Fleetwood. Other major
facilities owned by private sector companies
include Felixstowe, Harwich and Medway.
Northern Ireland has four main ports, at Belfast,
Larne, Londonderry and Warrenpoint. With the
exception of Larne, which is privately owned, they
are all public trust ports.
The Government aims to assist ports in maintaining
competitiveness; to develop nationally agreed safety
standards; to promote environmental best practice;
and to build on the approach detailed in its 2000
ten-year plan for transport, which recognises the
importance of port hubs within integrated transport
systems.
Port traffic
Freight traffic at UK ports was 555 million tonnes
in 2003, a 1 per cent fall compared with 2002.
Traffic through the 52 major UK ports (generally
those handling over 1 million tonnes a year)
accounted for 538 million tonnes (97 per cent) of
the total. Inwards traffic, 58 per cent of the total,
increased by 2 million tonnes to 323 million
340
UK 2005
21 Transport
tonnes, while outward traffic fell by 6 million
tonnes to 231 million tonnes.
The principal ports, in terms of total tonnage
handled, are shown in Table 21.13. Forth, Milford
Haven and Sullom Voe mostly handle oil, while the
main destinations for non-fuel traffic are London,
Felixstowe, Grimsby and Immingham, Tees and
Hartlepool, and Liverpool. In 2002 crude oil
accounted for 32 per cent of all major ports traffic.

Felixstowe is the most important port for
container and conventional services, handling
38 per cent of this type of traffic in 2002. Dover
handled 30 per cent of total road goods vehicles
and unaccompanied trailers, and is also the major
arrival and departure point for sea passengers (see
above). The top four UK ports are among the ten
largest ports in northern Europe. Northern Ireland
ports handle some 95 per cent of its trade.
Inland waterways
Although UK inland waterways are now used
mainly for leisure and general recreation, they
have a number of other important roles: as a
heritage and environmental resource, as a catalyst
for regeneration, and in land drainage and water
supply. Some continue to carry freight.

than in 1992. The volume of goods moved was
1.7 billion tonne-kilometres, down from 1.8 billion
tonne-kilometres in 2001. The River Thames was
the busiest inland waterway, carrying 19.3 million
tonnes of traffic in 2002, followed by the River
Forth with 8.5 million tonnes.
British Waterways is the leading UK navigation
authority, with responsibility for some 3,200
kilometres of canals, rivers and docks, over half
the UK total. It is a public sector body, sponsored
by the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs and the Scottish Executive. There are
about 30 other navigation authorities in the
United Kingdom.
The Pontcysyllte aqueduct
As one of the seven 'Wonders of the Waterways',
and the highest and biggest in the British Isles,
the Pontcysyllte aqueduct carries the Llangollen
canal across the River Dee in north Wales. It is 37
metres high and over 300 metres long. The first
stone was laid in July 1795 and construction took
ten years, at a cost of around £47,000. It is
currently being cleaned, in time to celebrate its
200th anniversary in 2005.
v   
In the last few years British Waterways has
completed Great Britain’s largest programme of
waterway restorations, in which over 350
kilometres of canals and waterway structures were
restored or built, with funding coming from a
range of partnerships and public support. The
organisation is working towards self-sufficiency
for Great Britain’s inland waterways through
innovative commercial ventures and has the
objective of attracting twice as many people to its
canals and rivers in 2012 compared with 2003.
The cross-border body Waterways Ireland manages,
maintains, develops and restores the inland
navigable waterway systems throughout the island
of Ireland, principally for recreational purposes.
In 2002, UK inland waters traffic5 carried goods
amounting to 49.0 million tonnes, a fall of 8 per
5 This covers internal non-seagoing traffic and seagoing traffic that
crosses into inland waterways.
Transport policy
In July 2004 the Government published a
transport strategy White Paper, The Future of
341
21 Transport
UK 2005
Transport: a network for 2030. The strategy builds
on the long-term approach to transport planning
established in the ten-year plan for transport,
published in 2000 and which came into effect in
April 2001. The White Paper incorporates the 2004
Spending Review (see page 368), which rolled
forward the original ten-year plan public spending
package to 2014/15.
Spending by the DfT will rise by an annual average
of 4.5 per cent in real terms between 2005/06 and
2007/08. This includes a £1.7 billion transport
reform package for the railways over and above the
original ten-year plan provision. The Spending
Review also increased forecast ten-year plan
spending by £0.5 billion each year from 2006/07.
This higher level of spending will grow in real terms
(by 2.25 per cent each year) through to 2015.
Further details of how the revised spending package
will be broken down between transport modes will
be published in autumn 2004. Public spending by
the DfT in 2003/04 is shown in Figure 21.14.
Under the Transport Act 2000, local transport
authorities in England (excluding London) and
Wales have drawn up five-year Local Transport
Plans (LTPs). Most English authorities are
expecting to publish their second LTPs in July
2005. In Scotland all local authorities have
produced Local Transport Strategies and
Strathclyde Passenger Transport has a public
transport strategy.
Every year, capital allocations to English local
authorities are made in the LTP capital settlement.
This funding has been used by authorities to invest
in capital road maintenance works and schemes to
improve local road networks and infrastructure,
public transport, walking and cycling. The 2004
Spending Review established a Transport
Innovation Fund (TIF), additional to the LTP
funding stream, to support authorities that pursue
measures aimed at key shared national and local
priorities such as congestion reduction and
improving public transport services. Mechanisms
for deciding on allocations from the TIF will be
published in the 2005 Budget alongside regional
guideline budgets, with a view to making the first
allocations in 2006.
The Mayor of London (see page 10) is responsible
for transport in the capital except for main line
rail. The Mayor’s Transport Strategy recognises
that increasing the capacity of London’s transport
system cannot be based on the private car. It aims

to increase bus capacity by around 40 per cent and
to increase total rail capacity by up to 40 per cent
between 2002 and 2011.
With these additional improvements, total rail
capacity, including CrossRail - a new east-west
route planned through central London - and
Thameslink 2000 - an upgrade of the existing
Thameslink cross-London north-south route —
could be increased by up to 50 per cent by 2016.
Authorities in London produce local
implementation/borough spending plans in line
with the Strategy, which is delivered by TfL.
The Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 set up
a new Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB),
on similar lines to the AAIB and MAIB (see
pages 339 and 340). This is in response to
recommendations made in Lord Cullens report
into the Ladbroke Grove rail crash of 1999, in
which 31 people died. Other measures in the Act
include introducing alcohol limits in relation to
shipping and civil aviation (broadly replicating the
drink driving legislation that applies to motorists
and railway workers); establishing a new police
authority for the British Transport Police (see also
page 205), and restructuring the Office of the Rail
Regulator, which will now have a statutory board
and has become the ORR (see page 332).

Wales
The Transport Framework for Wales sets the context
within which the Welsh Assembly Government
makes decisions relating to transport. It aims to
provide a better coordinated and sustainable
system, including improved public transport.
Programmes have been set out under the
framework for rail, roads and local transport.
The Welsh Assembly Government Transport
Directorate had an annual budget of £326 million
in 2004/05. It is responsible for the maintenance
and improvement of motorways and trunk roads
in Wales, and the administration of grants to local
authorities and other bodies to fund a range of
capital transport schemes and transport services.
In 2004 the Welsh Assembly Government
announced a Transport Grant of £85 million for
2004/05. The total includes £36 million to support
integrated transport solutions such as bus-rail
interchanges, £34 million to improve the local
road network, and £8 million each to help develop
the rail network and to encourage walking and
cycling, including Safe Routes to Schools (see page
331).
Scotland
In June 2004 the Scottish Executive issued a White
Paper, Scotland’s Transport Future, setting out its
vision of a safe, integrated and reliable transport
system that supports economic growth and
provides opportunities for all. It plans to achieve
this through investing in infrastructure and
services, and reforming delivery at a national and
regional level. Major projects include new rail
links, for example to Edinburgh and Glasgow
International airports, a route development fund
to stimulate new or existing bus services and road
improvements, such as the M74 completion and
the Aberdeen bypass. The White Paper proposes
reforming transport delivery through the creation
of a national transport agency and statutory
regional transport partnerships, comprising local
authorities and representatives from business and
other organisations in the region.
Total planned expenditure on transport of
£1.3 billion in 2004/05 includes £643 million for
motorways and trunk roads (of which £338
million is a cost of capital charge), £211 million
for rail services, £28 million for ferries and
£22 million for Highlands and Islands airports.
The Scottish Executive is also taking a long-term
view of financial planning for public transport
infrastructure, and funding of £3 billion is
planned over the next ten years.
The first piece of private rail legislation to go
before the Scottish Parliament since devolution
was introduced in May 2003 and passed in July
2004. The Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine Railway and
Linked Improvements (Scotland) Act 2004 gives
permission for the re-opening of this link, part of
the Scottish Executive’s proposed improvements to
the Scottish rail network.
Northern Ireland
The Regional Transportation Strategy for Northern
Ireland 2002-2012 identifies strategic investment
priorities and considers potential funding sources
and the affordability of planned initiatives over the
ten years. Funding of £3.5 billion is envisaged over
the lifetime of the strategy. The principal
initiatives include:
■ upgrading existing rail network and services,
and providing new, modern trains and
increased rail capacity;
■ quality bus routes on all main Belfast
commuter routes and providing new, modern
accessible buses;
■ building a rapid transit system in the Belfast
metropolitan area; and
■ strategic highway improvements to provide,
for example, up to 13 bypasses and about 85
kilometres of dual carriageway.

Growth in the UK economy continued for the
12th consecutive year in 2003 (Figure 22.1).
The chained volume measure of gross domestic
product (GDP) (see glossary) rose by 2.2 per cent.
This was slightly above the 1.8 per cent growth in
2002, but slightly below its post-war average of
around 2'h per cent a year.

In recent decades the service sector (see chapter
29) has dominated growth. In 2003 it grew by
2.5 per cent, slightly below the 2.7 per cent
achieved in 2002. The real estate sector, hotels and
restaurants, post and telecommunications, and
health and social work all showed above average
rates of growth. The construction sector also grew
strongly in 2003, by 4.9 per cent, following growth
of 3.8 per cent in 2002. After declining by 2.5 per
cent in 2002, output of production industries was
broadly unchanged in 2003. Increases of 2.2 per
cent in electricity, gas and water supply and 0.4 per
cent in manufacturing - following two successive
years of decline - offset a 5.4 per cent fall in
mining and quarrying (including oil and gas
extraction). The agriculture, forestry and Fishing
industry declined by 2.6 per cent in 2003 following
an 11.9 per cent increase in the previous year.
In 2003 the rate of growth in expenditure by
households slowed to 2.3 per cent, compared with
3.2 per cent in 2002, while general government
expenditure rose by 3.5 per cent, slightly less than
the 3.8 per cent in the previous year. Gross fixed
capital formation (see glossary) increased by
2.2 per cent in 2003, less than the 2.7 per cent
increase in the previous year. On the trade side,
volumes were weaker than in recent years. Exports
of goods and services rose only marginally in both
2002 and 2003. Imports grew by 1.3 per cent in
2003, following a 4.1 per cent rise in 2002.
Economic strategy
The main elements of the Government’s economic
strategy, designed to deliver high and stable levels
of economic growth and employment, are as set
out in the 2004 Budget:
■ maintaining macroeconomic stability;
■ raising the sustainable rate of productivity
growth;
■ increasing employment opportunity for all;
■ building a fairer society;
■ delivering high-quality public services; and
■ protecting the environment.
HM Treasury is the department with prime
responsibility for macroeconomic policy - in
particular, taxation and spending - and setting the
inflation target that the independent Monetary
Policy Committee of the Bank of England is
required to meet (see page 348). It is also
responsible for wider economic policy, which it
carries out in conjunction with other government
departments, such as Trade and Industry,
Education and Skills, Work and Pensions, and
Transport.

22 Economic framework
UK 2005
Economic and monetary union (EMU)
Government policy on EMU (see page 69) was
originally set out by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in October 1997. The Government is in
favour of UK membership providing the economic
conditions are right. The determining factor is the
national economic interest and whether the
economic case for joining is clear and
unambiguous. The Government has set out five
economic tests, which must be met before any
decision to join can be made. The five tests are:
■ sustainable convergence between the United
Kingdom and the economies of a single
currency;
■ whether there is sufficient flexibility to cope
with economic change;
■ the effect on investment;
■ the impact on the UK financial services
industry; and
■ whether it is good for employment.
The most recent assessment of the five economic
tests in June 2003 concluded that at that time a
decision to join EMU would not be in the national
economic interest. The Treasury will review
progress on whether it is in the United Kingdom’s
economic interest to join EMU, and will announce
the results of the review in the 2005 Budget. If a
decision to recommend joining is taken by the
Government, it will be put to a vote in Parliament
and then to a referendum of the UK people.
Economic stability
The Government has established frameworks for
the operation of both monetary and fiscal policy
with the aim of achieving low and stable inflation
and sound public finances. It seeks to ensure the
coordination of monetary and fiscal policy by
setting mutually consistent objectives for both.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee (see page 348) sets the base rate for
interest rates to meet the Government’s new
inflation target (see page 353). As interest rate
changes take some time to be fully effective, the
Committee must consider its inflation forecast and
the impact of other factors some two years ahead
and beyond. Since the introduction of the new
monetary framework in 1997, official interest rates
peaked at Th per cent in 1998, compared with a
peak of 15 per cent in 1989 in the previous
economic cycle. From the beginning of 2001
The Allsopp Review
The final report of a wide-ranging review of
economic statistics, conducted by Christopher
Allsopp, was published in March 2004. The
report, flewew of Statistics for Economic
Policymaking - Final report to the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, the Governor of the Bank of
England and the National Statistician, made over
60 recommendations aimed at improving national
and regional statistics. It focused mainly on
whether the changing UK economic structure is
being properly reflected in the nature, frequency
and timeliness of official economic statistics. The
main recommendations included:
■ a National Accounts framework that
responds better to the economic structure of
the United Kingdom;
■ updating the surveys and methodology that
underpin the National Accounts;
■ better short-term estimates of output;
■ improving the estimates of expenditure
components;
■ developing better measures of the labour
market and productivity;
■ developing Regional Accounts to provide
better quality, more timely annual baseline
estimates; and
■ improving existing labour market and
population data and estimating regional
price levels.
The Office for National Statistics will be
implementing these recommendations in full.
onwards the Bank cut interest rates by 2'h
percentage points reaching a low of 3 72 per cent in
July 2003. Since then interest rates have been
gradually increased and were 43A per cent in
August 2004.
The United Kingdom has a freely floating
exchange rate and no capital controls: in the last
ten years the only official intervention against
sterling was conducted in September 2000 by the
Bank of England as part of concerted support by
the G7 group of countries (see chapter 7) for the
euro. In recent years there have been significant
fluctuations in bilateral exchange rates, but
sterling’s effective exchange rate measured against

Fiscal policy framework
The Code for Fiscal Stability sets out the five key
principles of fiscal management at the heart of the
Government’s fiscal policy framework:
■ transparency in the setting of fiscal policy
objectives, the implementation of fiscal policy
and the publication of the public accounts;
■ stability in the fiscal policy-making process
and in the way fiscal policy impacts on the
economy;
■ responsibility in the management of the
public finances;
■ fairness, including between generations; and
■ efficiency in the design and implementation
of fiscal policy and in managing both sides of
the public sector balance sheet.
The Code also requires the Government to state
both its objectives and the rules through which
policy will be operated. These objectives are:
■ over the medium term, to ensure sound
public finances and that spending and
taxation impact fairly within and between
generations; and
■ over the short term, to support monetary
policy and, in particular, to allow the
‘automatic stabilisers’ to help smooth the path
of the economy.
These objectives are implemented through the
Government’s two fiscal rules, against which the
performance of fiscal policy can be judged:
■ the golden rule - over the economic cycle, the
Government will borrow only to invest and
not to fund current spending; and
■ the sustainable investment rule - public
sector net debt as a proportion of GDP will
be held over the economic cycle at a stable
and prudent level. Other things being equal,
net debt will be maintained below 40 per cent
of GDP over the economic cycle.
The fiscal rules are designed to ensure sound
public finances in the medium term. They allow
flexibility in two key respects:
■ the rules are set over the economic cycle,
allowing fiscal balances to vary between years
in line with the cyclical position of the
economy; and
■ the rules work together to promote capital
investment while ensuring sustainable public
finances in the longer term.
The fiscal rules are the foundation of the public
spending framework (see chapter 23) and have
important consequences for the structure of the
budgeting regime.
The Budget
The Budget is presented annually by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in a major speech to
Parliament. Budget day in 2004 was on 17 March
and the 2004 Budget Report comprised two
documents:
■ the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report,
setting out the Government’s long-term goals
and the comprehensive strategy it is pursuing
to achieve them, the progress that has been
made so far, and the further steps the
Government is taking in the 2004 Budget to
advance its long-term goals; and
347
22 Economic framework
UK 2005
■ the Financial Statement and Budget Report,
providing a summary of each of the main
Budget measures and how they affect the
Budget arithmetic, and updated forecasts of
the economy and the public finances. See text
box on page 371 on Budget tax measures.
Pre-Budget Report
Under the Code for Fiscal Stability (see page 347),
the Government is committed to publishing a Pre-
Budget Report (PBR) at least three months before
the Budget (usually in the previous November,
although the PBR for the 2004 Budget was
published in December 2003). The PBR sets out
updated forecasts for the economy and the public
finances, reports on how the Government’s
policies are helping to deliver its long-term goals,
and describes the reforms that the Government is
considering ahead of the Budget and on which it
will be consulting in the months ahead.
Key announcements in the December 2003 PBR
included:
■ an updated economic forecast, which stated
that growth in the UK economy is expected to
continue strengthening and that the
Government is on track to meet its fiscal rules
for sound public finances over the economic
cycle;
■ new measures to raise productivity, including
improving access to finance for small business
and reducing red tape for business;
■ further reforms to promote employment
opportunity across the United Kingdom;
■ additional help for pensioners and for
families with children from April 2004;
■ measures to promote fairness in the tax
system; and
■ further steps to protect and enhance the
environment.
Bank of England
The Bank of England (see also page 461) was
founded in 1694 and nationalised in 1946. It
gained operational independence in 1997 when it
was given responsibility for setting the United
Kingdom’s official interest rate (see page 346). It is
the United Kingdom’s central bank and is
responsible for ensuring both monetary and
financial stability - which constitute its two core
purposes. The Bank also plays its part in
promoting an open and internationally
competitive financial centre in the United
Kingdom.
Under the Bank of England Act 1998, the Court of
Directors is responsible for managing the affairs of
the Bank, apart from the formulation of monetary
policy. The Court comprises the Governor, two
Deputy Governors and 16 non-executive directors.
It is required to report annually to the Chancellor
of the Exchequer.
Monetary policy framework
The Bank’s monetary policy objective is to deliver
price stability and, subject to that, to support the
Government’s economic policy, including its
growth and employment objectives. Price stability
is defined by the Government’s inflation target
(see page 353).
Responsibility for meeting this target and for
setting interest rates rests with the Bank’s
Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), comprising
the Governor, the two Deputy Governors, two
further Bank executives and four external
members appointed by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. The Committee meets every month
and decisions on interest rates are announced at
noon immediately after the meeting; minutes of
the meetings, including a record of each member’s
vote, are normally published on the second
Wednesday after each meeting. The Committee is
accountable to the Bank’s Court of Directors, to
government and to the public through Parliament.
Financial stability
The Bank’s financial stability objective is to
maintain the stability of the financial system as
a whole. The Bank seeks to identify and analyse
issues concerning the structure and functioning of
both UK and overseas financial markets and the
operation of the international financial system,
and to encourage changes designed to increase
their overall safety and effectiveness. The Bank
also undertakes work on the arrangements for
handling financial crises should they occur and,
in exceptional circumstances, acts as the financial
system’s ’lender of last resort’. In discharging its
financial stability remit, the Bank works closely
with HM Treasury and the Financial Services
Authority - through the Joint Standing
348
UK 2005
22 Economic framework
Committee established under the 1997
Memorandum of Understanding - and with other
central banks and international organisations.
Internally, guidance on priority setting is provided
by the Bank’s high-level Financial Stability Board.
Public understanding of issues relating to financial
stability is promoted through, for example, the
Bank’s biannual Financial Stability Review.
Other main functions
As the economy grows, demand for central bank
money - notes and coin - increases. The banking
system has to buy the notes from the Bank, but
lacks the funds to do so. The Bank, through its
operations in the sterling money markets,
distributes these funds at rates which implement
the MFC’s interest rate decisions. These operations
influence the general level of short-term interest
rates, as the rates at which the Bank deals are
quickly passed on through financial markets. This
in turn affects the whole pattern of interest rates
across the UK economy.
Structure and performance
The value of all goods and services produced in
the UK economy for final consumption (see
glossary) is measured by GDP. In 2003, the
chained volume measure of GDP at market prices
amounted to £1,035 billion (Table 22.3). The
economy’s trend rate of growth between 1997 and
2001 was 3 per cent a year, compared with 2'h per
cent over the previous economic cycle between
1982 and 1993.
According to the Organisation for Economic Co¬
operation and Development (OECD), the United
Kingdom experienced lower economic growth
than all its major competitors in the 1970s and,
apart from Germany and France, in the 1980s. In
the 1990s, UK growth was the same as the
European Union (EU) average but below that of
the United States (Table 22.4). Over the ten years
to 2002, relative UK performance improved
considerably. Although annual average growth still
lagged behind the United States, it was above the
EU and G7 averages.
In the 2004 Budget, HM Treasury forecast GDP to
grow by between 3 and 372 per cent in both 2004
and 2005, with the economy returning to its long¬
term trend rate of growth of between 2'h per cent
and 3 per cent by 2006.
I 
Spending on transport
According to the ONS Expenditure and Food Survey,
the average UK household spent £59 a week on
transport in 2002/03. This included buying and
running vehicles as well as transport services (fares
and other transport costs). In contrast, households
spent £56 a week on recreation and culture and
£43 on food and non-alcoholic drink.
The proportion of transport spending devoted to
the purchase of vehicles increases with income,
from around 30 per cent in lower income groups to
around 50 per cent in higher groups. In terms of
age, spending on purchases of new vehicles as a
proportion of total spending is highest in the 50 to
64 age group. Households in London spent the
most on transport services at £17.90 a week, more
than double the UK average of £8.40.
v )
UK living standards, as measured by the chained
volume measure of GDP per head, have grown
steadily over the last 30 years. Between 1993 and
2003, GDP per head increased from £13,417 to
£17,426, an average increase of 2.6 per cent a year.
Output
The service sector’s contribution to gross value
added (GVA, see glossary) at current basic prices
has continued to grow (Table 22.5), reaching
73 per cent in 2003. Within this sector, real estate,
renting and business activities contributed 25 per
cent of total GVA, with the wholesale and retail
trade accounting for a further 13 per cent.
Production industries had a 20 per cent share of
GVA in 2003, down from 26 per cent ten years
earlier. The manufacturing sub-sector contributed
only 16 per cent to GVA in 2003, compared with
21 per cent in 1993.
The contribution of agriculture, forestry and
fishing to GVA fell from 2 to 1 per cent between
1993 and 2003. The construction industry’s share
of GVA increased from 5 to 6 per cent over the
same period.

Expenditure on semi-durable and durable goods
rose by 5.7 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively,
while growth in services was limited to 0.8 per cent.
Table 22.6 shows the pattern of household final
consumption expenditure. Since 1993, using the
chained volume measure, growth has been
strongest in the semi-durable and durable goods
categories, and weakest in services and
non-durable goods. By purpose, communication
(postal services and telephone and telefax
equipment and services), recreation and culture,
and clothing and footwear have shown the most
significant growth. Household spending on
alcohol and tobacco and education have increased
the least.
Total resources (income) of the household sector -
including non-profit institutions serving

(at current prices) in 2003, compared with a G7
average of 17.8 per cent.
International trade
According to the OECD, the United Kingdom was
the fifth largest trading nation in 2003 (behind the
United States, Germany, Japan and France) with
exports of goods and services accounting for 25
per cent of GDP at current prices. See chapter 24
for information on the UK balance of payments.
Mergers and acquisitions
In 2003 expenditure on acquisitions abroad by UK
companies continued to fall, declining by 22 per
cent. This follows a drop of 36 per cent in 2002
and was far below the record level of £181 billion
established in 2000. One of the significant
transactions in 2003 was the purchase of US-based
Household International by banking group HSBC
Holdings for a reported value of around
£9.1 billion. Expenditure on acquisitions in the
United Kingdom by foreign companies fell very
sharply - by nearly 45 per cent - and again far
below the record level of £65 billion in 2000.

A significant acquisition in 2003 was of the retail
businesses of brewing group Scottish & Newcastle
by Spirit Amber Bidco - an international
consortium of investors - for a reported value of
£2.5 billion. Expenditure on acquisitions in the
United Kingdom by UK companies fell by nearly
26 per cent in 2003, although the number of
acquisitions was 30 per cent higher than in 2002. A
significant transaction recorded during 2003 was
the acquisition of Debenhams by Baroness Retail
Ltd - a consortium of investors - for a reported
value of £1.7 billion.
Prices
Two main measures of consumer price inflation
are used in the United Kingdom:
■ the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), formerly
known as the UK Harmonised Index of
Consumer Prices (HICP), is the main
UK domestic measure of inflation for
macroeconomic purposes. HICPs are
calculated in each Member State of the
European Union for the purposes of
European comparisons; they are also used by
the European Central Bank as the measure of
price stability across the euro area (see also
text box below); and
■ the all items Retail Prices Index (RPI),
a general purpose measure of inflation whose
uses include indexation of pensions, state
benefits and index-linked gilts.
The inflation target
In his Pre-Budget Report statement in December
2003, the Chancellor of the Exchequer changed
the UK inflation target so that it was based on
the UK HICP, which the National Statistician has
renamed the CPI. The CPI inflation target was set
by the Government at 2 per cent, applying from
10 December 2003, although the Bank of
England has the task of meeting the target.
Formerly the Bank was required to meet an
inflation target of 2'h per cent based on the RPI
excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX)
measure of inflation. The change in target does
not affect pensions or benefits, which will
continue to be linked to changes in the RPI.
Both the CPI and RPI measure the average change
from month to month in the prices of goods and
services purchased in the United Kingdom,
although there are differences in coverage and
methodology. In particular, the CPI excludes
a number of items that are included in the RPI,
mainly related to housing, including council tax
and mortgage interest payments.
The CPI and RPI are compiled using a large and
representative ‘basket’ of over 650 goods and
services sampled each month to see how prices
are changing. Each year the composition of
this basket is reviewed, so that it remains
representative of consumer spending patterns. For
example, items may be added to represent new or
increasing areas of spending, while other items
may be deleted as spending on them falls. For the
2004 review, new items included digital cameras,
dishwasher tablets, fresh turkey steaks, fishing rods
and basic manicure, while mini-disc players,
dishwasher powder, frozen turkey and gin were
removed from the basket.

Annual RPI inflation has fluctuated considerably
in the last 25 years or so, peaking at 21.9 per cent
in the year to May 1980. However, it was much
lower in the 1990s, and since 1993 has been in a
relatively narrow range, from around 1 'h per cent
to 372 per cent. In 2003, it averaged 2.9 per cent,
up from 1.7 per cent in the previous year. RPIX,

averaged 2.2 per cent in 2002, increasing to 2.8 per
cent in 2003, above the Government’s former
target of 2'h per cent - set in May 1997.
The Government’s new target measure of
inflation, the CPI, averaged 1.4 per cent during
2003. The equivalent average index for the
European Union, HICP, was 2.0 per cent.
The input price index for materials and fuels
purchased by manufacturing industry rose by
1.3 per cent in 2003 following a 4.5 per cent fall
in 2002. Producer output price inflation was
1.5 per cent, compared with 0.1 per cent in 2002.
The experimental ONS Corporate Services Price
Index, which aims in the long run to be the service
sector equivalent of the manufacturing Producer
Prices Index, increased by 3.0 per cent (at the net
sector level) in 2003 compared with 1.9 per cent in
2002. The price of banking services showed the
greatest increase in 2003, rising by 7.7 per cent.
Labour market
UK employment reached 28.3 million in spring
2004, 206,000 higher than in the same period
a year earlier, and representing a working age
employment rate of 74.7 per cent. Unemployment
was 1,432,000, 52,000 less than a year earlier. The
rate of 4.8 per cent was well below the averages of
Long-run Composite Price Index
In February 2004, the Office for National
Statistics launched a new long-run Composite
Price Index that tracks the path of UK consumer
price inflation since 1750. It found that consumer
prices increased about 140-fold between 1750
and 2003, with most of the increase occurring
since the Second World War. Between 1750 and
1938, prices rose by a little over three times, but
since 1938, they have increased more than
fortyfold.
The United Kingdom has experienced periods of
significant inflation in earlier times. During the
Napoleonic Wars, prices jumped 50 per cent in
ten years reflecting poor harvest quality and the
impact of war. Since 1934 prices have increased
every year, with particularly rapid increases taking
place between 1973 and 1981 when oil price
rises impacted badly on the industrialised world.

Industrial and commercial policy
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
aims to increase UK competitiveness and scientific
excellence to generate higher levels of sustainable
growth and productivity.
Competitiveness
UK performance in improving productivity is
assessed in the DTI’s Productivity and
Competitiveness Indicators. The latest full update
of indicators was published in November 2003 and
is available on the DTI website. The indicators
measure UK performance in five key areas -
investment, innovation, skills, enterprise and
competition - against other G7 members and the
OECD. The 2003 indicators show that:
■ the United Kingdom had the fastest average
growth rate of GDP per head in the G7
between 1989-2002, largely due to strong
labour market performance;
■ UK macroeconomic stability had improved;
354
UK 2005
22 Economic framework
■ UK unemployment was the lowest in the G7;
and
■ the United Kingdom has an excellent science
base, with more published papers and
citations per head of population than any G7
country.
On the other hand, there are areas where UK
performance could improve, including:
■ investment, which continues to lag behind
that of its competitors;
■ innovation, where many aspects of UK
performance remain around or below
average; and
■ skills, where too few adults have the basic
vocational skills that allow them to engage
effectively in the economy.
In spring 2004 the DTI and HM Treasury
published a consultation document reviewing the
set of indicators used to monitor UK productivity
performance. The results of the consultation are
due to be published later in 2004.
In 2003 UK whole economy productivity growth
(measured by output per worker) was 1.0 per cent,
slightly higher than the 0.7 per cent recorded in
2002. An alternative measure, output per hour
worked, showed a 1.6 per cent increase in 2003,
compared with 1.8 per cent in 2002. Productivity
has increased more in production industries than
in the rest of the economy over the last ten years
(Table 22.10).
Enterprise, innovation and business
support
In September 2003 the DTI published its strategy
for raising productivity in the United Kingdom,
focusing on five key priorities: transferring
knowledge from the science base and between
businesses; maximising potential in the workplace;
extending competitive markets; strengthening
regional economies; and forging closer links with
key economic players at home and overseas. The
strategy includes increasing funding for science;
creating a new business-focused Technology
Strategy; implementing the new Skills Strategy
(see page 149); promoting diversity, flexible
working and partnership in the workplace; and
launching Consumer Direct (see page 480).
The Government believes that productivity is the
key to securing long-term growth in living

standards. The DTI aims to promote enterprise
and innovation by encouraging business start-ups,
and by increasing the capacity of business,
including small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) to grow, invest, develop skills, adopt best
practice, and exploit opportunities abroad. It
provides a range of grants, loan guarantees and
subsidised consultancy to address a range of
business issues through its Business Support
Solutions programmes.
Business Link is the national business advice
service, delivering independent advice, business
information and access to a wide network of
business support organisations throughout
England. It reports to the Small Business Service,
an agency of the DTI, which is responsible for
organising the delivery of help to SMEs. Similar
business support arrangements apply in other parts
of the United Kingdom, via Scottish Enterprise’s
Business Gateway for lowland Scotland, Elighlands
and Islands Enterprise, Business Eye for Wales and
Invest Northern Ireland.
Business finance
The Government is working in partnership with
the private sector to help address weaknesses in
the finance market for SMEs. Nine DTI products,
grouped into four themes, reflect the areas in
which businesses are most likely to need help:

the Grant for Investigating an Innovative Idea,
Grant for Research and Development, and
Selective Finance for Investment in England (see
page 357). In many cases similar schemes are
offered by the appropriate organisations in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. Products available
across the United Kingdom include Collaborative
Research and Development and the Small Firms
Loan Guarantee.
The Queen's Awards for Enterprise
The Queen’s Awards for Enterprise are the top UK
annual awards for business performance.
Successful organisations are entitled to use the
Queen’s Award emblem on their stationery,
packaging, goods and advertising. Valid for five
years, they are awarded for outstanding
achievement in three categories: international
trade, innovation and sustainable development. All
UK organisations operating regularly as a ‘business
unit’, and that can meet the criteria, are eligible to
apply. In 2004 a total of 112 Awards were
conferred — 66 for international trade, 39 for
innovation and 7 for sustainable development.
Information and communication
technology (ICT)
The e-Government Unit within the Cabinet Office,
works with departments to deliver efficiency
savings while improving the delivery of public
services by coordinating electronic government
services around the needs of customers. It also
provides sponsorship of Information Assurance
and is responsible for ensuring that all government
services will be available electronically by 2005
with key services achieving high levels of use. The
e-Government Unit has taken on the majority of
the work previously undertaken by the Office of
the e-Envoy.
By the end of the first quarter of 2004, 74 per cent
of 664 government services identified were online.
The Government’s new online service, Directgov
(www.direct.gov.uk), replaced UK online in May
2004. The new service is designed around the
needs of the user, with the intention of making it
easy to find and access government information
and services electronically. The new site contains
extensive content for motorists, parents, disabled
people and carers, together with broader
information for other groups, such as UK citizens
abroad and the over-50s. This will be expanded to
include content for householders, jobseekers and
adult learners. As well as government departments,
the site links to relevant third parties which can
offer additional advice and support.
According to the ONS e-commerce survey, 59 per
cent of businesses had access to the Internet in
2002, compared with 51 per cent in the previous
year. Larger businesses had greater ICT usage -
99 per cent of firms with 1,000 or more employees
had Internet access in 2002 compared with 56 per
cent of those with fewer than ten. Other key
findings for 2002 from the survey included:
■ 29 per cent of UK businesses had a website,
compared with 25 per cent in 2001;
■ broadband was the main type of Internet
connection for 14 per cent of UK businesses;
■ 4 per cent of UK businesses sold via the
Internet and 13 per cent bought via the
Internet; and
■ 66 per cent of UK companies had PCs and 51
per cent had email - both little changed from
2001.
UK businesses in the non-financial sector sold
£23.3 billion over the Internet in 2002, a rise of
39 per cent on the previous year (Table 22.11).
Other results from the 2002 ONS e-commerce
survey included:
■ the total sold online represented 1.2 per cent
of total sales both online and offline;
■ of the total sold online, £6.4 billion was to
households;
■ the share of total online sales by UK
businesses to households rose from 24 per
cent in 2001 to 27 per cent in 2002; and
■ goods continued to represent the largest share
of the value of Internet sales by UK businesses
(£15.4 billion). The sale of services online
accounted for the second largest share, at
£6.8 billion.
In addition:
■ UK businesses, excluding financial businesses,
bought £22.9 billion online - up 14 per cent
from £20.1 billion in 2001; and
■ the value of orders received over other
information and communication technologies
(that is, excluding the Internet) was
£169.1 billion in 2002 - a 6 per cent decrease
on 2001.

Regional policy and development
Government regional policy aims to build
economic success in the regions and boost
regional capacity for innovation and enterprise.
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)
has overall responsibility for regional policy in
England, while responsibility for the nine Regional
Development Agencies in England rests with the
DTI (see also chapter 2).
there are significant disparities from the national
average in unemployment, the employment rate,
or in the area’s dependency on manufacturing. It
also seeks to secure growth in productivity
(measured by GVA per workforce job) compared
with the sector and national averages; and higher
skills, with the majority of new jobs required to be
at National Vocational Qualification level 2 (or
equivalent) and above.
As an indicator of competitiveness within the
manufacturing, services and other sectors, GVA
per workforce job in 2001 ranged from £33,000 in
Scotland to £23,500 in Northern Ireland, averaging
£30,600 in the United Kingdom as a whole.
The headline figure of GVA per head (workplace
basis) in 2002 ranged from £15,600 in England to
£12,000 in Wales (Table 22.12). England, however,
had the smallest increase in GVA in 2002, growing
by 4.7 per cent on a per head basis, compared with
5.1 per cent in Northern Ireland. In these figures,
GVA allocates the income of commuters to where
they work, rather than where they live, so this may
artificially inflate the GVA per head estimates for
regions with a high level of inward commuting,
such as London.
The DTI provides direct financial assistance to
business. Until the end of March 2004 the DTI
channelled funds via the Regional Selective
Assistance programme and Enterprise Grants.
However, from April 2004, they were replaced in
the English Assisted Areas by Selective Finance for
Investment in England.
The new scheme aims to secure employment
opportunities and increase regional
competitiveness and prosperity in areas where

Structural Funds, which account for over one-
third of the European Union budget, are the main
instruments for supporting social and economic
restructuring across the EU. The UK allocation for
the period 2000-06 is over £10 billion. Regions
may have access to up to four funds, depending
on their Objective status (see below). These funds
comprise the European Regional Development

Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and the Financial
Instrument for Fisheries Guidance.
The ERDF aims to improve economic prosperity
and social inclusion by investing in projects to
promote development and encourage the
diversification of industry into other sectors. It is
available in Objective 1 and 2 areas. The ESF funds
training, human resources development and equal
opportunities schemes in both Objective 1 and 3
areas. In Objective 2 areas it can be used to
complement the ERDF activities.
Objective 1 status is the highest level of regional
funding available from the EU. Eligible areas are
those with less than 75 per cent of EU average
GDP. Funding is aimed at promoting development
and structural adjustment. In the United
Kingdom, the qualifying areas are Cornwall and
the Isles of Scilly; Merseyside; South Yorkshire; and
West Wales and the Valleys.
In addition, the United Kingdom has two
transitional4 Objective 1 areas: the Scottish
Highlands and Islands, and Northern Ireland
(which also qualifies for a unique PEACE
programme — see page 37). In total, the United
Kingdom will receive over £3.9 billion of Objective
1 money between 2000 and 2006.
Objective 2 status is the second highest level of
funding available from the EU. It aims to support
the economic and social conversion of areas facing
structural difficulties. Areas qualify under four
main strands - industrial, rural, urban and
fisheries. This objective covers nearly 14 million
people in the United Kingdom and a further
5 million are covered by transitional programmes.
The United Kingdom will receive over
£3.1 billion for Objective 2 (including transitional
arrangements) over the period 2000-06.
Objective 3, which applies to all areas, involves
only the ESF and operates outside Objective 1 and
2 areas.
Between March and July 2003 the DTI, HM Treasury
and ODPM held a joint UK-wide consultation on
the future of the Structural Funds after 2006. In
December 2003, the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry announced the Government’s proposed
approach to the reform of the funds, advocating in
particular a substantial devolution and

Competitive markets
Enterprise Act 2002
The Enterprise Act 2002 included a range of
measures designed to strengthen UK competition
law and consumer enforcement frameworks,
transform its approach to bankruptcy and
corporate rescue, and benefit consumers. The Act
built on the Competition Act 1998, insolvency
reforms and measures already implemented from
the 1999 White Paper Modern Markets: Confident
Consumers. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT)
became a corporate body in April 2003 and a new
statutory board took on the role of Director
General of Fair Trading. The Act also established
an independent Competition Appeal Tribunal.
Most of the substantive consumer and
competition provisions of the 2002 Act came
into force on 20 June 2003.
Office of Fair Trading
The OFT plays a leading role in promoting and
protecting consumer interests throughout the
United Kingdom, while ensuring that businesses
are fair and competitive.
Its work is structured into three areas:
■ markets and policy initiatives — where there
are doubts that markets or market practices
are working well, it will carry out market
studies, consider super-complaints made
by designated consumer bodies, liaise
regularly with interested parties, gather
information and market intelligence, and
provide advice on new legislation and policy
initiatives;
■ consumer regulation enforcement — tackling
rogue traders, eliminating unfair trading
practices, approving consumer codes of
practice and licensing certain traders; and
■ competition enforcement - safeguarding
competition by enforcing legislation,
including action under the Competition Act
1998 against anti-competitive behaviour and
agreements, and decisions on mergers.

Sectoral regulators
A number of bodies regulate particular industries
or sectors formerly in public ownership, including
Ofgem (see page 450), OFWAT (see page 456),
Ofcom (see page 262) and ORR (see page 332).
Each regulator has the power to apply and enforce
the Competition Act 1998 to deal with anti¬
competitive agreements or abuse of market
dominance relating to relevant activities in their
designated sector.
Since May 2004, the OFT and utility regulators
have been applying EC competition law as well as
national competition law in the United Kingdom.
To ensure consistency, the OFT and the utility
regulators are members of the European
Competition Network (together with the
European Commission and all the competition
authorities in other Member States which have
been designated to apply EC competition law).
Competition Commission
The Competition Commission is an independent
public body established under the Competition Act
1998. It conducts in-depth inquiries into:
■ mergers (both anticipated and completed);
■ markets (the successor to monopoly
inquiries); and
■ the regulation, including price regulation,
of the major regulated industries.
The OFT and those utility regulators that have
concurrent powers also examine markets and may
make a reference to the Competition Commission
to decide whether a feature or combination of
features of a market in the United Kingdom for
goods and services prevents, restricts or distorts
competition.
The Enterprise Act 2002 (see page 358) has
enhanced the role of the Commission in most
merger and market investigation inquiries, making
it responsible for decisions on competition
questions and for making and implementing
decisions on appropriate remedies. Every inquiry
the Commission undertakes is in response to a
reference made to it by another authority. Since
the Act was implemented this is usually the OFT,
but references may also be made by the Secretary
of State for Trade and Industry, or by sectoral
regulators. The Commission has no power to
conduct inquiries on its own initiative. During
2003/04, it completed work on eight merger
references and one monopoly reference.
Mergers and markets
The OFT has a duty to make a reference to the
Commission if it believes there is or may be a
relevant merger situation5 that has resulted or may
be expected to result in a substantial lessening of
competition within any market or markets in the
United Kingdom for goods and services.
Exceptionally, the Secretary of State can intervene
in the consideration of a merger if this might raise
a ‘public interest consideration’ specified by the
Enterprise Act 2002, such as national security. The
Secretary of State can serve a European
intervention notice in cases where the competition
issues have an EC dimension and fall under the EC
Merger Regulation. This might occur if measures
were being considered to protect legitimate
interests such as public security.
The special provisions for newspaper mergers were
changed by the Communications Act 2003 (see
chapter 17). This Act defined mergers involving
newspapers and broadcasting enterprises as media
mergers and set out specific public interest
considerations. The Commission will now
consider media mergers as it does other mergers
5 A merger qualifies for investigation if either the value of the UK
turnover of the enterprise acquired (or to be acquired) exceeds
£70 million or if the share of supply of goods or services in the
United Kingdom (or a substantial part of the United Kingdom) is
at least 25 per cent as a result of the merger.

unless the Secretary of State intervenes to apply

Corporate affairs
There were an estimated 4.0 million private sector
enterprises in the United Kingdom at the start of
2003 (Table 22.14). The 6,075 large companies
(those with 250 or more employees) accounted for
an estimated 42 per cent of private sector
employment, and for 48 per cent of private sector
turnover.
According to a Financial Times survey of the
world’s 500 largest companies published in May
2004, 36 of the companies are UK-owned and they
have a combined market capitalisation of
US$1,439 billion. Of the top ten UK companies by
market capitalisation, three were banks and there
were two each in oil and gas, and in
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology (Table 22.15).
BP, the biggest UK company, was the ninth largest
in the world and the second largest oil and gas
company. In the other most valuable sectors, by
market capitalisation:
■ the United Kingdom had two representatives
in the world’s top ten banks - HSBC Holdings
and Royal Bank of Scotland;

22 Economic framework
Over 3,000 UK enterprises employed 500 or more
people (Table 22.14), accounting for just 0.1 per
cent of total enterprises, but representing 37 per
cent of total employment and 40 per cent of
turnover.
Small firms play an important part in the UK
economy. Around 46 per cent of the private sector
workforce in 2003 worked in companies
employing fewer than 50 people. Nearly 2.9
million enterprises were sole proprietorships or
partnerships without employees, while a further
760,000 enterprises employed one to four people.
Together these 3.6 million enterprises accounted
for 90 per cent of enterprises, 25 per cent of
employment and 17 per cent of turnover.
The number of enterprises in the United Kingdom
registering for value added tax (VAT) increased by
1,200 or 0.7 per cent between 2001 and 2002,
while those de-registering increased by 8,900 or
5.3 per cent (Table 22.16). In 2002, in most sectors
there was a slight increase or no change in the
number of new registrations compared with 2001.
Manufacturing, transport and communications,
finance and other services all experienced small
falls. The largest net losses were in wholesale, retail
and repairs where de-registrations exceeded
registrations by 5,400, and in manufacturing,
where there was a net loss of 5,000 businesses. The
largest net gain was in business services where the
number of VAT-registered businesses rose by 6,200.
This industry sector grew by almost 190,000 in the
nine years to 2002 to 494,000, or 28 per cent of all
UK VAT-registered businesses at the start of 2003.
Company profitability
Company profitability for all UK private non-
financial companies, in terms of the net rate of
return on capital employed, was 13.0 per cent in
2003, above the 12.1 per cent recorded in 2002
(Figure 22.17). Among the individual sectors:
■ manufacturing companies’ net rate of return
increased to 7.0 per cent, compared with
6.6 per cent in the previous year;
■ service companies’ net rate of return was
15.9 per cent, compared with 15.4 per cent
in 2002; and
■ the net rate of return of UK Continental
Shelf companies was 29.9 per cent, compared
with 30.7 per cent in 2002.
Corporate structure
At the end of August 2004 there were 1,792,918
companies on the Companies House active

22 Economic framework
UK 2005
corporate businesses are ‘limited liability’
companies - the liability of members is restricted
to contributing an amount related to their
shareholding (or to their guarantee where
companies are limited by guarantee). Businesses
can also be incorporated as limited liability
partnerships, with the organisational flexibility
and tax status of a partnership but with limited
liability for their members.
Companies may be either public or private. Certain
conditions must be satisfied before they can become
pics - they must be limited by shares and meet
specified minimum capital requirements. Private
companies are generally prohibited from offering
their shares to the public.
Company law and corporate governance
Company law is designed to meet the need for
proper regulation of business, to maintain open
markets and to create safeguards for those wishing
to invest in companies or do business with them.
It takes account of EC Directives on company law,
and on company and group accounts and their
auditing.
A quoted company is required, as part of the
annual reporting cycle, to publish a report on
directors’ remuneration. This must include full
details, including the performance criteria for
share options and long-term incentive schemes, a
justification of any compensation payments when
a contract is terminated, and a graph showing
company performance. A company must put a
resolution to shareholders on this remuneration
report at each annual general meeting.
A fundamental revision of company law in Great
Britain has been under way following an
independent three-year review. The aim of the
review was to develop a simple, modern, efficient
and cost-effective framework for business activity
in Great Britain. The Government published its
response to the review’s major recommendations
and set out in 2002 its core proposals for reform in
a White Paper, Modernising Company Law.
The Companies (Audit, Investigations and
Community Enterprise) Bill was published in
December 2003. It aims to improve confidence in
companies and financial markets, following recent
corporate failures, and to promote social
enterprise. Part one of the Bill strengthens the
system of regulating auditors, the enforcement of
accounting and reporting requirements and the
company investigations regime. Part two provides
for community interest companies (CICs). These
would be a new type of company, designed for
social enterprises that want to use their profits and
assets for the public good.
In 2002 the Government commissioned an
independent review of the role and effectiveness
of company non-executive directors. The Higgs
Review reported in January 2003. It recommended
changes to the ‘Combined Code’ on corporate
governance to require a greater proportion of
independent, better-informed individuals on a
company’s board. The new Code requires greater
transparency and accountability in the
boardroom, formal performance appraisal, and
closer relationships between non-executive
directors and shareholders. The report calls for
boards to put in place a more rigorous
appointments process. The Financial Reporting
Council agreed the final text of the new Code,
which came into effect for reporting years
beginning after 1 November 2003.
Insolvency
The Insolvency Service, an executive agency of the
DTI, deals with insolvency matters in England and
Wales and some limited insolvency matters in
Scotland. Its role is to ensure fair, dynamic and
competitive markets in which everyone can be
confident in participating. It does this by ensuring
that financial failure is dealt with fairly and
effectively and by detecting and deterring fraud
and financial misconduct. In Scotland, Accountant
in Bankruptcy is an executive agency of the
Scottish Executive Justice Department. The
Northern Ireland Insolvency Service operates
within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
Investment.
There was a 13 per cent fall in company
insolvencies in England and Wales in 2003; in
Scotland, where insolvencies are defined
differently, the decline was 20 per cent. The
number of individual insolvencies in England
and Wales rose by 19 per cent (Table 22.18).
The Enterprise Act 2002 contained provisions to
modernise insolvency law in England and Wales in
the areas of both individual and corporate
insolvency. These provisions included.

bankrupts and removing outdated statutory

Scotland. This is intended to modernise the
bankruptcy laws to reduce the stigma of
bankruptcy, encourage business restarts and

Regulation of business
The Cabinet Office’s Regulatory Impact Unit
(RIU) aims to ensure all new and existing
regulation is necessary, to meet the principles of
better regulation, and to impose the minimum
burden. The RIU reports to the Minister for the
Cabinet Office and assists government ministers
to ensure that regulations are fair and effective. It
takes an overview of regulations affecting business,
the voluntary sector, charities and the public
sector.
The Unit’s work involves promoting the principles
of good regulation; removing unnecessary or over-
burdensome legislation under the Regulatory
Reform Act 2001; improving assessment, drawing
up and enforcement of regulation; taking account
of the needs of business; identifying risk and
assessing options to deal with risk; responsibility
for the Cabinet Office Code of Practice on
Consultation; and supporting the Better
Regulation Task Force. This Task Force is an
independent body that makes recommendations
to Government on the quality of existing or
proposed regulations, and carries out studies of
particular regulatory issues.
Industrial associations
Trade associations represent companies that
produce or sell a particular product or group of
products. They exist to supply common services,
regulate trading practices and represent their
members in dealings with government
departments. A range of other organisations exists
to represent the views of business and to provide
advice and assistance.
The CBI (Confederation of British Industry)
was founded in 1965 and is the largest business
organisation in the United Kingdom. Membership
is corporate, comprising companies and trade
associations - its direct corporate members
employ over 4 million people, and its trade
association membership represents over 6 million
people in some 200,000 firms. The CBI’s objective
is to help create and sustain the conditions in
which business can compete and prosper, both in
the United Kingdom and overseas. It is the UK
member of the Union of Industrial and
Employers’ Confederations and has offices in
Brussels and Washington as well as 12 UK regional
offices.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) is the
national network for chambers of commerce,
which are local, independent, non-profit-making
organisations funded by membership
subscriptions. In June 2004 over 135,000
businesses were members of Chambers in its
accredited network. With over 2,500 staff covering
more than 100 locations, the network provides a
363
22 Economic framework
UK 2005
support team to businesses throughout the United
Kingdom. The BCC represents business views to
the Government at local, regional and national
levels and is also part of the global network of
Chambers of Commerce. It publishes a quarterly
economic survey of UK businesses.

counselling, and represents the interests of
members to authorities in the United Kingdom
and EU. It had almost 53,500 members at the end
of 2003.
The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) is the
largest campaigning pressure group promoting
and protecting the interests of the self-employed
and owners of small firms. It has over 185,000
members, and provides them with information
and guidance on subjects such as taxation,
employment, health and safety, and insurance.
Enterprise Insight is a government-supported
initiative and a joint venture between the BCC,
CBI, FSB and loD. It aims to encourage more
positive attitudes to enterprise among young
people aged 5 to 30 and to develop their
entrepreneurial skills. It will be holding the first
national Enterprise Week during November 2004.

Total UK government spending is expected to be
around £488 billion in 2004/05, and public sector
current receipts are forecast to be £455 billion
(Table 23.1). Social protection (see chapter 12) is
the biggest single element of public spending,
involving expenditure of £138 billion (28 per cent
of total public spending) in 2004/05, followed by
spending on health of £81 billion, and by spending
on education of £63 billion.
In 2003/04 there was a deficit of £20.3 billion on
the public sector current budget, compared with a
deficit of £13.9 billion in 2002/03 (Table 23.2).
Public sector net borrowing was £34.0 billion in
2003/04, 35 per cent higher than in 2002/03.
Public sector net investment rose by 21 per cent in
2003/04 to £13.7 billion.
Fiscal policy framework
The fiscal policy framework is designed to ensure
sound public finances, which are a prerequisite for
sustainable investment in public services. The
Code for Fiscal Stability sets out the five key
principles of fiscal management - transparency,
stability, responsibility, fairness and efficiency -
and government objectives are implemented
through two fiscal rules that are the foundation of
the spending framework and are designed to
promote economic stability:
■ the golden rule: over the economic cycle, the
Government will borrow only to invest and
not to fund current spending; and
■ the sustainable investment rule: public sector
net debt as a proportion of gross domestic
product (GDP) will be held over the
economic cycle at a stable and prudent level -
generally below 40 per cent of GDP.
The fiscal framework recognises that projections
of public finances involve a considerable element
of uncertainty. Projections are therefore based on
cautious assumptions for key economic variables,

Public spending framework
Public expenditure is measured across the whole
public sector using aggregate Total Managed
Expenditure (TME). TME is the sum of public
sector current expenditure, public sector net
investment and public sector depreciation. For
budgeting purposes, TME is split into:
■ Departmental Expenditure Limits (DELs),
which are three-year spending limits for
government departments; and
■ Annually Managed Expenditure (AME),
which covers those elements of spending
that cannot reasonably be subject to firm
multi-year pre-set limits and are instead
subject to scrutiny twice a year as part of
the Budget process (see chapter 22).
To improve long-term planning and protect
capital investment, DELs are further divided into
capital and resource (current) budgets, and these
are managed separately.
The framework for managing public expenditure
includes incentives for departments to plan for the
long term and to ensure that resources are used as
effectively and efficiently as possible. Features of
the framework include:
■ firm three-year plans for public spending,
which are reviewed every two years;
■ flexibility to allow departments to carry over
unspent resources into future financial years,
so reducing wasteful end-of-year spending
surges;
■ Public Service Agreements, through which
each department is committed to achieve
challenging targets;
■ Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB),
with public expenditure planned, controlled
and reported on a full resource basis, in line
with best commercial practice, and
departmental investment strategies, with an
emphasis on asset management and estate
rationalisation in departments; and
■ administration cost limits for government
departments.
Public expenditure
TME rose in terms of constant (2004/05) prices
from £253.4 billion in 1973/74 to £469.6 billion in
2003/04 (Table 23.3). During this period TME
peaked as a proportion of GDP at 49.9 per cent in
1975/76. By 1999/2000 this had fallen to 37.4 per
cent, before rising to 41.1 per cent in 2003/04.
UK local authorities are estimated to have spent
nearly £120 billion in 2003/04, around a quarter of
TME. The main categories of local government
current and capital expenditure are education and

2004 Spending Review
The 2004 Spending Review, published in July 2004,
sets public spending plans in the United Kingdom
for the three years to 2007/08 within the overall
spending limits set in the Budget in March 2004.
These allow:
■ current spending to increase by an annual
average of 2.5 per cent in real terms in 2006/07
and 2007/08; and
■ public sector net investment to rise from
2 per cent of GDP in 2004/05 to 2'U per cent
by 2007/08.
The growth rate of overall public spending and
departmental spending is lower than in the 2002
Spending Review. However, the Government's
objective is to maintain the growth in front-line
public services, and it plans to achieve this through
cutting administration costs in real terms and
achieving planned efficiency gains of 2.5 per cent
a year over the period of the 2004 Spending Review
(see below and page 58).
The allocation of resources in the 2004 Spending
Review is intended to:
■ deliver world-class public services that enhance
opportunity for all;
■ equip the United Kingdom to meet the
challenges of the global economy;
■ strengthen communities and build a fairer
society; and
■ enhance the United Kingdom's security, and
promote stability and prosperity around the
world.
training, social protection, public order and safety,
transport, environmental protection, general
public services, and housing and community
amenities.
Public expenditure is planned and controlled on a
departmental basis, except where devolved
responsibility lies with the Scottish Parliament, the
National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland
Assembly (when it is sitting) or local authorities.
Table 23.6 shows expenditure in 2002/03 when
Taking into account locally financed expenditure,
spending on the key priorities of education, health,
social services, transport, housing and criminal justice
will account for about three-quarters of the total
extra planned spending. The 2004 Spending Review
includes:
■ greater investment in learning and skills, with, for
example, total spending on education in England
£12 billion higher in 2007/08 than in 2004/05;
■ confirmation of the increased resources for health
announced in the 2002 Budget, with UK health
spending.growing by an annual average of 7.2 per
cent in real terms between 2002/03 and 2007/08;
■ investment in transport, with additional resources
to put the railways on a sustainable footing;
■ a major programme of investment in affordable
and decent housing, including a 50 per cent
increase in new building in the social sector;
■ spending on crime and justice to be £3.5 billion
higher in 2007/08 than in 2004/05;
■ spending on science to grow by an average of
5.8 per cent a year in real terms - a ten-year
investment framework for science and innovation
(see page 389) was published alongside the
Spending Review;
■ additional resources to support the Government's
commitment to tackling global poverty, with
development spending rising to nearly
£6.5 billion in 2007/08, representing a ratio
of official development assistance to Gross
National Income of 0.47 per cent; and
■ over £1 billion more for counter-terrorism by
2007/08.

The OGC also has a key role in helping
departments and other government bodies to
implement the property, estate management, and
other locational and workspace issues arising from
the Lyons Review of the scope for relocating Civil
Service posts out of London and the South East
(see page 58).
Examination of public expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is carried out
by select committees of the House of Commons.
The committees study in detail the activities of
particular government departments and question
ministers and officials. The Public Accounts
Committee considers the accounts of government
departments, executive agencies and other public
sector bodies, and examines reports by the
Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) on
the way in which they have used their resources.
review of public sector efficiency by Sir Peter
Gershon:
■ agreed departmental targets for achieving
annual efficiencies of over £20 billion a year
by 2007/08;
■ departmental plans for meeting these agreed
targets, including proposals for a gross
reduction of over 84,000 Civil Service posts
and the relocation of 20,000 other Civil
Service posts away from London and the
South East (see page 58);
■ administration budgets for departments that
will reduce administration costs as a
proportion of spending to a record low; and
■ a framework under the leadership of the chief
executive of the Office of Government
Commerce (OGC) for implementing,
measuring and monitoring the Government’s
efficiency programme.
Audit of government spending is conducted by the
C&AG, an officer of the House of Commons and
head of the National Audit Office (NAO), the
principal state audit body in the United Kingdom.
The C&AG and the NAO are independent of
government. The C&AG certifies the accounts
of all government departments and executive
agencies, and those of many other bodies receiving
public funds. The C&AG also has statutory
authority to report to Parliament on the economy,
efficiency and effectiveness with which
departments and other public bodies have used
their resources. In 2003/04 the NAO audited over
£700 billion of government expenditure and
revenue.
The Audit Commission is responsible for
appointing the auditors for local authorities and
health service bodies in England and Wales and for
promoting VFM in these sectors. There are
separate audit bodies dealing with the expenditure

Public-private partnerships
The Government sees public-private partnerships
(PPPs) as an important part of the delivery of
high-quality public services. PPPs cover a variety
of arrangements, including:
■ the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), in which
the public sector contracts to purchase
services, such as the construction and
operation of public services infrastructure on
a long-term basis;
■ the introduction of private sector ownership
and enterprise into state-owned businesses;
and
■ the sale of government services into wider
markets, using private sector expertise and
capital to exploit the commercial potential of
government assets.
Among the largest PPPs are a £16 billion
infrastructure investment programme for the
London Underground (see page 335) and the PPP
for air traffic control (see page 338), which is
providing around £1 billion for investment in new
technology. In Scotland the Scottish schools PPP
programme is providing some £2.4 billion of new
and modernised schools.
Debt and reserves management
The Government meets its borrowing needs by
selling debt to the private sector. At the end of the
financial year 2003/04 the stock of UK public
sector net debt was £376 billion (see Table 23.2),
nearly £34 billion higher than at the end of
2002/03. Net debt was 32.8 per cent of GDP at the
end of 2003/04. In 2003 the United Kingdom had
the lowest debt of any Group of Seven (G7) country
in terms of general government net financial
liabilities as a percentage of nominal GDP.
The objective of the Government’s debt
management policy is to minimise, over the long
term, the cost of meeting the Government’s
financing needs, taking into account risk while
ensuring that debt management policy is
consistent with the aims of monetary policy.
Operational responsibility for managing
government debt rests with a Treasury agency, the
UK Debt Management Office (DMO).
Gilt-edged stock
A gilt is a UK Government security issued by HM
Treasury. The term ‘gilt’ (or ‘gilt-edged’) is a
reference to the security of the investment; the UK
Government has never failed to make interest or
principal payments on gilts. Gilts include
‘conventionals’, which represent a guarantee by the
Government to pay the holder a fixed cash
payment (coupon) every six months until the
maturity date, when the holder receives the final
coupon payment and the return of the principal;
and index-linked stocks, on which both principal
and interest payments are adjusted in line with
movements in the Retail Prices Index (see page
353). The DMO, on behalf of the Government, is
aiming for gilts sales of about £47 billion in
2004/05. Gilts are issued primarily by auction, and
the DMO plans to hold 15 auctions of
conventional gilts and ten of index-linked gilts in
2004/05.
At the end of March 2004 holdings of central
government marketable securities were estimated
at £340.3 billion: £240.5 billion of conventional
gilts, £80.5 billion of index-linked gilts and
£19.3 billion of Treasury Bills (short-term
securities issued as part of the DMO’s cash
management operations). Insurance companies
and pension funds held 63.5 per cent of gilts at the
end of March 2004, other UK financial institutions
7.8 per cent, UK households 8.3 per cent, local
authorities and public corporations 0.9 per cent
and holders in the rest of the world 19.4 per cent.
Official reserves
The United Kingdom holds official reserves of
gold, foreign currency assets and International
Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Drawing Rights
(SDRs). Apart from SDR assets that constitute the
UK reserve tranche position at the IMF, these are
held in the Exchange Equalisation Account (EEA).
The Bank of England, acting as the Treasury’s
agent, manages the EEA by carrying out day-to-
370
UK 2005
23 Public finance
day tasks, such as foreign exchange dealing and
portfolio investment, within the framework of an
annual remit set by the Treasury.
At the end of June 2004 UK gross official holdings
of international reserves totalled US$44.9 billion,
including US$17.4 billion of euro, US$12.5 billion
of US dollars, US$6.0 billion of SDRs, US$5.1 billion
of Japanese yen and US$4.0 billion of gold. After
deducting liabilities of US$27.3 billion, the net
reserves totalled US$17.6 billion, US$1.2 billion
higher than a year earlier.
Main sources of revenue
Government revenue is forecast to be £455 billion
in 2004/05. The main sources (Table 23.1) are:
■ taxes on income (together with profits),
which include personal income tax,
corporation tax and petroleum revenue tax
(see page 372);
■ taxes on expenditure, which include VAT
(value added tax) and customs and excise
duties;
■ National Insurance contributions (NICs); and
■ taxes on capital, which include inheritance
tax, capital gains tax, council tax and business
rates (also known as non-domestic rates).
Taxation policy
The Government is committed to a modern and
fair tax system that encourages work and saving,
keeps pace with developments in business practice

Under the self-assessment system for collecting
personal taxation, around 9.3 million people -
primarily higher-rate taxpayers, the self-employed
and those receiving investment income - are
required to complete an annual tax return for the
Inland Revenue. Such taxpayers may calculate
their own tax liability, although they can choose to
have the calculations done by the Inland Revenue
if they return the form by the end of September.
About 1.1 million people submitted their tax
returns to the Inland Revenue electronically in
2003/04. A shorter self-assessment tax return is
being introduced for those with simple tax affairs.
The United Kingdom has agreements governing
double taxation with over 100 countries. They are
intended to avoid double taxation arising, to deal
with cross-border economic activity, and to
prevent fiscal discrimination against UK business
interests overseas. They also include provisions to
counter tax avoidance and evasion.
Protecting tax revenues
The 2004 Budget contained measures to tackle tax
avoidance, protect revenue and maintain the
integrity of the tax system including:
■ the closure of loopholes in partnerships,
finance leasing and VAT, and a new
requirement for accountancy firms and others
involved in promoting certain tax avoidance
schemes to register the schemes with the
Inland Revenue or, for VAT avoidance
schemes, with HM Customs and Excise;
■ measures to tackle complex schemes using
trusts for the purposes of avoiding taxes (such
as avoiding inheritance tax by giving away an
asset while continuing to enjoy its benefits);
■ a new minimum rate of corporation tax on
distributed profits (see page 373), designed to
deter the self-employed from adopting a
corporate legal form for tax reasons rather
than as a step to expansion; and
■ the introduction from 2006 of a system of
duty stamps for spirits, designed to prevent
losses from fraud on spirits.
Taxes on income
Income tax
Income tax is charged on all income originating in
the United Kingdom - although some forms, such
as child benefit, are exempt - and on all income
arising abroad of people resident in the United
Kingdom. Income tax is imposed for the year of
assessment beginning on 6 April. The tax rates and
bands for 2003/04 and 2004/05 are shown in Table
23.9. In 2004/05 there are an estimated 29.9
million income taxpayers, including 3.4 million at
Integration of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise
In March 2004 the Government announced that it
had accepted in full recommendations to integrate
the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise. The
two departments employed nearly 100,000 people
in 2003/04 and handled almost £325 billion of tax
collected in 2002/03: 86 per cent of UK net tax and
social security contributions.
The Inland Revenue is responsible for collecting
income tax; corporation tax; capital gains tax;
inheritance tax; petroleum revenue tax; and stamp
duties, and is responsible for NICs and tax credits.
HM Customs and Excise collects VAT; customs duties;
insurance premium tax; excise duties on fuel,
alcohol, tobacco, and betting and gaming; and a
range of environmental taxes. It also has a frontier
protection role, which makes it responsible for
controlling imports and exports.
The Government plans to introduce legislation for
the creation of the new department, which will be
known as HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). A new
executive chairman has been appointed jointly to
head both departments from September 2004. There
are separate plans to transfer counter-drugs work
from the new department to the new Serious
Organised Crime Agency (see page 206).
Development of strategic tax policy will become the
responsibility of HM Treasury (supported by HMRC),
while HMRC will lead on policy maintenance and
delivery issues. The integration of the two
departments and proposed efficiency reforms could
create scope for overall savings of up to 16,000 jobs
by the end of 2007/08. Some 3,500 of these jobs
would be redeployed within HMRC, producing a net
reduction in posts of 12,500.

basic rate of 22 per cent, 3.4 million at the higher
rate of 40 per cent (32.5 per cent on dividends)
and about 840,000 with a marginal rate at the
20 per cent lower rate for savings income or the
10 per cent ordinary dividend rate.
Allowances and reliefs reduce an individual’s
income tax liability. All taxpayers are entitled to
a personal allowance against income from all
sources, with a higher allowance for the elderly
(see Table 23.9).
One of the most significant reliefs, which is
designed to encourage people to save towards their
retirement, covers contributions to pension
schemes. The Finance Act 2004 includes provisions
to implement the Government’s arrangements for
simplifying the taxation of pensions, which will
take effect in April 2006. A single set of rules will
replace the eight different sets of tax rules, and
there will be a single lifetime allowance on the
amount of pension savings that can benefit
from tax relief. This allowance will initially be
£1.5 million, rising to £1.8 million by 2010.

Corporation tax
Corporation tax is payable by companies on their
income and capital gains. The main rate of
corporation tax in the United Kingdom is 30 per
cent, which is levied on companies with annual
profits of over £1.5 million. The small companies’
rate is 19 per cent, levied on firms with annual
profits of between £50,001 and £300,000. There is
a zero starting rate, so that companies with annual
profits of up to £10,000 do not pay corporation tax.
A sliding scale of relief is allowed for companies
with annual profits of between £10,001 and £50,000
and between £300,001 and £1.5 million, so that the
overall average rate paid by these firms is up to
19 per cent and between 19 per cent and 30 per
cent respectively. In the March 2004 Budget the
Government announced that there would be no
change in these rates, but from 1 April 2004 there
would be a minimum rate of 19 per cent on profits
distributed to individuals; businesses reinvesting
their profits or with taxable profits of over £50,000
are not affected by this measure.
Some capital expenditure - on plant and
machinery, industrial buildings and agricultural
buildings, for example - may qualify for relief in
the form of capital allowances, and there are tax
credits to encourage research and development. In
the March 2004 Budget the first-year allowance of
40 per cent for expenditure on plant or machinery
by small or medium-sized businesses was
increased to 50 per cent for one year from 1 April
2004. This is intended to assist the cash flow of
small businesses and to provide higher funding for
new investment.
Taxes on capital
Capital gains tax
Capital gains tax (CGT) is payable by individuals,
personal representatives of deceased people, and
trusts on gains realised from the disposal of assets.
It is payable on the amount by which total
chargeable gains for a year exceed the exempt
amount (£8,200 for individuals and £4,100 for
most trusts in 2004/05, up from £7,900 and £3,950
respectively in 2003/04). Subject to conditions,
gains on some types of asset are exempt from
CGT, including the principal private residence, a
private car, UK government gilt-edged securities,
and gains on assets held in a Personal Equity Plan
or an Individual Savings Account (see page 469).
For individuals, CGT in 2004/05 will be payable at
373
23 Public finance
UK 2005
10, 20 or 40 per cent, depending on a person’s
marginal income tax rate.
CGT taper relief reduces the amount of the
chargeable gain depending on how long an asset
has been held, with a higher rate of relief for
business assets than for non-business assets.
Inheritance tax
Inheritance tax is essentially charged on estates at
the time of death and on gifts made within seven
years of death; most other lifetime transfers are
not taxed. There are several important exemptions
from inheritance tax, including transfers between
spouses, and gifts and bequests to UK charities,
major political parties and heritage bodies. In
general, business assets and farmland are exempt
from inheritance tax, so that most family
businesses can be passed on without a tax charge.
Tax is charged at a single rate of 40 per cent above
a threshold (£263,000 in 2004/05, up from
£255,000 in 2003/04). About 5 per cent of estates
each year become liable for an inheritance tax bill.
National Insurance contributions
Most people who work pay NICs. There are four
main classes of NICs: Class 1 (paid by employees
and their employers); Class 2 (paid by the self-
employed); Class 3 (voluntary contributions paid
to safeguard the rights to some benefits); and Class
4 (paid by the self-employed on their taxable
profits above a set lower limit and paid in addition
to their Class 2 contributions).
Employees with earnings below £79 a week in
2004/05 do not pay Class 1 contributions. There are
rebates where employees are in their employer’s
pension scheme and this is contracted out of the
State Second Pension (see page 164).
Taxes on expenditure
Value added tax (VAT)
VAT is a tax on consumer expenditure and is
collected at each stage in the production and
distribution of goods and services. The final tax is
payable by the consumer. The standard rate is
17.5 per cent. Certain goods and services are
relieved from VAT, either by being charged at a zero
rate or by being exempt, and there is a reduced rate
of 5 per cent on certain goods and services:

volunteer development workers, of £2.70 and £3.95 a week
respectively in 2004/05.

■ Under zero rating, a taxable person does not
charge tax to a customer but reclaims any VAT
paid to suppliers. Among the main categories
where this applies are goods exported to other
European Union (EU) countries; most foods;
water and sewerage for non-business use;
passenger transport; books, newspapers and
periodicals; construction of new residential
buildings; young children’s clothing and
footwear; drugs and medicines supplied on
prescription; specified aids for handicapped
people; and certain supplies by or to charities.
■ For exempt goods or services, a taxable
person does not charge any VAT but is not
entitled to reclaim the VAT on goods and
services bought for his or her business. The
main categories where this applies are many
supplies of land and buildings; financial
services; postal services; betting and gaming
(apart from some exceptions); lotteries; much
education and training; health and welfare;
and, since 1 June 2004, admission charges to
many cultural attractions, such as theatres,
galleries, zoos and museums.
The reduced rate of 5 per cent applies to a number
of goods and services, including domestic fuel and
power, certain types of property conversion,
children’s car seats, women’s sanitary products,
and the installation of energy-saving materials
in homes.

From April 2004 the annual level of turnover
above which traders must register for VAT was
raised from £56,000 to £58,000. Other measures
in the 2004 Budget included raising the turnover
limit for the annual accounting scheme, which
allows businesses to make one VAT return each
year instead of the usual four, from £600,000 to
£660,000 a year.
Environmental and transport taxes
There are a number of environmental and
transport taxes:
■ Vehicle excise duty (VED): since March
2001 VED for new cars has been determined
according to the carbon dioxide (C02)
emissions of the vehicle and the type of fuel
used. There are six VED bands for new cars
(Table 23.11). For cars registered before
1 March 2001, VED is determined according
to engine size. The standard rate is £165, with
a lower rate of £110 for cars up to 1,549 cc.
VED for goods vehicles ranges from £165 to
£1,850 a year (£160 to £1,350 for lorries with
reduced pollution certificates). Duty on buses
varies according to seating capacity.

■ Road fuel duties: see box on page 376.
■ Air passenger duty: for flights within the
United Kingdom and for those to destinations
in the European Economic Area (EEA, see
page 104), countries applying to join the EU
(Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, see page 71)
and Switzerland, the duty is £5 for the lowest
class and £10 for any other class; the
equivalent rates to other destinations are £20
and £40 respectively. All flights from airports
in the Scottish Flighlands and Islands are
exempt from duty in recognition of their
remoteness and dependence on air travel.
■ Landfill tax: this is levied on active waste at
the standard rate of £15 a tonne, with a lower
rate of £2 a tonne for inert waste. The
standard rate will be increased by £3 a tonne
in 2005/06 and by at least £3 a tonne in the
following years to reach a medium- to long¬
term rate of £35 a tonne. The introduction of
the tax was accompanied by a reduction in
employers’ NICs and future increases will be
introduced in a way that is revenue neutral to
business.
■ Aggregates levy: this is levied at £1.60 a tonne
on virgin aggregate commercially exploited
in the United Kingdom. To enhance the levy’s
environmental impact in Northern Ireland,
in April 2004 the Government extended the
scope and duration of relief on aggregate used
in processed products, so that it now also
covers virgin aggregate in its raw state. The
levy has been accompanied by a new
Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund, which
provides support to businesses affected by
environmental extraction, and a reduction
in employers’ NICs.
■ Climate change levy: this is levied on the
non-domestic use of energy and, together
with associated measures, is designed to
encourage businesses to use energy more
efficiently and reduce emissions of C02.
All revenues are recycled back to business
through a reduction in employers’ NICs
introduced at the same time as the levy and
additional support for energy efficiency
measures (see page 454).
Other indirect taxes and duties
As well as duties on tobacco, beer, wines and
spirits, other indirect taxes and duties include:
■ Insurance premium tax: this is levied at 5 per
cent on most general insurance, with a higher
rate of 17.5 per cent on travel insurance and
on insurance sold by suppliers of cars and
domestic appliances.
■ Betting and gaming duties: these are charged
on off-course betting, pool betting, gaming in
casinos, bingo and amusement machines. Rates
vary with the particular form of gambling. On
the National Lottery there is a 12 per cent duty

Transport and the environment
The Government has introduced a number of
measures designed to improve the efficiency of
the transport system, while safeguarding the
environment. As well as the changes to VED
(see page 375), fuel duty differentials have been
introduced to encourage the take-up of less
environmentally damaging fuels.
The March 2004 Budget announced that sulphur-
free petrol and diesel would benefit from a 0.5
pence per litre differential relative to the rates
for ultra-low sulphur fuels. This differential is
expected to lead to sulphur-free fuels becoming
the standard specification for road fuels in the
United Kingdom. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
will review the date of the introduction of this
differential at the time of the 2004 Pre-Budget
Report. Among other transport-related measures
in the 2004 Budget was the continuation of a
20 pence per litre duty incentive in favour of
biodiesel until at least 2007. A duty incentive of
the same amount for bioethanol will be
introduced from 1 January 2005.
In April 2002 the Government reformed the
system of taxation on company cars, so that the
tax charge was linked to vehicle emissions. An
initial evaluation of the change, published in
May 2004, found that the system had reduced
business mileage and brought lower C02
emissions as a result of more fuel-efficient cars.
I   —^
on gross stakes, but no tax on winnings. The
Government has modernised the structure of
gambling taxation, including replacing general
betting duty and the duty on bingo by a 15 per
cent tax on the gross profits of bookmakers
and bingo companies.
Stamp taxes and duties
Under a major reform of stamp duty on UK
property transactions, stamp duty land tax
replaced stamp duty on UK land and buildings in
December 2003. The reform is intended to
modernise administrative arrangements, close
loopholes, remove distortions and pave the way for
the introduction of e-conveyancing systems. The
tax is payable at 1 per cent of the total price when
above £60,000 (£150,000 for non-residential land
and buildings), 3 per cent above £250,000 and
4 per cent above £500,000. However, in the most
disadvantaged areas in the United Kingdom, no
tax is payable on certain non-residential transfers,
while transfers of residential property of up to
£150,000 are exempt.
Some other transfers are subject to stamp duty.
Transfers of shares generally attract duty at 0.5 per
cent of the cost, while certain types of document,
such as declarations of trust, generally attract a
small fixed duty of £5. Transfers by gift and
transfers to charities are exempt.
Local authority taxation
Domestic property in Great Britain is subject to
the council tax, one of the main sources of income
for local authorities (see page 61). Each dwelling is
allocated to one of eight valuation bands, based on
its capital value (the amount it might have sold for
on the open market) in April 1991. In Wales new
valuation bands, based on property values in April
2003, will take effect in April 2005, with a ninth
band for properties over £424,000.
In 2004/05, in England, the average council tax for
a Band D dwelling (occupied by two or more
adults) is £1,167 (£1,119 in London, £1,143 in
other metropolitan areas and £1,185 in shire
areas). In Scotland the average Band D council tax
is £1,053 and in Wales £887.
Discounts are available for dwellings with fewer
than two resident adults and those on low incomes
may receive council tax benefit of up to 100 per
cent of the tax bill (see page 173). In the March
2004 Budget the Government announced a one-
off payment of £100 to each pensioner household
with someone aged 70 or over to help with their
council tax bills. Under the Local Government Act
2003, local authorities in England can reduce the
50 per cent discount for second homes. They can
also remove or reduce the 50 per cent discount for
long-term empty property. Local authorities in
Wales and Scotland also have these powers.
Business rates (also known as non-domestic rates)
are a tax on the occupiers of commercial property.
The rateable value is assessed by reference to
annual rents and reviewed every five years.
Separate business rates are set for England, Wales

Review of local government funding
The report of a review of local government funding
in England - Balance of Funding Review Report,
published in July 2004 - concluded that council tax
should be retained but that it should be reformed.
The Government has agreed that council tax should
be retained. It has set up an independent inquiry to:
■ make recommendations for the reform of council
tax in England, taking into account the
revaluation in 2007 of domestic property;
■ assess the case for giving local authorities more
flexibility to raise additional revenue;
■ analyse the options for changing the balance of
funding, including local income tax, reform of
business rates, and other possible local taxes and
charges;
■ consider the implications for financing elected
regional assemblies (see page 13); and
■ consider any implications of its recommendations
for other parts of the United Kingdom.
The Welsh Assembly Government has undertaken a
separate review in Wales. An independent review of
local government finance in Scotland was announced
in June 2004.
In Northern Ireland proposals to reform the domestic
rating system were published in July 2004 and are
planned to take effect from April 2007. They include
the replacement of domestic rental values with
individual assessments of the capital value of every
residential property in Northern Ireland.
and Scotland, and collected by local authorities.
They are paid into separate national pools and
redistributed to local authorities in proportion to
their population.
In Northern Ireland, rates - local taxes on
domestic and non-domestic properties - are based
on the value of the property. For 2004/05 the
average domestic rates bill in Northern Ireland is
£509.

The United Kingdom’s open economy is more
dependent upon international trade than many
other countries. It is the sixth largest exporter of
goods in the world and the second largest exporter
of services. In 2003, exports were equivalent to
25 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).
Furthermore the United Kingdom has the highest
ratio of inward and outward investment to GDP of
any leading economy. As a result, the Government
is committed to the continuing liberalisation of
global trade and investment.

Balance of payments
The balance of payments (Table 24.2) provides a
record of the transactions between the residents of
the United Kingdom and the rest of the world. It
records inward and outward transactions, the
overall net flow of transactions between UK
residents and the rest of the world, and how that
flow is funded. Economic transactions include:
■ exports and imports of goods, such as oil,
finished manufactured goods, and chemicals;
■ exports and imports of services, such as
international transport, travel, and financial
and business services;
■ income flows, such as dividends and interest
earned by non-residents on investments in
the United Kingdom and by UK residents
investing abroad;
■ financial flows, such as investment in shares,
debt securities, loans and deposits; and
■ transfers, such as payments to, and receipts
from, EU institutions, foreign aid and funds
brought by migrants to the United Kingdom.
The balance of payments is divided into four main
categories:
■ the current account - trade in goods (on a
balance of payment basis, see glossary) and
services (Table 24.3), income (investment
income and compensation of employees
- for example, locally engaged staff in UK
embassies and military bases abroad) and
current transfers (such as food aid);
■ the capital account - capital transfers and the
acquisition and disposal of non-produced,
non-financial assets (such as copyrights);
■ the financial account - the flow of direct,
portfolio and other investment and reserve
assets; and
■ the international investment position - the
United Kingdom’s stock of external financial
assets and liabilities.

deficit of £18.2 billion in 2002. The deficit in trade
on goods and services also increased - to
£32.7 billion in 2003 from £31.1 billion in 2002.
However, the surplus on the income account rose
to a record £22.1 billion. The surplus on the
capital account also increased, rising to £1.2 billion
in 2003 from £0.9 billion in 2002.
The current account deficit with EU-15 countries
widened sharply in 2003, reaching a record
£22.7 billion compared with £12.9 billion in 2002.
The balance on all current account components
fell from the 2002 levels, with particularly sharp
falls for both trade in goods and income. Over the
same period, the balance with non-EU countries
moved from a deficit of £5.3 billion to a surplus of
£2.2 billion. This was due to a lower deficit on
trade in goods, combined with higher surpluses on
trade in services and income.
Trade in goods and services
Table 24.3 summarises UK trade in goods and
services at current prices and Figure 24.4 shows
the balances over the past 30 years. The deficit
on the balance in goods increased in 2003 and the
surplus on the balance in services decreased,
leading to an overall increase in the shortfall in
the balance of goods and services.
Commodity composition of goods
UK exports of goods are dominated by
manufactures (Figure 24.5) - finished manufactures
and semi-manufactured goods - which accounted
for about the same proportion (82 to 83 per cent)
of exports in 2003 as they did in 1973. Oil, which
had risen as a proportion of total exports from

5 per cent in 1973 to 21 per cent in 1984,
subsequently declined to under 8 per cent in 2003.
Historically the United Kingdom was
predominantly an importer of foods and basic
materials. Over the last 30 years, however, imports
of manufactures have grown rapidly. Between
1973 and 2003 the share of finished manufactures
rose from 32 per cent of total imports to 59 per
cent. The United Kingdom has not recorded a
surplus on manufactured goods since 1982. Basic
materials fell from 12 per cent of total imports by
value in 1973 to 3 per cent in 2003. Food,
beverages and tobacco accounted for 19 per cent
of imports in 1973, compared with 9 per cent in
2003. Intermediate goods, such as car parts,
computer chips and semi-conductors, accounted
for 20 per cent of exports and 17 per cent of
imports in 2003.
Sectors with significant positive trade balances in
2003 included chemicals and crude oil, while those
with large negative balances included consumer
goods (including cars), food, beverages and
tobacco, and capital goods (such as heavy
engineering machinery). The deficit on trade
in motor cars was over £7 billion.

Trade in services
A surplus has been recorded for trade in services
(see glossary) in every year since 1966. In 2003 the
surplus declined to £14.6 billion from the record
£15.6 billion reached in 2002. Exports of services
rose by £2.5 billion in 2003, while imports
increased by £3.5 billion. Business services
accounted for over 30 per cent of exports in
services. In percentage terms, the largest increases
between 2002 and 2003 in both imports and
exports were in the computer and information
services sector (Table 24.8).
The travel sector recorded its largest ever deficit in
2003. In the early 1990s exports in this sector
accounted for between 24 and 27 per cent of the
total trade in services, compared with 16 per cent
in 2003. Imports of travel services have increased
by 2 or 3 percentage points over the same period,
accounting for 40 per cent of trade in services in
2003. Increasing numbers of UK citizens travelling
abroad, and a slow recovery in US visitors to the
United Kingdom after the 11 September 2001
attacks, have contributed to this deficit.
Income and transfers
The surplus on the income account grew to a
record £22.1 billion in 2003 from £21.5 billion in
2002. A sharply reduced deficit on the ‘other
investment’ category more than offset a lower
surplus on direct investment, which fell to £31.4
billion in 2003 from a record £33.8 billion in 2002.
Earnings on UK direct investment abroad
increased to £55.7 billion in 2003. A strong rise in
dividends received, which rose to a record £31.9
billion, more than offset a decline in reinvested
earnings, which fell to £18.2 billion. Earnings on
direct investment in the United Kingdom reached
their highest level since 2000. Total earnings on
equity rose to £17.4 billion in 2003, from
£14.4 billion in 2002, while earnings on debt rose
to £6.8 billion in 2003 from £4.5 billion in 2002.
The deficit on current transfers widened to £9.9
billion in 2003 from £8.6 billion in 2002.
Outward and inward investment
With an open economy, the United Kingdom has
no restrictions on the outward flow of capital.
The continuing current account deficit was largely
funded in 2003 by net inward investment in
UK-issued debt securities. The attractiveness of
UK debt to foreign investors may have reflected
the higher sterling interest rates compared to
dollar or euro-denominated issues.
Overall the financial account recorded net inflows
of £17.5 billion in 2003 compared with £8.8 billion
in 2002. Total UK net investment1 abroad rose to
1 Comprises direct, portfolio and other investment. UK net
investment abroad also includes financial derivatives (net) and
reserve assets.

International trade policy
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
represents UK interests in international trade
policy, working closely with EU partners and
drawing on UK bilateral relations and
membership of international organisations such
as the World Trade Organisation.
International direct investment
According to the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development World Investment Report
2003, the United Kingdom was ranked seventh at
attracting inward investment in 2002 and fourth in
its outward investment.
A DTI White Paper on trade and investment,
Making Globalisation a Force for Good, was
published in July 2004. It deals with the questions
of how globalisation can be controlled throughout
the world, especially in developing countries, and
how a world trading system can be fair as well as
free.
Recent inward investment announcements have
included:
■ Suzuki GB, the UK subsidiary of Japan’s
Suzuki Motor Corporation, is to develop a
new national parts, training and technical
centre at Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire
involving investment of over US$22 million;
European Union
The free movement of goods, people, services and
capital is a fundamental principle of the EU. These
four freedoms, set out in the Treaties of Rome,
form the basis of the Single European Market (see
page 69). A further ten countries joined the EU on
382
UK 2005
24 International trade and investment
1 May 2004 (see page 381), boosting the size of the
Single Market.
The EU Common Commercial Policy (CCP)
establishes uniform principles covering trade
between all Member States. These include changes
in tariff rates, the conclusion of tariff and trade
agreements with non-member countries,
uniformity in trade liberalisation measures, export
policy, and instruments to protect trade such as
anti-dumping measures and subsidies.
Since 1993, the EU has formed a single territory -
enlarged since May 2004 - without internal
borders within which the free movement of goods
is guaranteed. It applies a common external tariff
to imports from third countries. However, the EU
has also signed preferential trade agreements with
a number of countries. These include:
■ the European Economic Area (with Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein);
■ Association Agreements with the countries of
central and eastern Europe (see page 75);
■ agreements with the Mediterranean countries;
■ bilateral agreements with South Africa,
Mexico and Chile; and
■ the Cotonou Agreement with the African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
In May 2003 the European Commission published
the new Internal Market Strategy for 2003 to 2006
to make the internal market work better and build
on the jobs and wealth that have been created
since the free movement of goods within the EU
took effect. The Strategy aims to take account of
the effects of enlargement (see page 71) and of an
ageing population, and aims for the EU to become
the world’s most competitive economy by 2010.
Particular priorities include implementing the free
movement of services, removing the remaining
obstacles to trade in goods, and improving the
regulatory framework.
In January 2004 the Commission issued a report
on the implementation of the Internal Market
Strategy. It found that too many European
industries still operate in fragmented markets due
to trade obstacles and differences in standards and
regulations. It reported that only 27 of the 45
measures due to be implemented before the end of
2003 to improve the working of the Single Market
had been delivered on time. Others were on the
verge of being completed, but many of the
measures that had been delayed were important
legislative initiatives.
EU initiatives for simplifying national and
Community rules include SLIM (simpler
legislation for the internal market) and the
European Business Test Panel, which allows for
consultation with business during the drafting
stage of new legislation.
The SOLVIT dispute mechanism, which operates
through a network of centres based in each
Member State, aims to find an informal and speedy
solution to problems arising from the
misapplication of EU rules, without the need for
legal action. Details are held on an online database
system. In the United Kingdom, the DTTs Action
Single Market/UK SOLVIT Centre acts not only as
a contact point for UK business and citizens but
also as a first port of call for similar centres in other
Member States when single market problems arise.
World Trade Organisation (WTO)
The WTO was established in 1995 to succeed the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Its main
functions are to act as a forum for trade
negotiations, administer trade agreements and
handle disputes. The key principle is non¬
discrimination, ensuring that similar products
from different countries must be treated in the
same way. By April 2004 there were 147 member
countries, with 29 negotiating to join. In
November 2001, WTO members agreed an agenda
- the Doha Development Agenda - to introduce
a new round of trade negotiations. All members
agreed to place developing country concerns at
the heart of these negotiations. However, the
Ministerial Conference in Cancun, Mexico,
in September 2003, failed to agree negotiating
frameworks for key issues such as agriculture. In
August 2004 WTO members agreed a deal that
made it more likely that trade liberalisation could
be completed by the end of 2005. Key WTO
members accepted proposals to cut the subsidies
wealthy countries give their farmers for exports.
The WTO provides an arbitration service for
countries involved in trade disputes through its
dispute settlement system - ideally, the countries
concerned should discuss their problems and settle
any dispute mutually. The trade policy review
mechanism within the WTO allows members to
discuss an individual country’s trade regime. By
August 2004 the WTO had recorded 314 disputes.

24 International trade and investment
UK 2005
Although the United Kingdom is a member of the
WTO in its own right, for all practical purposes it
works through membership of the EU, as required
by the CCP (see page 383).
Developing countries
The DTI works closely with the Department for
International Development and other government
departments to ensure that developing countries
participate in, and benefit from, the world trade
system. Close collaboration between government
departments, coordinated by the DTI, ensures
consistency of approach.
The Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)
exists to promote the better integration of
developing countries into the world trading
system. It aims to encourage them to increase
exports by allowing their products preferential
access to the markets of developed countries. The
United Kingdom is party to the EC GSP, operated
by all Member States. The European Commission
is developing a new scheme which will operate
from 2005.
The Cotonou Agreement, signed in June 2000 in
Cotonou, Benin, replaced the Lome Convention.
This had provided a framework for trade, aid and
political relations between the EU and the 77 ACP
countries. Under the Cotonou Agreement, the
ACPs have unrestricted access to the EU market
for substantially all industrial goods and for a wide
range of agricultural products. One of the
Agreement’s main objectives is the integration of
ACP states into the global economy. The current
preferential access for the ACP countries is
incompatible with WTO rules and operates under
a waiver, due to expire at the end of 2007.
Negotiations for WTO-compliant Economic
Partnership Arrangements with the ACP regions
are under way and new agreements will come into
force by 2008. They will progressively remove
barriers to trade between the EU and ACP
countries and will aim to put trade relations with
the ACP countries on a secure and sustainable
footing.
Controls on trade
Import controls
In addition to EU-wide restrictions, certain goods
are prohibited from import into the United
Kingdom or are restricted for reasons of health
and safety, or to protect the environment.

The DTTs Import Licensing Branch (ILB) is
responsible for issuing import licences in
accordance with UK and EC law. In 2003/04
it issued 338,000 licences.
Export controls
Governments control the export of goods and
technology for a variety of reasons. Licences for
goods subject to strategic export control are issued
by the DTI acting through its Export Control
Organisation (ECO). These controls apply to a
wide range of goods, components and spare parts,
and technology, including:
■ military equipment such as arms,
ammunition, bombs, tanks, imaging devices,
military aircraft and warships;
■ nuclear-related items including nuclear
materials, nuclear reactors and processing

Figures for 2003/04 on inward investment
decisions notified to UK Trade & Investment by
its national and regional development agency
partners, and new jobs expected to be created, are
shown in Table 24.9. New investments accounted
for 42 per cent of these projects and expansions
for a further 35 per cent. Investment in industries
linked to the knowledge-driven economy -
computer software, IT, Internet, e-commerce,
electronics and telecommunications sectors -
formed the largest category of inward investment,
with 243 projects (30 per cent). Other major
sectors for UK inward investment were
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, management,
the automotive sector, and food and drink.
The Government provides a wide range of advice
and practical support to meet the needs of
overseas inward investors and exporters. UK Trade
& Investment is responsible for trade development
and inward investment. The Export Credits
Guarantee Department (ECGD) helps UK
exporters win business and helps firms to invest
overseas.
UK Trade & Investment
UK Trade & Investment is the government

ECGD is the official UK export credit agency. Its
role is to help UK manufacturers and investors
trade overseas by providing them with insurance
and/or backing for finance to protect against non¬
payment. It complements the insurance that is
available from the private sector. ECGD insurance
is available both for UK exporters of goods and
services, and investors in overseas projects. The
largest part of its operation involves underwriting
finance packages to support the sale of capital
goods, such as aircraft, machinery and services,
and to help UK companies take part in overseas
projects such as hospitals, airports and power
stations.
Including overseas investment insurance and
reinsurance, the total business supported by

The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of
many world-class advances in science, engineering
and technology. Notable areas of UK achievement
include aerospace, biomedicine, biotechnology,
chemicals, electronics and materials. Achievements
by UK scientists in the last 30 years include the
development of in-vitro fertilisation (1978) and
DNA fingerprinting (1985); the invention of the
World Wide Web address system and layout
(1990); the birth of the world’s first cloned
mammal (1996); and the UK contribution to
the human genome project (completed in 2003).
Research and development
expenditure
Gross domestic expenditure in the United
Kingdom on research and development (R&D)
in 2002 was £19.6 billion, or 1.9 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP, see glossary). Of this,
£17.6 billion was on civil R&D, with the rest going
to defence projects. In real terms, gross domestic
expenditure on R&D increased by 3 per cent
between 2001 and 2002.
Business enterprise is the largest source of funding,
providing 47 per cent of expenditure in 2002 (see
Figure 25.1). Contract research organisations often
carry out R&D for companies and are playing an
increasingly important role in the transfer of
technology to UK industry. Business enterprise also
supports university research and finances contract
research at government establishments. Some
charities have their own laboratories as well as
offering grants for research.
Nobel Prizes for UK scientists
In October 2003, Sir Peter Mansfield was awarded
the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, sharing
the award with the US scientist Paul C. Lauterbur,
for their discoveries concerning magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI - see page 395).
Anthony J. Leggett of the United Kingdom and
the United States was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Physics, sharing the 2003 Prize with Alexei A.
Abrikosov (United States and Russia) and Vitaly L.
Ginzburg (Russia), for pioneering contributions to
the theory of superconductors and superfluids.
Superconducting material is used, for example, in
MRI for medical examinations and in particle
accelerators in physics. Knowledge about
superfluid liquids gives an insight into the ways in
which matter behaves in its lowest and most
ordered state.
UK economist Clive WJ. Granger shared the 2003
Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences with US
economist Robert F. Engle. He demonstrated that
statistical methods used for stationary time series
could give wholly misleading results when
applied to the analysis of non-stationary data. His
significant discovery was cointegration - that
specific combinations of non-stationary time
series may exhibit 'stationarity' thereby allowing
for correct statistical inference.

Business enterprise carried out work worth some
£13.1 billion in 2002, an increase of 3 per cent
on 2001 in real terms. Business enterprises’ own
funds accounted for 66 per cent of this work, with
27 per cent coming from overseas, and most of the
remaining 7 per cent from government.
Government role
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry,
assisted by the Minister for Science, has overall
responsibility for science, engineering and
technology (SET). They are supported by the
Office of Science and Technology (OST), part of
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI, see
R&D scoreboard
The R&D scoreboard is an international
benchmarking tool for investment in R&D. The
scoreboard contains details of investment, sales,
profits and employee numbers for 700 UK-based
companies (39 from the FTSE 100, see page 470)
and 700 international companies. The 2003
scoreboard showed UK-based companies with
R&D investments totalling £16 billion, and the
international companies with R&D investments
totalling £207 billion.
The 2003 scoreboard suggests that the
challenges facing the United Kingdom are to:
■ maintain its leading position in
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, health,
aerospace and defence;
■ increase R&D investment as a percentage of
sales in other sectors; and
■ encourage medium-sized companies
(those with an annual turnover of up to
£500 million) in all sectors, but particularly
high R&D sectors, to increase their R&D
investment.
pages 389 and 390). The Ministerial Committee
on Science Policy provides the framework for the
collective consideration of, and decisions on,
major science policy issues.
The OST, headed by the Government’s Chief
Scientific Adviser, is responsible for policy on SET,
both nationally and internationally, and
coordinates science and technology policy across
government departments. The Chief Scientific
Adviser also reports directly to the Prime Minister.
An independent Council for Science and
Technology advises the Prime Minister and the
First Ministers of Scotland and Wales on the
strategic policies and framework for science and
technology in the United Kingdom. Its members
are drawn from academia, business and charitable
foundations and institutions.
Strategy and finance
The DTI/OST publication The Forward Look 2003:
Government-funded science, engineering and
388
UK 2005
25 Science, engineering and technology
technology sets out government spending on
science, engineering and technology for 2002-05.
Forward Look contains reports and financial data
from departments, Research Councils, learned
bodies and the devolved administrations.
The science and engineering base is mainly
financed through two funding streams, known as
the Dual Support system. One stream is provided
by the education departments through their
higher education funding councils. The other is
provided by the DTI/OST through the Research
Councils, which award programme and project
grants for specific research programmes, both to
universities and to their own institutions. The OST
is examining ways to implement changes to the
Dual Support system recommended by the review
of science and research.
Planned total government expenditure on
SET in 2004/05 (both civil and defence and
including the science budget) is £9.3 billion
(Figure 25.2).

The OST, through the Director General of
Research Councils, has responsibility for the
allocation of the UK science budget and for the
Science and innovation investment
framework
As part of the 2004 Spending Review (see page
368), the Government published the Science and
innovation investment framework 2004-14. It
envisages an annual real growth in public science
funding for R&D of 5.8 per cent. Total science
funding will rise by £1 billion in real terms
between 2004/05 and 2007/08 to nearly
£5 billion. The Framework plan is for R&D as a
proportion of GDP to increase from 1.9 per cent
to 2.5 per cent over ten years.
The Framework aims to:
■ maintain or improve the ranking of the United
Kingdom against the United States and the
rest of the OECD, and build world-class
centres of research;
■ improve the responsiveness of the publicly
funded research base to the needs of the
economy and public services;
■ increase business investment in R&D from
1.2 per cent of GDP to 1.7 per cent over the
next decade;
■ ensure a strong supply of scientists, engineers
and technologists;
■ achieve sustainable levels of research activity
and investment in universities and public
laboratories; and
■ increase confidence in and awareness of
scientific research and its applications.
government-financed Research Councils (see
pages 393-96). Through the Research Councils,
the science budget supports research by:
■ awarding research grants to universities, other
higher education establishments and some
other research units;
■ funding Research Council establishments
to carry out research or provide facilities;
■ paying subscriptions to international
scientific facilities and organisations; and
■ supporting postgraduate research students
and postdoctoral fellows.

Foresight programme
The Government's Foresight programme
encourages the public and private sectors to work
together to identify opportunities in markets and
technologies likely to emerge over the next 10 to
20 years. The programme is coordinated by a joint
industry/academic steering group, headed by the
Chief Scientific Adviser.
Foresight operates through a rolling programme
that looks at three or four areas at any one time.
The starting point for a project area is either a
key issue where science holds the promise of
solutions, or an area of science where the
potential applications and technologies have yet
to be considered and articulated.
Projects in the latest Foresight programme are
being carried out in the following areas: flood
and coastal defence; cyber trust (relating to
computers and the Internet) and crime
prevention; exploiting the electromagnetic
spectrum; and brain science and drugs. The
project on cognitive systems was concluded in
November 2003.
The science budget also funds programmes of
support to the science and engineering base
through the Royal Society (see page 402) and the
Royal Academy of Engineering (see page 403). The
other main sources of funds for universities are the
higher education funding councils (see page 396).
Department of Trade and Industry
In 2004/05, the DTI’s planned expenditure
(excluding the OST) on SET is £376 million.
This expenditure covers innovation and
technology for a number of industrial sectors,
including aeronautics, biotechnology, chemicals,
communications, engineering, environmental
technology, IT, space, and nuclear and non-nuclear
energy.
Funding for innovation may include the
development, design and financing of new
products, services and processes, exploitation of
new markets, creation of new businesses and
associated changes in the management of people
and in organisational practices. Through its
Innovation Unit, a mixed team of business
secondees and government officials, the DTI seeks
to promote a culture of innovation in all sectors of
the economy.
Technology and knowledge transfer
The DTI is involved in a number of programmes
to increase collaboration and the flow of
knowledge between the science and engineering
base and businesses, including:
■ LINK {www.ost.gov.uk/link), which promotes
partnership in pre-commercial research
between companies and the research base.
Government departments and Research
Councils fund up to 50 per cent of the cost of
research projects, with companies providing
the balance;
■ the International Technology Service
(www.globalwatchonline.com), which helps
UK companies to benefit from technological
expertise around the world;
■ Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (managed by
the Small Business Service - see page 355)
that facilitate technology and knowledge
transfer between businesses and universities,
colleges or research organisations; and
■ a network of 24 Faraday Partnerships that aim
to improve co-operation between the science,
engineering and technology base and industry
in the exploitation of SET in the United
Kingdom.
National Measurement System
The DTI is responsible for the National
Measurement System (NMS), which funds science
and technology programmes in measurement
science, including materials metrology. In
2004/05 DTI expects to invest nearly £70 million
in the NMS.
Measurement standards and calibration facilities
provided by the NMS enable businesses and public
authorities to make accurate measurements that
are nationally and internationally accepted. Most
of the work is carried out at the National Physical
390
UK 2005
25 Science, engineering and technology
Laboratory, LGC (formerly the Laboratory of the
Government Chemist), NEL (formerly the
National Engineering Laboratory) and the
National Weights and Measures Laboratory.
British Standards Institution
The DTI works closely with the British Standards
Institution (BSI), the national standards body that
is independent of the Government, to promote
UK trade and technology interests. DTI support
for BSI is directed towards European and
international standards, which account for over 90
per cent of the Institution’s work. It also provides
support for the United Kingdom Accreditation
Service (UKAS), the sole national body recognised
by the Government to accredit organisations that
test, calibrate, inspect and certify against
standards. The DTI contribution to BSI and
UKAS was £6.5 million in 2003/04.
Intellectual property
The Patent Office, an executive agency of the DTI,
is responsible for granting patents and registering
designs and trade marks. In 2002 it received
almost 30,000 applications for patents and over
60,000 applications for trade marks.
The Patent Office works towards the worldwide
harmonisation of rules and procedures, and the
modernisation and simplification of intellectual
property law. International patenting
arrangements include the European Patent
Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty.
For trade marks the European Community Trade
Mark System and the Madrid Protocol provide
a way to acquire rights beyond UK borders. The
Patent Office Central Enquiry Unit and its website
{www.patent.gov.uk) offer detailed information
about intellectual property rights. To raise
awareness of the value and importance of
intellectual property throughout the United
Kingdom, the Patent Office runs seminars and
workshops for business advisers, small and
medium enterprises and academics.
Ministry of Defence
Planned net expenditure by the Ministry of
Defence (MoD) on R&D in 2004/05 is around
£2.6 billion. The MoD invests about £450 million
a year in research, managed by the Chief Scientific
Adviser, to ensure that UK Armed Forces stay
ahead of threats from potential adversaries. The
MoD has a research budget and an equipment
procurement budget (see chapter 8). MoD
research is principally carried out by two
organisations: the Defence Science and Technology
Laboratory (Dstl) and QinetiQ pic, although
a growing amount of research is being let by
competitive tendering. Dstl is government-owned
and carries out research in key areas that must be
conducted within government. It provides a high-
level overview of defence science and technology,
acts as an in-house source of impartial advice and
manages international research collaboration.
A third of QinetiQ was sold to the Carlyle Group
in 2002. The MoD plans to sell its entire stake in
QinetiQ before 2008.
Department of Health
The Department of Health (DH) supports R&D to
inform policy and practice in public health,
healthcare and social care. This includes:
■ National Health Service (NHS) R&D funding,
which supports projects funded by other
non-commercial R&D sources (including
charities) carried out in the NHS, and also
specific health and social care projects
meeting the identified research needs of the
DH and the NHS;
■ a Policy Research Programme (PRP), directly
commissioned by the DH; and
■ ad hoc project funding from other DH R&D
budgets and support for non-departmental
public bodies (NDPBs).
The DH expects to spend some £611 million on
research in 2004/05: £549 million on NHS R&D,
£32 million on the PRP and about £30 million
involving the NDPBs and ad hoc budgets.
Home Office
Some scientific and medical research, as well as the
regulatory safety and efficacy testing of new drugs
and other substances, involves the use of live
animals. In Great Britain this is regulated through
a licensing system administered by the Home
Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures)
Act 1986, and in Northern Ireland the system is
regulated by the Department of Health, Social
Services and Public Safety, under the same Act.
Animals may only be used for specified permitted
purposes, when the benefits are judged likely, on
expert assessment, to outweigh the cost to their
391
25 Science, engineering and technology
UK 2005
welfare. There also has to be full application of
the ‘3Rs’:
■ replacement of animals with non-animal
alternatives whenever practicable;
■ where animals have to be used, reducing
their number to the minimum; and
■ refinement of the procedures to minimise
their suffering.
Prescribed standards of animal housing and care
also have to be maintained in the establishments
concerned.
In 2003, 2.9 million procedures were performed,
mostly on mice and other rodents. Breeding of
genetically modified animals is also regulated,
and is included in the above figure, accounting
for about a quarter of the total. The number of
regulated procedures is lower than in 1987 (when
the current legislation was introduced), when
3.6 million procedures were performed.
Scottish Executive
The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council
disburses the majority of the Scottish Executive s
support for the science base. This amounts to
some £212 million for 2004/05 - £161 million for
research and £51 million to support the strategic
development of the sector. The Executive is also
spending about £169 million directly on research
in agriculture and fisheries, health, and the
biological, environmental, economic and social
sciences. A large proportion of this goes to the
Scottish Agricultural and Biological Research
Institutes, the Fisheries Research Service and the
Scottish Agricultural College. In addition, the UK
Research Councils contribute around £210 million
to Scottish research institutions.
The Executive has established an independent
Scottish Science Advisory Committee to advise
it on strategic science matters.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the Support Programme for
University Research (SPUR) is a public-private
partnership that invests in the research
infrastructure. The first phase, SPUR 1, is investing
some £44 million over the period 2001/02 to
2004/05. The second phase, SPUR 2, will invest
£50 million between 2003 and 2007. About two-
thirds of the programme expenditure is for
science-related projects.
Invest NI has a similar role to that of DTI’s
Innovation Unit, supporting industrial R&D,
technology transfer and innovation.
Space activities
The UK civil space industry has an estimated
workforce of around 6,000 people. The civil space
programme is brought together through the
British National Space Centre (BNSC), a
partnership of government departments and the
Research Councils. BNSC’s policy and aims were
set out in Space Strategy 2003-2006 and beyond.
It gives UK space activity three objectives:
■ to enhance UK standing in astronomy,
planetary and environmental sciences;
■ to stimulate increased productivity by
promoting the use of space in government,
science and commerce; and
■ to develop innovative space technologies and
systems to deliver sustainable improvement in
the quality of life.
Galileo
The United Kingdom has taken a leading role in
the development of Galileo, the joint European
Union (EU)/European Space Agency programme
to develop and operate its own civil satellite
system for navigation, positioning and timing
applications. It will offer long-term improvements
to traffic management systems for all forms of
transport and in commercial, industrial and other
strategic areas. The first experimental satellite is
due to be launched in 2005.
V     
Through BNSC, the Government spends around
£190 million a year on space activities. Nearly
60 per cent of this is channelled through the
European Space Agency (ESA) for collaborative
programmes such as Earth observation,
telecommunications, and space science. Much of
this expenditure returns to the United Kingdom
through contracts awarded to UK industry.
The remainder of the space budget is spent on
international meteorological programmes carried
392
UK 2005
25 Science, engineering and technology
out through the European Meteorological Satellite
Organisation (EUMETSAT); developing
experiments for ESA satellites; and on the national
programme, which is aimed at complementing
R&D supported through ESA. Almost half of the
UK space programme is concerned with satellite-
based Earth observation (remote sensing) for
commercial and environmental applications.
The United Kingdom is a major contributor to
ESA’s Earth observation satellite, ENVISAT,
launched in 2002. This carries a new generation of
radar and radiometer systems as well as other
scientific environmental instruments, some of
which were either designed or constructed in the
United Kingdom. A third of the UK space budget
is devoted to space science led by the Particle
Physics and Astronomy Research Council (see
page 396), in support of astronomy, planetary
science and geophysics. The United Kingdom is
contributing substantially to the SOHO mission to
study the Sun; to the Cluster mission launched in
2000 to study solar-terrestrial relationships; to the
Infrared Space Observatory, which is investigating
the birth and death of stars; and to the Cassini
Huygens Mission (see page 396) to send a probe to
Saturn and its moon Titan, launched in 1997.
The United Kingdom is also participating in
XMM, ESA’s X-ray spectroscopy mission to
investigate X-ray emissions from black holes, and
ESA’s SMART-1 Mission (Small Missions in
Advanced Research Technology). This is the first
European spacecraft to travel to and orbit the
Moon. Beagle 2, the space lander designed and
built in the United Kingdom to look for life on
Mars, successfully detached from the ESA’s Mars
Express spacecraft in December 2003. However, it
failed to make contact and was presumed lost or
damaged. The instruments developed for Beagle
were especially light and efficient and could be
developed for future missions.
Research Councils
The UK Research Councils are independent public
bodies responsible to the OST (see page 389).
They are funded largely through the Government
Science Vote,1 and have a total budget of
1 The Director General of Research Councils, located in the OST, has
overall responsibility for advising ministers on the resources
needed by the Research Councils, the Royal Society and the Royal
Academy of Engineering (the Science Vote).
£2.4 billion in 2004/05. There are seven Research
Councils in the United Kingdom, each with
members of its governing council drawn from
universities, the professions, industry and
government. The Councils support research, study
and postgraduate training in universities and other
higher education institutions. They also carry out
or support research, through their own institutes
and at international research centres, often jointly
with other public sector bodies and international
organisations. They provide awards to about
15,000 postgraduate students in science, social
sciences, engineering and technology.
The Research Councils have a range of initiatives
to encourage academics to commercialise their
findings, to work with industry and to enhance
the entrepreneurial culture in the UK research
base. They also work with the public, promoting
awareness and listening to their views on issues
where research plays a part. The Arts and
Humanities Research Board (AHRB, see below)
will become the eighth Research Council in 2005.
Research Councils UK
Research Councils UK (RCUK) is the strategic
partnership of the seven UK Research Councils
and the AHRB. The partnership aims to:
■ create a common framework for research,
training and knowledge transfer;
■ provide a single focus for dialogue with
organisations involved with research;
■ channel independent scientific advice from
the Research Councils to the Government;
■ promote collaboration to deliver scientific
and strategic goals; and
■ harmonise procedures to give organisations
involved with research a more efficient
service.
Arts and Humanities Research Board
The AHRB supports research in the arts and
humanities, from archaeology and English
literature to design and dance. It funds research
and postgraduate study within the United
Kingdom’s higher education institutions and
provides funding for museums, galleries and
collections that are based in or attached to higher
education institutions in England. An Arts and
Humanities Research Council will be established
in 2005.

Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC)
BBSRC is the principal UK public funding agency
for basic and strategic research in non-clinical
biosciences. The scientific themes of its research
committees are biomolecular sciences; genes and
developmental biology; biochemistry and cell
biology; plant and microbial sciences; animal
sciences; agri-food; and engineering and biological
systems. As well as funding research in universities
and other research centres, BBSRC sponsors eight
research institutes.
Integrative systems biology
BBSRC funds a number of projects in which
disciplines are coming together to provide
predictive approaches to bioscience research, for
example understanding the spread of disease and
epidemiology, identifying gene and protein
functions, and modelling whole cell behaviour.
BBSRC has provisionally allocated up to
£15 million a year to establish new Centres for
Integrative Systems Biology. These will bring
together biological experimentation, insight from
the physical sciences and the power of modern
computational and mathematical science.
Council for the Central Laboratory of the
Research Councils (CCLRC)
The CCLRC has two functions: it works with the
other Research Councils to provide access to large
scale experimental facilities and it advises the
Government on future large scale facilities so that
the United Kingdom can maintain its place at the
forefront of SET. It is responsible for the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire,
the Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire and the
Chilbolton Observatory in Hampshire.
The CCLRC’s large scale facilities include ISIS,
the world’s brightest pulsed neutron and muon
source, which is used to study the atomic structure
of materials; the Central Laser Facility, which
enables research into fundamental and applied
science and engineering; and the synchrotron
radiation source, the brightest UK source of
ultraviolet light and X-rays, which is used for
materials and life science. Other areas of
specialism include particle physics, e-science,
high capability computing, space science,
instrumentation, atmospheric and radio research,
and accelerator science. Commercial applications
for CCLRC science are actively exploited through
its own knowledge transfer company, CLIK.
On behalf of the Government, the CCLRC is also
the main shareholder in Diamond Light Source
Limited, the largest science facility to be built in
the United Kingdom for more than 30 years,
which is due to start operations in 2007. Diamond
will produce pinpoint ultra-violet and X-ray
beams of exceptional brightness, that will enable
scientists and engineers to probe deep into the
basic structure of matter.
Upgrading Astra
Following a £3 million grant in March 2004, the
CCLRC's Astra laser will be upgraded to a unique
dual-beam laser. Each of the two beams in the
new laser will deliver a 0.5 petawatt (1015 W)
pulse as short as 30 femtoseconds (10~’5 s) every
few minutes. Each focused beam will attain an
intensity of 1022 Wcirr2. Astra can already
generate temperatures and pressures matched by
those found inside the Sun. Increasing the
intensity by three orders of magnitude is expected
to have considerable impact in the field of
astrophysics. Nuclear physics researchers will also
be able to investigate and modify nuclear
processes in an unprecedented manner as the
electric field of the laser radiation will be
sufficiently high to perturb the energy levels of an
atomic nucleus. The upgrade is expected to take
three years.
Economic and Social Research Council
The Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC) supports basic, strategic and applied
research and related postgraduate training in the
social sciences. Research funded by the ESRC is
conducted in higher education institutions or
independent research establishments. It aims to
focus economic and social research on scientific
and national priorities; enhance the capacity for

Centre on Migration, Policy and
Society (COMPAS)
COMPAS, launched in October 2003, provides
data and analysis on issues ranging from labour
migration to asylum seekers and political
refugees. One of the Centre's aims is to work
closely with immigrant groups. The £3.4 million
Centre has begun work on five major research
programmes, ail of which aim to have a
significant impact on not only policymakers, but
migrants and asylum seekers themselves.

and increase the impact of research on policy
and practice.
Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC)
EPSRC invests in basic, strategic and applied
research and related postgraduate training to help
the United Kingdom meet the next generation of
technological change. Its remit includes areas such
as mathematics, materials science, information
technology and structural engineering. It also
promotes public awareness of science and
engineering and manages programmes in basic
technology and e-science on behalf of all the
Research Councils.
Fusion
EPSRC awarded £48 million towards research
into fusion during 2003/04. Fusion involves
forcing atoms together to make heavier atoms, a
process which is accompanied by the release of
large amounts of energy: one kilogram of fusion
fuel produces the same amount of energy as
10,000 tonnes of coal. The grant, awarded to the
UK Atomic Energy Authority, will underpin UK
involvement in JET, the Joint European Torus -
the largest tokamak reactor in the world. It will
also enable development of a UK fusion device,
MAST (Mega-Amp Spherical Tokamak) and a
major expansion of research on materials.
Medical Research Council (MRC)
The Medical Research Council, see also chapter 13,
page 199) is the main source of public funds for
biomedical, health services and related research
and training aimed at maintaining and improving
public health. The Council has three major
institutes: the National Institute for Medical
Research, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and
the Clinical Sciences Centre. There are also
26 smaller MRC Units, an MRC Health Services
Research Collaboration based in the Department
of Social Medicine in Bristol University and
involving groups in seven other universities, and
seven grant-funded centres. Most of these are
attached to higher education institutions or
hospitals throughout the United Kingdom. The
MRC also has laboratories overseas in The Gambia
and Uganda.
About half of the MRC’s research expenditure is
allocated to its own institutes and units, with the
rest going mainly on grant support and research
training awards to teams and individuals in higher
education institutions. The Council works closely
with the health departments, major charities,
industry and international collaborators.
Magnetic resonance imaging
Sir Peter Mansfield (see page 387) was funded
for more than 20 years by the MRC. His work was
instrumental in harnessing the natural
phenomenon of magnetic resonance for clinical
use. MRI scanning produces exact images of
internal organs without using invasive techniques
and is widely regarded as one of the most
important diagnostic advances of the 20th
century. MRI scans are now routinely used in
thousands of hospitals worldwide to monitor
injury and disease, and the technique and its
offshoot, functional MRI, are helping scientists to
gain their first real understanding of how the
human brain works.
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC)
NERC funds and carries out scientific research in
the environmental sciences. A strategy document,
395
25 Science, engineering and technology
UK 2005
Science for a sustainable future 2002-2007,
identified priority areas for NERC, including:
■ Earth life-support systems - water,
biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity;
■ predicting and mitigating the effects of
climate change; and
■ sustainable economies - identifying and
providing sustainable solutions to the
challenges associated with energy, land use
and the effects of natural hazards.
NERC provides training for the next generation of
environmental scientists. It also provides a range
of facilities for use by the wider environmental
science community, including a marine research
fleet. Its wholly owned research centres are the
British Geological Survey, the British Antarctic
Survey, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,
and the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory.
NERC also supports 15 collaborative centres in
UK universities.
European Ice Core Project in
Antarctica (EPICA)
An international project involving scientists from
the British Antarctic Survey has shown how
temperature changed in the past and how the
concentrations of gases and particles in the
atmosphere varied. The first results confirm that
over the last 740,000 years the Earth experienced
eight ice ages, when its climate was much colder
than today, and eight warmer periods
(interglacials). By comparing the pattern of this
past climate with global environmental conditions
today, the scientists conclude that, without
human influence, the present warm period could
last at least another 15,000 years.
Particle Physics and Astronomy Research
Council (PPARC)
PPARC directs, coordinates and funds research,
education and postgraduate training in four broad
areas of science - particle physics, astronomy,
cosmology and space science.
PPARC provides researchers with access to
world-class facilities and funds UK membership
of international bodies such as the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), ESA
and the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
PPARC directly manages three scientific
establishments in support of its ground-based
astronomy programme: the UK Astronomy
Technology Centre at the Royal Observatory,
Edinburgh; the Isaac Newton Group of telescopes
on La Palma in the Canary Islands; and the Joint
Astronomy Centre in Hawaii. It also contributes
money for the UK involvement in telescopes in
Australia, Hawaii and Chile as well as the
MERLIN/VLBI National Facility - an array of
radio telescopes distributed around Great Britain.
PPARC operates a comprehensive support
programme to industry to encourage knowledge
transfer and exploitation of the novel technologies
developed for its science programme. Its
developing e-science programme, designed to
handle the massive data requirements of new
facilities, is expected to have applications
extending far beyond particle physics.
Cassini Huygens mission
UK scientists funded by PPARC are providing
critical instrumentation for the joint NASA/ESA
Cassini Huygens mission, which successfully
entered Saturn's orbit on 1 July 2004, having
travelled 2 billion miles during its seven-year
journey to the ringed planet. The Cassini
spacecraft has now begun a four-year tour of
Saturn and its mysterious rings, providing a
wealth of scientific data. On 25 December 2004
the Huygens probe will separate from the Cassini
mother ship to descend onto the surface of Titan,
Saturn's largest moon, to conduct in-situ
experiments of Titan's atmosphere and surface
which is thought to resemble primitive Earth
4 billion years ago. The combined Cassini
Huygens spacecraft will increase understanding of
planetary systems and how life may have formed
on Earth.
Research in higher education
institutions
Universities carry out most of the United
Kingdom’s strategic and basic research in science
and technology. The higher education funding
councils provide the main general funds to
396
UK 2005
25 Science, engineering and technology
support research in universities and other higher
education institutions in Great Britain. These
funds pay the salaries of permanent academic staff
(who usually teach as well as undertake research)
and contribute to the infrastructure for research.
The quality of research performance is a key
element in the allocation of funding. In Northern
Ireland institutions are funded by the Department
for Employment and Learning. In 2001/02, UK
universities and colleges received £3.5 billion in
research funding
The Research Councils finance basic and strategic
research in higher education institutions as well
as funding specific research projects. The other
main channels of support are industry, charities,
government departments and the EU.
Science parks
Science parks encourage and support the
start-up, incubation and growth of knowledge-
based businesses. They have formal or
operational links to a higher education
institution or other major research centre. In
2004 there were around 100 science parks in the
United Kingdom, 75 of which were members
of the UK Science Park Association, hosting
over 2,200 firms and employing over 47,000
people.
Public engagement in science
The Government supports activities such as the
annual Festival of Science and National Science
Week - both organised by the British Association
for the Advancement of Science (see page 402).
It also offers grants to science communicators
through a scheme administered by the Royal
Society.
Science and Engineering Ambassadors
The Science and Engineering Ambassadors (SEAs)
project was launched by the Department for
Education and Skills (DfES) and the DTI in 2002.
Individuals with backgrounds in science,
engineering, technology and mathematics go into
schools to help teachers develop the curricula and
to act as role models for the young. SEAs are
administered across the United Kingdom by
SETNET - the Science, Engineering, Technology
and Mathematics Network, - and delivered
through a network of 53 SET points.
Science festivals in 2004
The British Association for the Advancement of
Science's annual Festival of Science was held in
September in Exeter, on the theme of the
responsibility of being a scientist. Around 300
leading UK scientists discussed their research
with the public and an estimated 15,000 people
took part.
The Edinburgh International Science Festival was
held in April and attended by an estimated
69,000 people in 20 venues across the city. Its
aim was to communicate science and technology,
and the wonder of discovery to the widest
possible audience.
The third Cheltenham Festival of Science was held
over five days in June and attended by an
estimated 27,000 people. The theme was
perception, including events such as the science
of whiskey and the science of perfume. The
festival also included discussions on genetic
modification, nuclear power, society's obsession
with food, and the future of zoos.
The Wrexham Science Festival was held in March
and attracted audiences from north Wales,
Cheshire and Shropshire. Topics included killer
whales, astronomy, working horses, coral reefs
and willow weaving.
The transit of Venus
On the morning of 8 June 2004, the planet Venus
passed between the Earth and the Sun and was
observed by spectators across the United
Kingdom. Transits occur in pairs eight years apart,
at intervals of 122 years. Over 100 astronomers
celebrated the transit in Much Hoole, the
Lancashire village where 20-year-old Jeremiah
Horrocks first correctly predicted and then
observed the transit in 1639. The transit helped
18th century astronomers to estimate the
distance of the Earth to the Sun - a distance now
known as one astronomical unit (nearly
150 million kilometres).

National Science Week
The 11th National Science Week, coordinated by
the British Association for the Advancement of
Science and held throughout the United Kingdom,
took place in March 2004. Organisations
participating included hospitals, schools, industry
and museums, and events included ‘Spring into
science’, a national project to record the arrival of
spring, and the Ig Nobel Prizes tour (see box).
Jt
The Ig Nobels
The Ig Nobel Prizes tour of the United Kingdom
took place as part of National Science Week.
The awards are intended to celebrate the unusual
and imaginative, as well as spur people's interest
in science.
The 2003 prize for medicine was awarded to a
team from University College London. They
demonstrated that the hippocampus, the part of
the brain associated with navigation and spatial
memory, was enlarged in the brains of London
taxi drivers compared with other people. The
scientists also found that part of the
hippocampus grew larger as the taxi drivers spent
more time in the job.
Scientific museums
The Natural History Museum is one of the most
popular UK visitor attractions. It has exhibitions
devoted to the Earth and the life sciences and is
also a leading centre in the fields of taxonomy and
biodiversity. It is founded on collections of 70
million specimens from the natural world, and has
500,000 historically important original works of
art. The museum employs 350 scientists, and is
active in research projects in 60 countries. The
museum also offers an advisory service to foreign
institutions. It won ‘Large Visitor Attraction of the
Year’ at the Excellence in England Awards in 2004.
The Science Museum promotes public
understanding of the history of science,
technology, industry and medicine. The collections
contain many of the icons of the scientific age
with objects as diverse as Crick and Watson’s DNA
model and Stephenson’s Rocket (see page 399).
These two museums are in South Kensington,
London. Other important collections include
those at the Museum of Science and Industry in
Manchester, the Museum of the History of Science
in Oxford, and the Royal Scottish Museum,
Edinburgh.
Aventis Prize for Science Books 2004
The winner of the 16th international science book
prize, managed by the Royal Society, was Bill
Bryson for A Short History of Nearly Everything.
Mr Bryson, an American based in England and
more usually associated with travel writing, was
awarded the prize in recognition of the exposure
the book had given to science.
The prize for the best science book for children
under 14 was awarded to author Nick Arnold and
illustrator Tony De Saulles for Really Rotten
Experiments. It is the second time the pair have
won the award.
Discovery centres
There are over 80 science and discovery centres
in the United Kingdom, attracting over 11 million
visits each year. The Science and Discovery
Centre Network was set up in 2001 to support
and promote the centres, and is funded by the
OST and the Wellcome Trust (see page 401).
At-Bristol comprises three attractions:
Explore-At-Bristol - a hands-on science centre
with more than 150 exhibits and a planetarium;
Wildwalk-At-Bristol - a natural history centre
featuring interactive displays; and the IMAX
Theatre-At-Bristol.
Techniquest Science Discovery Centre in Cardiff
has over 100 hands-on exhibits and by 2004 had
welcomed over 2.5 million people since it opened
in 1986. Events in 2004 included Animalympics,
exploring how humans would do in a battle with
animals when running and jumping.
Scotland has four interactive science centres - in
Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow -
which in 2003 together attracted 584,000 paying
398
UK 2005
25 Science, engineering and technology
visitors and 109,000 pupils on school visits. The
Glasgow Science Centre is the largest such centre
in the United Kingdom and, like Stratosphere in
Aberdeen, has a range of exhibits. Dynamic Earth
in Edinburgh specialises in the earth sciences and
Sensation in Dundee in biological sciences.
In Belfast, the W5 Interactive Discovery Centre
is located within Northern Ireland’s Millennium
project, Odyssey. It has over 100 hands-on,
high-technology exhibits and attracted 222,000
visitors in 2003/04.
Zoological gardens
The Zoological Society of London (ZSL), an
independent conservation, science and education
charity founded in 1826, runs London Zoo in
Regent’s Park. It also owns and runs Whipsnade
Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire. ZSL is
responsible for the Institute of Zoology, which
carries out research in support of animal
conservation. The Institute’s work covers topics
such as ecology, reproductive biology and
conservation genetics. ZSL also operates in
overseas projects concerned with practical field
conservation, primarily in East and Southern
Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Other
zoos in the United Kingdom include those in
Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley and Marwell
(near Winchester).
Botanic gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded in 1759,
are based at Kew in south-west London and at
Wakehurst Place, Ardingly in West Sussex (see
also page 285). They contain one of the largest
collections of living and dried plants in the world.
Research is conducted into all aspects of plant life,
including physiology, biochemistry, genetics,
economic botany and the conservation of habitats
and species.
The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh was
established in 1670 and is the national botanic
garden of Scotland. Together with its three
associated specialist gardens, it has become an
internationally recognised centre for taxonomy;
for the conservation and study of living and
preserved plants and fungi; and as a provider of
horticultural education.
A National Botanic Garden and research
centre for Wales was opened in 2000 on a site on
the Middleton Hall estate near Carmarthen.
The Rainhill Trials
October 2004 marks the 175th anniversary of the
Rainhill Trials, a competition held by the Liverpool
and Manchester Railway Company to find the
best locomotive engine for a railway line that was
being built to serve the two cities.
The competition was notable for the participation
of the Rocket, considered by many to be the
forerunner of all steam passenger locomotives,
and a key factor in the advance of the Industrial
Revolution. The engine was designed and built by
George Stephenson with the help of his son,
Robert, and Henry Booth.
The success of the Rocket ms due to several
new design features. It was the first locomotive
to have a multi-tube boiler-with 25 copper
tubes rather than a single flue or twin flue.
The blast pipe also increased the draught to the
fire by concentrating exhaust steam at the base
of the chimney, generating more power.

The SET workforce
The term ‘science and engineering base’ is used to
describe the research and postgraduate training
capacity based in the universities and colleges of
higher education and in establishments operated
by the Research Councils (see pages 393-96). Also
included are the national and international central
facilities (such as CERN - see page 400) supported
by the Research Councils and available for use by
UK scientists and engineers. There are also
important contributions from private institutions,
chiefly those funded by charities. The science and
engineering base is the main provider of basic
research and much of the strategic research carried
out in the United Kingdom. It also collaborates
with the private sector in the conduct of specific
applied research.
According to the 2002 ONS Business R&D Survey,
the number of staff employed on R&D in UK
399
25 Science, engineering and technology
UK 2005
businesses in 2002 had increased to 167,000,
10 per cent more than in 2001 and 22 per cent
more than a low point in 1997. Scientists and
engineers accounted for almost two-thirds.
In 2001/02 there were over 87,000 full-time SET
staff employed in higher education, including
nearly 48,500 in teaching and research and just
over 35,500 working only in research. In all,
33 per cent were women.
In 2003 the Government published A Strategy for
Women in Science, Engineering and Technology. The
aim of the strategy is to improve the participation
of women in employment, education and policy
making in the United Kingdom and it is aimed
equally at academia, industry and public service.
International collaboration
European Union
The EU’s Sixth Framework Programme for
Research and Technical Development (FP6),
published in June 2002, has a budget of €17.5
billion for the four years to 2006. Framework
programmes are the EU’s main instrument for
funding research. There are seven key areas within
FP6: research in genomics and biotechnology for
health; information society technologies;
nanotechnologies and nanosciences; aeronautics
and space; food safety; sustainable development;
and economic and social sciences. Framework
programmes also provide support for mobility,
fellowships, infrastructures and the continuation
of nuclear research under Euratom.
FP6 is a key mechanism in realising a European
Research Area, which aims to regroup EU support
Rosalind Franklin Award
The second Rosalind Franklin Award, promoting
women in science, was awarded to Professor
Carol Robinson in May 2004. The award
commemorates the scientist whose work
contributed to the discovery of the double helix
structure of DNA and rewards excellence in SET.
Professor Robinson, of Cambridge University, is a
world leader in the field of mass spectrometry
and has applied the process to study the
interactions of proteins.
for better coordination of research and innovation
policies, at national and EU levels. The United
Kingdom is actively engaged in the development
of a common European Space Strategy involving
ESA, the EU and others.
The six grant-giving Research Councils (see pages
393-96), in association with UK universities,
maintain the UK Research Office in Brussels,
which promotes UK participation in European
research programmes. The CCLRC (see page 394)
receives funds from the EU to make its facilities
available to researchers from other Member States.
The Government is in consultation for FP7
covering the four years from 2006, and plans to
outline its position in 2005.
Other international activities
The COST programme (European co-operation in
the field of scientific and technical research) is a
multilateral agreement involving 34 countries. Its
purpose is to encourage co-operation in national
research activities across Europe, with participants
from industry, academia and research laboratories.
The United Kingdom participates in the majority
of COST actions and in the management of the
programme.
Another example of international collaboration is
CERN, home to the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics, based in Geneva, where the Large
Hadron Collider is due to be completed by 2007.
Scientific programmes at CERN aim to test, verify
and develop the ‘standard model’ of the origin and
structure of the Universe. There are 20 member
states. PPARC (see page 396) leads UK
participation in CERN, and the CCLRC (see
page 394) coordinates several aspects of research
community involvement. The CCLRC provides the
UK contribution to the costs of access by UK
researchers to the high-flux neutron source at the
Institute Laue-Langevin and to the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, both in Grenoble.
The United Kingdom is a member of the
European Space Agency, providing PPARC
researchers entry to the Cosmic Vision 2020
space mission programme. In 2002 it also joined
the multinational European Southern
Observatory, giving PPARC-funded scientists
access to a suite of 8-metre VLTs (Very Large
Telescopes) in Chile.

which conducts research on the ionosphere.
NERC has a major involvement in international
programmes of research into global climate
change, organised through the World Climate
Research Programme and the International
Geosphere-Biosphere Programme. It also supports
the UK subscription to the Ocean Drilling
Programme.
The MRC (see page 395) pays the UK subscription
to the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
(EMBL), which has its home research base in
Heidelberg, Germany. The European
Bioinformatics Institute, an outstation of the
EMBL, at Hinxton, near Cambridge, provides
access to important molecular biology, sequencing
and structural databases. The MRC is also
responsible for UK subscriptions to the
International Agency for Cancer Research, Lyon.
BBSRC (see page 394) and MRC pay the UK
subscription to the Human Frontiers Science
Program, which promotes international
collaboration in molecular level approaches to
brain function and other biological functions.
The Research Councils have a number of bilateral
arrangements to promote international
collaboration. For example, the BBSRC has
agreements with its equivalent organisations in
Canada, China, France, India, Japan, the Republic
of Korea, the Netherlands and the United States,
and supports travel, workshops and other activities
to encourage international links.
The United Kingdom is a member of the science
and technology committees of many international
organisations, including the OECD and NATO
(see page 67), and various specialised agencies
of the United Nations, including UNESCO. The
Research Councils and the Royal Society are
members of the European Science Foundation -
an association of 76 major national funding
agencies in 29 European countries. The UK
Government also enters into bilateral agreements
with other governments to encourage closer
collaboration in SET.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office has
established a network of Science & Technology
(S&T) attaches in 45 posts in 22 countries. These
aim to:
■ inform UK science policy development,
benchmarking UK performance against other
nations and using S&T in international
negotiations;
■ promote the United Kingdom as the
international partner of choice for
collaboration, and attract overseas expertise
in areas which complement existing or
potential UK strengths; and
■ to help companies access overseas innovation
and technology, facilitate high technology
trade and attract foreign investment.
The British Council (see page 81) promotes
‘cutting edge’ UK science through events,
partnership programmes, seminars, exhibitions
and information provision.
Other organisations
Charitable organisations
Medical research charities are a major source of
funds for research in the United Kingdom.
According to the Association of Medical Research
Charities (AMRC), its members spent more than
£660 million in support of medical research in the
United Kingdom in 2002/03. The two largest
contributors are the Wellcome Trust and Cancer
Research UK.
The Wellcome Trust is an independent charity,
established under the will of Sir Henry Wellcome
in 1936. Its mission is ‘to foster and promote
research with the aim of improving human and
animal health’. To this end, it supports ‘blue sky’
research and applied clinical research, and
encourages the exploitation of research findings
for medical benefit. The Trust also seeks to raise
awareness of the medical, ethical and social
implications of research and to promote dialogue
between scientists, the public and policy makers.
In 2002/03, the Wellcome Trust spent £552 million.
It will be committing £1.5 billion over five years
to complement the programme of resources
announced in the 2004 Spending Review.
Cancer Research UK is the largest volunteer-
supported cancer research organisation in the
world, supporting the work of around 3,000
scientists across the United Kingdom. Its annual
scientific expenditure is more than £190 million,
most of which is raised through donations.

Professional and learned institutions
There are numerous technical institutions,
professional associations and learned societies in
the United Kingdom, which promote their own
disciplines or the education and professional well¬
being of their members. The Council of Science
and Technology Institutes has ten member
institutes representing biochemistry, biology,
chemistry, the environment, food science and
technology, geology, hospital physics and physics.
Science
The Royal Society, founded in 1660, had 11,272
Fellows and 129 Foreign Members in 2004. The
Society has three roles: as the national academy
of science, as a learned society and as a funding
agency for the scientific community. It offers
independent advice to government on science
matters, acts as an international forum for
discussion of ground-breaking scientific research,
supports many of the best young scientists and
engineers in the United Kingdom, facilitates
dialogue between scientists and the public, and
promotes science education. Its government grant
for 2004/05 is £31 million.
In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by offering
postdoctoral research fellowships and
studentships, awarding prizes and grants,
organising meetings and symposia, and publishing
journals. It also acts as a source of independent
scientific advice to the Government and others.
Three other major institutions publicise scientific
developments by means of lectures and
publications for specialists and schoolchildren. Of
these, the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, founded in 1831, is mainly concerned
with the sciences, while the Royal Society of Art,
dating from 1754, deals with the arts and
commerce as well as science. The Royal
Institution, founded in 1799, arranges a large and
varied public programme of events to bring
science to a wider audience, including the
Christmas Lectures and the Friday Evening
Discourses. Over 100 events are organised each
year, attracting around 70,000 visitors of all ages.
The Christmas Lectures (started by Michael
Faraday) have been running since 1825. As well
as being broadcast in the United Kingdom, the
lectures are transmitted to other parts of Europe,
Japan and Korea.
Colossus
The 60th anniversary of Colossus, now generally
recognised as the world's first programmable
electronic computer, took place in 2004. Built by
Tommy Flowers at the Post Office research
laboratory, it was designed to break the codes of
the German military in World War Two. It went
into operation at Bletchley Park in February 1944
and, once running, it was not turned off until the
end of the war, in order to help prevent its 1,500
vacuum valves from blowing. Reading 5,000
teleprinted characters a second, it helped cut
code breaking from weeks to hours, which was
to prove vital for the D-Day preparations (see
page 99).

Airplane engines
Rolls-Royce delivered the first of its Trent 900
engines designed for Airbus's A380 double¬
decked 'super-jumbo' in February 2004. The
engine will provide 70,000 lb of thrust at take-off
and its makers claim it is the world's cleanest
large turbofan engine, as measured by emissions
per pound of thrust. The manufacturer has also
been working to reduce noise emissions from the
engine in order to meet regulations for departure
at London airports. The Trent 900's Quick system,
which provides constant data on how the engine
performs in-flight, helps maintenance teams
anticipate problems before they become
aggravated. In previous tests at Rolls-Royce test
beds, the engine coped successfully with the
simulated ingestion of a bird and with a 'blade
off' test, in which a fan blade is deliberately fired
loose. The A380 can seat around 555 people,
about 155 more than current jumbo jets, and is
due to enter service in spring 2006.

professional partners, the registration fees of
250,000 registered engineers, and industry
sponsorship. It also receives core funding from
the DTI.
The national academy of engineering in the
United Kingdom is the Royal Academy of
Engineering, which has just over 1,300 Fellows
including around 90 Foreign Members. It assists
the development of national policy on engineering
issues by submitting expert evidence to
parliamentary and government bodies. The
Academy’s programmes seek to enhance UK
engineering capabilities, inspire the next
generation of engineers, raise awareness of the
importance of engineering to society and develop
links between industry and higher education. It
had a government grant of £5.3 million in
2003/04.

In terms of gross value added (GVA - see
glossary), agriculture accounted for only 0.8 per
cent of the total UK economy in 2003, unchanged
from the previous three years. Its share of the total
economy has declined from 2.9 per cent in 1973
and 1.6 per cent in 1995, mainly because of a long¬
term fall in agricultural prices. Issues such as the
continuing debate on genetically modified food
(see page 408), however, mean that its profile
across the United Kingdom is greater than its
contribution to the economy would suggest.
The United Kingdom was 64 per cent self-
sufficient for all food and 77 per cent for
indigenous food in 2003. This represented a small
increase from the previous year, when the lowest
level of self-sufficiency was recorded since 1988,
the year in which the current method of
calculation was first applied.
Although the UK agricultural industry accounts
for the lowest proportion of national GVA of any
country in the European Union (EU), it is more
efficient than most, with the fourth highest GVA
per annual work unit (full-time equivalents)
(Table 26.1).

Agriculture
In 2003 UK agriculture contributed £7.9 billion to
the economy and employed some 533,000 people.
Agricultural land represents 77 per cent of the
total UK land area, compared with around 40 per
cent for the EU as a whole. Most agricultural land
in the United Kingdom is grassland or rough
grazing, with only a quarter used to grow crops
(Figure 26.2).
In June 2003 there were 304,000 farm holdings
in the United Kingdom, with an average area of
56.4 hectares. Over half were smaller than the
minimum size considered by the EU to be
necessary for full-time holdings. About two-thirds
of all agricultural land was owner-occupied; the
rest was tenanted or rented.

Total income from farming in 2003 rose in real
terms for the third successive year, by 28 per cent
to £3.2 billion, 50 per cent below its peak in 1995
but 77 per cent above the low point in 2000. The
value of output (including subsidies directly
related to products) rose by 6.2 per cent, or £963
million. Output volume was 1.7 per cent lower,
but prices received were generally higher, due in
part to exchange rate movements. There were
notable increases in the value of output of
livestock and cereals. Income per full-time worker

Migrant agricultural workers
As Table 26.1 shows, the United Kingdom has the
lowest proportion of its workforce employed in
agriculture of any EU country. However, the sector
does employ a large number of migrant and
seasonal workers. The Home Office runs the
Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme, which
allows workers from outside the European
Economic Area (see page 104) to enter the
United Kingdom to undertake seasonal
agricultural work for farmers and growers. There
will be 16,250 places on this scheme in 2005.
The Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 followed
a tragedy in which 21 Chinese workers were
drowned by the incoming tide when picking
cockles in Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, in
February 2004. The Act applies to labour
providers in the agricultural, shellfish-gathering
and associated processing and packaging sectors,
and aims to stop the exploitation of workers by
setting up a licensing scheme. This will enable
everyone in the food supply chain to distinguish
between legal and illegal operators.
from agriculture in the United Kingdom increased
by 32 per cent in real terms.
Since 1973 the productivity of the UK agriculture
industry has increased by 45 per cent. Total factor
productivity increased by 0.8 per cent in 2003 as
labour inputs continued to fall.
Prices received by agricultural producers for their
products were 17 per cent lower in 2003 compared
with the peak in 1995 (see Figure 26.3). The
largest falls were in the prices of root crops
(52 per cent), cereals (37 per cent) and seeds
(35 per cent). The main reason for the overall fall
has been the relatively high level of sterling since
the mid-1990s, which made exports more
expensive and imports cheaper. Reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy (see page 413), which
cut commodity prices and compensated with direct
payments to farmers, also had an effect. The 5 per
cent rise in product prices during 2003 was mainly
due to the higher prices of fresh fruit, up
14 per cent; fresh vegetables, up 13 per cent; eggs,
up 22 per cent; and cereals, up 11 per cent.

Agricultural tenure
About 35 per cent of agricultural land (excluding
common rough grazing) in England and
21 per cent in Wales is rented. There is a similar
proportion of rented land in Scotland, some of
it under crofting tenure.
Crofting is a system of land tenure regulated
through the Crofting Acts and found only in the
Highlands and Islands of Scotland. A croft is a
unit of land subject to these Acts; there are around
17,700 in total, and croft land covers almost
405
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
UK 2005
130,000 hectares (not including common grazing
land). The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 gave
crofting communities the right to acquire and
control land where they live and work, together
with sporting rights associated with that land.
Most farms in Northern Ireland are owner-
occupied, but the conacre system allows owners not
wishing to farm all their land to let it to others on
what are nominally short-term lettings (for 11
months or 364 days). Conacre land, about 34 per
cent of agricultural land, is used mainly for grazing.
Production
Home production of the principal foods is shown
in Table 26.4.
Livestock
About 40 per cent of UK farms are devoted mainly
to dairy farming, beef cattle or sheep. Most of the
beef animals and sheep are reared in uplands
where agriculture is largely related to grassland
and moorland areas. Among world-famous UK
livestock are the Hereford, Welsh Black and
Aberdeen Angus beef breeds; the Jersey, Guernsey
and Ayrshire dairy breeds; the Large White pig
breed; and Suffolk and Romney Marsh sheep. The
United Kingdom has more than 60 native sheep
breeds and many cross-bred varieties. Data on
livestock products are given in Table 26.5.
Cattle and sheep constitute 35 per cent of the
value of UK gross agricultural output. Dairy
production is the largest of the sector, followed by
cattle and calves, and then sheep and lambs.
In 2002 the average size of dairy herds was 87 in
England, 66 in Wales, 95 in Scotland and 61 in
Northern Ireland. The average milk yield for each
dairy cow in the United Kingdom in 2003 was
6,620 litres. The total value of production of milk
and milk products for human consumption rose
by 7 per cent, to £2.6 billion. This was primarily
due to an increase in the value of milk sold for
processing to dairy companies, which in turn arose
mainly from an increase in the average price of
milk received by farmers.
More than half of home-bred beef production
originates from the national dairy herd, in which
the Holstein-Friesian breed predominates. The
remainder derives from suckler herds producing

high-quality beef calves. In the year to June 2003
the UK cattle population increased by 1.1 per cent
to 10.5 million. The value of production of cattle
and calves rose only slightly in 2003, by 0.4 per
cent to £2.1 billion, due primarily to an increase in
the value of home-fed production of beef and veal.
The number of sheep and lambs in the United
Kingdom was 35.8 million in June 2003,
unchanged from a year earlier. The value of
production in 2003 rose by 12 per cent to
£1 billion, mainly due to a 13 per cent increase
in the value of home-fed production and a 6.1 per
cent increase in subsidy payments.
In the year to June 2003 the total number of pigs
in the United Kingdom fell by 9.7 per cent, to 5.0
million. The value of production fell by 0.5 per

and half the peak value of £1.4 billion in 1996. The
main reason was a 0.4 per cent fall in the value of

Crops
Farms devoted primarily to arable crops are found
mainly in eastern and central southern England
and eastern Scotland. The main crops are shown
in Figure 26.6 and Table 26.7. In 2003, 3.1 million
hectares were planted to cereals - predominantly
wheat and barley - a reduction of 5.7 per cent
on 2002, and 8.6 per cent less than in 2000. In
particular, there was a fall in the area of wheat
planted in 2003 due to wet weather conditions in
the autumn in some important growing regions.
The total volume of cereal production fell by 6 per
cent, while the total value rose by 10 per cent.
The value of production of oilseed rape increased
by 42 per cent in 2003. The volume of production
rose by 21 per cent to 1.8 million tonnes, one of
the largest ever recorded for this crop. Prices
remained strong throughout the year and subsidy
payments rose by 48 per cent. The value of sugar
beet production was unchanged from 2002.
Large-scale potato and vegetable cultivation takes
place on fertile soils throughout the United
Kingdom. The total area for all potato cultivation
fell by 8.4 per cent in 2003, while the value of
production rose by 1.0 per cent as prices paid
to producers rose.
Horticulture
Table 26.8 gives details of the main horticultural
products. In June 2003 the total area devoted to
horticulture (excluding mushrooms, potatoes and
peas for harvesting dry) amounted to 176,000
hectares, virtually unchanged from the previous
year. This area relates to field area and does not
take into account the number of crops in the year.
The overall value of production of vegetables
increased by 1 per cent to £962 million in 2003.
The value of production of ornamentals, such as
flowers and shrubs, also rose, by 3 per cent to
£772 million, and the value of fruit increased by
16 per cent to £285 million as increased demand
for some crops coincided with lower yields to
produce higher prices.
Genetically modified crops
The year 2003 witnessed the final phases of a
four-year UK programme of farm-scale
evaluations (FSEs) of genetically modified (GM)
crops, in which independent researchers studied
the effects that the management of such crops
might have on farmland wildlife when compared

with equivalent non-GM crops. Four crops were
involved, all modified to be resistant to specific
herbicides: oilseed rape (both spring and autumn
sown), beet and maize. The project involved
between 60 and 75 fields of each crop and also
monitored gene-flow, including cross-pollination.
The Government agreed with the industry that no
GM crops would be grown commercially in the
United Kingdom before the results of the FSEs had
been fully assessed.

Results from three of the crops were published in
October 2003. The FSEs found that growing
conventional beet and spring oilseed rape was
better for many groups of wildlife than growing
the GM herbicide-tolerant strains. In contrast, GM
herbicide-tolerant maize was better than
conventional varieties for many groups of wildlife.
Results from autumn oilseed rape are expected to
be published in 2005.
In addition to the FSE, the Government instigated
a wide-ranging review and consultation process on
GM agriculture. The three main elements were:
■ a UK-wide public debate on GM issues, which
reported general unease among the public
about GM crops and food, and little support
for commercialisation of GM crops;
■ a review of GM science, conducted by the
Royal Society, which found that the science
behind the FSEs was sound; that GM is not a
single technology and applications should
be assessed on a case-by-case basis; and that
there is no scientific case for ruling out all
GM crops or products; and
408
UK 2005
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
■ a study of costs and benefits, conducted by
the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit, which
concluded that the GM crops currently
available offer only limited benefits to UK
farmers, although future developments could
offer benefits of greater value and significance.
The Government announced in March 2004 that it
would not allow commercial planting of GM beet
and spring oilseed rape strains, while agreeing, in
principle and subject to conditions, to the
commercial planting of GM maize. Commercial
planting of the GM maize will only be allowed
if certain restrictions are imposed on its EU
marketing consent. In addition, in response to
concerns about the banning of the herbicide
atrazine (which was used in the FSEs), the
Government envisages that if the relevant
company wishes to renew the existing EU consent
beyond October 2006 it will need to submit new
evidence comparing the GM maize with whatever
herbicide practice is in operation with
conventional maize at that time.
Also in March 2004, the Government published
guidance covering new regulations on genetically
modified organisms (GMOs), on tighter labelling
of GM products and on monitoring for
environmental effects. The rules also extend the
range of products requiring traceability, labelling
and other controls.
Non-food uses of crops
The Industrial (Non-food) Crops section in the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Defra) is responsible for the development
of crops which provide renewable raw materials
for energy and industry. Such crops can help meet
sustainable development, climate change and
renewable energy targets, as well as providing new
commercial opportunities for the agriculture
sector. Defra also provides the secretariat for a
government/industry forum on non-food uses of
crops, and supports the National Non-Food Crops
Centre, an independent centre of expertise on
industrial uses of agricultural products. Crops for
the production of heat and power are supported
through the Energy Crops Scheme, part of the
England Rural Development Programme (see page
411). A new Bioenergy Infrastructure Scheme
provides support for biomass energy supply chains.
Food safety
The Food Standards Agency (ESA, see page 199)
aims to ensure that the food consumers eat is safe,
and to offer independent, balanced advice to
government throughout the United Kingdom. The
Meat Hygiene Service, an executive agency of the
ESA, is responsible for enforcing legislation on
meat hygiene, inspection, animal welfare at
slaughter and the control of specified risk
materials in all licensed abattoirs and cutting
premises in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland this
role is carried out by the Department of
Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) on
behalf of the ESA.
The ESA conducts an annual Consumer Attitudes
to Food survey. The 2003 survey found that there
have been changes in the levels of concern over
food safety in recent years - in 2003, 42 per cent of
respondents (aged 16 and over) said that they were
‘very’ or ‘fairly’ concerned about BSE, compared
with 61 per cent in 2000. For GM food these
figures were 38 per cent and 43 per cent,
respectively. Around half of those interviewed in
2003 expressed concern about the amount of fat,
salt and sugar in food.
Pesticides
The Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD), an
executive agency of Defra, administers the
regulation of agricultural, horticultural, forestry,
food storage and home garden pesticides. Its
principal functions are to evaluate and process
applications for approval of pesticide products for
use in Great Britain and provide advice to
government on pesticides policy. The PSD aims to:
■ ensure the safe use of pesticides, both for
people and the environment;
■ reduce negative effects of pesticides,
encourage reductions in their use, and
encourage the development and introduction
of alternative control measures; and
■ harmonise pesticide regulation in Europe.
Organic farming
Organic farming requires farmers to operate a
system based on ecological principles, which
imposes strict limitations on the use of inputs
from outside the organic system. Anyone involved
in the production, processing or import (from
outside the EU) of organic food must be registered
with one of the United Kingdom’s 11 approved
organic certification bodies, and subject to at least
annual inspections by them. The EC regulation
controlling the industry sets out the principle that
409
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
UK 2005
organic farming aims to be self-sufficient, and
fertility should come principally from the farm
itself, for example through the use of animal and
plant manures and crop rotation systems.
The area of land organically farmed in the United
Kingdom grew rapidly in the late 1990s, in
response to a number of factors, including a drop
in farm incomes, the extension of the scope of
organic farming to include livestock, and increases
in subsidy rates. In January 2004 the total area of
organic land (including land in the process of
conversion) was 695,600 hectares, representing
about 4 per cent of the total UK agricultural area
(excluding common grazing). Of the total, 53 per
cent was in Scotland, 37 per cent in England, 8 per
cent in Wales, and 1 per cent in Northern Ireland.
Permanent and temporary pasture accounted for
86 per cent of organic land, while 6 per cent was
used to grow cereals, 2 per cent vegetables and
3 per cent other crops.
The Organic Conversion Information Service,
funded by Defra in England, provides free advice
to farmers and growers considering conversion
to organic farming. Similar services operate in
Wales through the Farming Connect Organic
Development Centre, and in Scotland SEERAD
funds the Scottish Agricultural College to operate
a telephone helpline. The Committee on Organic
Standards advises on standards of organic food
production, set by Defra in consultation with the
other UK agricultural departments.
Exports, marketing and promotion
Exports of food, animal feed and drink were
around £9.9 billion in 2003, compared with
£20.9 billion for imports. EU countries accounted
for 63 per cent of all UK food and drink exports;
the main markets were the Republic of Ireland
(£1.6 billion) and France (£1.2 billion).
Imports and exports of food, animal feed and
drink both increased by 11 per cent between the
fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of
2003. However, this represents a larger increase in
imports than exports in absolute terms, and the
trade deficit in this area widened by 12 per cent
over the period. The largest import categories in
2003 were fruit and vegetables (£4.9 billion), meat
(£3.4 billion) and drink (£3.3 billion). Drink was
the largest export category, worth £3.5 billion,
with the majority of this coming from sales of
whisky (see page 425).
Food from Britain (FEB), an organisation funded
by Defra and the food and drink industry on
behalf of the four UK agricultural departments,
provides marketing and international business
development services to the industry. It has a
network of nine international offices, each with
local food industry expertise and trade contacts.
The FEB has been awarded £3 million over the three
years to 2006 to help promote the regional food
sector in England. The funding is being used for
a programme of activities aimed at trade
development, increasing competitiveness and
raising consumer awareness.
The British Farm Standard red tractor logo,
administered by Assured Food Standards and
owned by the National Farmers’ Union, identifies
food that has been independently verified as
having been produced in accordance with
assurance standards covering food safety, animal
welfare and environmental issues.
The Food Chain Centre is a government-supported
industry-led body, established in 2002 to research
and promote ways in which the food chain can be
made to operate more efficiently. It also seeks to
publicise best practice and encourage information
sharing within the food chain.
Agricultural shows
Several major agricultural shows are held each
year across the United Kingdom, including:
■ the Balmoral Show, Belfast (May);
■ the Royal Highland Show, Edinburgh (June),
with more than 5,000 animals on show and
the largest trade exhibition of agricultural
machinery in Great Britain;
■ the Royal Show, Stoneleigh, Warwickshire
(early July), where visitors can see the latest
techniques and improvements in UK
agriculture;
■ the Royal Welsh Show, Llanelwedd, Builth
Wells (late July - the centenary show was held
in 2004);
■ the Royal Welsh Agricultural Winter Fair,
Llanelwedd, Builth Wells, for livestock and
carcases (December); and
■ the Royal Smithfield Show, London (every
other year), for agricultural technology,
machinery, services, supplies, livestock and
carcases.

Farmers' markets
In June 2004 there were around 470 farmers’
markets operating in the United Kingdom, selling
produce direct to consumers. Of these, 150 were
accredited to FARMA, a body formed from the
amalgamation of the Farm Retail Association and
the National Association of Farmers’ Markets.
Accredited markets must follow these rules:
■ food must be locally produced (each market
has a definition of local);
■ all produce sold must be grown, reared or
otherwise produced by the stallholder; and
■ information should be available to customers
about the rules of the market and the
production methods of the producers.
   ‘ 
Transporting agricultural products
Agricultural products, foodstuffs and beverages in
the United Kingdom are usually transported by
road. A total of 106 million tonnes of agricultural
products were moved by heavy goods vehicles
within Great Britain in 2003, with an average
haul of 107 kilometres. In terms of tonne-
kilometres, nearly 58 per cent of such agricultural
products were moved more than 150 kilometres,
and 22 per cent more than 300 kilometres,
v 
Government role
Defra has responsibility for agriculture, fisheries,
food, animal welfare issues, environmental
protection, and wildlife and the countryside in
general. It also administers support policies agreed
in Brussels which provide around £3 billion a year
to UK agriculture from the EU budget.
The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural
Affairs Department (SEERAD), the Welsh
Assembly Government’s Agriculture and Rural
Regional foods
In 2004, both Arbroath Smokies (haddock) and
Scottish Farmed Salmon joined Roquefort (a
French cheese), Gorgonzola (an Italian cheese)
and Prosciutto de Parma (an Italian ham) on the
list of products recognised by the EU for their
quality and regional identity.
Both the UK products have been registered by
the European Commission as a protected
geographical indication under the EU's protected
food name scheme. The aim of the scheme is
primarily to provide consumers with a guarantee
of the geographical origin and methods of
production of the products they are buying.
Among 35 UK products protected under the
scheme are Dorset Blue cheese, Cornish clotted
cream, Scotch beef and lamb, and Welsh lamb.
Affairs Department (ARAD), and the Department
of Agriculture and Rural Development in
Northern Ireland (DARD) have varying degrees
of responsibility for agriculture and Fisheries.
Each of the four UK administrations has produced
its own agricultural strategy setting out its aims
and ambitions for the industry and outlining
mechanisms to help achieve these objectives.
While the detailed approach varies, reflecting the
different needs of farmers, each strategy is
intended to help the farming industry to become
more economically viable, while promoting
environmental and public health benefits.
Rural Development Programmes (RDPs)
RDPs have the general aims of conserving and
improving the environment; creating productive
and sustainable rural economies; and developing
more diverse and competitive rural industries.
The RDPs run from 2001 to 2006, and will invest
nearly £3 billion in the UK rural economy.
The England RDP is investing £1.6 billion in rural
development and agri-environment measures.
These include the Environmentally Sensitive Areas
(ESAs) and Countryside Stewardship Schemes; the
Rural Enterprise Scheme; the Energy Crops
Scheme; the Processing and Marketing Grant; and
the Vocational Training Scheme.
The Scottish Rural Development Programme
(SRDP) concentrates on complementing the
Common Agricultural Policy (see page 413) and
provides support for less favoured areas (LFAs),
411
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
UK 2005
agri-environment measures, and afforestation.
Around £685 million is being spent over the
lifetime of the programme. In addition, the
Agricultural Business Development Scheme
provides support to farmers and crofters and their
families in the Highlands and Islands. SEERAD
will provide £50 million towards supporting
diversification elsewhere in Scotland between
2001 and 2006.
The Rural Development Plan for Wales involves
investment of around £450 million. The
programme makes funds available for schemes
such as the Tir Gofal (Land in Care) whole farm
agri-environment scheme and the Processing and
Marketing Grant Scheme. It includes support for
hill farming and a range of forestry and farm
woodland initiatives.
The Rural Development Regulation Plan for
Northern Ireland, which runs from 2000 to 2006,
is worth £266 million. It includes the LEA support
scheme and an enhanced agri-environment
programme. DARD also manages a RDP targeted at
the broader rural community that is expected to be
worth about £80 million between 2001 and 2007.
Land based schemes
Land based schemes are a major part of the RDPs.
Within them, agri-environment schemes make
payments for the management of land to
maintain, enhance and extend wildlife habitats;
conserve historic or geological features; encourage
public access; and restore traditional aspects of the
countryside. Agri-environment schemes are
funded by the EU and the Government, and
include:
■ the ESA scheme,1 which offers incentives to
farmers to adopt agricultural practices that
will safeguard and enhance parts of the
country of particularly high landscape,
wildlife or historic value. The scheme
operates as Tir Gofal in Wales;
■ the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, which
is the main scheme for the wider countryside
in England. Farmers and land managers enter
ten-year agreements to manage land in an

applicants on 31 March 2004. Subject to EU approval, they will be

environmentally beneficial way in return for
annual payments. The Countryside
Management Scheme fulfils a similar role in
Northern Ireland;
■ the Rural Stewardship Scheme in Scotland,
which has replaced both the ESA and
Countryside Premium Scheme as the main
means of encouraging environmentally
friendly farming practice;
■ organic farming schemes, which offer
payments to farmers to aid them in converting
to organic farming and thereafter to continue
to manage their land in an environmentally
beneficial way; and
■ simplified ‘entry level’ agri-environment
schemes, which are being developed in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. A pilot
for the English scheme was launched in four
areas in 2003.
In England, the entry level scheme will form part
of a new, integrated agri-environment scheme to
be known as ‘Environmental Stewardship’.
Other land based schemes include the Farm
Woodland Premium scheme (partly funded by the
EU), which aims to encourage farmers to convert
productive agricultural land to woodland by
providing payments to help offset consequent falls
in agricultural income (the Scottish Forestry Grants
Scheme and Farmland Premium fulfil a similar
role); and the Hill Farm Allowance Scheme, which
provides support to hill farmers in the English
LFAs, in recognition of the difficulties they face and
the vital role they play in maintaining landscape
and community in upland areas. This scheme
operates as Tir Mynydd in Wales, while in Scotland,
the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme supports
environmentally sustainable farming in remote and
disadvantaged areas.
Project based schemes
These schemes are intended to benefit the wider
rural economy. Those operating in England are the
Rural Enterprise Scheme, which helps farmers
and other rural businesses adapt to changing
markets; the Vocational Training Scheme, which
is aimed at improving the occupational skills of
farmers and foresters; and the Processing and
Marketing Grant.

Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
The CAP was introduced in 1962, driven by
a need to ensure food security in Europe.
However, recent reforms emphasise a more
market-oriented approach to agriculture. Total
UK expenditure under the CAP and on national
grants and subsidies (less levies) in 2003
increased by 8 per cent from 2002, to £2.8 billion
(Figure 26.9).
To prevent and detect fraud, expenditure under
the CAP arable and livestock schemes is protected
through the Integrated Administration and
Control System (IACS). The controls include
verification checks of claimed land and animals,
via both on-the-spot inspections and remote
sensing by satellites.
EU legislation permits Member States to recycle,
or ‘modulate’, a proportion of payments made
direct to farmers under CAP commodity regimes.
Modulation, to help fund the RDP, was introduced
in 2001 at an initial flat rate of 2.5 per cent, rising
to 3 per cent in 2002 and 3.5 per cent in 2003 and
2004. This means a proportion of subsidy
payments is reallocated to agri-environment and
forestry schemes such as Countryside Stewardship,
Tir Gofal, and ESAs. The Government is matching
the sum reallocated to provide further funding for
the RDPs.

In June 2003, and again in April 2004, the Council
of Agriculture Ministers agreed proposals to
reform the CAP. These reforms break the link
between most subsidies and what and how much
farmers produce, and make subsidy dependent on
meeting environmental and other standards. They
are intended to reduce environmental damage,
make European agriculture more competitive and
market-oriented, promote simplification of the
CAP, facilitate the EU enlargement process (see
page 71) and increase flexibility while
guaranteeing farmers income stability.
A major part of the CAP reform process will be
the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme
in 2005. It will replace a large number of the
subsidies farmers receive with a single payment
that will not be linked to what they produce.
The new scheme is intended to reduce the
environmental impact of farming by removing an
incentive to intensify production, and by linking
payment of the subsidy to compliance with
environmental, food safety, animal health and
other standards. It will be implemented on a
regional basis across the United Kingdom.
Livestock subsidies
Five direct subsidies are currently available to
livestock producers. These include the Beef Special
Premium, a subsidy for male cattle; the Suckler
Cow Premium, a subsidy for female cattle which
form part of a suckler breeding herd used for
rearing calves for meat production; and the Sheep
Annual Premium, a subsidy for breeding ewes.
These subsidies will be replaced by the Single
Payment Scheme in 2005.
Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS)
Under this scheme - part of the CAP - farmers
may claim area payments on cereals, oilseeds,
proteins and linseed, and on flax and hemp for
fibre. A condition for claiming is that farmers
(excluding small producers) must ‘set aside’, and
not use, a certain percentage of their land, thereby
avoiding overproduction, and must comply with
the strict rules for managing set-aside. The
minimum rate for set-aside for 2004 was
5 per cent of the total area claimed (down from
10 per cent in 2003).
In 2003 there were around 55,000 claims for area
payments in the United Kingdom in respect of
4.5 million hectares of land. After allowing for
modulation, payments for claims made in 2003 are
413
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
UK 2005
expected to total about £1.1 billion. The AAPS will
be replaced by the Single Payment Scheme.
Professional, scientific and technical
services
A number of organisations provide professional,
scientific and technical services:
■ the Rural Development Service of Defra
provides services for the England RDP,
relating to the enhancement and protection of
the environment, including biodiversity and
rural development;
■ in Wales, similar services are provided by
Farming Connect and ARAD’s divisional
offices;
■ in Scotland, SEERAD agricultural staff
provide professional and technical scheme
implementation services, and the Scottish
Agricultural College (SAC) provides
professional, business, scientific and technical
services in the agriculture, rural business,
food and drink, and environmental markets;
■ DARD has a similar remit in Northern
Ireland;
■ the Farm Business Advice Service aims to help
farmers increase profitability and examine the
possibility of diversification; and
■ Lantra, which is the UK Sector Skills Council
(see page 136) for the industry, receives
government support under contracts from
Defra and the Scottish Executive.
Animal health and welfare
Professional advice and action on the statutory
control of animal health and the welfare of farm
livestock are the responsibility of the State
Veterinary Service in Great Britain. It is supported
in England and Wales by the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/vla),
which also offers its services to the private sector
on a commercial basis. Similar support is provided
in Scotland by the SAC. In Northern Ireland,
DARD’s Veterinary Service carries out a similar
role to the State Veterinary Service, supported by
its Veterinary Sciences Division.
The Welsh Assembly Government will take over
residual animal health and welfare powers in Wales
from Defra by the end of 2004. A Veterinary Policy
Unit will be created, based within the Assembly’s
Environment Planning and Countryside Division.
Defra, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh
Assembly Government launched an Animal Health
and Welfare Strategy for Great Britain in June
2004. The Strategy aims to make improvements in
the health and welfare of kept animals while
protecting society, the economy and the
environment from the effect of animal diseases.
Defra published a draff Animal Welfare Bill in July
2004. It covers the welfare of all farmed, wild or
exotic animals in captivity, domestic animals, and
animals in entertainment and sport, and proposes
a new statutory duty of care on owners. The Bill
applies to England and Wales. Similar legislation is
being considered in Scotland.
The United Kingdom enforces controls on imports
of live animals, genetic material, and products of
animal origin, including checks on all individual
consignments originating from outside the EU
and frequent checks on those from other EU
Member States. Measures can be taken to prevent
the import of diseased animals and genetic
material from regions or countries affected by
disease.
Imports of poultry from Thailand were suspended
by the EU in January 2004 in response to an
outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
(HPAI - ‘bird flu). This supplemented an existing
UK ban on the import of live poultry and
hatching eggs. Outbreaks of HPAI had already
been confirmed elsewhere in South East Asia, but
occurrence of the disease in Thailand was of more
concern as the EU imports large quantities of Thai
poultrymeat.
An EC Directive on welfare standards for laying
hens stopped the installation of conventional
barren battery cages from 1 January 2003, and will
ban them altogether from January 2012. Currently
farmers are still able to use ‘enriched cages, which
have more space for each bird and a nest, perch
and litter, although the EC will report in 2005 on
the various systems for rearing laying hens, and
make proposals as to which should be allowed.
The Pet Travel Scheme allows cats, dogs and ferrets
from certain countries to enter or re-enter the
United Kingdom without quarantine provided they
meet the relevant rules. The scheme started for cats
and dogs in 2000, covering a number of European
countries only. It has since been extended to cover
certain other countries, for example Jamaica,
Australia, Japan, the United States and Canada. An
414
UK 2005
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
EC regulation on the non-commercial movement
of pets came into force in 2003 and applied from
July 2004. This has changed the documentation
required for animals to travel, and also added
ferrets and some additional countries to the
scheme. The UK scheme will continue broadly
unchanged until at least 2008.
Movement of live animals
The British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) was
set up in 1998 to record the births, movements
and deaths of the 10 million cattle in Great
Britain. There is a legal requirement to notify the
BCMS of all births, deaths and movements
between holdings, and around 13 million such
movements are notified each year. In Northern
Ireland, all cattle and cattle movements are
recorded on the Animal and Public Health
Information System (APHIS).
The United Kingdom was one of 12 European
countries to sign up to the new Council of Europe
Convention on the Protection of Animals during
International Transport in November 2003. The
Convention will extend animal welfare standards
beyond the borders of the EU.
Tuberculosis (TB) in cattle
In response to the 1996 Krebs report, a scientific
review into the links between bovine tuberculosis
and badgers, the Government set out a five-point
plan of action to tackle bovine TB. One element is
research to find out how the disease is spread
among cattle and wildlife, including research into
improved diagnostic tests and the development of
a TB vaccine. An on-farm epidemiological survey,
known as TB99, is starting to provide data to help
understand the disease and focus future research.
Another important element of the Government’s
strategy in Great Britain is designed to establish
the contribution that badger culling strategies
could make in reducing the spread of TB to cattle.
However, reactive culling (in areas where there
have been recent outbreaks of TB) under the trial
was suspended in November 2003 when evidence
emerged that there was actually an increase in the
number of cases of bovine TB occurring in
reactive culling areas compared with areas in
which no culling took place. Proactive culling
(where all badgers in an area are killed regardless
of whether or not there has been an outbreak of
TB) and control surveying will continue until
results can be obtained.
In Northern Ireland, DARD is implementing
revised control measures aimed at bringing about
a reduction in the incidence of bovine TB.
Fur farming
Keeping animals solely or primarily for slaughter
for their fur is illegal across the United Kingdom.
Veterinary medicinal products
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate, an executive
agency of Defra, aims to protect public health,
animal health and the environment, and to
promote animal welfare, by ensuring the safety,
quality and efficacy of all aspects of veterinary
medicines in the United Kingdom. The
Government is advised by the independent
scientific Veterinary Products Committee on
scientific issues arising from the authorisation
procedures for veterinary medicines.
Plant Health Service
The Plant Health Service aims to prevent the
introduction or spread of serious plant pests and
diseases which threaten agriculture, horticulture
and the environment. During 2003/04 the service
dealt with the first outbreak of potato ring rot in
the United Kingdom. Tests were carried out on
over 165,000 potato tubers to trace the origin of
the outbreak of the infection and also to check
there had been no spread to other farms. The
outbreak was contained by February 2004.
The fishing industry
The United Kingdom has a major interest in sea
fisheries, reflecting its geographical position in the
North East Atlantic, and is one of the EU’s largest
fishing countries, taking about a fifth of the total
catch in major species. It has an interest in more
than 100 ‘Total Allowable Catches’ set by the
European Commission (see page 64). In 2003 total
UK fish supplies amounted to some 586,000
tonnes, with the UK fishing industry supplying
around 73 per cent by quantity. Household
consumption of fish in the United Kingdom in
2003 was estimated at 476,000 tonnes. Fisheries
Departments, in partnership with the European
Commission, are responsible for the
administration of legislation concerning the
fishing industry, including fish and shellfish
farming. The Sea Fish Industry Authority, a largely
415
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
UK 2005
industry-financed body, undertakes research and
development, provides training and promotes the
marketing and consumption of sea fish. There are
also two government laboratories specialising in
fisheries research - one in Aberdeen and one in
Lowestoft.
The Cabinet Office Strategy Unit published a
report into the UK fishing industry in March
2004. It concluded that the industry could be
profitable and sustainable in the future, provided
that it modernises to deal with global competition.
Key recommendations of the report include:
■ removal of at least a further 13 per cent of
the whitefish fleet to ensure long-term
profitability and stock recovery;
■ improving the industry’s compliance with
rules and regulations;
■ regionalisation of the Common Fisheries
Policy (see page 417) within the United
Kingdom, while strengthening the EU’s role
in ensuring fairness; and
■ reducing the volatility in stock by adopting
a ‘large stock’ strategy, which would mean
reducing the amount of fish caught in the
short term to achieve long-term benefits.
Fish caught and the fishing fleet
UK fishing industry statistics are shown in
Table 26.10. Altogether, some 550,600 tonnes of
sea fish, with a total value of £481 million, were
landed into the United Kingdom by both the
UK fleet and foreign fishing vessels in 2003.
Another major source of supply is the bulk
import of fish caught by other countries.
In 2003 demersal fish (those living on or near the
bottom of the sea) accounted for 32 per cent by
weight of total landings by UK fishing vessels into
the United Kingdom. Pelagic fish (those living in
mid water) accounted for 39 per cent and shellfish
for the remaining 29 per cent. Landings of all
types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by UK
fishing vessels into the United Kingdom totalled
444,600 tonnes. Haddock and cod represented
28 and 11 per cent, respectively, of the total value
of demersal fish landed. The quayside value of
landings of all sea fish, including shellfish, by
UK vessels into the United Kingdom in 2003 was
£392 million.
Catches of crabs, lobsters, nephrops (for example
langoustines) and other shellfish have increased
to supply a rising demand. In 1985 UK fishermen
landed 75,000 tonnes of shellfish worth about
£65 million but by 2003 landings into the United
Kingdom by UK vessels were 129,000 tonnes,
worth £171 million.
Some of the species caught by UK fishing vessels
find a more favourable market overseas and these
species are usually exported or landed directly
abroad. In 2003 UK vessels landed 186,700 tonnes
of sea fish directly into non-UK ports, with a value
of £129 million.
The United Kingdom is contributing to the EU
objective of reducing its fishing fleet by both
cutting numbers and limiting the time some
vessels spend at sea. At the end of 2003 the UK
fleet consisted of 7,271 vessels (including 340
greater than 24.39 metres or 80 feet), and there
were 11,774 professional fishermen (Table 26.10).
There is a substantial fish processing industry in
the United Kingdom. Based on a survey of the
sector in 2004, there are around 560 businesses
which employ some 18,500 people.
At the retail level, there are approximately
1,400 fishmongers. An increasing proportion of
all fish (87 per cent by volume and 88 per cent
by value, excluding canned produce) is sold
through supermarkets. A small proportion of
the catch is used to make fish oils and animal
feeds.
Cetacean by-catch
An estimated 300,000 whales, dolphins and
porpoises worldwide are killed each year by being
trapped in fishing nets. In March 2004 the EU
Agriculture and Fisheries Council reached
agreement on a new regulation to reduce the
level of by-catch caused by fishing fleets from EU
countries. The regulation sets out a number of
actions to be taken, including the compulsory
fitting of acoustic devices ('pingers') to fishing
vessels over 15 metres using fixed gear in the
North Sea, English Channel and Celtic Sea, and a
programme of pilot projects to monitor the
impact of fisheries where pingers are used and
compare the results with by-catch from vessels
under 15 metres long. This research will be used
to help in reviewing the regulations.

Aquaculture
Fish farming is a significant industry in remote
rural areas on the west coast of Scotland, as well
as in Orkney, Shetland and Eilean Siar, primarily
producing salmon. In addition, species such as
cod, halibut and turbot are entering commercial
production. Trout is also farmed as a freshwater
species, and various shellfish species are produced
all round the UK coast. In Scotland, the industry
directly employs about 2,000 people, and generates
over £500 million a year, accounting for around
50 per cent of all Scottish food exports by value.
Aquaculture is subject to a comprehensive
regulatory regime covering such issues as fish
and shellfish health and disease control, control
of discharges into the marine and riverine
environment, site leasing and planning, and the
use of medicines and other chemicals.
Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)
Management of UK sea fisheries is subject to the
EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Under this
policy, UK vessels have exclusive rights to fish
within 6 miles of the UK coast. Certain other EU
Member States have historic rights in UK waters
between 6 and 12 miles. UK vessels have similar
rights in other Member States’ 6 to 12 mile belts.
Between 12 and 200 miles, EU vessels may fish
wherever they have access rights. Non-EU
countries’ vessels may fish in these waters if they
negotiate reciprocal fisheries agreements with the
EU. UK fishery limits extend to 200 miles or the
median line (broadly halfway between the UK
coast and the opposing coastline of another
state).
The primary aim of the CFP is to ensure rational
and sustainable exploitation of fish stocks through
conservation and management policies designed
to protect resources and reflect the needs of the
fishing industry. The CFP aims to improve the
balance between catching capacity and available
resources by regulating the amount of fishing and
the quantities of fish caught, through a system of
Total Allowable Catches (TACs), based on
scientific advice, which are then distributed to
Member States.
The EU Fisheries Council is seeking to improve
the CFP by developing a more long-term approach
to fisheries management, including the setting of
‘multi-annual’ catch limits to replace the previous
annual allocations and introducing recovery plans
for depleted stocks. State aid for building fishing
vessels will cease from the end of 2004, as will aid
for the transfer of EU fishing vessels to third
countries. New Regional Advisory Councils are
being set up under the CFP in order to introduce a
more regional approach to fisheries management.
Conservation of fish stocks
Stocks of some fish in EU waters, notably cod and
hake, have been depleted through a combination
of overfishing, low numbers of fish surviving to
a size where they are taken commercially, and
possible environmental factors.
417
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
UK 2005
Measures have been put in place that aim to halt
and ultimately reverse the decline in EU cod
stocks, which is recognised as a serious problem.
A long-term plan for cod recovery began in 2004,
including limiting the number of days each month
fishermen can spend at sea catching cod.
fisheries are primarily regulated by Scottish
legislation, and the system is being reformed
with the intention of delegating management
responsibilities to local area management
groups.
Fish quotas
EU fisheries ministers set TACs for a wide range
of stocks each year, and the TACs are divided into
quotas for each Member State. UK quotas are then
allocated between various groups within the UK
fishing fleet. Some allocations are managed by
fishermen’s organisations, known as producer
organisations. However, overall responsibility for
managing UK quotas rests with Defra and the
other UK Fisheries Departments. Quotas, technical
conservation and other management measures
aim to restore balance to fish populations and
allow them to renew themselves.
In December 2003 there were increases in a
number of TACs including the quota for haddock,
in order to allow boats to take advantage of an
abundance of the species.
Restrictive licensing system for fishing
vessels
A restrictive licensing system is operated by
the UK Fisheries Departments, controlling the
activities of the UK fishing fleet in accordance
with the EU and UK objectives on fleet and catch
management. All engine-powered UK-registered
vessels which fish for profit for sea fish (other than
salmon, migratory trout and eels) are required to
hold a licence issued by one of the Departments.
To constrain the size of the fleet, additional
licences are not granted. Licences may, however,
be transferred or aggregated in accordance with
detailed rules. A national licensing scheme for
shellfish was introduced in 2004, limiting the
number of vessels permitted to catch crabs,
lobsters and crayfish.
Sea Fisheries Committees
The 12 Sea Fisheries Committees (SFCs) and the
Environment Agency (see page 300) regulate local
sea fisheries around the entire coast of England
and Wales out to 6 miles. SFCs were established
in the 19th century and are empowered to make
by-laws for the management and conservation of
their districts’ fisheries, and to control fishing for
environmental purposes. In Scotland, inshore
Forestry
The area covered by woodland at the end of March
2004 amounted to 17 per cent of total land area
in Scotland, 14 per cent in Wales, 9 per cent in
England and 6 per cent in Northern Ireland.
This gives a total of 12 per cent for the United
Kingdom, or 2.8 million hectares, double the cover
in 1947, and compares with 36 per cent for the EU
as a whole.

26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
In 2003/04, 23,664 hectares of trees were planted
in Great Britain, including both new planting and
restocking. This total included 8,600 hectares of
new broadleaf planting and 2,800 hectares of new
conifer planting (Figure 26.12). Since the early
1990s, incentives for planting broadleaves and
native pinewood, and for planting on former
agricultural land, have led to a growth in the
number of broadleaved trees planted; previously,
timber production was the key priority, resulting
in the planting mainly of fast-growing conifer
trees.
Tree planting is sponsored through various grant
schemes which encourage the planting of species
native to the United Kingdom, including the
Forestry Commission’s Woodland Grant Scheme
and the agricultural departments’ Farm Woodland
Premium Scheme. In Scotland these grants were
replaced in June 2003 with two new schemes
- the Forestry Grant Scheme and the Farmland
Premium Scheme, operated by the Forestry
Commission and SEERAD respectively. Changes
to the grants made in England and Wales are
expected to be made in 2005.
Woodland Grants are components of the RDPs
(see page 411). In England, expenditure of
£139 million between 2000 and 2006 is provided
for Forestry Commission schemes and in Scotland,
£95 million.
The United Kingdom uses a large amount of
timber, paper, board and other wood products
each year, equivalent to about 50 million cubic
metres under bark. Around 85 per cent of this has
to be imported, at a cost of about £9 billion a year.
The timber industry, using wood from sustainable
forests, has received considerable investment in
recent years. The volume of wood supplied from
Great Britain’s forests each year has more than
doubled from 4 million cubic metres over bark
standing in the 1970s to 9.5 million in 2002. This
is forecast to increase to over 16 million cubic
metres by 2020.
The National Forest covers 520 square kilometres
of the English Midlands, covering parts of
Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire. The
aim is to increase woodland cover, from 6 per cent
at its inception in 1994, to about 33 per cent of the
total area, with another third remaining in
agriculture. Over 5 million trees had been planted
by the end of March 2004, raising woodland cover
to some 15 per cent.

Major afforestation projects involving the Forestry
Commission, the Countryside Agency and 58 local
authorities include the creation of 12 Community
Forests in and around major cities in England,
with a total designated area of 450,000 hectares.
These forests help to restore areas marked by
industrial dereliction, provide new habitats for
wildlife and create sites for recreation and
environmental education. In 2002/03, 983 hectares
of new woodlands were created in Community
Forest areas, bringing the total created since 1990
to 10,041 hectares.
The Forestry Commission and forestry
policy
The Forestry Commission operates as a cross-
border public body within Great Britain (for
Northern Ireland see page 420). It serves as the
forestry department of the administration,
advising on forestry policies and, working with
partners, putting those policies into practice. In
particular, it gives grant aid for the stewardship
of existing woodlands and woodland expansion
in the private sector, and manages the national
forests of England, Wales and Scotland.
The work of the Commission in each part of Great
Britain is overseen by a National Committee that
has responsibility for giving strategic direction to
the Commission’s activities. The Forestry
419
26 Agriculture, fishing and forestry
UK 2005
Ministers’ Group discusses matters of common
interest, such as the UK Forestry Standard, which
sets out the criteria and standards for the
management of all UK forests and woodland.
Forestry Commission England is responsible for
leading implementation of the Government’s
England Forestry Strategy. Some of the key targets
for the Commission for 2003-06 are planting
15,000 hectares of new woodland (6,700 hectares
had been planted by the end of March 2004),
harvesting 38 per cent of annual timber growth
each year to promote the sustainable use of the
woodland resource, and creating 2,700 hectares
of new woodland in coalfield areas and deprived
wards to encourage economic regeneration. Forest
Enterprise England, an executive agency of Forestry
Commission England, is responsible for managing
the public forest estate, which amounts to 257,400
hectares and contains 19 per cent of England’s
woodlands. Forestry Commission Scotland
manages the national forests of Scotland, which
total 660,000 hectares, and gives grant aid for
woodland expansion and stewardship in the private
sector through the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme.
Forestry Commission Wales manages the 113,000
hectares of woodland owned by the Assembly.
Progress on sustainable forest management is
measured by the UK Indicators of Sustainable
Forestry. The 40 indicators were first published in
October 2002, and are grouped into six themes:
woodland; biodiversity; condition of forest and
environment; timber and other forest products;
people and forests; and economic aspects.
Forest Research is the principal organisation in the
United Kingdom involved on forestry and tree-
related research. An agency of the Commission, it
produces scientific research and surveys, both to
inform the development of forestry policies and
practices and to promote high standards of
sustainable forest management. The priorities for
forestry research are agreed at the meetings of the
forestry ministers.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
The Forest Service is an executive agency within
DARD and promotes the interests of forestry
through sustainable management and expansion
of state-owned forests. It encourages private
forestry through grant aid for planting. It manages
over 61,500 hectares of forest land. The Service
offered 423,000 cubic metres of timber for sale in
2003/04, with receipts of £5.4 million, and there
were some 446,000 paying visitors to its forests.
Forestry and timber processing employ about
1,000 people in Northern Ireland.

Manufacturing overview
The manufacturing sector’s share of the UK
economy was 16 per cent (£153 billion) of gross
value added (GVA - see glossary) at current basic
prices in 2003, compared with 21 per cent in 1993.
It accounted for 13 per cent of employment
(3.4 million jobs) in December 2003. The regions
with the highest proportion of employees in
manufacturing were the East Midlands and
West Midlands (at 19 and 18 per cent respectively).
London had the lowest at 6 per cent.
The recession in the early 1990s led to a decline in
manufacturing output. It began to rise between
1993 and 2000, before declining again in 2001 and
2002. Output rose slightly in 2003. Productivity
(measured by output per job) was 29 per cent
higher in 2003 than in 1993.
Manufacturing Strategy
In May 2002 the Government published a
Manufacturing Strategy for the United Kingdom. It
identified seven key issues for Government,
companies and the workforce:
■ macroeconomic stability;
■ investment;
■ science and innovation;
■ best practice;
■ raising skills and education levels;
■ modern infrastructure; and
■ the right market framework.
As part of the Strategy, the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI) established the Manufacturing
Advisory Service (MAS), providing manufacturers
with advice on how to improve productivity. MAS
operates through:
■ ten regional centres of manufacturing
excellence, providing advice to small and
medium enterprises;
■ a national network of centres of expertise in
manufacturing that companies can turn to for
advice. The network consists of accredited
bodies such as trade associations, university
departments and Research Councils (see page
393); and
■ a website, providing access to all parts of MAS
and to other complementary sources of
information and advice.
The second annual report of MAS showed that, in
2003, it delivered a total value added of
£39 million to UK manufacturers, an average of
£104,000 for every company assisted. It also
responded to nearly 11,000 enquiries from firms
seeking advice, visited over 4,400 companies to
carry out an initial diagnostic health check and
completed almost 1,000 in-depth consultancies.
A further report, The Manufacturing Strategy Two
Years On, was published in July 2004 and covers
the progress made and what more needs to be
done, and identifies the priorities that need to be
focused on to achieve a high value, highly skilled
and competitive manufacturing sector.
Manufacturing size and output
The number of manufacturing enterprises fell by
1.5 per cent in 2002 and total turnover was 2.5 per
cent lower than in 2001 (Table 27.1). Over half of
all manufacturing businesses had an annual
turnover of less than £250,000 in 2003 and
employed fewer than five people. In contrast, there
were 1,140 enterprises with turnover of at least
£50 million and 925 employing 500 or more
people.

GVA, output and productivity are shown in Tables
27.2, 27.3 and 27.4. Output of the chemicals and
man-made fibres industry has grown by 36 per
cent since 1993 and output of the transport
equipment industry (which includes aerospace
and defence) by 19 per cent. Electrical and optical
equipment, although 39 per cent higher in 2003
than in 1993, has shown a marked short-term
decline - it fell by 20 per cent between 2000 and
2003. Output of some sectors continued to decline
- leather and leather products, for example, were
44 per cent lower than in 1993 and textiles and
textile products fell by 35 per cent.
An outline of the major manufacturing sectors
follows, in order of their significance to the UK
economy in terms of GVA. Based on 2003 data,
food, drink and tobacco is the largest sector, with
transport equipment (including aerospace and
defence) moving up from fifth to third place
compared with equivalent 2002 data. For each
sector a table shows the number of enterprises and
turnover at current prices for the latest available
three years. These data are collected by the ONS
Annual Business Inquiry (ABI), which in 2002
sampled about 74,000 businesses. Occasionally,
statistics come from sources other than National
Statistics, such as trade associations. Any
variations usually reflect differences in coverage of
the industry concerned.
Food, drink and tobacco
In 2002 there were 7,560 enterprises in the UK
food and drink manufacturing and processing
industry, with a combined turnover of
£76.7 billion (Table 27.5).
The largest concentration of enterprises is in the
production of bread, fresh pastry goods and cakes,
followed by those engaged in the production,
processing and preserving of meat and meat
products. Spirits production gives Scotland the
highest concentration of employment in the
alcoholic and soft drinks manufacturing industry.

The biggest food and drink export category in
2003 was alcoholic beverages, with exports valued
at £2.9 billion, accounting for 33 per cent of the
total value of food and drink sales overseas. The
largest food-exporting sectors, each worth over
£500 million, were dairy products and cheeses,
processing and preserving of fish products, and
cocoa, chocolate and confectionery.
Organic foods are a growing sector of the market.
According to the Soil Association, retail sales
between April 2002 and April 2003 were worth just

over £1 billion, 10 per cent higher than in the
previous year. This makes the United Kingdom the
third biggest outlet for organic food in the world.
Organic baby food accounted for 41 per cent of all
baby food sold.
Bread and morning goods
The bread and morning goods (such as rolls, baps,
scones, teacakes and croissants) market is worth
over £3 billion a year and is one of the largest
sectors in the UK food industry. Total volume is
about 2.9 million tonnes, the equivalent of over
9 million large loaves every day. In 2002, 73 per
cent of bread in the United Kingdom (by value)
was produced by plant bakers, of which British
Bakeries, Allied Bakeries and Warburtons
accounted for 53 per cent. In-store bakeries
(within supermarkets) accounted for around
19 per cent of sales, with high street retail (craft)
bakers producing the remaining 9 per cent. Of
bread sold, 69 per cent is white, 19 per cent is
brown or wholemeal and the remaining 12 per
cent is accounted for by the more than 200
varieties of specialist bread available to the UK
consumer. The UK sandwich market accounts for
around 50 per cent of bread eaten (although most
sandwiches are still made at home) and was worth
£3.3 billion in 2002.
Dairy products
In Great Britain, 83 per cent of household
purchases of milk were bought from retail outlets
in 2003, with the remaining 17 per cent delivered
to the doorstep. This latter proportion has been
declining for some time - in 1998 the figure was
35 per cent. Household consumption of liquid
milk per head in the United Kingdom — 2.15 litres
a week in 2002 - is among the highest in the
world. Semi-skimmed (containing between
1.5 and 1.8 per cent fat) and skimmed milk (not
more than 0.5 per cent fat) consumption
accounted for 70 per cent of total milk sales in
2002.
The UK dairy industry accounted for 69 per cent
of butter and 68 per cent of cheese supplies to the
domestic market in 2002, and achieved significant
sales overseas. Over 400 different types of cheese
are produced in the United Kingdom. Cheddar has
the highest sales but other well-known varieties
include Caerphilly, Cheshire, Double Gloucester,
Stilton and Wensleydale.
Beer
UK consumers spent £3.1 billion on beer in the
retail sector in 2003, 7 per cent more than in 2002;
a further £15.7 billion was spent in restaurants and
hotels. Beer (including lager) production in 2003,
at 58.0 million hectolitres, was 2.4 per cent higher
than in 2002; beer released for home consumption
in the United Kingdom amounted to 60.3 million
hectolitres, 1.5 per cent higher than in 2002
(Table 27.6). Exports were valued at £231 million
in 2003, amounting to 3.5 million hectolitres.
Lager accounted for 48 per cent of all draught beer
sales in 2003, but there is still a strong demand for
traditional cask-conditioned and brewery-
conditioned ales and stouts. The UK brewing
industry has six major national brewery groups,

home-grown barley.
Spirits
Home-produced whisky production in 2003 was
3.9 million hectolitres, an increase of 1 per cent on
2002. The Scotch whisky industry is one of the top
UK export earners, with overseas sales up 4 per
cent in 2003 to nearly £2.4 billion. The United
States remained the largest market by value, with
sales worth £329 million. The industry exports to
200 countries worldwide - the top five overseas
markets are shown in Table 27.7. In September
2003 some 10,000 people worked in the Scotch
whisky industry and a further 30,000 were
employed in Scotland in associated sectors. There
are around 90 malt and grain whisky distilleries
in Scotland, the majority in Speyside and in the
Highlands, with seven on Islay and three in the
Lowlands. Most Scotch consumed is a blend of
malt and grain.
Gin and vodka production are also important
parts of the spirits industry, with 16 distilleries and
compounders in the United Kingdom. Some
70 per cent is now bottled in Scotland. Around
80 per cent of UK-produced gin and 20 per cent
of vodka were exported in 2003, worth over
£250 million - 24 per cent higher than in the
previous year. The largest export market was the
United States, worth £97 million.
Wine, cider and perry
There were 333 commercial vineyards in the
United Kingdom at the end of 2002, covering
812 hectares of land, nearly all in the southern
half of England and Wales. Most of the home
production is white wine, mainly from Germanic
vines. Cider and perry are made predominantly
in the west and south-west of England, notably in
Herefordshire, Somerset and Devon. Bulmers, one
of the two biggest UK producers, is the world’s
largest cider maker.

Welsh whisky
More than 100 years after the end of whisky
production in Wales, a new whisky was launched
in March 2004. Penderyn single malt is made by
the independent Welsh Whisky Company
(Y Cwmni Wisgi Cymreig) producing 75,000
bottles a year at its distillery in the village of
Penderyn in the Brecon Beacons.
The Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association estimates
that UK spending on legitimate tobacco products
in 2003 was £12.3 billion, of which £9.8 bilion was
paid in tax (£8.0 billion in excise duty and
£1.8 billion in VAT). Sales in recent years have
been affected by the growth of smuggling.
Government estimates of revenue lost through
tobacco smuggling in 2002/03 were £3.0 billion,
compared with £3.2 billion in 2001/02; revenue
lost through cross-border shopping amounted to
£1.4 billion in 2002/03.
The industry’s export sales were £901 million in
2003 - with Europe, the Middle East and Africa
important markets. The UK tobacco industry
remains one of the top ten balance of payments
earners in the UK economy. In 2003 around
6,700 people were directly employed in tobacco
manufacturing, with a further 81,000 jobs

Paper, printing and publishing
In 2002 the UK pulp, paper and paper products
industry had a turnover of £11.5 billion and the
publishing and printing industry a turnover of
£33.9 billion. Total industry output fell by 1.5 per
cent in 2003, although it was 3.5 per cent higher
than in 1993. Exports in 2003 were £5.1 billion -
the largest contributors were paper and
paperboard (27 per cent), publishing of books
(25 per cent), and publishing of journals and
periodicals (10 per cent).

Paper
The paper and board sector is dominated by a
small number of medium and large firms. In 2003
there were 80 pulp, paper and board mills in the
United Kingdom, employing around 15,800 people
and concentrated in north Kent, Lancashire, the
West Country and central Scotland. These mills
produce hundreds of different grades of paper and
board, which are converted into a wide range of
products for use in industry, commerce,
education, communications, distribution and in
the home. They also produce a host of speciality
papers for industrial use, for example material that
is subsequently coated, sensitised or laminated.
UK papermaking production in 2003 was
6.2 million tonnes, about the same as in 2002, and
15.3 per cent higher than in 1993. Exports in 2003
grew to 1.3 million tonnes, 5.4 per cent more than
in 2002 and 19 per cent higher than in 1993.
Exports to the European Union (EU) rose for the
first time since 1999 by 4.9 per cent to 0.9 million
tonnes. There has been a trend towards producing
waste-based packaging grades. Recycled paper
(including imports) made up 68.6 per cent of the
raw material for UK newspapers in 2003, up from
65.1 per cent in 2002 and 63.5 per cent in 2001.
Printing and publishing
Unlike the paper and board sector, the UK
printing and publishing industry has many small
businesses - only 3.4 per cent of enterprises
employed 50 or more people and over 91 per cent
employed fewer than 20 people in 2003. Many
publishing and printing firms are based in south¬
east England. Mergers have led to the formation of
large groups in newspaper, magazine and book
publishing. The main export categories for the
printing and publishing industry are shown in
Table 27.10.
The UK book-publishing industry is a major
exporter, with exports of £1.3 billion in 2003,
6 per cent higher than in 2002 (Table 27.11). The
United States remained the largest export market,
with just over one-sixth of the total; the Republic
of Ireland was again in second place.
The UK printing industry had a turnover of
£14.2 billion and employed an average of
191,000 people in 2002. It continued to take
advantage of technological changes. The use of
digital technology has improved both automation
and personalisation. Direct exports were worth
£501 million in 2003.

Half a million Minis
The 500,000th new-style Mini rolled off the
production line at BMW's Oxford plant in August
2004. The original Mini first went on sale in 1959
and more than five million were sold up to
October 2000 when Rover, then owned by BMW,
ceased production at Longbridge in Birmingham.
BMW revived the marque in 2001, and the plant
now produces 174,000 cars a year.
v   
Motor vehicles
UK car production in 2003, at 1.66 million, was
2 per cent higher than in 2002, and 21 per cent
higher than in 1993. Traditional home markets no
longer dominate production - exports accounted
for 69 per cent of production in 2003 compared
with 39 per cent a decade earlier. There were
1.14 million passenger cars produced for export in
2003, 9 per cent more than in 2002, with
significant growth at BMW MINI, Honda, Nissan
and Peugeot. Commercial vehicle production in
2003 fell by 1 per cent to 189,000; 54 per cent, or
103,000 units, were for export. The sector is
dominated by light commercial vehicles (mainly
vans and minibuses). In total, UK motor vehicle
exports were worth £14.6 billion in 2003, 7 per
cent more than in 2002.
In 2003 about 243,000 people were employed in
vehicle and component production and
manufacturing activities in the United Kingdom.
This was around 3,000 fewer than in 2002, a trend
similar to UK manufacturing as a whole, and
driven mainly by improvements in manufacturing
efficiency.
The United Kingdom is an important location for
car and commercial vehicle manufacture (Table
27.13). In addition to the independent MG Rover,
there are eight other global car manufacturers in
the United Kingdom: Nissan, Toyota, Peugeot,
Honda, BMW (MINI and Rolls-Royce), Ford PAG
(Aston Martin, Land Rover and Jaguar Daimler),
General Motors (Vauxhall) and Volkswagen
(Bentley). Nissan’s Sunderland plant is the most
productive in Europe in terms of vehicles
produced per employee, with Honda and Toyota
also in the top ten. Nissan is also the largest UK
producer at present, with 332,000 cars made in
2003.
A range of smaller producers, such as Morgan,
Noble, Bristol and TVR, target specialist markets
such as sports and luxury cars. London Taxis
International produces the famous London ‘black
cab’ in Coventry. About 3,000 taxis were produced
there in 2003, one-sixth of them for export.
The main UK truck manufacturer is Leyland
Trucks, based in Lancashire. Medium-sized vans
are manufactured by LDV at Birmingham, Ford
at Southampton and by the General
Motors/Renault/Nissan joint venture at the IBC

the leading bus manufacturer. Accessibility is an
important issue and the company is one of the
world leaders in the design of low-floor chassis
and variable height suspension.
Engine production is increasing in the United
Kingdom and is currently estimated at a little
below 3 million units a year. Ford is producing
diesel engines at Dagenham and petrol engines
at Bridgend, and BMW’s new Hams Hall (West
Midlands) plant is producing engines for several
BMW models including the new BMW 1 series.
The other principal UK engine makers are Honda,
MG Rover, Nissan and Toyota.
Shipbuilding and marine engineering
In 2002, there were about 760 enterprises
employing 25,000 people in the UK shipbuilding
and ship repair industry, with a turnover of
£1.9 billion. Exports in 2003 were worth
£268 million. Strong competition from Eastern
Europe and the Far East has made commercial
shipbuilding a highly challenging market for
European shipyards operating in the commercial
sector. The United Kingdom also has large naval
yards in Portsmouth, Plymouth and on the Clyde.
There were around 770 enterprises in the UK boat
building (pleasure and sporting boats) industry in
2002, with turnover of £662 million. Exports in
2003 were worth £455 million. The industry covers
both sail and motor vessels. These range from
small day boats to super yachts (private ocean¬
going leisure craft over 24 metres in length).
This sector is becoming increasingly important
to the marine industry, as it is an expanding,
high value added market.
The UK marine leisure industry is a distinct group
of about 3,210 firms and 1,450 sole traders,
providing specialised products and services to
marine leisure users around the world. According
to the British Marine Federation, the export
market grew by 10 per cent in 2003 to £794
million, the EU and North America accounting for
72 per cent of the total. Boat exports were worth
£498 million. Just over 30,000 people were
employed in the industry in 2003, 5 per cent more
than in 2002. About 30 per cent were involved in
boat building and a further 16 per cent in
equipment manufacture.
The UK marine equipment industry is diverse,
ranging from propulsion and navigation

equipment to generators and safety equipment. It
provides equipment for commercial vessels, naval
ships and leisure boats. Faced with a diminishing
home market, this sector has been successful in
targeting the Korean, Japanese and Chinese
markets.
Railway equipment
A number of UK enterprises are engaged in
manufacturing railway equipment for both
domestic and overseas markets, mainly producing
specialist components and systems for use in
rolling stock, signalling, track and infrastructure
applications. Employment in the industry
averaged 14,000 in 2002, with a turnover of
£1.8 billion, over £400 million higher than in
2001. In 2003, exports were worth £151 million.
About 4,000 firms are involved in the supply
chains, and UK expertise extends to technical
consultancy and project management.
The largest company in this sector is the
Canadian-owned Bombardier Transportation,
which assembles and maintains UK passenger
rolling stock. Most new trains now being
introduced in the United Kingdom have a
number of foreign-made components, and UK
input varies from 5 to 75 per cent of total value.
Privatised train operating companies have placed
orders for around 5,000 new passenger carriages
since 1997, while many older trains have been
refurbished. An extensive programme of
infrastructure modernisation is also being
undertaken.
Aerospace and defence
The UK aerospace industry is one of the few in
the world with a complete capability across
the whole spectrum of aerospace products and
technology. Exports grew by 8 per cent to
£12.5 billion in 2003.

with £12.1 billion in 2002, and an order book
of £46.0 billion.
Engines
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s leading
manufacturers of power systems. Rolls-Royce
engines power over 30 civil aircraft types. It is also
responsible for 11,000 helicopter engines in
commercial service. Its group turnover in 2003
was £5.6 billion, including £2.7 billion in civil
aerospace and £1.4 billion in defence aerospace,
and it had an order book worth £18.7 billion.
In civil aerospace, it delivered 746 engines to
48 airlines and 68 corporate customers in 2003.
In defence aerospace, Rolls-Royce has the world’s
largest military engine customer base, serving over
160 armed forces worldwide, with 24,000 engines
in current military service.
Civil aircraft
Airbus is jointly owned by the European
Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS)
and BAE Systems (with 80 and 20 per cent stakes,
respectively). Airbus UK designs and manufactures
the wings for the whole range of Airbus airliners
at its two sites in Filton (Bristol) and Broughton
(Chester). By the end of June 2004, 5,000 Airbus
aircraft had been ordered and over 3,000 were in
service with more than 200 operators worldwide.
Airbus is now engaged in the design and
manufacture of the wings for the new A380 ‘super
jumbo’ - the world’s first twin-deck, four-aisle
airliner, with capacity for 555 passengers - which
is due to enter service in 2006.

UK 2005
Bombardier Aerospace of Canada, the third largest
civil aircraft manufacturer in the world, produces
a wide range of turboprop and regional jet aircraft
and business jets. At its Belfast site, Bombardier
Aerospace Northern Ireland designs and
manufactures major civil aircraft sub-assemblies,
advanced engine nacelles and flight controls, as
well as providing aviation support services.
Military aircraft and missiles
BAE Systems, along with EADS and Alenia of Italy,
has developed the Eurofighter Typhoon, a multi¬
role aircraft for the RAF and for the German,
Italian and Spanish air forces. Of 620 aircraft
presently on order, 232 will be built in the United
Kingdom. The company is also a partner with
Lockheed Martin of the United States in the F-35
Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft. Three variants
are being developed, with requirements for around
3,000 aircraft. The RAF and Royal Navy will use
a short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVE)
version. The first JSF is expected to be operational
in 2010. BAE Systems also developed the Harrier
jump-jet, latterly as part of the US-UK AV-8B
programme, and the European joint venture
Tornado combat aircraft. The Hawk fast-jet trainer
remains in production with new versions planned
for RAF service and export.
Europe’s main guided weapons business, MBDA,
is jointly owned by BAE Systems (37.5 per cent),
EADS and Italy’s Finmeccanica. The French-
owned Thales, including Thales Air Defence in
Belfast, is another major company operating in
the UK guided weapons sector.
Helicopters
AgustaWestland, currently jointly owned by GKN
and Finmeccanica, produces the multi-role
EH 101 medium-lift helicopter for civilian and
military markets. There are two UK variants for
the Royal Navy and for the RAF. It also
manufactures the Super Lynx 300 light battlefield
and naval helicopter, and has produced under
licence from Boeing the Apache AH Mkl attack
helicopter for the UK Armed Forces. It has a joint
venture with Bell in the United States to produce
the Bell Agusta AB139 helicopter.
Space equipment and services
The UK space industry includes companies that
provide space technology (the upstream sector)
and those exploiting this technology (the
downstream sector). The upstream sector
employed 5,900 people and generated turnover
of £501 million in 2002/03, 2 per cent less in real
terms than in 2001/02; space prime business
accounted for 49 per cent of the total. UK
participation in the European Space Agency, and
the British National Space Centre’s (BNSC) role in
coordinating UK space policy (see page 392), has
enabled UK-based companies to participate in
many leading space projects. The industry’s
strengths are in the development and manufacture
of civil and military communications satellite
systems, small satellites, radar and antennae, and
software. In the field of Earth observation, BNSC
has played a major role in programmes which have
led to the development of platforms, space radar
and meteorological satellite hardware, and in the
exploitation of space data imaging products.
EADS Astrium is Europe’s leading space company.
Its satellite business activities cover civil and
military communications and Earth observation,
science and navigation programmes, avionics and
equipment. In the United Kingdom it operates
from two sites in Portsmouth, Hampshire and
Stevenage, Hertfordshire, together employing over
2,000 people.
Electrical and optical equipment
In 2002, 29 per cent of turnover in this industry
was in the radio, TV and communications
equipment sector; 26 per cent in electrical
machinery; 23 per cent in medical, precision and
optical equipment and watches; and 22 per cent in
office machinery and computers.
Total output rose sharply up to 2000, but then fell
20 per cent by 2003. It remained 39 per cent
higher than in 1993. Between 1993 and 2003,
production of office machinery and computers
nearly trebled, while radio, TV and
communications equipment output, which peaked
in 2000, was up by 52 per cent. However,
production of medical and optical instruments
was only 1 per cent higher than in 1993, while that
of electrical machinery and apparatus fell by
13 per cent over the same period.
Total exports fell by 18 per cent in 2003 to
£36.6 billion. Computers and process equipment
accounted for £8.9 billion, TV and radio
transmitters £6.5 billion, measuring instruments
£4.5 billion, and electronic components
£4.1 billion.

A substantial proportion of employment in these
sectors (especially sales and administrative jobs)
is based in southern England, with Scotland and
Wales important areas for inward investors.
In 2002, electrical and instrument engineering
accounted for Scottish exports worth £6.7 billion,
39 per cent less than in 2001, but worth 46 per
cent of Scotland’s total manufactured exports.
Many leading overseas-based multinational
electronics firms have substantial manufacturing
investment in the United Kingdom. The main
electronic consumer goods produced are television
sets - 1.6 million were manufactured in 2003. UK
production is concentrated in the high-value
market, increasingly in widescreen and digital sets.
The UK computer industry produces an extensive
range of systems for all uses - 10 million personal
computers were produced in 2003. Many
multinational computer manufacturers operate in
the United Kingdom, though between 2000 and
2003 production of computers declined by about
32 per cent. In 2002 there were 1,630 enterprises
involved in the manufacture of computers and
other information processing equipment, with
turnover of £10.8 billion, although this was down
18 per cent on the previous year.
Both UK and foreign companies produce a range
of other electrical machinery and apparatus in the
United Kingdom. These include electric motors,
generators and transformers; electricity
distribution and control apparatus; insulated wire
and cables (including optical fibre cables for
telecommunications); and lighting equipment.
There were nearly 5,500 enterprises in this sector
in 2002, with turnover of £13.9 billion.
Communications equipment
Domestic telecommunications equipment
manufacturers have invested heavily in facilities to
meet rapidly increasing demand for
telecommunications services (see chapter 17). The
main products are switching and transmission
equipment, telephones and terminals.
Transmission equipment and cables for
telecommunications and information networks
include submarine and high-specification
data-carrying cables, such as fibre optics.
Another sector of the industry manufactures radio
communications equipment, radar, radio and
sonar navigational aids for ships and aircraft,
thermal imaging systems, alarms and signalling
apparatus, public broadcasting equipment and
other capital goods.
Medical electronics
The high demand for advanced medical
equipment in the United Kingdom stems from its
comprehensive healthcare system and extensive
clinical research and testing facilities in the
chemical, biological, physical and molecular
sciences. UK scientists and engineers have made
important contributions to basic research and
development (R&D) in endoscopy, computerised
tomography scanning, magnetic resonance
imaging (pioneered in the United Kingdom),
ultrasonic imaging, coronary artery diagnosis and
renal analysis. Total exports in this sector were
£2.0 billion in 2003. Turnover amounted to
£3.0 billion and the sector employed an average
of 34,000 people in 2002.
Instrumentation and control
The UK instrumentation and control sector is
diverse, with around 3,350 enterprises, employing
77,000 people in 2002 and with turnover of
£8.1 billion. The sector covers the design,
development and manufacture of scientific and
industrial equipment and systems for analysis,
measurement, testing and control.
Chemicals and chemical products
The chemicals industry is one of the primary UK
manufacturing sectors and accounted for 10 per
cent of manufacturing industry GVA in 2003.
Around 37 per cent of turnover in 2002 was in the
manufacture of basic chemicals, with a further
32 per cent in pharmaceutical products. Soap and
detergents, cleaning and polishing preparations,
and perfumes and toilet preparations accounted
for 11 per cent of industry turnover.

27 Manufacturing and construction
UK 2005
The sector underpins the UK manufacturing
industry, with chemicals being essential supplies
for most other industrial processes. Although
output only grew by 1 per cent in 2003, it was still
36 per cent higher than in 1993. The industry is a
leading UK exporter, and had a trade surplus in
2003 of £5.6 billion. Exports totalled £31.3 billion,
of which 40 per cent were pharmaceuticals and
31 per cent basic chemicals.

The UK chemicals industry is diverse, with
important representation in all principal chemical
sectors - ranging from bulk petrochemicals to
low-volume, high-value specialised organics. It
includes key industrial materials, such as plastics
and synthetic rubber (both in primary forms), and
other products such as man-made fibres, soap and
detergents, cosmetics, adhesives, dyes and inks,
and intermediate products for the pharmaceutical
and a range of other downstream industries.
Bulk chemicals
North Sea oil and gas provide accessible feedstock
for the large UK organics sector, including
products such as ethylene, propylene, benzene and
paraxylene. These provide the building blocks for
the manufacture of many chemical products,
including plastics that are strong, durable and
lightweight, and are increasingly used in transport
and packaging applications; and synthetic fibres
such as nylon and polyester used in textiles,
clothing and home furnishings.
There is substantial inorganics production,
including sulphuric acid, chlorine and caustic
soda, based on minerals such as salt, sulphur, and
phosphate ores, or on reaction between gases.
These also serve many other chemical processes.
Formulated products
The United Kingdom produces many formulated
consumer products, such as decorative paint,
home laundry and cleaning products, and
personal care items like toothpaste, shampoos
and skincare products, as well as a wide range of
industrial speciality products, such as adhesives,
inks and lubricants.
Fine chemicals
Fine chemicals meet specific needs through highly
sophisticated product and process development.
Active ingredients for the pharmaceuticals and
agrochemical sectors are at the forefront of this
kind of innovation. In recent years, the application
of chirality1 in synthesis has allowed firms to make
drugs and agrochemicals more closely tailored
to specific targets. Leading-edge research by
international pharmaceutical and agrochemical
companies in the United Kingdom is supported
both by a strong academic research capability and
a network of specialist manufacturers of‘fine’
chemicals. The latter specialise in the highly skilled
processes needed to produce commercial
quantities of the complex molecules identified by
the pharmaceutical and agrochemical companies’
research.
Pharmaceuticals
The UK pharmaceuticals industry had record
exports worth £12.4 billion and a trade surplus of
£3.2 billion in 2003, making it the world’s fourth
largest pharmaceuticals sector earner by trade
surplus. It is largely based in the South East, East
(Hertfordshire/Essex), North West and North East
of England. Research-driven, it is one of the most
dynamic UK industries, and is of key importance
to the economy. Principal overseas markets are
Western Europe, North America and Japan.
Recently, the largest growth has been in medicines
acting on the cardiovascular system, followed by
central nervous system and alimentary tract
remedies. The UK pharmaceuticals sector had an
estimated total UK market value of £13.2 billion in
2003, of which prescription medicines accounted
for 85 per cent.
There are 365 pharmaceutical companies
operating in the United Kingdom, with indigenous

(United States) was the leading company in 2003,
with an 11.4 per cent market share. UK-based
GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca (Anglo-
Swedish) were in second and third place,
accounting for 9.7 and 5.1 per cent respectively
of market sales.
About 83,000 people were employed in the UK
pharmaceuticals industry in December 2002 with
a further 250,000 jobs in downstream/related
sectors. The industry’s investment in UK-based
R&D exceeded £3.5 billion in 2003, nearly a
quarter of all UK industrial R&D. AstraZeneca and
GlaxoSmithKline are the top two UK-based
companies in terms of R&D expenditure.
Of the world’s top 100 medicines, 25 were
discovered and developed in the United Kingdom.
Among more than 20 new medicines launched in
the United Kingdom in 2003 were treatments for
HIV, pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, heart
disease, diabetes, prostate hyperplasia, hormone
deficiency, asthma, eczema, osteoporosis, Crohn’s
disease, medicines used in bone marrow
transplantation and for surgical pain, and the first

Biotechnology
Biotechnology is the application of knowledge
about living organisms, and their components, to
industrial products and processes. The United
Kingdom has companies developing and exploiting
biotechnology in all areas: from pharmaceuticals
and diagnostics, through speciality chemicals, food
and agriculture, to the environment.
In 2002 the United Kingdom had over 480
specialist biotechnology companies, estimated to
employ almost 26,000 people. A further 1,100
companies were involved in broader
bioscience/healthcare related activities. Companies
are clustered particularly around Cambridge,
Oxford and London, as well as in parts of the
South East, the North West and Scotland. Research
laboratories of many leading pharmaceutical
multinationals are based in the United Kingdom.
The industry benefits from the strong science base
in UK universities and the large number of leading
research institutes in the United Kingdom (see
chapter 25). UK companies account for 40 per
cent of products in clinical trials by European
public companies. In addition, 41 per cent of new
biotechnology drugs in late stage clinical trials in
Europe are from the United Kingdom.
Basic metals and fabricated
metal products
Steel
The Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom
(c.1760s-1830s) was largely based on the
manufacture of iron and steel and heavy
machinery. These sectors remain important,
accounting for 10 per cent of manufacturing GVA
in 2002, but are declining, with the exception of
products for the construction industry. Output of
basic metals and fabricated metal products fell by
2.5 per cent in 2003, but exports increased by
8 per cent to £11.1 billion.

Steel production is concentrated in south Wales
and northern England, with substantial processing
in the Midlands and Yorkshire. Major
restructuring in the steel industry has taken place
since the 1980s, including the closure of
steelmaking at the Corns Llanwern site in south
Wales in 2001 and Corus investment plans leading
to the rationalisation of engineering steels
production (Rotherham and Sheffield) and of east
coast facilities (Teesside and Scunthorpe). The
former ASW’s plants in Cardiff and Sheerness,
Kent, which closed in 2002, resumed production
under new ownership in 2003. Similarly,
Alphasteel in Newport re-started steelmaking late
in 2002 and, following a change in ownership, has
embarked on a major expansion plan.
UK crude steel production increased by 13 per
cent to 13.3 million tonnes in 2003, reversing five
consecutive years of decline. Production was
boosted by the resumption of normal working at
Port Talbot, south Wales, following a major
accident at the Corus plant in 2002. The UK steel
industry exported 6.2 million tonnes in 2003, 10
per cent more than in 2002. Most export gains
took place in markets outside the EU, principally
China and the Middle East. The EU market share
of exports fell from 75 per cent in 2002 to 60 per
cent in 2003.
Corus is Europe’s second largest steelmaker and
the seventh biggest in the world. It employed
24,600 people in the United Kingdom at the end
of December 2003, almost 50 per cent of its total
employees, and produced 89 per cent of total UK
crude steel in 2003. It produces carbon steel by the
basic oxygen steelmaking method at its plants in
Port Talbot, Teesside and Scunthorpe and
engineering steels by the electric arc furnace
method at its Rotherham and Stocksbridge
(Sheffield) plants. It also manufactures a wide
range of other products at sites across Great
Britain.
Products manufactured by other UK steel
companies include reinforcing bars for the
construction industry, wire rods, hot rolled bars,
bright bars, tubes, and wire and wire products.
Production of special steels is centred on the
Sheffield area and includes stainless and alloy
special steels for the aerospace and offshore oil and
gas industries.
Steel has had a notable success in the UK
construction industry, with its market share in
building frames of two or more storeys increasing
from 30 per cent in the early 1980s to more than
69 per cent in 2003. It has 95 per cent of the
single-storey market. The market mix is changing,
with a fall in the construction of London multi¬
storey offices and a national increase in hospitals,
schools, shops and high-rise residential
accommodation. Total iron and steel sales to the
construction sector were £2.7 billion in 2003.
Consumption of constructional steelwork was
over 1.2 million tonnes with an additional
2.2 million tonnes of other steel used by the
construction sector.
Steel is a fully recyclable product and may be
recycled any number of times without loss of
quality. The UK steel recycling industry reclaimed
10.3 million tonnes of steel scrap in 2003,
3.1 million tonnes of which were sold to UK
steelmakers and foundries and 7.2 million tonnes
exported to steelmakers overseas. In a typical year
in the United Kingdom, the steel industry saves
enough energy through recycling to provide
electricity for several million households.
Non-ferrous and fabricated metals
Non-ferrous metals in the United Kingdom are
produced from both primary and recycled raw
materials. They are extremely recyclable without
loss of quality and have always made significant
contributions to sustainability. Including precious
metals, exports totalled £3.1 billion in 2003, about
the same as in 2002.
The aluminium sector supplies the packaging,
transport, building and construction, and general
and electrical industries. It had a turnover of
£2.1 billion in 2002, with exports in 2003 worth
£1.0 billion. In 2003, 750,000 tonnes of aluminium
were recycled, two-thirds back into wrought
products and one-third into cast products.
Precious metals had a turnover of £532 million in
2002, and exports worth £930 million in 2003.
434
UK 2005
27 Manufacturing and construction
Copper and copper alloys are used for electrical
wire and cables, power generation and electrical
and electronic connectors, automotive
components, plumbing and building products,
and components for industrial plant and
machinery. In 2002 this sector had a turnover of
£704 million, with exports worth £502 million in
2003. About 50 per cent of the raw material feed to
the semi-finished sector is sourced from the
recycling of secondary material, both process scrap
and life-expired components.
Lead is used for lead acid batteries and roofing,
and zinc used for galvanising to protect steel.
Including tin production, this sector had a
turnover of £446 million in 2002, with exports
worth £104 million in 2003.
Nickel is used principally as an alloying element to
make stainless steel and high-temperature turbine
alloys, and titanium is used for high-strength, low-
weight aerospace applications. In 2002 turnover in
this sector was £636 million and exports were
valued at £596 million in 2003.
Fabricated metal products include those made by
forging, casting, pressing, stamping and roll
forming of a wide variety of metals. Many of these
products are subjected to surface engineering
processes, which improve their working
performance. These include electroplating,
galvanising, anodising and heat treatment. In 2002
turnover in this sector was £25.7 billion (67 per
cent of the basic metals and fabricated metal
products total), with structural metal products
having the largest individual share at £7.0 billion.
Construction
The UK construction industry accounted for 6 per
cent of GVA in 2003. Output has recovered from
the recession that affected the industry in the early
1990s, and was 9 per cent higher in 2003 than in
the previous peak in 1990. The growth in output
in 2003 was 4.9 per cent. The number of
workforce jobs in the industry grew between
December 2002 and 2003 by 6 per cent to
2,088,000, 14 per cent higher than in 1993.

also grew by 4 per cent in 2003, with new work
increasing by 3 per cent and repair and
maintenance by 7 per cent. The main areas of
activity within the UK construction industry
covered by these statistics are:
■ building and civil engineering - ranging from
major private sector companies with diverse
international interests to one-person
enterprises carrying out domestic repairs; and
■ specialist work - companies or individuals
undertaking construction work ranging from
structural steelwork and pre-cast concrete
structures to mechanical and electrical
services (including the design and installation
of environmentally friendly building control
systems).
Other areas of construction work not covered in
the above statistics include:
■ the supply of building materials and
components (Table 27.21 has production
details) - ranging from large quarrying
companies, and those engaged in mass
production of manufactured items, to small,
highly specialised manufacturers; and
■ consultancy work — companies or individuals
engaged in the planning, design and
supervision of construction projects.
Estimated earnings by engineering
consultants on projects in the United
Kingdom in 2003 were £3.7 billion.
This figure accounts for 30 per cent of all
income earned by UK professional services

Overseas contracting and consultancy
UK companies operate internationally and in any
one year UK consultants work in almost every
country in the world.
UK contractors have pioneered management
contracting and design and build, and also the
financing mechanisms developed in the domestic
market through innovations such as the Private
Finance Initiative (see page 370). They won new
international business in 2002 worth £4.3 billion,
9 per cent less than in 2001. Contractors were
particularly successful in North America, the most
valuable market, which accounted for 48 per cent
of all new contracts.
The main categories of work in which UK
consultants are involved include structural
commercial (roads, bridges, tunnels and railways);
electrical and mechanical services; chemical, oil
and gas plants; and water supply.

The energy industries in the United Kingdom play
a central role in the economy by producing,
transforming and supplying energy in its various
forms to all sectors.
In 2003, they accounted for 3.3 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP, see glossary). They are
also major contributors to the UK balance of
payments through the export of crude oil and oil
products; in 2003, the United Kingdom’s trade
surplus in fuels was £5.4 billion.

Production and resources
Production of primary fuels (Figure 28.1) was
4.6 per cent lower in 2003 than in 2002, at
260.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent (including
electricity generated from renewables and waste
sources). Petroleum production was 116.3 million
tonnes of oil equivalent, down by 8.5 per cent,
while production of gas (including gaseous
renewables) was 102.9 million tonnes of oil
equivalent, 0.7 per cent lower than in 2002.
Although ten new fields started production in
2003 (see page 443), the 2 per cent they
contributed to total production was insufficient
to make up the decline in production from older
established fields. Stocks of crude oil and
petroleum products were 3 per cent higher at the
end of 2003 than a year earlier.
Coal production continued its long-term
downward trend, with a fall of 6.0 per cent in
2003. Despite this, coal still supplies a significant
proportion of the country’s primary energy needs:
34.6 per cent of the electricity supplied in 2003
was from coal compared with 32.0 per cent in
2002. Gas remains a major fuel for generating
electricity, accounting for 38.1 per cent of supply
in 2003 - a fall of 2.1 percentage points from 2002.
Nuclear energy supplied 21.5 per cent of electricity
in 2003, a fall of 0.4 percentage points from 2002.
The United Kingdom had a trade surplus in fuels
of 21.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2003. In
volume terms, imports of fuel in 2003 were 7.0 per
cent higher than in 2002, while exports were 9.6
per cent lower. The United Kingdom became a net
importer of gas in the fourth quarter of 2003 as its
reserves started to deplete. However, it remains a
438
UK 2005
28 Energy and natural resources
net exporter of oil and oil products despite
declining production. Most UK production
of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) is
exported, primarily because the product is
generally lighter and more valuable than that
produced in other areas of the world.
The United Kingdom has an obligation under EU
law to maintain stocks of key oil products at or
above a certain level, to ensure adequate supplies
would exist for any international oil supply
emergency. These obligations are based on the UK
annual consumption of the key products such as
motor spirit (petrol), diesel-engined road vehicle
(DERV) fuel and other gas diesel oils, aviation fuel
and other kerosenes, and fuel oils. These
obligations are updated every July as consumption
data for the previous year are finalised. The UK
obligation, based on 2002 consumption data, is to
hold a total of 11 million tonnes of these products,
equal to 67.5 days of consumption. At the end of
2003 the United Kingdom held stocks equal to
78.8 days of consumption.

consumption in the service sector fell by 2.1 per
cent. There has been a rise in household energy
use per person since 1970 from 0.66 to 0.81 tonnes
of oil equivalent per person in 2003.
Total UK primary energy consumption rose by
0.9 per cent in 2003, to 232.7 million tonnes of oil
equivalent (based on primary fuel input, Table
28.2). On a temperature-corrected basis, which
shows what annual intake might have been if the
average temperature during the year had been the
same as the average for 1971-2000, consumption
rose by 0.1 per cent. Also on a temperature-
corrected basis, consumption of coal increased by
8 per cent in 2003, while consumption of oil and
gas fell by 0.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent
respectively.
Final energy consumption, that is, consumption
by the final user rather than that which is used for
transformation into other energy, shows a strong
seasonal pattern with more energy being
consumed in the winter months and less in the
summer, particularly in the domestic and service
sectors. Final consumption by sector is shown in
Figure 28.3. Each day, the domestic sector uses
1,060 Gigawatts (GWh) of gas and 317 GWh of
electricity, while industry uses 470 GWh of gas
and 310 GWh of electricity.
In 2003, energy consumption in the industry,
transport and domestic sectors rose by 0.6 per
cent, 1.2 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively, but
Transport energy use
Transport has been the biggest energy user in the
United Kingdom for the past 17 years, accounting
for 35 per cent of final energy use in 2003. Overall

energy consumption in the transport sector almost
doubled between 1970 and 2003, with most of the
increase taking place during the 1980s. Fuel
consumption in the air transport sector nearly
trebled (Figure 28.4).
Fuel use by road passenger vehicles has increased
by 77 per cent since 1970; the distance travelled
by passengers has increased by 89 per cent, while
energy consumption per passenger-kilometre fell
slightly (Figure 28.5).

Energy policy
The 2003 White Paper, Our energy future -
creating a low carbon economy, identified three
major challenges confronting the UK energy
system: climate change; a declining indigenous
energy supply; and keeping the UK energy
infrastructure up to date with changing
technologies and needs. To address these
challenges, the Government’s policy has four goals:
■ to cut UK emissions of carbon dioxide (C02)
by about 60 per cent between 1990 and 2050;
■ to maintain the reliability of energy supplies;
■ to promote competitive markets in the United
Kingdom and beyond, helping to raise the
rate of sustainable economic growth and
improve productivity; and

distance travelled by road passengers,

Index (1970=100)

Transport
■ to ensure that every home is adequately and
affordably heated.
The Sustainable Energy Act 2003 imposes various
duties on the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry, the National Assembly for Wales, Ofgem
(the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets - see
page 450) and local authorities in order to help
achieve these four goals.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and
the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Defra) published Creating a low carbon
economy -first annual report on implementation of
the Energy White Paper in April 2004. This
describes the progress made in meeting the White
Paper’s four goals; 56 out of 112 milestones set as
a first step towards achieving the White Paper’s
long-term commitments had been completed by
the end of March 2004 (each milestone has its own
target date - the latest is December 2010).
The Government believes that energy efficiency
is likely to be the cheapest and safest way of
addressing all four goals, and that renewable
energy will play an important part in reducing
carbon emissions, while also strengthening energy
security and improving industrial competitiveness.
In December 2003, it announced plans to increase
the level of the Renewables Obligation (see page
440
UK 2005
28 Energy and natural resources
452) in stages from 10.4 per cent in 2010/11 to
15.4 per cent in 2015/16.
The Energy Act 2004 contains provisions designed
to exploit the United Kingdom’s renewable energy
potential (see pages 453-54), together with
measures relating to the integrity and security of
the electricity and gas supply. New planning
policies aimed at encouraging the development of
renewable energy in England were published by
the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)
in August 2004. Recognising that additional ways
of reducing C02 emissions will be needed to meet
its 2050 target, the Government is also drawing up
a Carbon Abatement Technologies (CAT) Strategy.
The Sustainable Energy Policy Network (SEPN)
is taking forward the implementation of the
White Paper. SEPN members are drawn from
government departments, the devolved
administrations, regulators and other key
organisations. SEPN groups meet at all levels of
government, including an ad hoc ministerial
committee and a management board attended by
senior civil servants from key departments.
The Government has sought views on the most
appropriate indicators with which to monitor
progress annually. UK energy sector indicators
2004, published in April 2004, presents four key
 ; 
Hydrogen buses in London
In January 2004, three hydrogen fuel cell buses
were introduced as part of a two-year EU project
to reduce air pollution and noise. CUTE (Clean
Urban Transport for Europe) involves nine other
European cities and is the largest project of its
type in the world. The London trial is a joint
venture between London Buses, DaimlerChrysler,
BP, First (the United Kingdom's largest surface
transport company), the Energy Saving Trust (see
page 454) and the Department for Transport.
The single-decker buses, which cost £750,000
each and can travel 200 kilometres before they
need refuelling, are the first buses in the United
Kingdom to run with no harmful emissions. They
run off hydrogen gas contained in six cylinders on
their roofs; the fuel cell turns the gas into
electrical power and the only emission is water.
v   
indicators (greenhouse gas and C02 emissions,
reliability, competitiveness, and fuel poverty),
27 supporting indicators, and a range of
background energy indicators.
Climate change levy
The climate change levy (CCL) was introduced in
April 2001 as an environmental tax on the use of
energy by business and the public sector. Its
purpose is to encourage the efficient use of energy,
in order to help meet UK targets for cutting
emissions of greenhouse gases.
The revenue raised by the levy is recycled back to
business, primarily through a 0.3 percentage point
reduction in employers’ National Insurance
contributions. Revenue from the levy also provides
support for investment in energy efficiency
measures by businesses through 100 per cent
enhanced capital allowances (EGAs), and support
for the Carbon Trust (see page 454), which
provides energy efficiency advice for business and
supports the development of low carbon
technologies. The levy and package of associated
measures form part of the Government’s strategy
for moving the burden of tax from ‘beneficial’
activity, such as employment, to ‘detrimental’
activity, such as pollution. The levy package is
expected to reduce emissions by the equivalent of
at least 5 million tonnes of carbon by 2010.
Between the introduction of CCL and June 2004,
44 eligible energy-intensive sectors of industry
have entered into Climate Change Agreements
(CCAs) to improve their energy efficiency and
reduce carbon emissions, in return for an 80 per
cent discount from the levy. The 88 per cent of
industrial sites certified by Defra as having met
their 2003 milestone targets can continue to
benefit from the levy discount between April 2003
and March 2005. Eligibility for a CCA is currently
limited to those sectors whose processes are
controlled by the Prevention Pollution Control
Regulations 2000, but the Government is planning
to extend the eligibility criteria for CCAs to sectors
that meet a specific energy-intensity threshold.
International developments
The EU’s Sixth Framework Programme of
Research and Technological Development is
the focus for research, development and
demonstration of energy technologies in the EU.
The Programme has a budget for the years 2002 to
2006 of €17.5 billion.
441
28 Energy and natural resources
UK 2005
The European Commission’s energy action
programme, Intelligent Energy for Europe, began
in August 2003 and will run to 2006. It supports
EU policies in the field of energy and aims to
support sustainable development in an energy
context. The programme has four areas: the
promotion of renewable energies (ALTENER);
improved energy efficiency (SAVE); energy aspects
of transport (STEER); and the promotion of
renewable energy sources and energy efficiency in
developing countries (COOPENER).
The International Energy Agency (IEA), based in
Paris, is an autonomous agency linked with the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). It monitors world energy
markets on behalf of industrialised countries and
promotes reform of energy markets, both among
its members and internationally. The IEA is the
energy forum for member countries, including the
United Kingdom. IEA member governments are
committed to taking joint measures to meet oil
supply emergencies and agree to share
information, co-ordinate their energy policies and
co-operate in the development of rational energy
programmes.
Energy Products Directive
The EC Energy Products Directive came into force
on 1 January 2004 and provides an EU framework
for taxation on energy products, increasing the
existing minimum rates of duty on hydrocarbon
oils and introducing minimum rates of duty on
other energy products, including electricity,
natural gas, coal and other solid fuels. The
minimum rates in the Directive do not affect any
of the United Kingdom’s existing rates or
exemptions, but will require increases in some
other Member States, in order to provide
environmental benefits across the EU.
Oil and gas exploration and
production
In 2003, oil and gas accounted for about three-
quarters of total UK energy consumption, either
through direct use or as a source of energy for
electricity generation. Total UK production of
crude oil and NGLs in 2003 was 8.5 per cent lower
than in 2002, at 106.1 million tonnes. Total
indigenous UK production of natural gas in 2003
was 0.7 per cent lower than in 2002 and, in 2003,
imports of gas accounted for 8.4 per cent of gas
available for consumption. The United Kingdom
is beginning to become more dependent on gas
imports as reserves in the UK Continental Shelf
(UKCS) start to decline.
The UKCS comprises those areas of the seabed
and subsoil up to and beyond the territorial sea
over which the United Kingdom exercises
sovereign rights of exploration and exploitation of
natural resources. Exports from the UKCS rose by
17.5 per cent in 2003 to 16.0 billion cubic metres
(bcm). About 7.7 bcm were imported from
Norway and from Belgium via the UK-Belgium
interconnector, representing 8.4 per cent of total
supplies in 2003, compared with 5.8 per cent in
2002.

Taxation
The North Sea fiscal regime is a major mechanism
for gaining economic benefit for the United
Kingdom from its oil and gas resources. The
Government grants licences to private sector
companies to explore for, and exploit, oil and gas
resources (see box, page 443). Its main sources of
revenue from oil and gas activities are petroleum
revenue tax, levied on profits from fields approved
before 16 March 1993, and corporation tax,
charged on the profits of oil and gas companies.
Companies pay a 10 per cent supplementary
charge on North Sea profits and receive a 100 per
cent first-year allowance for capital expenditure in
the North Sea.

UK 2005
28 Energy and natural resources
Licensing
The main type of offshore licence is the traditional
Seaward Production Licence, which covers the life
of a field from exploration to decommissioning.
To increase oil and gas production in the North
Sea, a new type of licence called ‘Promote’ was
introduced in 2003, which offers opportunities
to smaller business.
The ‘Frontier’ licence was introduced in February
2004 to boost exploration by allowing companies
to apply for relatively large amounts of acreage at
significantly reduced costs, and then relinquish
three-quarters of that acreage after a screening
period. It applies to blocks in the Atlantic Margin,
west of the Shetland Isles. Onshore production
licences are called Petroleum Exploration and
Development Licences (PEDLs), and are similar to
the offshore production licences.
New licensing rounds
In March 2004 the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry invited applications for licences in
the 22nd offshore and 12th onshore licensing
rounds. These were the most extensive rounds of
their kind since 1965; they opened all of the UK
onshore area and 1,039 blocks and part blocks in
the offshore area for oil and gas licensing
opportunities.
Under these rounds, traditional offshore licences
applied to all regions of the UKCS, with Frontier
licences only available in the challenging West of
Shetland region and Promote licences in areas
excluding the West of Shetland. Twenty of the 68
companies that applied are potential new
entrants to the North Sea.
Production and reserves
There were 259 offshore fields in production at the
end of 2003: 131 oil, 104 gas and 24 condensate
(a lighter form of oil). During 2003, ten new field
developments (all offshore) were approved,
consisting of three oilfields, five gas fields and two
condensate fields. In addition, approval for four
incremental offshore developments and one
incremental onshore development was granted.
Only 204 development wells were drilled offshore
during 2003 compared with 249 in 2002, although
the number of exploration and appraisal wells
started offshore increased slightly, from 44 to 45.
In 2003, 17 development wells were drilled
onshore, compared with 18 in 2002, and only four
exploration and appraisal wells were started
onshore, compared with 14 in 2002.
Oil and gas production from the UKCS peaked in
1999. It is expected to continue to decline as
remaining reserves are depleted, and was estimated
at just over 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per
day (mboepd) in 2003.
The value of the United Kingdom’s recoverable oil
and gas reserves mainly depends upon the
estimated physical amounts remaining, the current
rate of extraction and the assumed future price per
unit of oil and gas, net of the cost of extraction.
Since 1993, the estimated stock of reserves has
fallen as a result of extraction, but the value of
reserves has generally risen, as oil prices have
increased. By the end of 2002, oil reserves were
valued at £59 billion while gas reserves were
estimated to be worth £51 billion.
Offshore gas
Natural gas now accounts for some 40 per cent of
total inland primary fuel consumption in the
United Kingdom. In 2003, indigenous production
fell by 0.5 per cent to 108.4 bcm.
The first significant discovery of offshore gas in
the United Kingdom was in 1965, and cumulative
gross gas production to the end of 2003 was 1,933
bcm. Maximum possible remaining gas reserves in
present discoveries now stand at 1,206 bcm.
Pipelines
Some 10,928 kilometres of submarine pipelines
transport oil, gas and condensate from one field to
another and to shore. Nine landing places on the
North Sea coast bring gas ashore to supply a
national and regional high- and low-pressure
pipeline system some 273,000 kilometres long,
which transports natural gas around Great Britain.
A 40-kilometre pipeline takes natural gas from
Scotland to Northern Ireland; exports to the Irish
Republic are conveyed by the Britain-Ireland
interconnector. The pipeline from Bacton in
Norfolk to Zeebrugge in Belgium (232
kilometres), which was opened in 1998, has an
443
28 Energy and natural resources
UK 2005
annual export capacity of 20 bcm of gas, or about
15 per cent of UK peak demand. Although a
smaller volume of gas can flow into the United
Kingdom at present, the interconnector’s owners
are proceeding with plans to increase import
capacity from the current 8.5 bcm to 16.5 bcm
a year in 2005 and 23.5 bcm a year in 2006.
Economic and industrial aspects
Since 1965, the UK oil and gas production
industry has generated operating surpluses of
some £325 billion, of which about £119 billion
(including £25 billion of exploration and appraisal
expenditure) has been reinvested in the industry,
£110 billion paid in taxation, and about £96
billion retained by the companies. Total annual
income of the oil and gas sector fell slightly to just
under £25 billion in 2003.
In 2003, the average price received by producers
from sales of UKCS oil was £130 per tonne,
compared with £124 per tonne in 2002. Total
revenues from the sale of production from the
UKCS in 2003 fell slightly compared with 2002,
with revenue from oil (including NGLs) at some
£14.5 billion and revenue from gas at £7.6 billion.
Taxes and royalty receipts attributable to UKCS oil
and gas fell to some £4.4 billion in 2003/04.
The PILOT initiative promotes co-operation
between industry and the Government to develop
recovery of the United Kingdom’s oil and gas
resources and prolong indigenous supplies. One
of its targets is that production should not decline
below 4 mboepd in 2005 and 3 mboepd by 2010.
Two initiatives it has helped to develop are the
DEAL Data Registry (www.ukdeal.co.uk), which
catalogues well and seismic survey data for the
UKCS, and the National Hydrocarbon Data
Archive (NHDA, www.bgs.ac.uk/nhda), which will
be a repository for some of the more valuable
geoscientific data collected during exploration of
the UKCS.
Production investment in the oil and gas
extraction industry in 2003 fell slightly from that
in 2002 to some £3.7 billion, including exploration
and appraisal investment of just over £0.3 billion.
It formed just over 16 per cent of total UK
industrial investment. In 2003, some 30,000 people
were engaged in extraction, while the industry
supported some 230,000 in other sectors.
The offshore environment
All new developments are assessed under the
Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipelines
(Assessment of Environmental Effects)
Regulations, the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) Regulations and the Offshore
Petroleum Activities (Conservation of Habitats)
Regulations. The EIA Regulations apply to the
drilling of wells, the installation of pipelines,
extended well tests and the development of new
fields. Environmental Statements are required for
projects that could have a significant impact on
the marine environment. The Habitats Regulations
additionally apply to activities that are not covered
by the EIA Regulations, such as offshore oil and
gas surveys, well abandonment and
decommissioning operations.
In addition to these assessment procedures,
permits are required for a number of offshore
activities. The Offshore Combustion Installations
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Regulations
2001 control emissions from offshore combustion
installations, that is, gas turbines and diesels
burning natural gas or diesel fuel which are
predominantly used to generate electricity. Permits
are also required for the use and discharge of
chemicals during all offshore operations under the
Offshore Chemicals Regulations 2002. By 2005,
operators will be able to use the UK Oil and Gas
Portal (www.og.dti.gov.uk/portal.htm) to apply
online for environmental consents.
The amount of oil spilled around the United
Kingdom and offshore is small in relation to
production, amounting to 96 tonnes in 2002. The
number of spills recorded increased from 349 in
1997 to 481 in 2002. About 96 per cent of reports
were for a spill of less than 1 tonne.
Since 1986, the United Kingdom has carried out
surveillance flights in accordance with
international obligations under the Bonn
Agreement. These flights are unannounced and
cover all offshore installations on the UKCS. The
DTI uses a computer link to the aircraft, which
transmits photographic images of possible
pollution incidents and enables it to investigate
these as they happen. In 2003, a total of 61
dedicated or operational over-flights were flown,
surveying 2,243 installations; the installations in
the southern North Sea and Irish Sea (Morecambe
Bay) were covered during designated shipping
flights. The total amount of oil observed from
444
UK 2005
28 Energy and natural resources
unreported spills was 2.4 tonnes from 26 separate
detections. DTI works closely with the Scottish
Fisheries Protection Agency, Defra and the
Maritime and Coastguard Agency (see page 339),
which all routinely over-fly UK waters.
Decommissioning
The Petroleum Act 1998 places a decommissioning
obligation on the operators of every offshore
installation and the owners of every offshore
pipeline on the UKCS. Companies have to submit
a decommissioning programme for ministerial
approval and ensure that its provisions are carried
out. The OSPAR Convention (see page 296) has
agreed rules for the disposal of defunct offshore
installations at sea. There is a ban on the dumping
and leaving in place of such installations, but
derogations are possible for concrete platforms
and the footings of steel installations with a jacket
weight above 10,000 tonnes.
All installations put in place after 9 February 1999
must be removed completely. The Government
encourages the re-use of facilities and expects
operators to show that they have investigated such
a course. It also encourages free trade in mature
offshore oil and gas assets, as a means of extending
field life and maximising economic recovery.
By August 2004, 25 decommissioning
programmes, covering 30 redundant installations,
had been approved by the DTI. The DTI is
working with the United Kingdom Offshore
Operators Association to identify best
environmental practice for dealing with drill
cuttings' at the decommissioning stage. OSPAR’s
Offshore Industry Committee agreed in March
2004 to UK proposals for action.
Offshore safety
Offshore health and safety are the responsibility of
the Flealth and Safety Executive (HSE, see page
158). Its Offshore Division (OSD) ensures that
risks to people who work in oil and gas extraction
are properly controlled. OSD’s regulatory tasks
range from providing advice and guidance on
operational and technical matters to working with
industry on reducing releases of hydrocarbons.
1 Rock fragments, sometimes contaminated with drilling mud, which
can accumulate on the seabed around drilling installations.
Suppliers of goods and services
As the UK offshore oil and gas sector matures, UK
supply and manufacturing companies have
increasingly turned to work in other industrial
sectors and in overseas hydrocarbon-producing
areas. The Oil and Gas Industry Development
Group in the DTI works with PILOT (see
page 444) and takes other action to help the
industry realign to changing market
circumstances. The UK supply chain database
(www.og.dti.gov.uk/portal.htm), maintained by
the DTI, contains contact details of over 3,000
companies in the UK oil and gas supply chain, and
is available for global buyers who seek information
on the capabilities and contact details of UK-based
companies in this sector.
Gas supply industry
Structure
Working in a fully competitive market, the holder
of a gas transporter’s1 2 licence in Great Britain may
not also hold licences for supply or shipping.
National Grid Transco pic (NGT) is the owner,
operator and developer of the majority of Britain’s
gas transport system. Its network supplies 40 per
cent of the country’s energy needs and it is
responsible for dealing with gas leaks and
emergencies. It has also had a monopoly in gas
metering, which the energy regulator (Ofgem)
opened to competition in July 2004 following
extensive consultation through its review of gas
metering arrangements.
Shippers participate in balancing supply and
demand in the pipeline network, within a regime
partly driven by commercial concerns, and
utilising gas trading arrangements, which include
a screen-based on-the-day commodity market for
trading in wholesale supplies of gas. In addition,
there are auctions for the allocation of entry
capacity into the high-pressure national
transmission system and commercial incentives for
NGT to operate and balance the system efficiently.
In Northern Ireland, natural gas has been available
since 1996 when the Scotland to Northern Ireland
2 Suppliers sell piped gas to consumers; public gas transporters
(PGTs) operate the pipeline system through which gas will
normally be delivered and shippers arrange with PGTs for
appropriate amounts of gas to go through the pipeline system.
445

gas pipeline was put into operation. Phoenix
Natural Gas Ltd has a combined licence for the
conveyance and supply of gas in Greater Belfast.
Bord Gais Eireann (BGE - based in the Republic
of Ireland) is responsible for the development and
maintenance of the whole of Ireland’s natural gas
transport network. The company intends to
complete a gas transmission pipeline to the
north-west of Northern Ireland by autumn 2004
and a connecting South-North pipeline by 2006.
Piped natural gas should be available to 80 per cent
of the population of Northern Ireland by 2012.
Competition
Since deregulation of the industry in 1994,
wholesale gas has been traded like most other
commodities. At the end of 2003, around 50
companies were active in the UK gas market, but
some companies owned or partly owned more
than one supplier.
By March 2004, 40 per cent of gas customers
(8.2 million)3 had changed from British Gas to one
of 20 other companies in the domestic market. In
2003, when 3.1 million domestic gas customers
changed suppliers, a standard credit4 customer
who had not switched was paying, on average,
£46 more on a standard bill of £289 a year.
Only companies that have been granted a
supplier’s licence are allowed to sell gas. Licence
conditions include providing gas to anyone who
requests it and is connected to the mains gas
supply. Special services must be made available for
elderly, disabled and chronically sick people.
Suppliers must offer customers a range of
payment options, and although they set their own
charges, they must publish their prices and other
terms so that customers can make an informed
choice. Domestic gas prices fell by 1.1 per cent in
real terms (including VAT) in 2003, continuing
the trend of a 16 per cent fall since 1995.
Ofgem acts to ensure that Great Britain’s
competitive retail market works for all customers
and that anti-competitive practices do not take
place. It is also working to prevent continuing
problems caused by doorstep selling, which
undermine customer confidence.
3 Excludes customers who changed suppliers and then returned to
British Gas.
4 Paying monthly in advance by cheque or cash, at a bank or post

Consumption and the market
In the United Kingdom, gas was traditionally used
as a fuel for the domestic, commercial and
industrial markets. During the 1990s, a market
opened up for the use of gas for power generation.
This offers higher generation efficiency, fewer
carbon emissions and lower fuel costs than
conventional coal-fired technology. The increase
of gas-fired generation caused rapid growth in UK
gas use. In 2003, gas represented around 47 per
cent of UKCS hydrocarbon production, 40 per
cent of UK energy production and around 4 per
cent of world gas production, making the United
Kingdom the fourth largest gas producer.
UK demand for natural gas in 2003 was 0.3 per
cent higher than in 2002. Final consumption rose
in all sectors but 1.7 per cent less gas was used for
electricity generation because high gas prices
meant that some generators found it more
profitable on occasions to sell gas rather than use
it for generation. Prices paid by industry
(excluding the CCL) increased slightly in 2003 by
0.7 per cent in real terms, having fallen by 20 per
cent over the last decade.
The effect of the stable demand for gas and the
decline in indigenous gas production is that the
United Kingdom is expected to become a net
importer of gas (on an annual basis) by around
2006 (it already imports gas during the winter).
The dependence on imports is expected to
increase sharply to 40-50 per cent by 2010,
and 80-90 per cent by 2020. This will require
additional import infrastructure; a number
of commercial projects are under discussion
including expanded and new interconnectors with
continental Europe, a major new pipeline from the
Norwegian Continental Shelf and new liquefied
natural gas (LNG) terminals. There are plans to
increase gas storage capacity within Great Britain
to help meet demand peaks. The first long-term
deal to import LNG was signed in August 2004.
Downstream oil
Oil consumption
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery consumption)
in 2003 included 19.9 million tonnes of petrol for
motor vehicles, 17.7 million tonnes of DERV fuel,
10.5 million tonnes of aviation turbine fuel,
446
UK 2005
28 Energy and natural resources
6.1 million tonnes of gas oil (distilled from
petroleum) and 1.6 million tonnes of fuel oils
(blends of heavy petroleum).
Oil refineries
In 2003, the United Kingdom’s 13 refineries
processed 84.5 million tonnes of crude and
process oils, slightly less than in 2002. About two-
thirds of UK output by weight is in the form of
lighter, higher-value products such as gasoline,
DERV and jet kerosene. Petrol production is more
important in the United Kingdom than in its
European counterparts, accounting for about a
third of each barrel of crude oil compared with
the European average of just over a fifth.
In 2003, UK exports of refined petroleum
products rose by 4.2 per cent to £4.9 billion.
Virtually all exports went to partners in the EU
and in the IEA (especially France, Germany and
the United States).
The importance of petroleum in
transport
Transport accounted for 70 per cent of all
petroleum energy and non-energy use in the
United Kingdom in 2003. Road transport used
37.6 million tonnes of petrol (unleaded and lead
replacement petrol) and DERV fuel. Water
transport used 1.1 million tonnes (mainly gas oil
and diesel) and railways used 0.3 million tonnes
(mainly gas oil, diesel and fuel oil). Most of the
use of petrol (95 per cent) was by cars and taxis,
with goods vehicles (mainly light vans)
accounting for 4 per cent and motorcycles most
of the remaining 1 per cent. Goods vehicles,
however, accounted for 68 per cent of the use of
DERV fuel, with coaches accounting for 7 per
cent, and the remaining 25 per cent mainly used
by diesel cars and taxis.

Coal
The UK coal industry is entirely in the private
sector. The main deep mine operator in the United
Kingdom is UK Coal pic. UK Coal, Scottish Coal
Company Ltd, H J Banks and Company and Celtic
Energy (which operates in Wales) are the main
opencast operators. In May 2004, there were 38
opencast sites in production and 11 major deep
mines. A number of deep mines have closed over
the years, including the Selby complex in north
Yorkshire, which closed in summer 2004. The coal
industry employed just over 7,900 people in May
2004, of whom around 73 per cent were employed
at deep mines. Opencast production accounts for
most of the relatively low-sulphur coal mined in
Scotland and South Wales.
UK coal production fell by 6.0 per cent to
27.8 million tonnes in 2003, a new record low
for deep-mined coal (down 4.6 per cent to
15.6 million tonnes) and the lowest level since
1976 for opencast coal (12.1 million tonnes, down
7.8 per cent on the year).
Market for coal
Imports of coal in 2003 were 31.9 million tonnes,
some 11 per cent higher than in 2002 and the
second highest annual volume on record,
35.5 million tonnes in 2001. Very little UK coal
is exported - only 542,000 tonnes in 2003.
UK demand for coal in 2003 was 6.4 per cent
higher at 62.4 million tonnes, with consumption
by electricity generators up 11.2 per cent. This was
mainly due to high gas prices leading to coal-fired
generation in preference to gas-fired, but it was
also prompted by a reduced output from nuclear
power stations in the fourth quarter of the year.
Electricity generators accounted for 85 per cent of
total coal use in 2003, compared with 81 per cent
in 2002. Coal use in coke ovens and blast furnaces
in the steel industry was very slightly higher than
in 2002, at 6.6 million tonnes.
Cleaner coal
Cleaner coal technologies reduce the
environmental impact of coal used for power and
industrial applications by increasing the efficiency
of its conversion to energy and reducing harmful
emissions (one of the causes of acid rain).
Improvements in the efficiency of coal-fired power
stations lead to reductions in carbon dioxide
emissions, a major contributor to climate change.
The DTI is supporting research and development
(R&D) into cleaner coal technology, covering a
number of technologies in advanced power
447

generation and emissions reduction. In
the longer run, it should be possible for UK
project developers to benefit from carbon credits
through international trading under the Kyoto
Protocol (see page 293) clean development
mechanism.
Other sources of funding for cleaner coal R&D
for UK companies include the British Coal
Utilisation Research Association (BCURA), the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
Council (see page 395) and the EU’s Sixth
Framework Programme (see page 441).
Coal Authority
The Coal Authority is a public body sponsored by
the DTI. Its responsibilities include:
■ licensing coal-mining operations and granting
leases to exploit coal reserves;
■ coal subsidence damage claims not falling on
coal mining companies;
■ managing property in coalfield areas;
■ managing minewater pollution and other
environmental problems associated with coal
mining; and
■ providing geological and other information
on past and future coal-mining activity to
house buyers, other purchasers of property
and local authorities.
Nuclear power
Nuclear power substantially reduces the use of
fossil fuels that would otherwise be needed for
electricity generation. It generates about one-sixth
of the world’s energy and over a third of Europe’s.
Calder Hall, in Cumbria, which was connected to
the national grid in 1956 and operated until the
end of March 2003, was the first nuclear power
station in the world to provide electricity
commercially. No new nuclear reactors have been
ordered or built in the United Kingdom since
Sizewell B in Suffolk, which began to generate
electricity in 1995. In 2003, the United Kingdom
had 31 operating reactors at 13 nuclear power
stations. Nuclear stations generated 89 terawatt
hours (TWh) in 2003 and contributed 22.2 per
cent of total electricity generation.
Existing nuclear stations are expected to continue
to contribute to the country’s energy requirements
provided they do so to the high safety and
environmental standards currently observed.
Government projections suggest that nuclear
power generation could represent about 17 to
18 per cent of total generation by 2010 and about
7 per cent by 2020. These projections assume no
new stations will be built, and recognise that plant
lifetimes are dependent on safety and economic
factors. The energy White Paper (see page 440) did
not rule out the possibility that, at some point in
the future, the construction of new nuclear power
stations might be necessary if the United Kingdom
is to meet its carbon targets. However, in the
Government’s view, the economics of nuclear
power make it an unattractive option for new
generating capacity and there are still important
issues concerning nuclear waste to be resolved.
British Energy
The private sector company British Energy (BE)
owns and operates seven advanced gas-cooled
reactor stations and the pressurised water reactor
(PWR) at Sizewell B. BE’s reactors have a declared
net capacity of 9,580 megawatts (MW).
Following financial difficulties in 2002, BE
received a short-term government loan, which
it repaid in March 2003. The Government agreed
to continue to fund BE’s operation while its
restructuring plan was agreed and implemented,
and extended the credit facility on a contingency
basis to September 2004 or the date on which
the restructuring plan became effective. The
maximum amount to be made available was £275
million. The Electricity (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act 2003 is designed to facilitate the Government’s
response to BE’s financial difficulties and to
allow it to plan for a smoother path through
administration should BE be unable to deliver its
restructuring plan.
British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL)
BNFL operates four magnox power stations,
while seven others are being defuelled or
decommissioned. BNFL is the primary UK
provider of nuclear products and services
including spent fuel management, recycling,
reprocessing oxide fuel, decommissioning and
cleaning up redundant nuclear facilities, and
treating historic wastes for both UK and
international customers. The company’s turnover
in 2003/04 was £2.32 billion. BNFL comprises four
business groups: British Nuclear Group;
Westinghouse; Nuclear Sciences and Technology
Services; and Spent Fuel Services.

Managing the nuclear legacy
The Energy Act 2004 (see page 441) provides for
the creation of the Nuclear Decommissioning
Authority (NDA), a non-departmental public
body that will take responsibility for discharging
the historic liabilities in the United Kingdom
owned and managed by BNFL and the UK Atomic
Energy Authority (see below). It is estimated that
the costs of cleaning up this legacy, which are
already being met by the taxpayer, will amount to
£48 billion over the next century.
The NDA is a cross-border public authority
reporting to both the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry, and Scottish ministers. It is
responsible for developing a long-term strategy for
decommissioning and cleaning up designated sites.
In doing so, it will work closely with the nuclear
regulators (Environment Agency, Scottish
Environment Protection Agency, HSE Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate and the Office for Civil
Nuclear Security) to ensure that its clean-up plans
are carried out in line with environmental and
international obligations. The new authority is
expected to be fully operational by 1 April 2005.
UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)
UKAEA manages the decommissioning and
environmental restoration of its former nuclear
research sites at Dounreay (Caithness), Windscale
(Cumbria), Elarwell (Oxfordshire) and Winfrith
(Dorset). It also manages the UK contribution to
the fusion energy programme at Culham,
Oxfordshire. UKAEA is a non-departmental public
body, funded mainly by the DTI.
By summer 2003, UKAEA had dismantled 18
major radioactive facilities including six research
reactors. It has also produced plans for the
restoration of all its sites. The estimated cost of its
liabilities is £9.7 billion.
Fusion research
Nuclear fusion research in the United Kingdom is
funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC, see page 395) and
Euratom (the European Atomic Energy
Community). The main focus of government
spending in this area is magnetic confinement,
which is based at Culham in Oxfordshire. The
UKAEA operates Europe’s leading fusion facility
- JET (Joint European Torus) on behalf of its
European partners in the European Fusion
Development Agreement - as well as the UK
domestic programme. Through the EU, the
Euratom/UKAEA Fusion Association contributes
to International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor - the international partnership between
China, Europe, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the
United States - to demonstrate the principle of
power production from fusion.
Nuclear safety
The safety of nuclear installations is the
responsibility of the nuclear operators within a
system of regulatory control enforced by the HSE.
Regulation of nuclear safety is primarily achieved
through a system of licensing. The HSE assesses
and inspects sites to satisfy itself that the licensees
meet their responsibilities for safety.
The International Convention on Nuclear Safety
has been ratified by 53 countries (including the
United Kingdom and other members of the EU)
and the European Commission. Each signatory is
required to submit a report showing how it meets
the articles of the Convention, and such reports
are the subject of peer review by the other parties.
The most recent UK report for the Convention on
Nuclear Safety was prepared in 2002.
The Nuclear Safety Directorate, acting for the HSE
(see page 158), gives specialist assistance to the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the
OECD’s nuclear energy agency, and Euratom. The
main UK contribution to the international effort
to improve safety in Central and Eastern Europe
and the former Soviet republics is channelled
through the EU nuclear safety programmes.
Electricity
The Energy Act 2004 provides for the creation of
a single wholesale electricity market in Great
Britain. The British Electricity Trading and
Transmission Arrangements (BETTA) are
scheduled to be introduced in April 2005. The
Government hopes that extending the New
Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) to
Scotland will increase competition in Scotland and
across Great Britain more generally.
England and Wales
In December 2003, 43 companies held generation
licences in England and Wales. The largest
449
UK 2005
28 Energy and natural resources
generating companies are RWE Innogy, Powergen
(now called E.ON UK), British Energy and
Centrica. National Grid Transco owns and operates
the transmission system, and is responsible for
balancing electricity supply and demand. Its
appointment as the GB System Operator under
BETTA was confirmed in August 2004.
The 12 Distribution Network Operators (DNOs)
are responsible for transferring electricity from the
high-voltage National Grid to consumers via local
distribution networks. Supply - the purchase of
electricity by end users from electricity suppliers
- has been fully open to competition since 1999.
Cross-border acquisitions and takeovers have
become a feature of the European power market
and most of the companies involved in
distribution and supply are now overseas-owned.
All but one of the main UK generators also now
own supply businesses.
NETA came into effect in England and Wales in
2001, replacing the Electricity Pool that had
operated since privatisation in 1990. NETA was
designed to introduce more competition into
wholesale electricity trading and to create a
commodity-based market. Participants are free to
trade electricity for any half-hour period until one
hour ahead of real time (‘gate closure’). From that
point until real time, the market operates through
the Balancing Mechanism, run by NGT, because of
the need to balance the system on a second-by-
second basis.
Scotland
Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Energy
transmit and distribute electricity within their
respective franchise areas, and generate and supply
electricity throughout the United Kingdom. They
are also contracted to buy all the output from
British Energy’s two Scottish nuclear power
stations (Hunterston B and Torness) until BETTA
becomes operative or April 2006, whichever is the
later. Under BETTA, transmission assets in
Scotland will continue to be owned by the two
companies.
Northern Ireland
Three private sector companies generate electricity
in Northern Ireland from power stations: AES
Kilroot Power Ltd, Premier Power Ltd and
Coolkeeragh Power Ltd. Most of the output is sold
to Northern Ireland Electricity pic (NIE), which
has a monopoly of transmission and distribution,
and a licence to supply.
The electricity market has been gradually opened
up to competition since 1999. From April 2004,
the right to choose a supplier was extended to
36 per cent of the total market (mainly large
industrial consumers). In addition to NIE, a
number of second-tier suppliers are operating.
Three interconnectors link the electricity system
of Northern Ireland with that of the Republic of
Ireland. The main North-South interconnector
has a capacity to trade 2 x 600 MW of electricity —
enough to power several major towns. The
interconnectors enable trade of electricity between
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and,
through the Moyle interconnector (Northern
Ireland-Scotland), with Great Britain.
Regulation and other functions
The electricity and gas markets in Great Britain
are regulated by Ofgem, according to policies set
by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority.
Ofgem’s principal objective is to protect the
interests of gas and electricity customers, wherever
appropriate, by promoting effective competition.
Other duties and objectives include ensuring that
reasonable demands for electricity are met and
that electricity and gas licensees are able to finance
their statutory obligations. Ofgem is responsible
for setting performance standards for gas and
electricity companies, and for price regulation of
companies where competition has not yet fully
emerged or where there is a natural monopoly.
The Northern Ireland Authority for Energy
Regulation, a non-ministerial government
department, regulates electricity and natural gas
industries in Northern Ireland. It is supported by
the Office for the Regulation of Electricity and Gas.
Consumption
In 2003, final consumption of electricity in the
United Kingdom rose by 1.3 per cent to 337 TWh.
The major users were the domestic sector and
industry (around 34 per cent each). Commerce,
public administration, transport and agriculture
together accounted for 32 per cent. Sales of
electricity through the public distribution system
in the United Kingdom were 325 TWh in 2003.
Electricity prices for industrial customers fell by
6.8 per cent in real terms during 2003, continuing
450
UK 2005
28 Energy and natural resources
the downward trend of the previous ten years.
Domestic consumer prices for electricity fell by
1.9 per cent in real terms (including VAT) during
2003 and have fallen by 29 per cent in real terms
(including VAT) since 1995.
Since deregulation in 1998, around 10.5 million5
domestic customers (42 per cent) have switched
suppliers, including 4.2 million in 2003. These
customers saved an average of £21 on their annual
bill. The average annual domestic electricity bill in
the United Kingdom for a customer paying by
standard credit was estimated at £237 in 2003.
Energywatch
Energywatch was established under the Utilities
Act 2000 as an independent adviser for consumers
in the gas and electricity markets in Great Britain.
The Government is working with Ofgem,
Energywatch and the industry to ensure that the
market works better and to improve consumers’
confidence. Energywatch also seeks to ensure that
both the industry as a whole and individual
companies improve their performance in a range
of other areas including customer contact,
administration and the management of accounts.
It receives a grant from the DTI, which is derived
from the licence fee that energy companies have to
pay to the Government.
Generation
Non-nuclear power stations owned by the major
UK power producers consumed 58 million tonnes
of oil equivalent in 2003, of which coal accounted
for 55 per cent and natural gas for 42 per cent.
Other power companies (for which gas is the most
widely used fuel) and over 2,000 small
autogenerators (which produce power for their
own use) have equal access with the major
generators to the grid transmission and local
distribution systems.
Combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs)
In 2003, CCGT stations accounted for 33 per cent
of the electricity supplied by major power
producers, compared with 7 per cent in 1993.
CCGT stations, favoured by the smaller,
independent producers and using natural gas,

unit of electricity than coal-fired plant. At the end
of December 2003, the United Kingdom had 29
CCGT stations, with a total registered capacity of
23.5 gigawatts (GW).
Combined heat and power (CHP)
CHP is a highly fuel-efficient technology, which
puts to use the waste heat produced as a by¬
product of the electricity generation process. It can
convert more than 75 per cent of fuel input into
useful energy, while conventional generation wastes
around half the energy content of the fuel and
emits considerably more C02 per kilowatt hour
(kWh) of useful output. CHP thus benefits the
environment and contributes to UK climate change
targets by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
It is also used for cooling and chilling.
CHP can be fuelled by a variety of energy sources.
It offers particular benefits where there is a regular
need for heat as well as electricity on a local scale,
such as in hospitals, leisure centres and new
housing developments. About 83 per cent of CHP
plants are less than 1 MW capacity; however,
large-scale plant (above 10 MW) constitutes 81
per cent of total CHP capacity.
Between 1991 and 2003, the electricity generation
capacity of CHP plants more than doubled. In
2003, 1,506 CHP schemes with a combined
capacity of 4,879 MW produced a total of 24.2
TWh. This represents just over 6 per cent of the
total electricity generated in the United Kingdom
(and 11 per cent of electricity consumption in the
commercial and industrial sectors).
EU strategy is to double CHP’s share of the EU
electricity market from 9 per cent in 2001 to
18 per cent by 2010. The UK Government is
committed to having at least 10,000 MW of Good
Quality CHP'’ generating capacity by 2010, but
recent modelling work suggests that capacity is
likely to fall short of this target. The Strategy for
combined heat and power to 2010, published in
April 2004, sets out a range of measures to support
the long-term growth of CHP and its capacity
to meet the target, including CCL exemptions,
enhanced capital allowances to stimulate
investment and working with Ofgem to ensure a
level playing field under NETA.
6 Good Quality CHP refers to CHP generation that achieves a
designated level of operational efficiency as defined under the UK
Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance (CHPQA) programme
(www.chpqa.com).

Trade
NGT and Electricite de France run a 2,000 MW
cross-Channel cable link, allowing transmission of
electricity between the two countries. The link has
generally been used to supply ‘baseload’ power -
which needs to be generated and available round
the clock - from France to England. Imports met
just 0.7 per cent of the United Kingdom’s
electricity needs in 2003.
Scotland has a peak winter demand of under
6 GW and generating capacity of over 9 GW. The
additional available capacity is used to supply
England and Wales through transmission lines
linking the Scottish and English grid systems. This
interconnector’s capacity has been upgraded from
1,600 MW to 2,200 MW. The 60-kilometre 500
MW undersea Moyle interconnector between
Scotland and Northern Ireland allows exports
of power from Scotland.
Renewable energy
Renewable electricity can be generated from wind
(both offshore and onshore), water (hydro, wave
and tidal power), sunlight (the direct conversion
of solar radiation into electricity, called
photovoltaics or PV), biomass (energy from
forestry, crops or biodegradable waste) and from
the earth’s heat (geothermal energy). None of
these forms of generation, except biomass, involves
the production of carbon, and biomass generation
produces only the carbon that the material has
absorbed from the atmosphere while growing.
Emissions arising from the management, handling
and transport of the biomass are small relative
to its energy content. The exposed coastline of
the United Kingdom offers particularly strong
potential for the expansion of wind, wave and tidal
power. Table 28.7 gives details of UK renewable
energy sources. Renewables and wastes provided
2.9 per cent of the electricity generated in the
United Kingdom in 2003 compared with 3 per
cent in 2002.
Heat, as well as electricity, can be generated from
renewable sources. Solar energy can heat water
directly, either for hot water or for space heating
in buildings. Heat from the ground, river water,
sewage and the air can be extracted via a heat
exchanger for both water and space heating.
Biomass can be used to generate heat in either
heat-only developments or in CHP units.

Growth in the proportion of electricity generated
from renewable sources has a vital role to play in
government efforts to exceed the UK Kyoto
commitment to reduce emissions of greenhouse
gases by 12.5 per cent below 1990 levels by
2008-12 (see page 294). The Government’s target
is to obtain 10 per cent of UK electricity sales from
sources eligible for the Renewables Obligation (see
below) by 2010, rising to 15 per cent by 2015.
Measures to meet this target will help the United
Kingdom meet EU targets for 2010 - 12 per cent
of national gross energy consumption from
renewables and 22 per cent of green electricity
in total electricity consumption.
The Renewables Obligation is the Government’s
key measure to encourage renewable energy
generation. Orders came into force in 2002 that
oblige all licensed electricity suppliers in Great
Britain to ensure that a specified and growing
proportion of their electricity comes from
renewable sources. Initially set at 3.0 per cent for
2002/03, the level of the Obligation rose to 4.3 per
cent for 2003/04 and will rise by annual steps to
15.4 per cent in 2015/16. Suppliers may meet their
Obligation by supplying eligible renewable
electricity to customers in Great Britain, by buying
Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs)
reflecting renewable generation by others, or by
paying a buy-out price to the electricity regulator,
Ofgem, rather than supplying renewable
electricity. The buy-out price is set at a level
intended to make this option unattractive.
In September 2004, the Government issued
452
UK 2005
28 Energy and natural resources
a consultation paper on limited changes to the
Renewables Obligation Order, and expects to
complete the 2005/06 review of the Renewables
Obligation by December 2005.
The Scottish Executive published a renewable
energy strategy for Scotland in May 2003 and set
a target that 40 per cent of electricity generated
in Scotland by 2020 should be from renewables.
The Strategic Energy Framework for Northern
Ireland, published in June 2004, requires
renewables to contribute 12 per cent of all
electricity consumed by 2012. There are plans
to introduce a Northern Ireland Renewables
Obligation from 1 April 2005. It is intended that
Northern Ireland ROCs will be fully tradeable
with those issued in Great Britain. By 2010, it is
estimated that support from the Renewables
Obligation and the benefit of exemption from the
climate change levy will be worth around £1
billion a year to the UK renewable energy industry.
Renewables UK, a unit within the DTI, seeks to
help UK manufacturers of renewable equipment
and technology overcome barriers to renewables
projects in the United Kingdom and to benefit
from the expanding global renewables market. It
aims to raise awareness of the industry and to take
advantage of transferable skills from the
established oil and gas industry. The Renewables
Advisory Board, an independent non-
departmental public body sponsored by the DTI,
provides advice to the Government on renewable
energy issues. The DTI supports collaborative
R&D in renewables technologies through its
Technology Programme.
Wind energy
Wind energy generated at both onshore and
offshore installations is expected to make the
largest contribution to the expansion of renewable
energy in the United Kingdom between 2004 and
2010. At the end of 2003, UK wind generating
capacity was 742 MW, up from 534 MW at the
end of 2002. This is equivalent to an annual
generation of 1.29 GWh or 0.5 per cent of UK
electricity supply, and was produced by 1,043
turbines operating at 84 sites, two of which were
offshore. The British Wind Energy Association
(BWEA) expects 22 new wind projects will be
built in the United Kingdom in 2004, representing
some 474 MW of new capacity. These include a
new offshore wind farm at Scroby Sands, off the
coast at Great Yarmouth. Total installed wind
capacity by 2005 is predicted to be around
1,700 MW, equivalent to the generation of about
4.49 TWh - sufficient to meet the needs of just
under 1 million UK households.
The first round of leasings of areas of the UK
seabed for offshore wind farms, announced in
December 2000, resulted in 18 proposals from
developers and could result in more than 500
turbines, generating 1.5 GW. A second round of
offshore leasings, on a much larger scale than the
first, was announced in July 2003; each farm is
expected to comprise hundreds of turbines and
the energy produced will be sufficient to provide
electricity for over 3.5 million households.
Three strategic areas of shallow coastal waters -
the Thames Estuary, the Greater Wash and the
North West of England - have been identified as
appropriate for development. In December 2003,
15 new sites were announced in these areas. They
include the world’s largest proposed offshore wind
farm off the Lincolnshire coast, which could have
over 250 turbines and provide up to 1.2 GW of
generating capacity.
The DTI estimates that, by 2010, UK offshore
wind farms could provide up to 6 GW of energy,
enough to power 15 per cent of all households in
the United Kingdom. Under the Energy Act 2004
(see page 441), developers can now build wind
farms more than 12 nautical miles out to sea,
beyond territorial waters.
Biomass and waste
Agricultural biomass includes both agricultural
wastes such as straw and poultry litter, and energy
crops such as short rotation coppice and
Miscanthus (a perennial woody grass) grown
specifically for energy generation. Forest biomass
includes material direct from the forests (such as
small roundwood and harvesting residues) and
sawmill products (such as wood chips and
sawdust). Other sources of clean woody biomass
include arboricultural arisings.
Elean power station at Sutton (Cambridgeshire)
is the United Kingdom’s first straw-fired power
plant. With a potential output of 36 MW, it burns
200,000 tonnes of straw a year and generates
enough power for 80,000 homes. The power
station at Thetford in Norfolk burns over 450,000
tonnes of poultry litter and other agricultural
453
28 Energy and natural resources
UK 2005
biomass each year, producing 38.5 MW of
electricity - enough for around 93,000 homes.
The Government is supporting biomass projects
through a £29 million Energy Crops Scheme
running from 2000 to 2006 and, subject to
European Commission approval, a £3.5 million
Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme.
Wave and tidal power
The DTTs Renewables Innovation Review,
published in December 2003, recognised the large
UK wave and tidal resource and predicts that wave
and tidal stream power could develop into a
significant global market by 2050. As the current
leader in this field, the United Kingdom is well
placed to exploit this. Research and development
are supported through the DTI’s Technology
Programme and a number of technologies have
already been demonstrated at full scale. A new £50
million Marine Research Development Fund was
announced in August 2004 and the Energy Act
2004 allows the development, for the first time,
of marine renewable energy sources outside UK
territorial waters.
The world’s first free-standing tidal energy turbine
system began trials at Lynmouth, north Devon in
August 2003, while a new floating wave power
machine, Pelamis, which is capable of generating
enough electricity to power 500 homes, began
trials off Orkney in August 2004. Successful trials
of a prototype tidal stream generator took place off
Shetland in 2002 and those for a prototype marine
current turbine off the Devon coast in 2004.
Solar energy
Solar radiation can be converted directly into
electricity using PV cells. The costs of solar PV
technology have fallen substantially over the last
25 years and are expected to fall further as global
markets expand and as its use increases to meet
electricity requirements in areas without access to
grid supplies.
PV integrated into or attached to houses and other
buildings can deliver clean, silent electricity at the
point of use, but requires government support
because of its current high cost. The Large Scale
Photovoltaic Demonstration scheme has £25
million available to help raise awareness of the
technology in the public and private sectors,
reduce technology costs and stimulate demand.
The Government also supports the development
of active solar heating and passive solar design.
Active solar heating systems convert solar
radiation into heat that can be used directly, stored
for use in the future, or converted to electricity.
The UK climate means that the technology is best
suited to low temperature heating applications,
which do not require direct sunlight. The most
common of these is the provision of heat for
domestic hot water systems. Government grants
for the installation of solar water heating systems
for households or communities are available
under the £10 million Clear Skies Scheme
(www.clear-skies.org). Additional funding of
£2.5 million will extend the scheme to March 2006.
Passive solar design uses the fabric and orientation
of a building to capture the sun’s energy and thus
reduce the need for artificial heating, cooling and
lighting. Significant progress has been made in the
United Kingdom in the non-domestic buildings
sector, but uptake in the housebuilding sector has
been slower.
Energy efficiency
Energy efficiency is an essential part of the UK
climate change programme (see page 293) and the
Government funds a number of programmes.
The Carbon Trust is a government-backed,
non-profit organisation that seeks to help UK
business and the public sector reduce carbon
emissions. The Trust’s funding is around £50
million a year from the Government - partly from
recycled receipts from the climate change levy (see
page 441). It works in partnership with the
Research Councils and others to support low
carbon technology innovation across all sectors,
and offers free energy efficiency information and
advice to business and public sector organisations.
The Energy Saving Trust is a non-profit
organisation funded by government and the
private sector whose initiatives cover energy
efficiency, renewable energy and clean fuels.
Its network of advice centres across the United
Kingdom provide free and impartial energy
efficiency advice to households and small
businesses, including advice on grants available
locally as well as general advice on how to make
homes more energy efficient. It also offers an
information service for local authorities.
454
UK 2005
28 Energy and natural resources
Energy efficiency - the Government’s plan for action,
published in April 2004, contains a package of
measures which could deliver over 12 million
tonnes of carbon savings by 2010. These measures
include a doubling of the level of current Energy
Efficiency Commitment activity from 2005 to
2008, with a possible extension to 2011. Under the
Commitment, electricity and gas suppliers must
meet targets for the promotion of improvements
in domestic energy efficiency. They do this by
encouraging and assisting consumers to take up
energy efficiency measures, such as insulation and
heating measures, and energy-efficient appliances
and light bulbs.
The Market Transformation Programme, a Defra
initiative, aims to promote products and services
which do less harm to the environment by using
less energy, water and other resources. It focuses
on improving the delivered energy performance
of domestic and non-domestic products, especially
energy-consuming appliances, equipment and
components.
Fuel poverty
A household is considered to be living in fuel
poverty when it needs to spend more than 10 per
cent of its income on household fuel use in order
to keep warm. Fuel poverty is generally more
significant in the United Kingdom than in the rest
of Europe, where homes have traditionally been
built to higher energy efficiency standards.
The UK Fuel Poverty Strategy, published in 2001,
sets out policies for ending fuel poverty by 2010
in vulnerable7 households. The second annual
progress report, published in April 2004, estimates
that the number of UK households in fuel poverty
has declined from 5.5 million in 1996 (of which
4 million were vulnerable) to 2.25 million in 2002
(of which 1.75 million were vulnerable). Falling
fuel prices and increases in incomes, especially for
the most vulnerable, are thought to be the main
factors for the reduction, with a smaller
contribution from improved energy efficiency.
The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group (FPAG) is a
non-departmental public body jointly sponsored
by Defra and the DTI. Its primary task is to advise
the Government on practical measures needed to
achieve its target of eradicating fuel poverty in
England. In its 2004 annual report, FPAG
7 A vulnerable household is one containing children or someone
who is elderly, sick or disabled.
Household energy efficiency
Existing energy efficiency measures, such as
greater loft insulation and more efficient central
heating boilers, have already delivered a
considerable improvement in household energy
efficiency. However, the demand for energy
continues to rise due to the growing number of
households and higher levels of 'energy service'
(warmer and better lit homes using more
appliances). Around 11 million of the estimated
17 million dwellings with wall cavities in the
United Kingdom do not have insulation.
Government programmes have increased the rate
of uptake of cavity wall insulation towards
280,000 a year, but this rate will have to treble
before 2009 in order to meet the target energy
savings. Further R&D is also needed to develop
cost-effective and compatible methods of
improving the energy efficiency of the estimated
7 million homes with solid walls.
estimates that the number of vulnerable fuel-poor
households needs to be reduced to 400,000 by
March 2008 to be on track to meet the
Government’s 2010 target.
Warm Front is the Government’s main
programme to tackle fuel poverty in England and
is targeted specifically at vulnerable households in
the private sector in receipt of an income-related
or disability benefit. Between April 2001 and
February 2004, the scheme assisted some 670,000
households with measures such as insulation,
replacement boilers, new gas and electric central
heating systems, and gas central heating repairs.
The forthcoming Fuel Poverty Implementation
Plan will set out the future for Warm Front and
outline how fuel poverty targets will be met.
The overall target dates for ending all fuel poverty
in Scotland and Wales are 2016 and 2018
respectively. Warm Deal, the Scottish Executive’s
insulation grant scheme, provided energy
efficiency packages to over 180,000 households
between 1999 and February 2004. The National
Assembly for Wales’s fuel poverty programme, the

The target dates for Northern Ireland are to end
fuel poverty in vulnerable households and social
housing by 2010, and to end all fuel poverty by
2016. Towards a fuel poverty strategy for Northern
Ireland was published for consultation by the
Department for Social Development in October
2003. The interim target is to have assisted at least
40,000 households by 2006, from an estimated
203,000 households in fuel poverty.
Water supply
About three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s
water supply is obtained from upland lakes,
reservoirs and river intakes, while a quarter is
from underground sources (stored in layers of
porous rock). Parts of East Anglia, South West,
South East and southern England are more
dependent on groundwater than the rest of the
United Kingdom. Northern England, Scotland
and Wales have a relative abundance of unpolluted
water from upland sources. Northern Ireland also
has plentiful supplies for domestic use and for
industry.
Water put into the public water supply system
(including industrial and other uses) in England
and Wales averaged 15,394 megalitres a day (Ml/d)
in 2002/03. An average of 2,387 Ml/d was supplied
in Scotland, and 710 Ml/d in Northern Ireland.
Some 58,489 Ml/d were abstracted from all
sources in England and Wales in 2001, of which
public water supplies accounted for 16,231 Ml/d.
The electricity supply industry took 32,263 Ml/d
and agriculture 108 Ml/d (excluding spray
irrigation which accounted for a further 259
Ml/d). Abstractions for the public water supply
were 13 per cent higher in 2001 than in 1971, but
8 per cent lower than in 1991. Electricity supply
industry abstractions have varied greatly since
1990, but have recently increased and in 2001 were
very similar to the 1971 level. Total abstractions
for all other purposes fell during the 1970s, but
have since increased again.
Despite improved efficiency in the use of water,
public demand continues to increase. Household
water consumption per person in England and
Wales grew from 140 litres a day in 1992/93 to
150 litres a day in 2003, due to the increasing
numbers of households, increasing use of
domestic appliances and warmer weather.
England and Wales
The Environment Agency regulates the amount of
water that can be abstracted from each resource
under the Water Resources Act 1991 by issuing
abstraction licences. There is a charging scheme
for abstraction of water.
The 26 water companies across England and Wales
have statutory responsibilities for public water
supply, including quality and sufficiency. Ten of
these companies are also responsible for sewage
treatment.
The average household bill in 2004/05 is £249
(£117 for water and £132 for sewerage). Since
privatisation in 1989, average household bills for
water and sewerage have increased by 25 per cent
in real terms.
The Water Industry Act 1999 prohibits water
companies from disconnecting households and
other premises deemed vital to the community. It
also makes provision for the protection of water
customers on metered supplies who are vulnerable
to hardship because of high usage for essential
household purposes. These include a large number
of low-income families, and elderly and disabled
people. These provisions are laid down in the
Vulnerable Groups Regulations and their
amendments.
WaterVoice provides independent representation
for all customers of the water and sewerage
companies in England and Wales. Operating
through regional committees, it represents the
interests of customers in respect of price, services
and value for money, and investigates complaints.
The ten regional committee chairmen form the
WaterVoice Council, which deals with issues at
national and European levels.
The Director General of Water Services, who heads
the Office of Water Services (Ofwat), is the
economic regulator of the water industry in
England and Wales. The Director set price limits
for water and sewerage services for 2000-05,
which assumed water companies would deliver
a capital investment programme of £15.6 billion
at May 1999 prices during this period. This
investment is intended to maintain the water
and sewerage systems, improve customer services,
and cope with growth in demand. It includes
£7.4 billion to improve drinking water and
456
UK 2005
28 Energy and natural resources
environmental water quality, to meet new EU
and national standards.8
The 2004 price review will set water and sewerage
price limits for 2005-10 and a revised capital
investment target. Ofwat published its draft
decisions in August 2004 and plans to finalise
these in December 2004. Its decisions will be based
partly on the water companies’ water resource
plans for 2004. These annual plans of water supply
and demand are reviewed each year by the
Environment Agency.
About a quarter of households and around 90 per
cent of commercial and industrial customers were
charged for water on a metered basis in 2003.
Most homes are still charged according to the
rateable value of their property. All water
companies supply and install free meters to
households on request. In 2004/05, the average
unmeasured bill for water is £122 and, for
sewerage, it is £136. The average measured bill is
£101 for water and £121 for sewerage.
The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) is
responsible for ensuring that water companies in
England and Wales supply safe wholesome water,
and comply with the requirements of the relevant
Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations. New
Regulations were introduced in 2000 for England
and 2001 for Wales, and came fully into force on
1 January 2004. In 2003 (the final year of
reporting against the previous Regulations), 99.88
per cent of the 2.9 million tests carried out on
drinking water samples taken in England and
Wales met national and EU quality standards. The
new Regulations were introduced to reflect the
requirements of an EC Directive on drinking
water quality, which included meeting new and
revised standards by December 2003.
The UN World Water Development Report,
published in March 2003, found that the United
Kingdom had the fourth best water quality of
122 selected countries, behind Finland, Canada
and New Zealand.
New regulatory arrangements
The Water Act 2003 (see page 298) commits the
Government to the sustainable management and
use of water resources in England and Wales. It
8 The 2000-05 programme includes tightening sewage effluent
quality standards to improve river estuaries and coastal waters,
reducing the impact of storm overflows from the sewerage system
and renovating iron water mains to reduce discoloured water.
updates the framework for abstraction licensing,
and aims to promote greater water conservation
and planning for the future by water companies.
Licensing changes will be introduced in 2005,
drought plans are expected to become statutory in
2005, and water resources plans in 2007/08. A new
regime for competition in the water industry will
allow licensees to supply non-household
customers who use more than 50 megalitres a year.
The Act establishes a new regulatory authority for
the water industry in England and Wales, which
will be known as the Water Services Regulation
Authority (WSRA) and will be set up on 1 April
2006. The post of Director General of Water
Services will be abolished, though the new
Authority may still commonly be known as Ofwat.
The Act also abolishes existing customer services
committees, which will be replaced by a new
independent Consumer Council for Water
(CCW). This will begin work on 1 October 2005.
Water conservation
Targets are set each year for water companies in
England and Wales to reduce leakage. In 2003/04,
3,650 Ml/d of water put into the supply were lost
through leakage - 30 per cent lower than in the
peak year of 1994/95, but about the same as in
2002/03.
The Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme for water
technologies was launched in July 2003 to provide
tax incentives for companies investing in
designated technologies that save water and
improve water quality, while the Market
Transformation Programme (see page 300)
encourages products that use less water.
Envirowise (see page 300) offers free advice and
information on reducing water use in business.
Scotland
Scottish Water was created from the merger of the
three former water authorities in Scotland as a
result of the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002. It
is the fourth largest water service provider in the
United Kingdom, supplying about 2.4 billion litres
of water a day and serving just under 5 million
customers with drinking water. It also provides
sewerage services.
Scottish Water is a public sector organisation
accountable to three regulatory bodies: the Water
Industry Commissioner for Scotland; the Scottish

Environment Protection Agency; and the Drinking
Water Quality Regulator for Scotland.
Northern Ireland
The Water Service is an executive agency of the
Department for Regional Development (DRD).
It is responsible for the supply and distribution
of drinking water and the provision of sewerage
services to over 765,000 domestic, agricultural,
commercial and business customers.
The Water Service envisages that expenditure of
around £3 billion will be required over 15 to 20
years to bring water and sewerage services up to
standard and to meet increasing demand. It plans
to invest £590 million over the three-year period
to 2006. In 2003, 99.31 per cent of the 98,920 tests
carried out on drinking water in Northern Ireland
met national and EU quality standards.
A major programme of reform will move
Northern Ireland’s water and sewerage services
onto a fully self-financing basis by the end of the
decade and relocate responsibility for the delivery
of these services outside central government. New
arrangements for the economic regulation of the
Northern Ireland water industry and consumer
representation on water and sewerage issues are
also planned.
Non-energy minerals
Output of non-energy minerals in 2002 was
294.1 million tonnes, valued at £2.5 billion. The
total number of employees in the extractive
industry in Great Britain was around 24,000.
The United Kingdom is virtually self-sufficient in
construction minerals, and produces and exports
several industrial minerals, notably china clay, ball
clay, potash and salt. Over 90 per cent of non¬
energy minerals extracted in Great Britain each
year are used to supply the construction industry
with materials. Production of china clay (or
kaolin), the largest export, was 2.1 million tonnes
in 2003, of which 89 per cent was exported. The
Boulby potash mine in north-east England is the
most important UK non-energy mineral operation.
Production in 2003 was a record 1.04 million
tonnes, of which some 62 per cent was exported.

The largest non-energy mineral imports are non-
metallic mineral products (£5.7 billion, of which
rough diamonds accounted for £3.1 billion),
refined non-ferrous metals (£3.4 billion), iron
and steel (£2.4 billion) and ores, concentrates
and scrap (valued at £1.6 billion in 2002).
Aggregates levy
The aggregates levy is an environmental tax on
the commercial exploitation of aggregates in the
United Kingdom. It was introduced in 2002 at
£1.60 a tonne on the extraction of sand, gravel and
rock. The object is to reduce the demand for such
aggregates and encourage the use of recycled
materials, thereby reducing the environmental
costs associated with quarrying operations.
The Government has recognised the special
position of processed product manufacturers in
Northern Ireland - due to the land boundary with
the Republic of Ireland - by introducing the
Aggregates Levy Credit Scheme. Provided they
adhere to a code of good environmental practice,
operators may be eligible for an 80 per cent relief
from the full rate of the levy for virgin materials
and processed products until March 2011. The
scheme is administered by the Department of
the Environment for HM Customs and Excise.

This chapter covers the UK service sector,
although some areas, such as public services and
telecommunications, are covered in other chapters.
The sector is the main contributor to economic
growth in the United Kingdom, accounting for 73
per cent of gross value added (GVA - see glossary)
at current basic prices in 2003. The sector
expanded by 2.5 per cent during the year (Table
29.1), slightly below the 2.7 per cent growth in
2002. There were over 23.5 million workforce jobs
in the sector in December 2003, representing 79
per cent of all jobs.

The financial services sector accounted for over
5 per cent of GVA in the United Kingdom in 2003
and for 1.05 million employee jobs.
London is one of the three main financial centres
in the world, along with New York and Tokyo, and
is the premier financial centre in Europe. Major
financial institutions and markets include the
Bank of England, the London Stock Exchange and
Lloyd’s insurance market. Scotland (Edinburgh
and Glasgow) is the second financial centre in the
United Kingdom, and one of the main European
centres for institutional fund management
- £327 billion of funds were under management
in Scotland at the end of 2003. Other sizeable UK
financial centres are Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds
and Manchester. International Financial Services
London (IFSL) promotes the international
activities of UK-based financial institutions and
professional and business services. It also seeks
to raise awareness of the leading UK role in
international financial markets and highlight the
major contribution of financial services to the
UK economy.
Bank of England
The Bank of England (see also page 348 and 466)
has close links with financial markets and
institutions, and is responsible for maintaining
461

stability in the financial system. It analyses and
promotes initiatives to strengthen the system,
monitors developments to try to identify potential
threats to stability, and undertakes work on the
arrangements for handling financial crises should
they occur. It is also the financial system's 'lender
of last resort' in exceptional circumstances. In this
work, the Bank co-operates closely with HM
Treasury and the Financial Services Authority
(FSA, see page 471).
In addition, the Bank provides banking services to
its customers, principally the Government, the
banking system and other central banks. It plays a
key role in payment and settlement systems, and
manages the country’s foreign exchange reserves
on behalf of HM Treasury.
Banking
The UK banking sector is the third largest in
the world after the United States and Japan. In
addition to having one of the largest commercial
banking industries, the United Kingdom is also
a major international centre for investment and
private banking. The substantial presence of
foreign banks underlines the banking sector’s
international outlook. Its assets and liabilities
totalled £4,160 billion at the end of 2003, nearly
three times the level in 1993. Foreign banks
accounted for over half of the banking sector’s
assets, and 287 of the 382 banks operating in the
United Kingdom in 2003 were foreign-owned.
‘Retail’ banking primarily caters for personal
customers and small businesses. Nearly all banks
also engage in some ‘wholesale’ activities, which
involve taking larger deposits, deploying funds in
money-market instruments, and making corporate
loans and investments, while some concentrate on
wholesale business. Banks feature among the
United Kingdom’s top companies (see page 360)
- three of the top ten companies by market
capitalisation in March 2004 were banks: HSBC,
Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays.
Retail bank services include current accounts,
savings accounts, loan arrangements, credit and
debit cards, mortgages, insurance, investment
products, share-dealing services and ‘wealth
management’ services. Around 92 per cent of
households in the United Kingdom have at least
one adult member with a bank or building society
or other savings account (Table 29.2).

The universal banking programme, giving access
to basic bank accounts and a Post Office card
account, became available through post offices in
2003. These services are intended to tackle
financial exclusion and bring those people withdut
bank accounts into the financial mainstream,
while ensuring that benefit recipients and
pensioners can continue to receive their money in
cash at their local post office when such payments
are automated. Automated payment arrangements
commenced in April 2003 and will be completed
by October 2005. The major financial institutions
have agreed to contribute by making their own
basic bank accounts accessible at post offices and
by making a contribution of £182 million to the
cost of running the Post Office card account.
By the end of 2003, 1.38 million of the 5.04
million basic bank accounts in the United
Kingdom were accessible at the Post Office.
The major retail banks have traditionally operated
through local branches, but technological
developments are having a major impact on the
way in which banking is conducted. Between 1993
and 2003, the number of branches in the United
Kingdom fell by one-quarter to 11,100. Electronic
delivery channels, including automated teller
462
UK 2005
29 Services
machines (ATMs), Internet banking, corporate
electronic banking, interactive TV and mobile
phone banking, have all gained in importance in
recent years. The number of ATMs has more than
doubled over the past decade (see page 465). The
United Kingdom is the largest market for online
banking in Europe, with over 8 million adults
accessing online banking websites in 2002.
Supervision
The FSA (see page 471) is responsible for
regulating banks. Banks are required to meet
minimum standards on the integrity and
competence of directors and management, the
adequacy of capital and cash flow, and the systems
and controls to deal with the risks they experience.
Should a bank fail to meet these criteria, its
activities may be restricted, or it may be closed.
These arrangements are intended to strengthen,
but not guarantee, the protection of bank
depositors, thereby increasing confidence in the
banking system as a whole.
The Banking Code is an additional, voluntary
arrangement, setting out the relationship between
banks and building societies and their customers.
The independent Banking Code Standards Board
assesses compliance with the Code. A review of
the Code began in January 2004 and will continue
until autumn 2004, with a new version coming
into effect from March 2005.
Investment and private banking
London is a major international financial centre
for investment banking, accounting for an
estimated 50 per cent of such activity in Europe.
Although the United Kingdom is the source of
around a quarter of European investment banking
fee revenue, around half of European banking
activity is conducted through London, and the
majority of investment banks have either a
headquarters or a major office in the City.
Global investment banking revenue increased by a
fifth in 2003 to reach US$40.7 billion but this was
still over a quarter below the 2000 peak. In 2003,
the United Kingdom accounted for 27 per cent of
the US$11.4 billion earned by the investment
banking industry in Europe.
Investment banks offer a range of professional
financial services, including corporate finance and
asset management. Advice on mergers and
acquisitions accounted for 59 per cent of
investment banking revenue originating in the
United Kingdom in 2003.
Building societies
Building societies are mutual institutions, owned
by, and run for, their members. As well as their
retail deposit-taking services, they specialise in
housing finance, making long-term mortgage
loans against the security of property - usually
private dwellings purchased for owner-occupation.
In recent years, a number of building societies
have diversified and now offer a wide range of
personal financial services. The chief requirements
for societies are that:
■ their principal purpose is making loans which
are secured on residential property and are
funded substantially by their members;
■ at least 75 per cent of lending has to be on the
security of housing; and
■ a minimum of 50 per cent of funds must be
in the form of deposits made by individual
members.
In May 2004 there were 63 building societies in the
United Kingdom, all of which were members of
the Building Societies Association (BSA). The
number of societies has fallen from 273 in 1980
as a result of mergers. In addition, several large
societies have given up their mutual status and
become banks. Many of the remaining societies
have taken steps to defend their mutual status, for
example by requiring new members to assign to
charity any ‘windfall’ payments arising from a
conversion.
Total assets at the end of 2003 amounted to over
£205 billion. Building societies employed over
43,000 staff in head offices and had 2,081
branches. They had almost 21 million savings
accounts issued to around 15 million savers, and
had issued approximately 2.7 million mortgages to
about 2.5 million borrowers.
The largest society is the Nationwide, with group
assets of £101 billion in April 2004, followed by
the Britannia and Yorkshire (£21 billion and
£14 billion respectively at end-2003).
National Savings and Investments
National Savings and Investments (NS&I) is an
executive agency reporting to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer. It is a source of finance for
government borrowing, offering personal savers a
463
29 Services
UK 2005
range of savings and investments. The Finance Act
2003 included a number of provisions in respect of
NS&I. For example, it can issue plastic cards so
that customers can make cash withdrawals from
ATM machines (see box).
Closure of NS&I Ordinary Account
On 31 July 2004 the NS&I Ordinary Account was
closed after more than 140 years. It was
originally introduced in 1861, the year National
Savings (then known as the Post Office Savings
Bank) was founded by the Government to
encourage workers to 'provide for themselves
against adversity and ill health'. The account has
been replaced by the Easy Access Savings
Account, launched in January 2004, in response
to changing customer needs, offering increased
access and consistent and competitive interest
rates. The new account comes with an ATM card
for cash machines.
Gross sales of NS&I products (including accrued
interest) were £12.7 billion in 2003/04 and £66.5
billion was invested in NS&I products at March
2004. Savings products include Premium Bonds,
which offer tax-free prizes instead of interest in a
monthly draw, Savings Certificates (both Fixed
Interest and Index-linked), Pensioners Guaranteed
Income Bonds, Capital Bonds, Children’s Bonus
Bonds, cash mini ISAs (see page 469), Investment
Accounts (where deposits can be made at post
offices) and Guaranteed Equity Bonds, where the
investor’s return is linked to the performance of
the FTSE 100 index (see page 470).
Friendly societies
Friendly societies are mutual organisations - set
up and owned by their members and run for their
benefit - providing a wide range of savings,
assurance, insurance and healthcare products,
often tax-free. The representative trade body for
the United Kingdom is the Association of Friendly
Societies. In March 2004, 2,377 societies (including
branches) were registered under the Friendly
Societies Acts 1974 and 1992, according to the
Mutual Societies Registrar.
Credit unions
Credit unions are financial co-operatives,
established under the Credit Unions Act 1979,
owned and controlled by their members, who save
in a common fund. The money saved is used to
make low-interest loans to other credit union
members. The Association of British Credit
Unions Ltd is the main trade association in Great
Britain. In the year ending September 2003, 444
credit unions were registered, with membership
of about 365,000 and savings balances of around
£293 million. In Northern Ireland credit unions
are served by the Irish League of Credit Unions,
which covers the whole of Ireland.
Responsibility for registration and supervision of
credit unions lies with the FSA (see page 471).
Credit unions must meet a basic test of solvency
and maintain a level of initial capital and a
minimum liquidity ratio. Members have
protection for their deposits through the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme (see page 472).
Private equity/venture capital
Private equity/venture capital companies offer
medium- and long-term equity financing for new
and developing businesses, management buy-outs
and buy-ins, and company rescues. The British
Venture Capital Association (BVCA) represents
private equity and venture capital sources in the
United Kingdom. According to its report on
investment activity (based on data provided by
165 firms that were then members), worldwide
investment by UK private equity and venture
capital firms increased by 16 per cent in 2003 to
£6.4 billion. Of this, £4.1 billion (64 per cent) was
in the United Kingdom. The Government has
encouraged the development of venture capital,
including Regional Venture Capital Funds.
Other credit and financial services
Finance houses and leasing companies provide
consumer credit, business finance and leasing, and
motor finance. There are 107 full and 75 associate
members of the Finance and Leasing Association,
achieving new business worth £90 billion in 2003,
of which £65 billion was credit granted to private
individuals. Factoring and invoice discounting
companies offer a range of financial services,
including credit management and finance against a
company’s outstanding invoices. Member companies
of the Factors & Discounters Association handled
business worth £117 billion in 2003,13 per cent
higher than in 2002, of which £95 billion was
domestic invoice discounting.

Payment systems
Apart from credit and debit card arrangements,
three companies manage the major UK payment
clearing systems:
■ Cheque and Credit Clearing Company,
responsible for the bulk clearing of cheques
and paper credits throughout Great Britain -
cheque and credit payments in Northern
Ireland are processed locally;
■ CHAPS (Clearing House Automated Payment
System), an electronic transfer system for
same-day payments from bank to bank; and
■ BAGS Payment Schemes Ltd, managing the
schemes under which bulk payments are made.
The UK trade association for payments is the
Association for Payment Clearing Services
(APACS). A total of 33 banks and building
societies belonged to APACS at the end of June
2004, while several hundred others obtain access
to one or all of the clearings through agency
arrangements with one of the members.
In March 2004, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)
announced the establishment of a new Banking
Payment System Task Force to consider
competition, efficiency and incentive issues
relating to payment systems. The creation of the
Task Force followed the publication of the
Government’s Pre-Budget report in December
2003, which said that the OFT would take on an
enhanced role on payments systems for four years.
The Government would review competition in the
industry at the end of the four-year period and
would legislate unless there had been a significant
improvement.
Trends in financial transactions
The nature of financial transactions has
undergone major changes since the first plastic
cards appeared in 1966. Most small non-regular
payments are still made by cash, but there is a
trend away from cheques towards greater use of
plastic cards (Table 29.3).
Consumers now acquire more than half their cash
through withdrawals from ATMs, which in 2003
dispensed £144 billion in 2.4 billion transactions.
About two-thirds of adults use ATMs regularly,
making on average 70 withdrawals a year.
In 2003, direct debit and standing order payments
accounted for 62 per cent of regular bill payments,
and 73 per cent of adults have set up at least one
direct debit or standing order. Many mortgage
and other loan repayments and life insurance
contributions are made by this means, as are the
majority of utility and council tax bills.
Direct debit payments rose by 6 per cent to
reach 2.4 billion in 2003.
Plastic cards
According to APACS, there were 160 million
plastic cards in issue in 2003 and 7.8 billion plastic
card transactions in the United Kingdom.

Debit card payments are deducted directly from
the purchaser’s bank or building society account.
The number of transactions grew by over 12 per
cent to nearly 3.4 billion in 2003. Less than
£18 billion of goods and services were paid for by
debit card in 1993. By 2003, this figure had grown
to over £130 billion.

UK 2005
At the end of 2003 there were 66.8 million credit
cards and 4.4 million charge cards in use in the
United Kingdom. They are the most common way
for adults to buy goods and services using the
Internet. Of the 200 million online transactions,
69 per cent are made by credit card.
According to figures from APACS, UK plastic card
fraud fell for the first time in eight years in 2003,
to £402 million from £425 million in 2002.
However, the fall was entirely due to a reduction
in the amount of fraud committed abroad on UK
cards, whereas for UK-based transactions there
was a very slight increase. Counterfeit card fraud
saw the largest reduction in 2003, down by 28 per
cent to £107 million. The bulk of the reduction
occurred in mainland Europe, where it was down
by £26 million on 2002. To combat fraud, banks
are investing in new systems, in which information
is contained on a microchip embedded in cards.
By 2005 the majority of transactions involving
credit and debit cards will involve chip and PIN
(personal identification number) cards.
Banknotes and coins
The Bank of England is the sole issuer of currency
notes in England and Wales, and although banks
in Scotland and Northern Ireland1 issue their own
notes, there is a legal framework which stipulates
the conditions under which these need to be
covered, pound for pound, by Bank of England
notes or other assets. Net profits from the Bank of
England note issue are paid over to the Government.
The provision of UK coinage is the responsibility
of the Royal Mint, based at Llantrisant, south
Wales. At the end of 2003 there were an estimated
25.7 billion coins in circulation in the United
Kingdom, with a face value of £3.15 billion. The
number of coins issued during 2003/04 amounted
to 1.8 billion.
Insurance
The UK insurance industry is the largest in Europe
and the third largest in the world. It employs
348,000 people, a third of all financial services
jobs, and accounts for 17 per cent of investment in
the stock market. It pays out £281 million a day in
1 In Scotland these comprise the Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of
Scotland and Clydesdale Bank, and in Northern Ireland the Bank
of Ireland, First Trust Bank, Northern Bank and Ulster Bank.

pension and life insurance benefits and
£47 million a day in general insurance claims.
The UK insurance industry generated net
worldwide premiums of £159 billion in 2003,
according to the Association of British Insurers
(ABI). UK risks were £124 billion and overseas
risks £35 billion. The industry has over
£1,150 billion invested in company shares and
other assets.
Main types of insurance
Insurance can be long-term, such as life insurance,
pensions and savings, where contracts may be for
many years; and general, such as motor, household
and commercial insurance, where contracts are
usually for up to one year only. Most insurance
companies reinsure their risks; this performs an
important function in spreading losses and in
helping companies manage their businesses.
UK long-term insurance accounted for
£118 billion of net worldwide premiums by the
UK industry in 2003, compared with £41 billion
of general insurance. Life insurance accounted for
31 per cent of long-term premium income,
occupational pensions 39 per cent and individual
pensions 27 per cent. About 50 per cent of
households have life insurance cover.
Motor insurance accounts for over a third of UK
company market general insurance premiums.
Other important areas are property insurance,
and accident and health insurance. Independent
466
UK 2005
29 Services
intermediaries distributed 55 per cent of general
insurance premiums in 2003, direct selling 21 per
cent, banks and building societies 8 per cent, and
company agents 7 per cent. Direct selling in motor
insurance has increased, reflecting the growth of
insurers offering telephone-based and Internet-
based services.
Structure of the industry
At the end of 2003, 768 companies were
authorised to conduct insurance business in the
United Kingdom. Nearly three-quarters of these
companies carry on general business only. About
400 companies belong to the ABI. The industry
includes both public limited companies and
mutOal institutions (companies owned by their
policyholders), although the mutual sector has
gradually contracted. The biggest insurance group
in the United Kingdom in 2003 was Aviva, with
net premium income of around £14 billion.
In March 2004, Standard Life, the biggest mutual
insurance company in Europe, announced that
it planned to abandon its mutual status and seek
a stock market listing. The company has been
adversely affected by stock market falls and a
declining market for its with-profits policies. The
decision to consider listing is part of a strategic
review after talks with the ESA over how to meet
new solvency requirements.
Insurance firms and markets have been affected by
weak equity markets and by events such as the
destruction of the New York World Trade Centre
in 2001. At the time, the ESA relaxed some of its
requirements on solvency to ease the position for
insurance companies. Its prime focus now is on
introducing a new capital regime requiring
companies to hold sufficient financial resources
that more adequately reflect the risks they
underwrite. This means that life insurance
companies are better able to meet their
responsibilities to policyholders and absorb any
market falls that may occur.
Equitable Life, the world's oldest mutual life
assurer, experienced particular problems arising
from guarantees offered to a number of its
policyholders and closed to new business in
December 2000. HM Treasury appointed Lord
Penrose to lead an inquiry into the history of th£
Equitable, and to find out who was to blame, what
lessons could be learned and whether there was a
failure by the regulatory authorities. The Penrose
report, published in March 2004, found that the
balance of blame lay more with Equitable than
with its regulators. In response to the inquiry, the
Government announced an independent review of
the actuarial profession, with a wide-ranging remit
to examine the profession and the Government
Actuary’s Department. The review, which will
build on the work of the Myners review of
institutional investment (see page 468), will report
by spring 2005. The Government has also
announced a review led by Paul Myners into the
corporate governance arrangements applicable to
mutual life offices. This review is due to report by
the end of 2004.
The London Market
The London Insurance Market (London Market)
is a distinct part of the UK insurance and
reinsurance industry centred in the City of
London. It is the main centre for reinsurance
business and for energy, marine, aviation, satellite
and other forms of transport insurance. It
comprises insurance and reinsurance companies,
Lloyd’s syndicates, Protection and Indemnity clubs
(mutual insurers for shipowners) and brokers who
handle most of the business. The business traded
is mainly non-life (general) insurance and
reinsurance, with an increasing emphasis on high-
exposure risks.
Estimated gross premiums of the London Market
from reported returns were £24.6 billion in 2002.
Virtually all companies participating in the
company sector are members of the International
Underwriting Association of London (IUA), which
in May 2004 had 42 ordinary members. Over
three-quarters of companies operating in the
London Market are overseas-owned.
Lloyd's of London
Lloyd’s of London is the world’s leading insurance
market, with a capacity to accept premiums of
£14.9 billion in 2004. It provides insurance
services to businesses and individuals in more
than 190 countries. In 2004, 66 syndicates were
underwriting insurance at Lloyd’s, covering many
speciality areas including marine, aviation,
catastrophe, professional indemnity and motor.
Syndicates, staffed by underwriters, compete for
business and cover either all or a portion of the
risk. They are run by managing agents who have a
franchise to operate within the Lloyd’s market.

29 Services
UK 2005
Lloyd’s is administered by the Council of Lloyd’s
and a Franchise Board. In 2003, it reported a profit
of £1.9 billion on an annually accounted basis, and
an initial projection of profit of £1.8 billion on a
three-year accounted basis for the 2003
underwriting year. In addition, the net resources of
the society and its members increased by 35 per
cent to £10.1 billion at the end of 2003.
Investment
The United Kingdom has considerable expertise in
fund management, which involves managing funds
on behalf of investors, or advising them how best
to invest their money. The main institutional
groups and asset types are shown in Table 29.5.
The assets of these institutions were valued at
£1,652 billion at the end of 2002, compared with
£1,838 billion at the end of the previous year.

driving changes in investment decision¬
making by occupational pension schemes.
The review will inform future decisions on
the need for further action; and
■ in May 2004, the FSA announced the results
of a review of the practice of ‘soft
commissions’ (whereby a broker agrees to pay
for the supply of services from a third party
to a fund manager in return for an agreed
volume of business at an agreed commission
rate) and ‘bundling’ (the provision by brokers
of other in-house services, such as research,
together with dealing in securities in a single
commission charge) of transaction costs by
brokers, following discussions of these issues
in the Myners report. The FSA agreed with
the Myners report that these practices create
conflicts of interest for fund managers and
said it would seek to limit the scope for both
bundling and charging soft commissions.
Pension funds
At the end of 2002, total identified assets of UK
self-administered pension funds amounted to
£611 billion, compared with £714 billion at the
end of 2001. Pension funds are major investors in
securities markets, holding around 20 per cent of
securities listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Funds are managed mainly by the investment
management houses.
Unit trusts and open-ended investment
companies (OEICs)
Authorised unit trusts pool investors’ money in
funds divided into units of equal size, enabling
people with relatively small amounts of money
to benefit from diversified and professionally
managed portfolios. Unit trusts can invest in a
468
UK 2005
29 Services
range of asset classes, such as equities, cash and
bonds, and most have a geographical theme, such
as the United Kingdom and North America.
However, there are also specialist funds with
a sector focus such as property or
telecommunications. OEICs, set up in 1997, are
similar to unit trusts, but investors buy shares in
the fund rather than units.
At the end of June 2004 there were 1,925 UK
authorised unit trusts and OEICs. There were 124
fund management companies, of which 75 were
OEIC providers. Total funds under management
were valued at £250 billion in June 2004, 16 per
cent higher than in June 2003, including
£158 billion of funds in OEICs. In June 2004
Personal Equity Plans accounted for £37 billion
and Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) for £34
billion. The Investment Management Association
represents the UK asset management industry.
Investment trusts
Investment trusts are companies that invest in the
shares of other companies. They are listed on the
London Stock Exchange and their shares can be
bought and sold in the same way as for other
companies. Assets are purchased mainly out of
shareholders’ funds, although investment trusts are
also allowed to borrow money for investment.
At the end of March 2004, there were 351
investment trusts, forming the largest listed sector
of the London Stock Exchange, with assets worth
£58 billion and market capitalisation of
£44 billion. Members of the Association of
Investment Trust Companies accounted for 249
of the total listed trust companies.
Share ownership
Results from the ONS Share Ownership Survey for
2003 (Table 29.6) indicate that nearly half of all
ordinary shares listed on the UK Stock Exchange
were owned by UK insurance companies, pension
funds and other institutional shareholders. About
24 per cent of households in the United Kingdom
have at least one adult owning shares (Table 29.2).
Tax-free savings
Tax-free saving is encouraged by Individual
Savings Accounts (ISAs), launched in 1999 for an
initial ten-year period as the successor to Personal
Equity Plans (PEPs) and TESSAs (Tax Exempt
Special Savings Accounts). Until April 2006, £7,000

can be invested every tax year. There are three
main elements of an ISA:
■ cash - up to £3,000 each year - such as in a
bank or building society ISA account;
■ stocks and shares - up to £7,000 a year in a
maxi ISA and £3,000 in a mini ISA (see
below); and
■ life insurance - up to £1,000 a year.
In addition, savers can roll over capital from a
matured TESSA into a cash ISA or a special
TESSA-only ISA.
There are two main types of ISA: a maxi ISA,
which can include all three elements in an ISA
with a single manager up to the value of £7,000;
and a mini ISA, which allows savers to have
different managers, for the cash, stocks and shares,
and life insurance components up to the value of
£7,000. Savers can choose to put money into a
mini ISA or a maxi ISA, but not both, in each tax
year. Subscriptions are shown in Table 29.7.
Financial markets
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange is one of the three
great financial centres of the world (along with
469
29 Services
UK 2005
New York and Tokyo). Founded in 1801, it is the
most international market in terms of the equities
traded on the exchange and it is the leading
provider of equity market services in Europe. A
market for smaller, fast-growing companies -
AIM, the Alternative Investment Market - opened
in 1995. Within the Main Market of the London
Stock Exchange, two ‘attribute markets’ have been
launched - in 1999, techMARK, a market for
innovative technology companies, followed in
2001 by techMARK mediscience, the world’s first
international market for healthcare companies.
The number of companies operating in these ■
markets and the equity market value of each is
shown in Table 29.8.
A range of indices track share price movements on
the Stock Exchange. The most widely quoted is the
FTSE 100 index (the ‘Footsie’), which relates to the
100 largest UK companies, by market
capitalisation, listed on the Exchange. Figure 29.9
shows monthly closing levels for the FTSE 100
since its inception in January 1984.
Several other products for raising capital are
handled, including Eurobonds, warrants,
depositary receipts and gilt-edged stock (see page
370). The London Stock Exchange provides a
secondary or trading market where investors can
buy or sell UK Government securities (gilts). The
Government raised £53 billion through issues of
gilts on the Exchange in 2003.
Other equity exchanges

OFEX and OM London. A new equities derivatives
business, EDX London Ltd, jointly owned by the
London Stock Exchange and OM AB, began
trading Scandinavian equity derivatives in 2003.
Bond markets
London is at the centre of the Euromarket (a
major market in a variety of currencies lent
UK 2005
29 Services
outside their domestic markets) and houses most
of the leading international banks and securities
firms. According to IFSL, bookrunners based in
London are estimated to account for about 60 per
cent of the primary and 70 per cent of the
secondary market in Eurobonds.
Foreign exchange market
A Bank for International Settlements (BIS) survey
in April 2004 showed that daily foreign exchange
turnover in the United Kingdom was US$753
billion and that London was the world’s biggest
trading centre, handling over 31 per cent of global
net daily turnover. Dealing is conducted by
telephone and electronic links between the banks,
other financial institutions and a number of firms
of foreign exchange brokers which act as
intermediaries. Electronic trading accounts for
55 per cent of foreign exchange activity.
Bullion markets
London is the world’s most liquid ‘spot’
(immediate) market for gold and the global
clearing centre for gold and silver. Around 60
banks and other financial trading companies
participate in the London gold and silver markets.
World gold prices are fixed twice a day and the
world silver price once a day in London, through
the members of the London Bullion Market
Association.
Derivatives
Financial derivatives, including ‘futures’ and
‘options’, offer a means of protection against
changes in prices, exchange rates and interest
rates. Futures and options contracts can be traded
on an exchange or over-the-counter (OTC). The
United Kingdom is the most important OTC
market place, as measured by booking location.
According to the BIS, the UK share of world
turnover represented average daily turnover of
US$643 billion in April 2004, compared with
US$275 billion in 2001.
Euronext.liffe is the international derivatives
business of Euronext, comprising the Amsterdam,
Brussels, LIFFE, Lisbon and Paris derivatives
markets. It is the world’s leading exchange for euro
short-term interest rate derivatives and equity
options. Euronext.liffe is creating a single market
for derivatives, by bringing all its derivatives
products together on a single electronic trading
platform LIFFE CONNECT. The exchange traded
695 million futures and options contracts in
2003, representing an underlying value of
€251 trillion. In the first half of 2004, volume
was up 24 per cent on the first half of 2003, to
438 million contracts with an underlying value of
€157 trillion.
Other exchanges
Other important City exchanges include:
■ the London Metal Exchange (LME) - the
primary non-ferrous metals market in the
world, trading contracts in aluminium,
aluminium alloy, copper, lead, nickel, tin and
zinc. It traded 72.3 million futures and
options lots in 2003;
■ the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE),
a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange Inc
of the United States, and Europe’s leading
energy futures and options exchange. Over
US$2 billion in underlying value is traded
each day on the IPE; and
■ the Baltic Exchange, the world’s premier
maritime market.
The LCH.Clearnet Group - formed by a merger
between the London Clearing House and Clearnet
S.A. in December 2003 - clears and settles business
at the LSE, EDX London, Euronext.liffe, LME, IPE
and Virt-x.
Regulation
Financial Services Authority
The Financial Services Authority (FSA)is the
independent body that regulates the UK financial
services industry. The Government established the
ESA in 1997, and the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000, which came into effect in 2001,
gave the ESA statutory powers to regulate the
industry. A new single Financial Services
Compensation Scheme and a single Financial
Ombudsman Service were also set up (see page
472). The FSA is the single statutory regulator
responsible for the authorisation and supervision
of deposit taking (such as by banks), insurance
and the investment business. In October 2004
it will become responsible for regulation of
mortgages, followed in January 2005 by general
insurance regulation.
The FSA’s key objectives are to maintain
confidence in and promote public understanding
471
29 Services
UK 2005
of the UK financial system; secure the right degree
of protection for consumers; and help to reduce
financial crime.
The FSA monitors advertising and marketing of
investment products such as pensions, ISAs,
bonds, unit trusts and OEICs. Coverage will be
extended to mortgages from October 2004. The
FSA has set up a hotline for the public and firms
to report misleading advertisements for financial
products.
The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (see page 63)
gives a general right of access by the public to
information held by public authorities, sets out
exemptions from that right of access and places a
number of obligations on public authorities. The
Government has made the FSA a public authority
for these purposes. The Independent Information
Commissioner confirmed approval of the FSA
publication scheme in January 2004.
Compensation
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme
(FSCS) pays compensation if an authorised firm is
unable, or likely to be unable, to pay claims against
it. The Scheme was set up under the terms of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. It is an
independent, non-profit-making organisation and
covers deposits, insurance and investments.
Financial Ombudsman Service
The Financial Ombudsman Service provides
consumers with a free, independent service for
resolving disputes with financial firms. It considers
complaints about a wide range of financial matters
from firms in the insurance, mortgage, pensions
and investments business.
Non-financial services
Non-fmancial services covered in this chapter
include the motor, wholesale and retail trades;
hotels, restaurants and catering; travel agents and
tour operators; real estate, renting, computer and
related activities, such as software consultancy;
business services, such as market research, business
and management consultancy and advertising; and
tourism. See Table 22.5 on page 351 for the
contribution these industries make to the UK
economy.
Table 29.10 shows turnover for a range of non-
fmancial services. Computer and related activities
and the motor trades showed the greatest increase
in 2003. The United Kingdom is one of the world’s
major tourism destinations and spending on the
hotel and restaurant sector is strongly influenced
by the number of visitors coming from overseas.
The impact of the conflict in Iraq, weak economic
growth in Europe and the outbreak of Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome affected the tourism
industry across the world in 2003.

Distributive trades
Motor trades
In December 2003 there were 582,000 employee
jobs in the United Kingdom in retailing motor
vehicles and parts, and in petrol stations. Turnover
of the motor trades in Great Britain in 2003 was
£145 billion, 7 per cent higher than in 2002. Most
businesses selling new vehicles are franchised by
the motor manufacturers. Car sales have grown
strongly in recent years, with volumes reaching
record levels in 2003 for the third successive year.
At the end of 2003 there were 10,535 petrol
stations, 890 fewer than a year previously.
However, the number of supermarket sites
included in this total increased by 59 to 1,126.
Many petrol stations offer other retail services,
such as shops, car washes and fast-food outlets
(there were 708 ‘quick-serve’ restaurants at the end
of 2003). Oil company sites accounted for 66 per
cent of UK petrol stations in 2003.

Wholesaling and retailing
In 2003 over 106,000 enterprises were engaged in
wholesaling in the United Kingdom; 23 per cent
were sole proprietors and 14 per cent partnerships.
There were 1.1 million employee jobs in the
United Kingdom in this sector in December 2003.
Almost all large retailers in the food and drink
trade have their own buying and central
distribution operations. Many small wholesalers
and independent grocery retailers belong to
voluntary ‘symbol’ groups, which provide access to
central purchasing facilities and coordinated
promotions. This helps smaller retailers to remain
relatively competitive; many local and convenience
stores and village shops would otherwise not be
able to stay in business.
Retailing is the leading private sector service
industry in the United Kingdom, employing over
2.85 million people in March 2004 (around 11 per
cent of the workforce). In 2003 there were nearly
189,000 retail enterprises in the United Kingdom;
41 per cent were sole proprietors and 32 per cent
partnerships. The sector recorded £236 billion in
sales, or 34 per cent of total consumer spending.
The volume of retail sales in Great Britain rose
by over 16 per cent between 2000 and 2003 (Table
29.11). Growth in non-food stores (21 per cent)
was higher than in predominantly food stores
(12 per cent), with the greatest increase (29 per
cent) in textile, clothing and footwear stores.
Small independent retail businesses and co¬
operative societies have been in relative decline for
some time. To help their competitive position,

under the Sunday Trading Act 1994, small shops
(under 280 square metres) have no restrictions
on Sunday opening, while large shops (over 280
square metres) are restricted (except in Scotland)
to six hours only between 10.00 am and 6.00 pm.
In February 2004, the OFT published a review of
the Supermarkets Code of Practice, which found
a widespread belief among suppliers that the Code
is not working, although the OFT found no hard
evidence to support this view. The OFT has
commissioned further work to establish how
supermarkets deal with suppliers under the Code,
which was introduced in 2002 following a
Competition Commission report into supermarkets.
In April 2004, supermarket group Morrisons
re-opened the first of the stores to be converted
following its £3 billion takeover of Safeway in
March. The takeover gives Morrisons a greater
presence in southern England.
The Co-operative Group (CWS) Limited is the
largest UK mutual retail group, with total food
sales of £3 billion in 2003. As well as food
retailing, the Group’s operations include funeral
businesses, travel retailing, motor trading and
non-food department stores. The Co-operative
Group is the principal supplier of goods and
services to the Co-operative Movement -
comprising 42 independent retail societies and
3,246 stores. Retail co-operative societies are
voluntary organisations controlled by their
members, membership being open to anyone
paying a small deposit on a minimum share.
Franchising is the granting of a licence by one
company (the franchiser) to another (the
franchisee), usually by means of an initial payment
with continuing royalties. Franchised activities
operate in many areas, including cleaning services,
film processing, print shops, fitness centres,
courier delivery, car rental, engine tuning and
servicing, and fast-food retailing. About 260
franchisers are members of the British Franchise
Association (BFA), which conducts an annual
survey of franchising. Its findings for 2004
estimated that there were 695 franchisors, with
around 33,800 franchisees, accounting for about
330,000 jobs in the United Kingdom and with
annual turnover of £9.7 billion.
Shopping facilities
There are eight regional out-of-town shopping
centres in the United Kingdom, located at sites
473
29 Services
UK 2005
offering good road access and ample parking
facilities. Opened between 1985 and 1999, they
range in size from 56,000 square metres
(Braehead, near Glasgow) to 160,000 square
metres (Bluewater, in Kent, which is the largest
such development in Europe).
Since 1996, social, economic and environmental
considerations have led the Government and local
planning authorities to limit new retail
developments outside town centres. Out-of-town
superstores, retail warehouses and shopping
centres were felt to be undermining the vitality
and viability of existing town and district centres.
Government policy is now to focus new retail
development in existing centres and so revitalise
them. This is to ensure that everyone has easy
access to a range of shops and services, whether or
not they have a car; and to enable businesses of all
types and sizes to prosper.
All new retail development requires planning
permission from the local planning authority,
which must consult central government before
granting permission for most developments of
2,500 square metres or more.
Home shopping
Traditionally, all kinds of goods and services are
purchased through mail-order catalogues. The
largest-selling items are clothing, footwear,
furniture, household textiles and domestic
electrical appliances. Internet sales (see page 253)
and electronic home shopping have grown rapidly.
In 2002, 71 per cent of online sales of goods and
services by UK businesses in the non-financial
sector were in the wholesale, retail, catering, travel
and telecommunications sectors.
Hotels, restaurants and catering
There were 1.8 million employee jobs in the hotel
and restaurant trades in the United Kingdom in
December 2003. This includes pubs, wine bars
and other licensed bars, in addition to businesses
offering accommodation and prepared food.
Turnover in 2003 in Great Britain, at £62.0 billion,
was 4.9 per cent higher than in 2002.
In 2002 there were 54,340 enterprises in the
United Kingdom in the licensed restaurant
industry (including fast-food and takeaway
outlets), an increase of 3.2 per cent on 2001. Total
turnover in 2003 in Great Britain amounted to
£20.3 billion, 6.2 per cent higher than in 2002.
Real estate, renting and business
activities
Exhibition and conference centres
The United Kingdom is one of the world’s leading
centres for international conferences. Many UK
towns and cities have conference and exhibition
facilities, including several traditional seaside
resorts which have adapted to the growing
business tourism market.
Key exhibition venues include the National
Exhibition Centre and International Conference
Centre in Birmingham; ExCeL in London’s
Docklands; Earls Court and Olympia Exhibition
Centres and Wembley Exhibition Centre in
London; the Scottish Exhibition & Conference
Centre in Glasgow; and King’s Hall Exhibition
Centre in Belfast.
The Exhibition Venues Association represents
most of the leading exhibition complexes across
the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Association
of Exhibition Organisers represents many trade
and consumer event organisers, while the British
Exhibition Contractors Association represents the
interests of contractors. These three bodies tackle
issues of common concern through the Exhibition
Association Forum.
Total visitor attendance at exhibitions in 2003 fell
by 16 per cent, but was only 4 per cent lower than
in 2001. Including multiple exhibitions, there were
856 events in 2003, attracting 9.6 million visitors.
UK Trade & Investment (see page 385) provides
key funding towards development and
maintenance of the United Kingdom’s official
listing of all consumer, trade, public and industrial
exhibitions held in major UK venues.
Renting
A varied range of rental services, many of which are
franchised, are available across the United
Kingdom. These include hire of cars and other
vehicles; televisions, video recorders and
camcorders; household appliances such as washing
machines; tools and heavy decorating equipment
such as ladders and floor sanders; and videos,
DVDs and computer games. In the business sector
these services include renting of agricultural or civil
engineering machinery. Retailing of many types of
474
UK 2005
29 Services
service is dominated by chains, although
independent operators are still to be found in most
fields. In December 2003 there were 165,000
employee jobs in the United Kingdom in the rental
sector. Turnover in 2003 in Great Britain amounted
to £19.4 billion, 1.9 per cent higher than in 2002.
Computing and related activities
The computing software and services industry
comprises businesses engaged in software
development; systems integration; IT consultancy;
IT ‘outsourcing’; processing services; and the
provision of complete computer systems. It also
includes companies that provide IT education and
training; independent maintenance; support,
contingency planning and recruitment; and
contract staff. Intellect is the trade body for the
UK-based IT, telecommunications and electronics
industry.
In December 2003 there were 490,000 employee
jobs in computer and related activities in the
United Kingdom. Turnover of companies in this
sector in Great Britain amounted to £51.0 billion
in 2003, 12.0 per cent higher than in 2002. UK
firms and universities have established strong
reputations in software R&D and a number of
international IT conglomerates, such as Microsoft,
have set up R&D operations in the United
Kingdom. Academic expertise is especially evident
in such areas as artificial intelligence (AI), neural
networks, grid computing, formal programming
for safety-critical systems, and parallel
programming systems.
Software firms have developed strengths in sector-
specific applications, including systems for
retailing, banking, finance and accounting, the
medical and dental industries, and the travel and
entertainment industries. Specialist ‘niche’ markets
in which UK software producers are active include
AI, scientific and engineering software (especially
computer-aided design), mathematical software,
geographical information systems, and data
visualisation packages. Some firms specialise in
devising multimedia software. Distance learning,
‘virtual reality’ and computer animation all benefit
from a large pool of creative talent.
Many IT jobs have been outsourced to lower cost
bases overseas. In December 2003, for example, the
largest UK insurance group, Aviva, announced the
transfer of 2,350 administrative and IT jobs to
India.
Business services
In December 2003 the other business activities
sector accounted for 2.8 million employee jobs in
the United Kingdom. The sector includes market
research, business and management consultancy
activities and advertising. Turnover in 2003 in
Great Britain amounted to £168.4 billion, 6.3 per
cent higher than in 2002.
Market research
The British Market Research Association aims to
promote good practice in market research in the
United Kingdom and to cater for the professional
and trade needs of UK market research companies.
Its members’ turnover grew by 2.8 per cent in 2003
to an estimated £1.22 billion. UK-owned market
research companies include the largest
international customised market research
specialists. The top ten companies by turnover are
shown in Table 29.12.

One of the biggest users of software is the
telecommunications industry (see page 252). The
provision of almost all new telecommunications
services, including switching and transmission,
is dependent on software.
Management consultancy
The United Kingdom’s 70,000 management
consultants supply technical assistance and advice
to business and government clients. In 2003
revenues for the industry were estimated at
475
29 Services

£10 billion, with exports worth £1 billion. The 45
member firms of the Management Consultancies
Association, which accounts for roughly 60 per
cent of UK revenues, generated £5.8 billion in fee
income in 2003, nearly 23 per cent more than in
2002 (Table 29.13). Income from outsourcing
activities increased by 64 per cent and accounted

Advertising and public relations
The United Kingdom is a major centre for creative
advertising, and multinational companies often
use UK-created advertising for marketing their
products globally. UK agencies have strong foreign
links through overseas ownership and associate
networks. UK television advertising has received
many international awards. According to the
Advertising Association, total UK advertising
expenditure rose by 2.4 per cent in 2003 to
£17.2 billion (Table 29.14).
There were around 1,480 advertising agencies in
2003. As well as their creative, production and
media-buying roles, some offer integrated
marketing services, including consumer research
and public relations. Many agencies have
sponsorship departments, which arrange for

The UK public relations industry has developed
rapidly, and there are now a wide variety of
consultancy firms with different specialisms and
sizes. The Public Relations Consultants
Association membership accounts for 70 per cent
of UK fee income. It has over 130 members
generating more than £400 million each year in
fees from clients.
Travel and tourism
Overseas travel
Spain and France were the top countries visited by
UK residents in 2003 (Table 29.15). Long-haul
holidays have remained popular, despite recent
global events. The United States is still the top
long-haul destination, with the Caribbean,
Canada, Australia, India, South Africa and New
Zealand maintaining their popularity. A survey
carried out by the Association of British Travel
Agents (ABTA) in February 2004 found that
consumer confidence had returned to holiday

few large firms have hundreds of branches.
ABTA operates financial protection schemes to
safeguard customers and maintains a code of
conduct drawn up with the Office of Fair Trading.
It also offers a free consumer affairs service to help

Tourism in the UK
The total value of tourism in 2000 was estimated
to be nearly £90 billion (Table 29.16). Figures for
subsequent years will be available following
completion of the UK Tourism Satellite Account.2
The bulk of tourism services are provided by
131,000 mainly independent small businesses such
as hotels and guest houses, restaurants, holiday
homes, caravan and camping parks.

15 per cent in 2003.
The British Incoming Tour Operators Association
represents the commercial and political interests
of incoming tour operators and suppliers to the
British inbound tourism industry.
In 2003 total turnover in the travel agency and
tour operator businesses in Great Britain
amounted to £17.1 billion, 6.1 per cent lower than
in 2002. Around 6,500 high street travel agents

of 2.2 per cent on the previous year. The earnings
they generated increased by 1.1 per cent to £11.9
billion (Table 29.16). These figures are still below
2000 levels, but they suggest a continuing recovery
from the effects of the foot-and-mouth outbreak
and 11 September 2001. Holiday visits by overseas
visitors to the United Kingdom increased by
3.1 per cent in 2003. However, the number of
arrivals from North America fell, declining by
6.4 per cent in 2003 to 4.0 million, nearly
1 million below the levels recorded in 2000.
Arrivals from the EU continued to rise, by
4.7 per cent to 14.8 million in 2003.
Business travel, which includes attendance at
conferences, exhibitions, trade fairs and other
business sites, accounted for 28 per cent of all
overseas visits in 2003. The numbers of business
visitors declined slightly during the year, reflecting
the continuing weak state of the global economy
and in particular the economic slowdown in the rest
of the EU, which accounted for 60 per cent of
visitors. Around 71 per cent of visitors arrived by air.
Domestic tourism expenditure was estimated to be
nearly £58 billion in 2003, with day visits
accounting for over half of this expenditure.
Historic towns and cities and the scenic rural and
coastal areas of the United Kingdom continue to
have great appeal for domestic and overseas
tourists alike. Their popularity reflects the interest
in UK heritage, arts and culture. Tourism plays an
increasingly important role in supporting the UK
national heritage and creative arts, in addition to
the large financial contribution it makes to hotels,
restaurants, cafes and bars, and public transport.

Activity holidays are often based on walking,
cycling, canoeing, mountain.climbing, or artistic
activities. The Youth Hostel Association operates
a network of 225 hostels in England and Wales

catering, to families and people of all ages. The
Scottish Youth Hostels Association operates over
60 hostels, including purpose-built premises,

International Northern Ireland operates a further
six hostels. The British Airways London Eye was
the most popular UK attraction charging
admission in 2002. With the abolition of
admission charges to several museums and

& Albert and Science Museums recorded sharp
increases in visitor numbers.
Tourism promotion
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport
(DCMS) and the devolved administrations are
responsible for policy on UK tourism. VisitBritain
promotes the United Kingdom to an international
audience and England domestically. It is sponsored
by DCMS and has a network of 31 overseas offices,
located in markets that offer the best potential
return and covering 88 per cent of all visitors to
the United Kingdom. There are separate national
tourist boards in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland that support domestic tourism and work
with VisitBritain to promote their products
overseas. Since April 2003, the Regional

document, Extending Competitive Markets:
Empowered Consumers, Successful Business, sets out
the practical actions required to bring the United
Kingdom up to world-class standards.
The DTI is currently working with the free debt
advice sector and the credit industry to increase
capacity and improve access to free debt advice.
As part of this work, the Government continues
to provide a substantial part of the funding for
National Debtline, a telephone helpline for people
with debt problems in Great Britain.
The EU consumer programme covers activities
such as health and safety, protection of the
consumer’s economic interests, promotion
of consumer education and strengthening of
consumer representation. The interests of UK
consumers on EU matters are represented by
a number of organisations, including the
Consumers’ Association and the National
Consumer Council.
Development Agencies in England have been
playing a stronger role and are required to develop
and implement regional sustainable tourism
strategies, working with regional and local
partners as well as with VisitBritain on marketing.
VisitBritain and the national tourist boards inform
and advise the Government on issues of concern
to the industry. They also research and publicise
trends affecting the industry and work closely with
regional tourist boards, on which local
government and business interests are represented.
There are several hundred local Tourist
Information Centres in the United Kingdom. The
national tourist boards, in conjunction with the
Automobile Association and the Royal Automobile
Club, administer the National Quality Assurance
Standards schemes for accommodation.
Consumer protection
The Government aims to maintain and develop a
clear and fair regulatory framework that gives
confidence to consumers and contributes to
business competitiveness. It works closely with
outside bodies that have expert knowledge of
consumer issues in order to develop policies and
legislation. The DTI is responsible for the
Government’s consumer policy and in July 2004
launched a consultation on a consumer strategy
for the next five to ten years. The consultation
Consumer legislation
Purchasers of goods, services or credit are
protected by the following legislation:
■ the Trade Descriptions Act 1968;
■ the Consumer Credit Act 1974;
■ the Sale of Goods Act 1979;
■ the Weights and Measures Act 1985;
■ the Consumer Protection Act 1987;
■ the Doorstep Selling Regulations (1987 and
1998);
■ the Control of Misleading Advertisements
Regulations 1988;
■ the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts
Regulations 1999;
■ the Distance Selling Regulations 2000; and
■ the Enterprise Act 2002 (see page 358).
Consumer advice and information
The Citizens Advice service delivers advice from
over 3,200 locations across England, Wales and
Northern Ireland and handled 5.7 million
enquiries, including consumer issues, in 2002/03
(Table 29.20). Their work is coordinated by a
national association - Citizens Advice, formerly
known as the National Association of Citizens
Advice Bureaux - linked to individual locations by
local and regional committees. In 2002/03,

The National Consumer Council is a consumer
policy and research organisation with a special
focus on the needs of disadvantaged consumers. It
is a non-profit-making company limited by
guarantee and most of its funding is from the DTI.
It works with associate organisations in England,
Wales and Scotland and the General Consumer
Council of Northern Ireland to represent all
consumer interests to policy makers, regulators
and suppliers in the United Kingdom and in the
EU.
Consumer bodies for privatised utilities, such as
electricity and gas, investigate questions of
concern to the consumer. Some trade associations
have set up codes of practice. In addition, several
organisations work to further consumer interests
by representing the consumer’s view to
government, industry and other bodies. The
largest is the Consumers’ Association
(www.which.co.uk), with over 700,000 members in
August 2004, funded largely by subscriptions to
Which? magazine. Around 103,000 subscribers
have online access to the complete range of Which?
publications.
Consumer Direct
The DTI is launching a new national telephone
and online consumer advice and information
service, Consumer Direct
(www.consumerdirect.gov.uk). Consumers will be
able to access clear, practical consumer advice
through a single national telephone number. The
service was introduced in Yorkshire and the
Humber, Wales and Scotland during summer
2004 and will be available throughout the United
Kingdom by spring 2007.

Appendix A UK Parliament and devolved
administrations, government departments
and agencies
This appendix gives contact details for the main
government departments and describes their
principal functions. It is divided into the following
sections:
■ non-devolved functions (including matters
‘reserved’ to the UK Government); and
■ devolved administrations - Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland.
The entries for departments responsible for non-
devolved functions give a broad indication of their
geographical remit, but details may vary.
Executive agencies are listed at the end of the entry
for their sponsor department. Those marked with
an asterisk^ also have an entry in their own right.
Following the entry for the UK Parliament, the
listing within each section is alphabetical, except
that words like ‘the’ ‘and’ ‘of’ and ‘for’ are ignored,
as is the ‘HM’ before Customs and Excise, Land
Registry and Treasury.
A complete listing of government departments,
executive agencies, non-departmental public
bodies, and a range of related organisations, such
as museums, galleries and research establishments,
is published in the Civil Service Year Book; and
there is further information in Public Bodies 2003,
published by HMSO.

Glossary
Additional Member System
Used in elections for the Scottish Parliament and
the Welsh and London assemblies, this system
combines the election of constituency members on
a first-past-the-post basis with additional
members elected from a party list in each electoral
region. In the United Kingdom, the additional
members are elected using the d’Hondt system.
Adoption Order
Gives parental responsibility for a child to the
adoptive parent(s). The Order is made on
application to an authorised court.
Alcohol-related deaths
Includes only those causes regarded as being most
directly due to alcohol consumption. Does not
include other diseases where alcohol may be a
contributory factor, such as cancer of the liver.
Also excludes road traffic deaths and other
accidents.
Balance of payments basis
Refers to data on exports and imports that have
been adjusted in coverage and valuation to make
them consistent with international standards for
national accounting.
Basic prices
Prices excluding taxes and subsidies on products.
Biodiversity
This covers the whole variety of living things,
including the habitats that support them, the
different arrays of species and the genetic variation
within species.
Carers
In the 2001 Census, unpaid care was defined as
unpaid help, looking after or supporting family
members, friends, neighbours or others because of
long-term physical or mental ill-health or
disability or problems related to old age.
Chained volume measures
These are time series that measure gross domestic
product in real terms (that is, excluding price
effects). They are produced by a method known as
annual chain-linking. This means that the figures
for 2002 and 2003 quoted in this book are based
on 2001 prices (the reference year), figures for
2001 on 2000 prices, and so on.
Children
In surveys, children are never-married people of
any age who live with one or both parents. The
category also includes step-children, adopted
children (but not foster children) and
grandchildren (where the parents are absent).
Class A, B and C drugs
In the United Kingdom, illegal drugs are classified
under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 into:
■ Class A drugs, which include opiates (such as
heroin and morphine); hallucinogens (such as
LSD and magic mushrooms); ecstasy and
cocaine;
■ Class B drugs, which include amphetamines
and barbiturates; and
■ Class C drugs, which include cannabis, most
anabolic steroids and benzodiazepine
tranquillisers.
Current account
In the Balance of Payments, this is an account of
transactions in respect of trade in goods and
services, income, and current transfers.
Current prices
Actual prices for the time period in question,
without adjusting for inflation.
Decent home standard
This is measured against the following criteria:
■ whether the home meets the current statutory
minimum for housing, which at present is the
fitness standard;
■ whether it is in a reasonable state of repair;
■ whether it has reasonably modern facilities;
and
■ whether it provides a reasonable degree of
thermal comfort through effective insulation
and efficient heating.
Dependent children
In the Labour Force Survey and the General
Household Survey, dependent children are
childless never-married children in families who
508

time education.
DERV
Diesel-engined road vehicle fuel used in internal
combustion engines that are compression-ignited.
Detection of crime
A crime is ‘detected’ (or in Scotland ‘cleared up’) if
a suspect has been identified and interviewed and
there is sufficient evidence to bring a charge. There
does not have to be a prosecution: for example, the
offender may accept a caution or ask for the crime
to be taken into consideration by the court, or the
victim may not wish to give evidence.
d'Hondt system
A form of proportional representation used in
England, Wales and Scotland for elections to the
European Parliament and, as part of the
Additional Member System, used in elections to
the Welsh Assembly, Scottish Parliament, and
London Assembly.
The party with the most votes in an electoral
region receives the first seat. The votes for that
party are then divided by two and this new figure
compared with votes for the other parties. The
party that now has the most votes receives the next
seat. Each time a party wins a seat, its total vote is
divided by a number equal to the number of seats
it has already been allocated, plus one, and the
process is repeated until all seats are allocated.

The Official Yearbook of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland
Now in its 56th edition, the Official Yearbook
has a unique place on bookshelves in universities,
libraries, businesses and homes around the world,
as one of the most respected reference works on
the United Kingdom.
UK 2005 outlines government policy and provides
facts and figures on the nation's economic, social
and cultural affairs, its physical environment,
international relations and systems of government.
It also contains a useful directory of the main
government departments and agencies.
'Transport and travel, the United Kingdom on the
move' is this year's theme. This is marked by items
of interest throughout the book. The colour pages
provide a photographic diary of the year from the
opening of a new National Park in September 2003
to Team GB's successes at the Olympic Games in
August 2004. It includes events and anniversaries
as diverse as the first exhibition of UK art in Iran
since the Islamic revolution, the 200 years of the
Royal Horticultural Society, the first citizenship
ceremony in the United Kingdom, and Liverpool
being awarded World Heritage status.
