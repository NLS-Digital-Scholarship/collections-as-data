Introduction
Britain: an official handbook, 1966, is the seventeenth in the series
prepared and extensively revised each year by the Reference Division of the
Central Office of Information with the co-operation of other government
departments and of many national organisations.
The handbook, which is the mainstay of the reference facilities provided
by the British Information Services in many countries, was at first only
available overseas in a limited free edition. In 1954 it was placed on sale
throughout the world and it has since become widely known as an established
work of reference.
This 1966 edition, which covers events up to September 1965, gives, like
its predecessors, a factual account of the administration and the national
economy of the United Kingdom. It describes the activities of many of the
national institutions, both official and unofficial, and shows the part played
by the Government in the life of the community.
The handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt
to cover Britain’s participation in Commonwealth or world affairs. The
factual and statistical information it contains is compiled from official and
other authoritative sources, and, while most sections of the book relate to the
United Kingdom as a whole, facts and figures for England, Wales, Scotland,
and Northern Ireland are also given separately when relevant.
Readers who require more detailed information should consult the Annual
Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics, issued by the Central
Statistical Office, and also other government publications and standard
works of reference, some of which are listed in the bibliography at the end
of the handbook. Readers are asked to note that the Central Office of
Information reference documents listed in the bibliography as free and
marked with an asterisk are available free of charge only at British Information
Offices overseas; they can, however, be obtained in the United Kingdom
from the Reference Division, Central Office of Information, on payment of
a small charge.

THE LAND AND THE
PEOPLE
i
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe with
a total area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest islands are Great
Britain proper (comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland)
and Ireland (comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west
are the Isles of Scilly; off North Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is
fringed by numerous islands and to the far north are the important groups
of the Orkneys and Shetlands. All these form administrative counties or parts
of counties of the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the
Channel Islands between Great Britain and France have a large measure of
administrative autonomy and are not part of England, Wales, Scotland or
Northern Ireland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border) has a
total area (including inland water) of 50,327 square miles and is divided into
39 geographical or 46 administrative counties; Wales (including Monmouth¬
shire), with a total area of 8,017 square miles, has 13 counties; Scotland,
including its 186 inhabited islands, has a total area of 30,411 square miles
and is divided into 33 counties; and Northern Ireland, consisting of six
counties, has a total area of 5>459 square miles. Together, these countries
constitute the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with
a total area of 94,214 square miles. The total land area of the United Kingdom
(excluding inland water) is 93,018 square miles: England, 50,051; Wales and
Monmouthshire, 7,966; Scotland, 29,795; and Northern Ireland, 5,206 square
miles.
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they
refer to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together
for many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which com¬
prises England, Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The position is further complicated by the fact that the county of Monmouth
is sometimes included with England. United Kingdom statistics and other
data sometimes include the Isle of Man, 227 square miles, and the Channel
Islands, 75 square miles, which strictly are not part of the United Kingdom
but are dependencies of the Crown. Since southern Ireland became indepen¬
dent, official statistics do not normally refer to the British Isles as a whole.
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o Groats, is in latitude 58° 40/. The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old Observatory of Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly i° 43' East and the westernmost
point of Ireland is approximately io° 30' West. It is just under 600 miles
in a straight line from the south coast of Britain to the extreme north and
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

Topography
rather over 300 miles across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous bays
and inlets no point in the British Isles is as much as 75 miles from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less
than 50 fathoms (300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental shelf.
To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly
from 600 feet to 3,000 feet. These shallow waters are important because they
provide excellent fishing grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish.
The North Atlantic Current, the drift of warm water which reaches the
islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out over the shelf and its ameliorating
effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect of tidal movement is also
increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main
geological periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant
to weather and have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south
and east, and the island can therefore be divided roughly into two main
regions, Lowland Britain and Highland Britain.
In Lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern
England have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and
rising to chalk and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet
above sea level. The boundaries of this region run roughly from the mouth
of the Tyne in the north-east of England to the mouth of the Exe in the
south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and
moors of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands,
which extend from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the
Lake District in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the
Pennines, almost the whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of
England coinciding approximately with the counties of Devon and Cornwall.
Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of Great Britain and
extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet. This high ground, however,
is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains. Geologically
the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old rocks (archaean
and palaeozoic), while the top strata in the valleys and plains are mainly more
recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern and western
parts of Lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal
measures which have been the foundation of Britain’s industrial expansion.
The outcrops and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted
were found on the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high
land. Most of the present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors
of present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice
Age, and at one period or another during this time the whole of Britain north
of a line joining the river Thames and the Bristol Channel was covered by
ice caps and ice sheets. The ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground
and swept from the mountains of Scotland, northern England and Wales
any loose rock or soil which had previously been formed, so that, when the
ice eventually disappeared, the hills stood out as barren rocky areas, while a
thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders, boulder-clay, sands and gravels—
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 4,406 feet; in Wales, Snowdon,
3,560 feet; and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District, Cumberland), 3,210 feet.
The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard, 2,796 feet.

lay distributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had blocked up previous
drainage channels and left large lakes, which have since gradually dried up,
leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by
the ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption
of the previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses of Ireland
are irregularly placed around central lowlands; in the higher parts the
moorland vegetation resembles that of the higher parts of Highland Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances,
particularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach
the coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the Pembrokeshire coast in
South Wales; the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumberland coast;
and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner
Hebrides. Even around Lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some
parts the soft, white limestone—the chalk—forms the world-famous white
cliffs of Dover or the Needles off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the
south and south-east coastline have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern
coast of England between the Humber and the Thames estuary is for the
most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years some stretches of it have been
protected against the sea by embankments. These have occasionally been
breached, as in the flood disaster of January 1953, which was caused by the
abnormal concurrence of violent gales and exceptionally high tides.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much
of the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries
of the short British rivers1 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. It lies in middle latitudes
to the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but the
prevailing winds are south-westerly and the weather from day to day is
controlled mainly by a succession of depressions from the Atlantic which,
moving in a generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over or near
the British Isles. The climate is subject to frequent changes but to few
extremes of temperature. Although it is largely determined by that of the
eastern Atlantic, occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may
bring a cold, dry, continental type of weather which, once established, may
persist for many days or even weeks. During the summer months the Azores
high pressure system usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards
north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course, often
passing entirely to the north of the British Isles.
In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an
easterly quarter the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as
south-westerly ones although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent
in the spring that at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction
may differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography.
Winds are generally stronger in the north than in the south of the British
Isles, stronger on the coasts than inland, and stronger in the west than in the
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—are only 210 and
200 miles long respectively.

east. The strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the average speed at
Lerwick, Shetland Islands, varies from about 22 m.p.h. in January to about
14 m.p.h. in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of
London, the average speed varies from about 10 m.p.h. in January to about
7 m.p.h. in August. The stormiest region of the British Isles is along the
north-west coast, with over 30 gales a year; south-east England and the east
Midlands are the least stormy, with gales occurring on about 2 days a year
inland and on some 15 to 20 days on the Channel coast.
Near sea level the mean annual temperature ranges from 470 F. (8° C.) in
the Hebrides to 520 F. (ii° C.) in the extreme south-west of England; it is
slightly lower in the eastern part of the country in the same latitude. The
mean monthly temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetlands),
ranges from 390 F. (40 C.) during the winter (December, January and
February) to 530 F. (120 C.) during the summer (June, July and August):
the corresponding figures for Jersey (Channel Islands), in the extreme south,
are 430 F. (6° C.) and 63° F. (170 C.). The average range of temperature
between winter and summer varies from 150 F. to 230 F. (7°-i20 C.), being
greatest inland in the eastern part of the country. During a normal summer,
the temperature occasionally rises above 8o° F. (270 C.) in the south, but
temperatures of 90° F. (320 C.) and above are infrequent. Extreme minimum
temperatures depend to a large extent on local conditions, but 20° F. (— 70 C.)
may occur on a still, clear winter’s night, io° F. (—12° C.) is rare, and
o° F. (—180 C.) or below has been recorded only during exceptionally severe
winter periods.
The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches, while
England alone has about 34 inches. The geographical distribution of annual
rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure to the Atlantic, the
mountainous areas of the west and north having far more rain than the plains
of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches of rain fall on the summits
of Snowdon and Ben Nevis during the average year, whereas some places in
the south-east of England record less than 20 inches. Rain is fairly well
distributed throughout the year, but, on the average, March to June are the
driest months and October to January the wettest, the former period of four
months having about 60 per cent of the rainfall of the latter. A period of as
long as three weeks without rain is exceptional, and is usually confined to
limited areas. In successive years, however, remarkably contrasting weather
conditions are sometimes experienced.
The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a general decrease
from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with
altitude. During May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the
mean daily duration of sunshine varies from five and a half hours in western
Scotland to seven and a half hours in the extreme south-east of England;
during the months of shortest daylight—November, December and January—
sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a day in some parts
of the Highlands of Scotland and in the Peak District (Derbyshire) and two
hours a day on the south coast of England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog
in winter1. Until about 1956 dense fogs containing smoke and other pollution
from the burning of coal used to occur from time to time in London and
1 The number of mornings with less than 1,100 yards visibility ranges from less than 5
a year in areas of lowest incidence to about 55 in areas of the highest.

other centres of population. Since then, as a result of changes in fuel usage
and the operation of clean air legislation, these fogs have become much less
severe.
Many parts of the surface of Highland Britain have only thin, poor soils,
with the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands
of Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valley lands and the plains where soils are deeper and
richer; villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any
habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, almost the
whole of Lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area
except where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land
drainage systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under
cultivation the fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and
similar areas in East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
natural vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands,
forests of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open
moorland. In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively
diminished and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry
Commission in the past forty years, woodlands now occupy only about
7 per cent of the surface of the country. The greatest density of woodland
occurs in the north and east of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England
and in Monmouthshire on the Welsh border. Midland Britain appears to be
well wooded because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees. The most
common trees are oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of
which about a third is arable and the rest pasture and meadow, a varied
semi-natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or wire fences
and, specially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents
a pattern of contrasting colour. The cool temperate climate of Britain and
the even distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season; streams rarely
dry up, grassland is green throughout the year and full of wild flowers from
spring to autumn; in most years there is scarcely a month in which some flowers
may not be found in hedgerows and sheltered woodland glades.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western
Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals,
including the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct;
but red deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish High¬
lands and on Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are
found in Scotland and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow
deer (which are probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks
and are wild in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen;
6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
there are foxes in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers
and streams. Both common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of
the coast, though not usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include
mice, rats, voles, shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey
more numerous than the native red), hares, rabbits, coypu, weasels and stoats
There are about 43° species of birds, including many song-birds. About
2/20 species are resident and the rest are regular visitors to Britain. The
chaffinch and the blackbird are probably the most numerous and are widely
and evenly distributed, but sparrows usually predominate near houses, and
huge flocks of starlings, which gather at certain seasons, sometimes congregate
in London and other large towns. These and some other species of small
birds have been on the increase for several decades owing to their success in
adapting themselves to a man-made environment, while small birds in
general have benefited by more considerate treatment from the public. The
number of large birds, on the other hand, has tended to decline, except for
game birds which are specially preserved, such as pheasants and partridges,
and the red grouse which is found in moorland areas.
Many species of gulls and other sea-birds nest round the coast and gulls
often fly far inland in search of food or shelter in rough weather. The drainage
and reclamation of marsh lands have diminished the natural habitat of due ,
geese and other aquatic birds. Such birds, however, now frequent reservoirs,
gravel pits and sewage farms in addition to the nature reserves and bird
sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearlv all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous and three species o
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Of these, only
one species of newt and the common viviparous lizard are indigenous; the
other species of reptiles and amphibians that are now firmly established came
to Britain from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
River and lake fish include salmon, trout, sea-trout, perch, roach, dace,
^Thefe are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small,
in the British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly
(1 to 4 inches) and the stag beetle (2^ inches). The insect fauna in Britain is
less varied than that of continental Europe and lacks a number of common
European species. With modern methods of pest control, extensive msec
damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks of diseases commonly spread
by insect vectors are exceptional in Britain but there is some anxiety among
naturalists that chemical protection against insects may be reducing t e
creatures which feed on them, and their predators in turn.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from
the people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long
succession of invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of
Europe were the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian
Vikings who, after settling in northern France, intermarrying with the b rench,
and assimilating the French language and customs, crossed to England an
conquered it in 1066.

It is neither possible nor suitable to attempt in this chapter to estimate the
relative importance of various early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans,
Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the
present English, Scots, Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over
most of England and the Lowlands of Scotland the language which soon
came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and
Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales,
Cornwall, the Isle of Man, the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland
(see p. 18).
The available records do not permit of any precise estimates of the size of
population or of the extent or direction of population movement until the
beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the end
of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about two million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century a reasonable contemporary
estimate put the population of England and Wales at 5^ million and that of
Scotland at about one million. The main factor in this gradual growth of
population was a slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in
Britain, as in all countries before the development of medical science, by
high death rates and, in particular, by very high infant and maternal mortality.
Immigration from the continent of Europe has been an influence at certain
times and immigration from other Commonwealth countries more recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the
British people—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births,
deaths, marriages, occupations, language and family structure is relatively
plentiful and reliable. Most of it is derived from two main sources: the regular
flow of vital statistics, i.e. statistical information based on statutory registration
of births, marriages and deaths, and the periodic census of population which
gives a national snapshot at a particular moment of time.
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is
carried out by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as
registrars of marriages. In England and Wales there are about five hundred
superintendent registrars in charge of registration districts and about twelve
hundred registrars in charge of sub-districts. Registrars and superintendent
registrars are appointed by the county, county borough and metropolitan
borough councils but they act under the instruction of the Registrar General
for England and Wales, who is in charge of a central government department,
the General Register Office, concerned with regulating the registration of
births, deaths and marriages, with planning and carrying out population
censuses, and with the compilation and analysis of population and vital
statistics. There are corresponding authorities1 and similar arrangements
(differing only in detail) in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man.
Censuses of the people of Great Britain have been taken regularly every
ten years since 1801, except that there was no census in 1941 because of the
war. The latest census covering the whole of the British Isles was taken in
1961 by the appropriate authorities in England and Wales, Scotland, Northern
Ireland, the islands of the British seas and the Irish Republic. As well as
total population figures and local reports, tables have been published on
1 The various authorities are: the General Register Office, Somerset House, London;
the General Registry Office, Edinburgh; the General Register Division of the Ministry
of Finance of the Government of Northern Ireland; the Governments of Jersey, of
Guernsey and its associated islands, and of the Isle of Man.

birthplace and nationality, age and marital condition, housing tenure and
household arrangements and also reports on incidence of Welsh speaking
in Wales and Monmouthshire and on scientific and technological qualifications.
Further tables are expected on migration, dwellings and households, occupation
and industry, workplace, education and fertility.
Because the traditional ten-year interval is now too long to wait for the
firm figures needed by Government and business for decision making, which
only a census can give, censuses are to be taken throughout Great Britain
(on a sample basis) and Northern Ireland in 1966.
The short demographic account of the United Kingdom given in this
chapter is based mainly on census reports and on the regular returns of births,
marriages and deaths, though some use has been made of other special
investigations, including the Reports of the Royal Commission on Population.1
The enumerated population of the United Kingdom at the censuses taken
on 23rd April, 1961, was 52,709,000, excluding persons in the Isle of Man
and the Channel Islands, which are not strictly parts of the United
Kingdom.
The population had increased by nearly 2^ million since 1951, by about
6| million since 1931, by about 8J million since 1921 and by about 45 J million
—or about sevenfold—since 1700. The main causes of this increase were a
progressive reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates
into the beginning of the twentieth century. Between June 1961 and June 1962
the population increased by 1 per cent, faster than at any time in the past 40
years, owing to natural increase and exceptionally high net gain from migration.
If a census had been taken in mid-1964 it is estimated that some 54,066,000
people would have been enumerated in the United Kingdom (adjusted for
members of the armed forces and others, 54,213,000). On the basis of present
trends it is now expected to go on growing, though probably by slightly under
the 1961-62 rate of increase.
The population density of the United Kingdom as a whole is one of the
highest in the world: it was approximately 554 persons per square mile at
the time of the 1961 censuses; but in England there were approximately
863 persons per square mile.

For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was about 35 per
thousand of the population, and the annual death rate was just over 20 per
thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the century,
but the natural increase of the population changed but little. It rose from
12 per thousand in 1851 to 15 per thousand in 1881, and fell to 11 per thousand
in 1901.
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age
groups, produced a population of low average age. At each successive census
the population of any age group exceeded the corresponding figure at the
preceding census, while the short expectation of life further reduced the ratio
of older to younger persons. When, therefore, death rates in all age groups
fell by an average of about a third, as they did between 1880 and 1910,
the results were a very low general death rate, which helped to maintain the
population increase in spite of a fall in the birth rate, and a gradual increase
in the average age of the population.
After the first world war the birth rate fell to less than half the nineteenth
century rate. Even so, the population continued to increase slowly, though
its average age rose more rapidly.
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
nearly stationary since 1920 at around 12 per thousand of the population
though death rates have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particu¬
larly among pre-school children, school children, and adults in their thirties
and forties, with a consequent lengthening of the expectation of life from about
50 years at birth in 1900 to 1910 to over 70 years at birth in 1958 to i960. Since
1933 the steady fall in the number of births has ceased. During the second
world war the birth rate began to rise and reached a temporary post-war peak
of 20-7 per thousand population in 1947. It then receded again to slightly above
the pre-war level in the early 1950s, but since 1955 it has risen slowly and was
18-7 per thousand in 1964. The proportion of illegitimate births, which
reached a peak of 9-1 per cent of all live births in 1945, the last year of the
second world war, fell between 1945 and 1955, when it reached 4-5 per cent;
since then it has been rising again gradually and was nearly 7 per cent in
1964.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, public and private schemes to make the health services generally
available, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain
on mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant
and maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main
acute infectious diseases of childhood is less than a two-hundredth and
mortality from tuberculosis is about one-fifty-fifth of the rate prevailing in the
mid-nineteenth century. Infant mortality (i.e. deaths of infants under one year
old per thousand live births) has fallen by about 80 per cent since 1900.
Maternal mortality is now only about one-thirteenth of the 1934 rate. The
reported mortality from many of the chronic diseases of middle and old age,
such as cancer of the lung and coronary thrombosis, has risen during the
twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement in
diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective
measures to combat some of these diseases, and improvetnent in positive
health does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Marriage Over the past thirty years the proportion of the whole population who are
married has risen from 43 to 51 per cent, while the proportion of single
persons in the population over 15 years of age has fallen from nearly a third
to under a quarter. This change has been due mainly to an increase in marriage
rates among men and women in their late teens and early twenties. In 1962
some sixty per cent of the young women aged 20 to 24 were married; in 1931
only twenty-five per cent were married. Earlier marriage has led to a large
increase in the number of children born to women under 30 years of age and
in recent years has contributed to a substantial acceleration of the total flow
of births into the population.
FertiUty Trends The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part
of the twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the size of the family
(i.e. the number of children born per married couple) caused by the spread
of deliberate family limitation. Couples married a hundred years ago produced
on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline seems to
have set in with those married in the 1860s, and continued steady until, with
the couples married in the late 1920s, the average family size had been reduced
to between 2'2 and 2-1. The decline then stopped, and the figure remained
stable in spite of the disturbance of the war years; the latest data suggest a
definite increase.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20
and 30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to
replace the original generation, while those born at the beginning of the present
century had only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for
replacement. Since then the figure has been rising again and seems likely to
exceed full replacement with the generation born during the second world
war. The rise has been due mainly to the increased proportion of children
surviving to adult life and of women getting married; but there has also been
some increase in family size and fertility statistics suggest that this increase
is continuing.
^ge The first effect of the fall in the birth rate was to reduce the number of
Distribution children, and therefore the ratio of dependent population to working popula¬
tion. This ratio was at a minimum in the i93os- After 1936 the number of
children leaving school for work fell sharply owing to the drop in the birth
rate after 1921, while the population aged over 4° continued to increase and
the population aged over 64, born during an era of high fertility and repre-

senting successive generations of steeply rising numbers, increased very
rapidly. The higher birth rates after 1942 arrested the compensating fall in
the number of dependent children and have further reduced the ratio of
working to dependent population.
At mid-1964 the age distribution of the British population was estimated
as follows:
Under 15 .. .. .. 23-2 per cent
15 to 64 .. .. .. 65-0 per cent
65 and over .. .. 11-9 per cent
An unusually small proportion of the population of the United Kingdom
(about 25 per cent) is now aged 20 to 39 years. Assuming a continued fall in
death rates and an aggregate net gain from migration of some 20,000 people
a year from the usual age groups, it is estimated that between 1964 and 1980
(1) the number of people aged 20 to 39 will increase by about 16 per cent
to about 16 million;
(2) the population aged 40 to 64 will decrease by about 4-5 per cent;
(3) the number of old people (over 65) will increase by nearly 28 per cent
to about 8 million.
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but
stillbirth rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so
that in nearly all countries—and in Britain since records began—women
preponderate among the elderly and outnumber men in the total population.
Formerly indeed women outnumbered men in the United Kingdom in
every age group from adolescence onwards. Recently, however, the fall in
stillbirths and infant mortality has reduced the influence of these factors on
sex ratio so that the age at which women begin to outnumber men has been
advanced and is now about 35. On the other hand, the lengthening of the
expectation of life, which has been rather more marked for women than for
men, has increased the preponderance of women among the elderly—there
are now some seven women over seventy years old to every four men—and
made it a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole population. This increase
in the number of elderly women, however, does not quite counterbalance
the increase in the number of boys and young men so that the ratio of females
to males has fallen from 108 : too in 1951 to 105: too in 1964.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the 1930s the balance
of migration was markedly outward. Between 1815 and 1930 well over
20 million people left Britain for destinations outside Europe, mainly in the
Commonwealth and the United States. Many emigrants later returned and
large numbers of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles, Germans and Hungarians,
entered the British Isles. Nevertheless, the net loss by migration from the
present area of the United Kingdom amounted to some four million between
1871 and 1931. Since then the balance of migration of Britain as a whole
has been inward, though Scotland and Northern Ireland have throughout
continued to have a net outward movement of population to countries
overseas as well as to England and Wales. The main net inflow to Britain
since 1931 occurred in two periods. The first was in the years 1931 to 1940
when emigration was very low, many former emigrants returned, there was
considerable net immigration from the Irish Republic, and extensive
immigration from Europe, including about a quarter of a million refugees
12
Nationality
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
seeking sanctuary in Britain. The second, in the years from 195^ onwards,
resulted from a large increase in net immigration from Commonwealth
countries, particularly West Indian countries and Pakistan. In the three years
1960-62 total net immigration amounted to some 388,000 people, about
three-quarters of them from the Commonwealth and nearly half from the
West Indies. It was in these circumstances that the Government introduced
the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, which gave it power to restrict
the number of people from the Commonwealth and, in principle, the Irish
Republic who may immigrate into the United Kingdom without assured
prospects of employment or adequate means of self-support, and to deport
unsuitable immigrants (that is, those convicted of offences and recommended
for deportation by a court of law). The Act came into force on 1st July, 1962,
and net Commonwealth immigration in the rest of 1962 amounted to some
2,500; in the year 1963 it was 66,000, and in 1964, 75,500.
At the 1961 census some 2*i million residents in England and Wales were
reported definitely to have been born outside the United Kingdom rather
under one-third of them in other Commonwealth countries, about the same
number in the 26 counties now forming the Irish Republic, and the rest in
foreign countries, notably Germany, Poland, the United States and Russia.
The total number born outside the United Kingdom had increased by about
40 per cent since 1951, largely because of the inflow from Commonwealth
countries in the Wbst Indies, Asia and Africa. Residents in England or
Wales born in these countries had increased from over 170,000 to about
530,000. In Scotland and Northern Ireland the number of residents born out¬
side the British Isles is relatively small.
It has been estimated that there are currently up to a million Commonwealth
immigrants in Britain, many of them living in the congested parts of industrial
cities such as London, Birmingham and Bradford. They are making an
important contribution to the economy and public services by relieving
shortages of labour that would otherwise be critical bm the arrival of large
numbers during a relatively short period, and their concentration in certain
areas of full employment, has led to a suddenly increased demand for housing
where it is already scarce and caused additional pressure on the social services.
The central Government, local authorities and a variety of social agencies are
seeking in different ways to help immigrants and other citizens through this
period of adjustment and to deal with special social problems as they become
evident.
Emigrants from Britain to Commonwealth countries in 1963 numbered
about 130,000, an increase of more than 30 per cent over the previous year
but still well below the 200,000 in each of the two post-war peak years,
1952 and 1957.
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, with insignificant exceptions,
persons who are born, or whose fathers were born, in the United Kingdom
or in a territory which was a colony of the United Kingdom on 1st January,
1949, or at the date of birth if later, or in a United Kingdom registered ship
or aircraft, are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. Citizenship
may also be acquired: by descent (subject to certain requirements) from a
paternal grandfather born in the United Kingdom or Colonies or from a
more remote paternal ancestor in the male line; by registration, for citizens
of Commonwealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor
children and for women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies; in consequence of an adoption order; and by naturalisation. The

requirements for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation include five years’
residence in the United Kingdom or Colonies or five years’ Crown service,
good character, a sufficient knowledge of English and the intention to reside
in the United Kingdom or a colony or to remain in Crown service.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizen¬
ship by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another
country; nor does a woman who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and
Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to an alien. Indeed, a citizen cannot
be deprived of his citizenship against his will except in very exceptional
circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisation or registration
as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen is, however, at
liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires the nationality
or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens. Until the passing
of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, they were free to enter and
remain in the United Kingdom without restrictions of any kind. Similar
treatment has been extended to citizens of the Irish Republic who, in the
United Kingdom, are not aliens.
The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that
of all other parts of the British Isles combined. The distribution of the
population of the British Isles by country, as estimated at mid-1964 and as
enumerated at population censuses back to 1901, is shown in Table 1.
The populations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were
in every case greater in 1961 than in 1951 and in 1951 than in 1931, whereas
in the ten years preceding 1931 p0Pulati°n °f Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland had declined. The rate of increase in England, however,
continues to be higher than in the other three countries, largely because of
migration from these countries to England.
Geography, history and increasing urbanisation have given rise to the
differences between these countries and to an uneven distribution of the
population within them. Table 2 shows the distribution of the population
by urban and rural districts and the populations of the standard adminis¬
trative regions, of the seven major conurbations and 17 larger cities, some of
which are the principal cities included in a conurbation. About 30 million
people live within the central area, about 60 to 65 miles wide and 200 miles
long, which runs approximately from the mouth of the Thames to the mouth
of the Mersey and contains five of the main conurbations, a number of other
sizeable towns and much rich agricultural land. Other areas with large
populations (see map on p. 13) are the central lowlands of Scotland, 1,000
square miles in the north-east of England from north of the river Tyne down
to the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and the English Channel
coast from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. On the other hand, most of the
mountainous parts of Britain, including much of Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland and the central Pennine Chain in northern England, are very sparsely
populated.
These differences in average density between different regions have been
increasing. Though few places in the United Kingdom have had any
decrease of population in the past decade, there have been local differences
in the rate of increase. Many places in the midlands and south-east England,
some south-coast areas and some of the most prosperous parts of northern
England, Wales and Scotland have had increases well above the average

l6 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
national rate, while many of the older industrial towns and remote country
areas in northern England, Wales and Scotland and some coastal resorts have
had relatively small increases. The differences result from the combined effect
of natural increase in almost all areas and net migration towards the expanding
employment opportunities of the midlands and south and towards certain
retirement areas, mainly on the south coast.
Throughout Britain the population is predominantly urban and suburban,
although there may be access to large parks, commons and other expanses
of open country within the urban area.
During the nineteenth century the labour demands of newly developing
industry drew great numbers from the countryside; by the end of the
century three-quarters of the British population was living in towns and the
large conurbation was already the dominant type of British community. During
the twentieth century the suburbs of the towns in these population centres
have continued to spread and merge. Since 1921 nearly 40 per cent of the
population has lived in the seven great conurbations whose centres are the
cities of London, Manchester (South-East Lancashire), Birmingham and
Wolverhampton (West Midlands), Glasgow (Central Clydeside), Leeds and
Bradford (West Yorkshire), Liverpool (Merseyside), and Newcastle upon
Tyne. Even the 20 per cent of the population who live in areas classed
administratively as rural include many who regularly work, shop or go to
school in towns.1
Urban Dispersal A development which has been accelerating in recent years is the long-
established tendency for the number of people who actually have their homes
in the inner parts of an area (especially the town or city centre itself) to
decrease, and be balanced or surpassed by the increase of population in and
beyond the outer suburban fringes, where development commonly extends
without a break beyond the administrative boundaries and includes areas
which are administratively rural. For this reason the statistics of conurbations,
comprising continuously built-up, economically and socially interdependent
areas, are in many ways more illuminating than those for urban administrative
areas.
In some cases even the conurbation, as defined for statistical purposes,
does not cover the whole of developments on the outskirts. This applies
most strikingly to London. The population of Greater London, after falling
between 1951 and 1961, showed a very slight increase by 1964; but there is a
broad belt of almost continuous population increase which now completely
encircles it, includes and passes beyond all existing London new towns and
extends along every major rail and road route from London. This belt contains
both commuters, who have moved their homes but continue to travel to work
in inner London, and people who have changed both home and work place
from inner London to new or expanded towns. Other areas in which outward
movement and fringe development have been noticeably large are the outer
areas of the West Midlands and Merseyside conurbations and areas on the
edges of Bristol, Derby, Leicester, Norwich, Oxford, Portsmouth and Sheffield.
Thus it is that Table 2, as well as showing decreases since 1951 for the urban
administrative areas of Glasgow and nine other cities, shows such small
increases since 1951 (because of this further spreading out of population) even
in the officially defined conurbations of South-East Lancashire, West Mid¬
lands, the West Riding of Yorkshire, and Merseyside, and in the London and
south-eastern region.
1 About 3^ per cent of the total working population are engaged in agriculture.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE \n
Factors in the further dispersal of the last 15 years have been the spread
of car ownership, expansion in public transport serving journeys to work,
private property developments to meet the demand for housing, and planned
transfers of population to the new towns around London, Glasgow, the
West Midlands and Merseyside and to selected expanding towns near to
the great cities.

“.The boundaries of some of the administrative areas have been altered from time to
time. The population figures given relate in general to the areas as these were defined
in the year noted at the head of each column. The figures for conurbations, however,
relate in general as nearly as possible to areas as constituted in 1961.
b Area at the date of the 1961 census of population.
e 1937 census figures.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
is the first language of the majority of the population in most of the western
counties and was spoken by 26 per cent of the population at the time of the
1961 census. In Scotland, in 1961 some 77,000 persons, mainly in Ross and
Cromarty, Inverness, Argyll, and Lanark, spoke the Scottish form of Gaelic,1
while a few families in Northern Ireland spoke the Irish form of Gaelic.
The Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic are no longer effectively living
languages, although, in the Isle of Man, Manx is spoken by a few people,
and is used in addition to English for certain official pronouncements.
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French
patois is still also spoken there by some people. French is still the official
language of Jersey, used for ceremonial and official procedure; both French
and English are used in the courts. In Guernsey, however, English is now
used for almost all official proceedings.
A general summary of trends in social organisation, similar in scope to the
foregoing summary of population trends, is not practicable. It may be useful,
however, to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of British
households and social habits in Britain in order to provide a background to
the information given in later chapters on such matters as town and country
planning, housing, and transport.
The great majority of people enumerated in the 1961 census in England and
Wales (nearly 97 per cent) were living in private households2 (usually in
families or on their own). About 0-75 per cent of the population were in hotels
or boarding houses, about 1-5 per cent in hospitals or homes for the elderly
or disabled, and the remainder not in private households included people
in the Armed Services, in educational institutions and in various places of
detention.
1 Most of the islands off the west coast of Scotland where Gaelic is spoken are included
in the counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness and Argyll.
2 Counting people living alone as one-person households.
Household
Arrangements
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE ^
Of the i6£ million private households in Great Britain in 1961, 13,475,000
were estimated on the basis of the 1961 census to be of the simplest type,
comprising married couples, lone parents or single people with their children'
if any, and resident domestic servants, if any. More specifically, the 13,475,000
households comprised 7,863,000 married couples, or lone parents with
children, of whatever age, 3,655,000 married couples without children, and
1,957,000 people living alone. This represents an increase of 1,942,000 house¬
holds since 1951, when there were 11,533,000 households of the simplest
type, comprising 6,877,000 married couples or lone parents with children of
whatever age and 4,656,000 married couples without children or people living
alone. Altogether some 9,362,000 households were estimated in the 1961
census to be without children under 15 or in full-time education and another
3A54.000 contained only one child. An exact comparison of these figures with
those for 1951 is not available. However, in 1951 there were 8,228,000 house¬
holds without children under 16 (instead of 15), but possibly including older
children in full-time education. Also in 1951 there were 3,080,000 households
with only one child.
The number of households (which has increased by 84 per cent since 1911)
and their small average size reflect a number of factors, including lower
birth rates, increased survival into old age, the higher proportion of married
people in the population and the general assumption that married couples
and old people in good health prefer and are entitled to have their own separate
homes. They are not to be taken as meaning there has been a general
weakening of family feeling, though family ties may link fewer people than
in former times. The volume of travel at Christmas time, the bulk of which
consists of people going to spend Christmas with their relatives, achieves
news value every year; only those involved know the hidden devotion in
thousands of homes where infirm old relatives or handicapped children are
cared for by their families. None the less, the small size of families, coupled
with a considerable degree of movement about the country for the sake of
study, work or housing, do make the role of neighbours and friends with
kindred interests of great importance.
The 14I million households enumerated in the 1961 census in England and
Wales were accommodated in 14 million dwellings, about 6 million of which
were owner occupied, ^! million rented from a local authority or New Town
Corporation and 3^ million privately rented. Over 98 per cent of all house¬
holds had exclusive use of a piped supply of cold water, 79 per cent one of
hot water, 78 per cent a fixed bath and about 90 per cent a water-closet.
The proportions were higher in urban areas.
Most women, and many men living alone, do their own catering and house¬
work. Probably less than five per cent of households employ any regular
paid help and almost certainly less than one per cent have a resident servant.
Relatively few households (estimated to be less than one in 600), and those
mainly ones with small children, have a foreign girl living with them au pair
to give some help in the home while improving her English. Approximately
one household in 40 gets help through the local authority home help service
at some time in the course of a year because of the presence of an invalid,
an old person or a maternity case. Nowadays wives can normally expect some
help with household tasks from their husbands.
Much of the drudgery has been reduced by changes in habits and equipment,
for example the relative popularity of easily cleaned plastic surfaces in place
of wood, tiles and metal in need of polishing; the availability of ‘convenience

Opportunities
foods’1, non-iron fabrics and disposable babies’ napkins; and the spread of
labour-saving devices. More than three households in four now have a
vacuum cleaner, two in five a refrigerator, about half a washing machine,
nearly all an electric iron, one in four an electric hair drier, one in five an
electric blanket and one in eight an electric toast-maker. About one in five
have completely eliminated the traditional coal fire in their principal living-
room. Women who go out to work (about half the women of working age are
in employment) benefit particularly from the flexible opening hours of many
launderettes and from the spread of automatic machines selling milk, groceries,
stockings and other supplies at any time of the day or night.
Compared with previous generations most people have considerably more
time at their own disposal, higher real incomes, and more chance of
developing their potentialities.
Agreed hours of full-time work are usually from 40 to 42 hours a week.
Actual hours worked by men average somewhat longer because of voluntary
overtime working; actual hours worked by women and girls average a little
less. Most employees are entitled to at least two weeks’ paid holiday a year
in addition to public holidays. Probably more than half enjoy a five-day week,
which is widespread in manufacturing industry. Plans are being made for a
further extension of five-day week working in distributive trades offering
six days a week service. Housewives are probably, despite current aids in the
home, the section of the community with least leisure and fewest extended
periods of free time—even compared with those older schoolchildren entered
for examinations who spend hours nightly on homework.
At the other end of the scale, people who have ceased work or are
approaching retirement are showing considerable interest in courses offering
guidance on the constructive use of their increased leisure time.
Average earnings have risen more than prices in the last decade. Women’s
earnings have risen somewhat faster than men’s. The average earnings of
women in industry are now just over half the average earnings of men. In
many occupations the principle of equal pay for equal work is applied. The
real incomes of manual workers, especially unskilled workers and young
people under eighteen years, have risen both in absolute terms and in relation
to the incomes of non-manual workers. The groups who are weakest
economically are retired people wholly or mainly dependent upon pensions,
households in which the father is absent or dead, and the families of low-wage
earners with a number of dependent children.
Opportunities for education and training have widened; these are
increasingly the keys to advancement. Four-fifths of all university under¬
graduates in Great Britain in 1961-62 were ‘first generation’ students, neither
of whose parents had had a university education (one-fifth of the total had
fathers who were manual workers); though children from culturally articulate
homes in which they benefit from parental experience have relatively more
success than others in achieving qualifications at every stage of the educational
system. Social distinctions based on occupation have become much less
clear-cut. Differences between the way of life of manual and other workers
are less pronounced, while many manual workers’ families have acquired
habits which were formerly regarded as ‘middle-class’. There is less disparity
than there used to be in the range of possessions to be found in the home.

Home Interests
Modern production and marketing methods, coupled with the declining
proportion of ‘dirty’ jobs, have contributed to far greater homogeneity of
dress and appearance; style in clothes, for example, being more divided by
age-group than by income-group or occupation.
The general level of nutrition is high, and still rising. In Great Britain in
1962 the average diet of households of all classes was nutritionally more than
adequate1. Average weekly food consumption per head included 5^ pints of
milk and cream, over 3 ounces of cheese, nearly 38 ounces of meat, poultry
and bacon, nearly 22 ounces of sugar and preserves, over 115 ounces of fruit
and vegetables, 44 ounces of bread and over 6 ounces of butter. Tea remained
the principal beverage but the consumption of coffee, one-seventh that of
tea, was nearly four times what it was 30 years ago. There are other pointers
to a modification in the traditional conservatism of British diet in the increased
consumption of wine, the spread of foreign restaurants in all parts of the
country, and successful sales of the more exotic fruits and vegetables outside
traditionally cosmopolitan areas.
There is quite a variation in diet between different parts of Britain.
Scotland maintains its traditional penchant for cakes, and the consumption
of materials for making pies and puddings is above the national average in
the Midlands and the north of England. More coffee is drunk in the south of
England, which also consumes proportionately more fresh fruit and vegetables.
The consumption of mutton and pork decreases proportionately from south
to north and the consumption of beef increases.
Food consumption accounts for rather more than a quarter of all consumers’
expenditure on goods and services in Britain. Clothing accounts for about a
twelfth. Features of recent years have been the growing range of ‘leisure’
clothes and a greater adventurousness in men’s wear; fur hats for men have
become widely acceptable in the last few winters.
Something of a counterweight to the greatly increased strength of the
production and distribution sides of a modern economy is the growth of
activity to help the consumer; this has received government support.
Which, the magazine of the Consumers’ Association, which publishes
appraisals of selected consumer goods, has over 300,000 subscribers and an
estimated readership of three million. Over three-quarters of a million people
a year make a personal visit to the Design Centre in London to see its display
of well-designed British consumer goods in current production. State services
do not escape the scrutiny of voluntary groups such as the Association for
the Improvement of Maternity Services and the Association for the
Advancement of State Education.
A considerable proportion of people’s free time and money is spent in and
on their own homes. On a weekday evening roughly seven in eight of the
adult population are at home. More demanding standards of home comfort
are evidenced by the sharp increase in the installation of central heating
apparatus and by the popularity of wall-to-wall carpeting. About four out
of five families do most of their own decorating, which may often constitute
the hardest physical effort undertaken by sedentary workers. The sales of
hand-tools and of small power-tools and powered garden implements testify
to the extent and range of home carpentry and joinery and to the interest
and initiative that maintain Britain’s homes and gardens. In spite of the high

fn Britain have some garden, and the standard of both “d c°un«y
eardens is high. Some 4,000 local horticultural societies are affiliated to the
National Allotment and Gardens Society and there are a large number of
nnaffiliated societies; altogether there are probably some 20 million spare¬
time gardeners. The numerous flower and vegetable shows held in town an
counhyare very popular and there is a large attendance at the most important
of them including the annual Chelsea Flower Show.
Other home pursuits include reading, listening to the radio, record player
or tare recorder, watching television, entertaining friends1, looking after
nets2^and pursuing hobbies. An estimated i£ million people regularly express
ffieir' competitive instincts by entering promotional competitions of the type
in which purchasers of a particular product may attempt a puzzle and compose
a slogan in the hope of winning a car, a house, or a dream holiday.
Over 80 per cent of families (and a somewhat higher proportion of the large
families in Britain) have a television set. The growing impact of television was
pZably most noticeable in the second half of the ,950s; the number of
viewing licences was doubled and by 1961 totalled over „i million. Since
then1 the increase has been slower, and by June ,965 the number was

resulted in far-reaching social changes, clear-cut indications of the ^ me of
such changes are lacking. Mass entertainments have suffered, especially
where the quality and amenities provided are not considered adequate,
lives of those housebound by disability or the care of small children hav
been much enriched. Viewers in general have been stimulated to an awareness
of events and happenings which was once confined to fairly n"r“* ;
Television has become an important influence in the way in which the vanou
political parties make their appeal to the electorate. There is no evidence
that television has brought any decline in those hobbies, recreations and
spare-time8hiterests whidi people in Britain pursue so enthusiastically; in
fact for many of them it may well have provided a stimulus.

interest in playing or watching outdoor and indoor sports. The tendency is
for spectators to be attracted in large numbers only to the more important
events. This trend has been especially in evidence in association football,
which is by far the most popular spectator sport, cricket and horse racing.
Higher standards of comfort and amenity are being sought by the public and
failure to provide these may be reflected in falling attendances. But almost
any sporting body reports a growing desire to take part in outdoor recreations
—golf, tennis, riding, angling, bowling, rugby and association football are
some examples—and steadily rising sales of sports goods and membership
of sports clubs indicate the keenness with which open air leisure activities
are pursued.
A feature is the enthusiasm with which new forms of sport and recreation,
some made more familiar through television or foreign travel, are adopted.
Among spectator sports, the rise of motor racing to wide popularity is notable
(the European Grand Prix in 1964 brought 100,000 spectators to the Brands
Hatch circuit). Ski-ing and sailing are examples of activities which, once
confined to a small number, now number their enthusiasts in hundreds of
thousands. A surge of interest in ten-pin bowling since i960 seems to have
stabilised; the number of rinks now stands at about 150.
Much of the gambling with small stakes, which is practised at least occasionally
by three adults out of four, is on the results of sporting events. The total
money staked by the public on organised betting and gambling (private
wagers and games of chance cannot be counted) is estimated at between
£750 million and £1,000 million a year and seems to have increased by about
50 per cent since 1957; at least in part the increase was apparent because the
legalisation of betting shops under the Betting and Gaming Act i960 brought
into the open betting which had been illicit. About half the money staked is
on horse racing. Betting on football matches, both at fixed odds and through
the football pools, is widespread, but usually for smaller stakes. A more recent
gambling craze is for Bingo, which is widely played in converted cinemas and
in club rooms and village halls, although total expenditure is not large.
Cinema attendances (7 million a week) are at less than a third of the rate of
ten years ago, but the cinema remains the most popular form of indoor
entertainment outside the home, particularly for young men and women and
older children.
Attendances at theatres are much smaller. There are probably only some
200 theatres offering professional performances compared with some 2,000
cinemas. Nevertheless, there is an enthusiastic and growing public not only
for plays but for ballet, opera and concerts. Special art exhibitions attract
many people; the attendance at the Arts Council Picasso Exhibition in i960
remains a record (close on half a million).
Dancing is popular, especially with those under twenty-five years of age;
it is thought that about six million people go dancing every week. There are
estimated to be some 3,000 to 4,000 regular dance halls, including public
dance halls and halls operated by the major dance schools, which are open
at least three times a week, and about 4,000 other schools of ballroom dancing.
Public dances are also often held in other halls, while many of the clubs and
societies which abound in Britain hold dances from time to time in their own

or hired premises. In addition, Scottish and English traditional dances have
their own following.
Nearly 73 million ‘singles’ and ‘extended play’ (45 revolutions per minute)
gramophone records were pressed in Britain in 1964. It is on the weekly
sales of these records (almost entirely to young people) that the ‘pop music’
popularity placings, known as the ‘Top Ten’ and ‘Top Twenty’, are calculated.
Personal appearances by leading ‘pop performers draw huge attendances
both inside and outside the theatre or studio.
A number of people from all age-groups and occupations find their main
free-time interest in some form of sustained group activity connected, for
example, with the churches, trade unions, politics, social welfare and reform,
with study or other self-improvement or with cultural pursuits.
Clubs and societies, which may be primarily social or devoted to some
particular purpose, range from small informal groups to great national and
international organisations with branches throughout the country. Organisa¬
tions of national importance in social life and in the promotion of social
gatherings include, in addition to those connected with religious denomina¬
tions, the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds
and the Women’s Institutes. There are some 3,600 clubs, with over 2 million
members (mainly but not entirely men), affiliated to the Working Men s
Club and Institute Union. These clubs are primarily social and recreational,
though they also arrange lectures and classes. In recent years they have given
much attention to improving their premises and to arranging events of
sufficient attraction to compete with the comforts of members homes and
the standard of entertainment obtainable on television. Over 2,400 Towns¬
women’s Guilds, with a total membership of about 200,000, are affiliated to the
National Union of Townswomen’s Guilds. The guilds are educational as
well as social in purpose and they co-operate in many public welfare activities.
The declared objective of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes is
to improve rural life and amenities; the institutes make an important con¬
tribution to rural life by providing meeting places for countrywomen and by
organising social gatherings. In villages throughout England and Wales there
are some 8,700 institutes with nearly half a million members; in Scotland
and Northern Ireland there are Women’s Rural Institutes with similar aims
and interests.
About 31 million people in Britain take an annual holiday. Although the
seaside is still by far the most popular for holidays, the trend appears to be
towards visiting several resorts for short periods rather than staying in one.
Camping and caravanning have also increased greatly. Both tendencies are
closely allied to the growth of personal transport (see below). More and more
people—the total is now 5 million—take more than one holiday during the
year. The number going abroad has also risen sharply and in 1964 totalled over
4! million—more than half as many again as a few years earlier. The popularity
of holidays abroad may be attributable to several factors besides rising
incomes; the attraction of a warmer climate, which make Spain and Italy
the most sought-after destinations for British tourists, the many charter and
other airline services available, and the readiness of the travel trade to provide
relatively inexpensive inclusive holidays. In this connection, the learning of
foreign languages is popular among adults1, aided by radio and television
1 Instruction in two languages is available to children in 15 per cent of state-maintained
grammar schools, three in 35 per cent, four in 27 per cent and five or more in 23 per cent.
The most widely taught modern languages are French, German, Russian and Spanish,
in that order.

programmes as well as by attendance at adult classes. Wider experience of
foreign travel probably contributes to the increased adventurousness in diet
and dress already noticed and to the acceptability of examples of the best
in international design in furnishings and decor now available in many
British shops.
Ownership of motor vehicles is now widespread. At the end of 1964 there
were about million cars (an increase of 5 million in ten years) and about
if million motor cycles (including motor scooters) licensed on the roads in
Great Britain. The trend to touring holidays (it is estimated that three-fifths
of the people taking an annual holiday do so by car) is only one of the results.
The spread of car ownership, making many people more independent of
public transport, is not only affecting the whole pattern of leisure activities
but also leading to a new and more scattered distribution of houses, changing
the siting requirements of factories, shops and offices, and making large-scale
urban reconstruction and road development urgent. At the same time, by
reducing the economic returns on public transport, resulting in reduced
services, it is in danger of impoverishing the amenity of those who for reasons
of age, health, income or personal preference do not possess their own
transport. A grim by-product of the increasing volume of road traffic is the
toll of road accidents which, though increasing far less rapidly, exceeded
7,800 people killed and 385,000 injured in 1964.
Increasing population and social developments are affecting the physical
appearance of Britain. Towns and cities are being altered to accommodate
more traffic and house more people; experiments are being tried in remodelling
town centres with pedestrian precincts; new blocks of flats and office blocks
pierce familiar skylines. Town and country interpenetrate as new estates for
migrating townsfolk encircle the little-changed hearts of old villages. New
roads and motorways to carry the traffic on leisure and business, reservoirs
to supply the growing demand for water and lines to carry electric power for
the growing volume of appliances, all have to be accommodated, while the
convenient household detergent threatens to pollute rivers with its foam.
In a modern industrial society in a densely populated country it is not
always possible to reconcile the conflict between the community’s needs and
existing natural beauty or historic interest. However much planning machinery
exists to contain disturbance and to preserve and foster the creation of
beauty, natural or man-made, it cannot achieve this unless enough people
care. The activities of amenity societies (such as the Civic Trust, the Council
for the Preservation of Rural England and its Scottish counterpart, and the
Council for Nature), and the wider public opinion which supports them,
suggest that a growing volume of people in Britain do care.

GOVERNMENT
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical State, whose origins and traditions
are to be found in the history of each of its four component parts: England,
Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. England was unified under a Saxon
king in the ninth century; Wales became part of that kingdom and Ireland
was joined with it under the same king before the end of the thirteenth
century; and the English and Scottish thrones were dynastically united in
the person of James I and VI in 1603. In 1707 the Treaty for the Union of
England and Scotland provided that the two countries ‘should be forever
united into one kingdom’, and one Parliament (the Parliament of Great
Britain) became the supreme authority in both countries. In 1801 the Act
for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland 1800, which joined the Irish
Parliament to the Parliament of Great Britain, established the United
Kingdom. In 1922 the 26 counties of Southern Ireland (now the Irish
Republic) became a completely independent country, outside the United
Kingdom. Meantime, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 had enacted a
constitution for Northern Ireland which perpetuated Northern Ireland
representation in the United Kingdom Parliament as the supreme authority
and, at the same time, provided that country with its own legislature and
executive, to deal with domestic affairs.
The United Kingdom is a unitary, not a federal, State but methods of
government are flexible and, to some extent, adapted to the needs of the
constituent countries. England and Wales on the one hand, and Scotland
on the other, continue as before the Union to have different systems of law,
a different judiciary, different educational systems, different systems of local
government, national churches on a different footing, and, for most domestic
matters, different government departments.
There is a measure of devolution in the administration of Welsh affairs
to the Welsh Office, under the Secretary of State for Wales, who is a Cabinet
Minister, assisted by a Minister of State and a Parliamentary Under¬
secretary. The main Scottish departments are grouped under the direction
of the Secretary of State for Scotland, who is a member of the United
Kingdom Cabinet. In Northern Ireland the law is derived from and similar
to the law of England but the judiciary is separate; the Northern Ireland
government departments are responsible to the Northern Ireland Parliament.
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies,
not part of the United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and
systems of local administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same
time, they have a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of
their proximity to the mainland and the antiquity of their connection with the
Crown. They are treated as part of the mainland for purposes of trade and
postal communication and are ‘territories for whose international relations
Her Majesty’s Government is responsible’. They are also formally subject
to the United Kingdom Parliament.
The United Kingdom Parliament has the ultimate responsibility for the
good government of the overseas dependencies within the Commonwealth
GOVERNMENT
27
which are administered by territorial governments and are at various stages
of development towards full self-government. The United Kingdom is also
one of the independent member nations of the Commonwealth,1 which all
acknowledge the Queen as the symbol of their free association and, as such,
the head of the Commonwealth; most of these independent countries owe
allegiance to the Crown.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions,
which are not part of the law of the land since violation of them would not
lead to proceedings in a court of law, but which are nevertheless indispensable
to the machinery of government. The rules of the constitution have never
been codified; principles and practice are both alterable, and the rules of the
constitution can be adapted to changing conditions at any time by the passing
of an Act of Parliament, or by the general acceptance of a new convention,
without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
The organs of government in the United Kingdom constitution are readily
distinguishable although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They
are:
(1) the legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the
supreme authority in the realm;
(2) the executive, which consists of: (a) the Cabinet and other ministers
of the Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national
policy; (b) government departments, most of them under the control
of ministers and all staffed by civil servants, which are responsible for
administration at the national level; (c) local authorities, which administer
and manage many services at the local level; and (d) statutory boards,
which are severally responsible for the operation of particular nation¬
alised industries or public services, and which are subject to ministerial
control in varying degrees; and
(3) the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes,
and is independent of both the legislature and the executive.
The following pages describe these three organs of government in some
detail in order to show how the constitution of the United Kingdom works.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II
is a descendant of the Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the
year 829) and of Malcolm II, whose reign in Scotland (too^-34) was corre¬
spondingly important in that part of the realm.
According to the Royal Titles Act 1953, the royal title in the United
Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
The form of the royal title is varied for the other member nations of the
The other members are: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon,
Ghana, Malaysia, Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Jamaica, Trinidad,
Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Malta, Zambia and The Gambia.

GOVERNMENT 2Q
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, to suit the particular
circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom, the Queen being
represented by a Governor in Northern Ireland. For the performance of
royal functions in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is
represented by a Lieutenant-Governor. In the other member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown the Queen’s representative
is the Governor-General, who is appointed by the Crown on the advice of
the ministers of the country concerned and is wholly independent of the
United Kingdom Government. In the United Kingdom dependencies the
Queen is usually represented by Governors (but in some cases by High
Commissioners, Administrators or Residents), who are appointed by the
Crown, have varying executive and legislative powers, and are responsible
to the United Kingdom Government for the good government of the countries
concerned.
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement 1701, which
provided that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most
excellent Princess Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants’.
Subsequent Succession to the Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration;
and although succession is not bound to continue in its present line, it cannot
now be altered (under a provision of the Statute of Westminster, 1931)
except by common consent of the member nations of the Commonwealth
which owe allegiance to the Crown.
The inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which
provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the
Throne according to their seniority or, if there are no sons, the daughters
in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-
Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as fully and effectively
as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of a king takes the
rank and style of her husband; but the converse does not apply and the
constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the husband
of the Queen-Regnant.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession
of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new
Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of
the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the
Lord Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London,
and the High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the
Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval
which may last for a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the
same in substance for nearly a thousand years although the details have
frequently been modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of
the time. The service used at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953
was derived from that used at the coronation of King Edgar at Bath in the
year 973.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of
representatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Acts of
Government
in the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the
other Commonwealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in
England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-in-chief
of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal head of the established
Church of England. In practice, as a result of a long evolutionary process
during which the absolute power of the monarchy has been progressively
reduced, the Queen acts only on the advice of her ministers which she cannot
constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule. The United
Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation
during the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers
without any necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts
of government which require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; as a general rule
she opens the new session with a speech from the throne (although this may
be read by the Lord Chancellor if the Queen is unable to be present); and
she must give Royal Assent before a Bill which has passed all its stages in
both Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enactment. The Queen is ‘the
fountain of justice’, and as such, can remit all or part of the penalties imposed
on people convicted of crime. As ‘the fountain of honour’, the Queen confers
peerages, baronetcies, knighthoods and other honours,1 and makes appoint¬
ment to all important State offices, including those of judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, and diplomats, and to all leading positions in the
established Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are
required before a minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the
realm of international affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the
State, the Queen has the power to conclude treaties, to cede or accept territory,
to declare war and to make peace.
These and similar acts of government involve the use of the royal preroga¬
tive2 which has been defined as ‘the residue of discretionary authority legally
left in the hands of the Crown’. Ministerial responsibility for the exercise
of this authority is shown in three constitutional ways in which the royal
will can be expressed: by Order in Council made ‘by and with the advice
of the Privy Council’; by Order, Commission or Warrant signed personally
by the Queen and generally bearing the signature of one or more responsible
ministers; or by Proclamation, Writs, Letters Patent, or other documents
under the Great Seal affixed by the Lord Chancellor in obedience to a Royal
Warrant countersigned by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the
smooth working of government; for although the Queen has no personal
authority and must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; a
few, i.e. the Order of Merit, the Order of Companions of Honour, the Royal Victorian
Order, the Most Noble Order of the Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient
Order of the Thistle, are in the Sovereign’s personal gift.
2 Other powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by Royal Charter;
the construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of infants; the admin¬
istration of charities; coinage; the grant of franchises, e.g., markets, ferries and fisheries;
the right to treasure trove; and the right of printing or licensing others to print the
Bible, the Book of Common Prayer and state papers.

informed and consulted on every aspect of the national life. The Queen
holds meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and
other holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet
decisions, reads dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them
if the Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or is under the age of eighteen on
accession to the throne. The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act 1953—
laid down that the first potential Regent should be The Prince Philip, Duke
of Edinburgh, and thereafter those in succession to the throne who are of age.
In the event of the Sovereign’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision
is made for the appointment of Counsellors of State (generally speaking, the
wife or husband of the Sovereign, and the four adult persons next in succession
to the Crown1) to whom the Sovereign may delegate by Letters Patent
certain royal functions. But Counsellors of State may not, for instance,
dissolve Parliament (except on the express instructions of the Sovereign),
nor create peers.
Ceremonial and Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the
Royal Visits British Isles and, in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered
outlook of both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages
are the same today as they were many centuries ago. Royal marriages, the
birth of royal children and royal funerals are marked by ancient ceremonial,
although to a lesser degree than in former days; and the birthday of the
Sovereign, formerly the occasion of many royal and public functions, is
today officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on the Horse
Guards Parade. State banquets take place when a foreign monarch or head
of State visits the United Kingdom; investitures are held at Buckingham
Palace; and royal processions grace such social occasions as the Ascot Race
Meeting, known as Royal Ascot, and add significance to the opening of
Parliament, when the Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating
from the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal
ordinances, established custom and the public will. The Queen and other
members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom every
year, and their presence at the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial,
and charitable works of national importance ensures nation-wide interest and
support. They also pay State visits to foreign governments and undertake
lengthy tours in other countries of the Commonwealth.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—
the House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate: they are con¬
stituted on different principles; they do different work in different places and
they meet together only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the
coronation, or the opening of Parliament by the Queen in person, when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-

legislate without the concurrence of all its parts (except in the case of Bills
passed under the Parliament Acts 19 n and 1949).
The Parliament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the
United Kingdom. It can legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole, or
any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination of them.
It can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, but in these
islands and in Northern Ireland it is not the only legislature, for the Northern
Ireland Parliament has power to legislate for Northern Ireland on most
domestic subjects (see p. 42), and the ancient legislatures of the two Channel
Island Bailiwicks (the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey) and of the
Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) legislate on domestic matters.1 Nevertheless,
the Parliament at Westminster retains supreme authority, and within practical
limits there is nothing that it cannot legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act 1911 the life of a United Kingdom
Parliament was fixed at five years (although it is usually dissolved and a general
election held before the expiry of the legal term); and since one Parliament
cannot bind its successor (for otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not
be sovereign or supreme), each assembly has a period of time of up to five
years during which it may legislate exactly as it chooses. During its life, it
can make or unmake any law; destroy by statute the most firmly established
convention or turn a convention into binding law; and legalise past illegalities
thus reversing the decisions of the courts. It even has power to prolong its
own life by legislative means beyond the normal period of five years without
consulting the electorate although such power is used only in circumstances
of national emergency, such as times of war.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice
Parliament does not exercise its supremacy in this way. Its members bear
in mind the common law which has grown up in Britain throughout the
centuries and they act as far as possible in accordance with precedent and
tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parliament that has
been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the proper authority
cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be likely to pass an
Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system of party
government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its responsibility
to the electorate in mind.
A Parliament, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with
a proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council.
Such a proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and,
on the other, orders the issue of writs for the election of a new one and
appoints the day and place of its meeting.
The resignation of a government usually entails the dissolution of Parlia¬
ment. Formerly the death of a Sovereign also involved dissolution, but since
1867 the duration of Parliament has been independent of the demise of the
Crown; both Houses stand adjourned on such an occasion only until their
members have taken the oath of allegiance to the new Sovereign, which
they do immediately after the Accession Council has made the order for
proclamation.
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man consist of the Queen, the
Privy Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the
member of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each
legislative measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.
GOVERNMENT
33
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or
dissolution is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a com¬
mission under the Great Seal (see p. 30), which appoints the day and place
of its meeting in a new session. The date so appointed may be brought
forward or deferred by a subsequent proclamation. The effect of a prorogation
is at once to terminate all business (with certain minor exceptions) until
Parliament is summoned again. A Bill not completed in one session must
be reintroduced in the next, unless it is to be abandoned.
During a session either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to
such date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business.
A reassembly of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or by
virtue of powers specially conferred by each House on its Speaker.
The average number of sitting days for the House of Commons is about
160, divided by custom into the following periods: one from November until
Christmas lasting 30-40 sitting days, one from January to Easter of 40-50
sitting days, one from Easter until Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and one
from Whitsun until the end of July lasting about 40 sitting days. Nowadays,
the session is sometimes concluded with a short period of up to 10 sitting
days in October, after the long summer adjournment. The House of Lords
sits, on average, for about no days in each session.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Temporal and the Lords Spiritual.
The Lords Temporal may be sub-divided into (i) all hereditary peers and
peeresses of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who
have not disclaimed their peerages under the Peerage Act 1963, (ii) all life
peers created by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act 1958, and (iii) Lords
of Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed under the terms of the Appellate
Jurisdiction Act 1876 to assist the House in the performance of its judicial
duties and who remain members of the House after their retirement from
office. The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,
the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the
Church of England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops.
Temporal peerages (both hereditary and life) are conferred by the Sovereign
on the advice of the Prime Minister. Hereditary peerages carry with them a
right to a seat in the House of Lords, provided the holder is 21 years of age
or over. Under the Peerage Act 1963, however, anyone succeeding to a peerage
may, within twelve months of succession, disclaim that peerage for his or her
lifetime. Those who disclaim their peerages lose their right to sit in the
House of Lords but they are able to vote at parliamentary elections and are
eligible for election to the House of Commons.
Not all holders of temporal peerages with a right to sit in the House of
Lords attend the sittings of that House. Those who do not wish to attend may
apply for leave of absence, either for the duration of a particular Parliament
or for a single session.
Members in constant attendance at the House of Lords include elder states¬
men and others who have spent their lives in public service. They receive no
salary for their parliamentary work, but they are entitled to travelling expenses
from their homes to the Palace of Westminster (provided they attend at
least one-third of the number of sittings), and (with the exception of the
Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chairman of Committees and any member in
receipt of a salary as the holder of a ministerial office) they may claim payment
for expenses incurred for the purpose of attendance at the House (except for
judicial sittings) within a maximum of four and a half guineas (£414s. 6d.) a day.

Commons

Electoral
System
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sits
on the woolsack and is ex officio Speaker of the House. The Crown, by
commission under the Great Seal, appoints several members of the House
to act as deputy speakers in the absence of the Lord Chancellor. The first
of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of Committees, who is appointed
each session and takes the chair in all committees, unless the House other¬
wise directs. The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments,
who is charged with keeping the records of proceedings and judgments and
who pronounces the words of the Royal Assent to Bills; the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod, who enforces the orders of the House; and the
Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Lord Chancellor.
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost
universal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections of
the community. There are at present 630 seats in the House of Commons
(511 for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
Members of the House of Commons receive a salary for their parliamentary
work and hold their seats during the life of a Parliament. They are elected
either at a general election, which takes place after a Parliament has been
dissolved and a new one summoned by the Sovereign, or at a by-election,
which is held when a vacancy occurs in the House as a result of the death of
a member, or of his acceptance of office under the Crown,1 or as a result of his
elevation to the House of Lords.
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
by the members to preside over the House immediately after a new Parliament
is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of
Ways and Means, and the Deputy Chairman, both of whom may act as
Deputy Speaker; these officers are elected by the House on the nomination
of the Government. Permanent officers of the House, i.e. those who are not
members of Parliament, include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who
conducts the business of the House in the official departments under his
control and is charged with such matters as keeping the records, endorsing
Bills and signing orders, and the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Speaker
in the House.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. Permanent
Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
keep constituencies constantly under review, submit periodic reports, and
may, at any time, recommend changes in the boundaries of any particular
constituency or constituencies if, for instance, movement of the population
has made this necessary.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained principally in the
Representation of the People Act 1949, which repealed and re-enacted in a
single statute previous legislation relating to the franchise, the conduct of
elections and corrupt and illegal electoral practices. Under the provisions of
this Act, election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot in
which British subjects (except members of the House of Lords) and citizens
of the Irish Republic are entitled to vote (voting is not compulsory), provided
that they are 21 years old or over, and are not subject to any legal incapacity

of profit under the Crown.

to vote. Those eligible to vote in any constituency are those who are recorded
on the register1 of electors for the constituency as resident in that constituency
on a date fixed by statute. Electors normally vote in person at polling stations
especially established for the purpose, although members of the armed forces,
Crown servants of the United Kingdom employed overseas, and wives of such
persons, if resident overseas with their husbands, may vote by proxy. Voting
by post, or in certain cases by proxy, may also be allowed if the voter cannot
attend in person for such reasons as physical incapacity or the nature of his
work. Any person, male or female, who is a British subject of 21 years of age or
over and is not otherwise disqualified, may be elected to the House of Com¬
mons. Categories of persons disqualified for election include members of the
House of Lords, clergy of the Church of England, the Church of Scotland,
the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church, undischarged
bankrupts, and those expressly precluded under the House of Commons
Disqualification Act 1957 (for instance, holders of judicial offices, civil
servants, members of the regular armed forces and the police forces, members
of the legislature of any country or territory outside the Commonwealth,
and holders of other public offices listed in the Act).
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain privileges and immunities designed to
protect the House from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. These
privileges apply collectively to each House and individually to each member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown
for the Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include freedom from arrest in civil
proceedings for a period from forty days before to forty days after a session
of Parliament; freedom of speech in debate; and the right of access to the
Crown, which is a collective privilege of the House. Further privileges
include the right of the House to control its own proceedings (so that it is
able, for example, to exclude strangers if it so wishes); the right to pronounce
upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and the right to penalise those who commit a breach of its
privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords are: freedom from civil arrest;
freedom of speech in debate; freedom of access to the Sovereign for each
peer individually; and the right to commit for contempt. These privileges
are not formally claimed by the Speaker as in the House of Commons; they
exist independently without grant.
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, and has now become an essential element in the working of the
constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political
parties, each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a
general election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for
election; any other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then
indicates, by its choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the
opposing policies it would like to see put into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority

of supporters in the House of Commons, forms the Government. By tradition,
the leader of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign,
usually on the advice of senior ministers; and its most outstanding members
in the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial
appointments on the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority
party becomes the official Opposition with its own leader and its own council
of discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties
or any Independents who have been elected may support the Government
or the Opposition according to their party’s or their own view' of the policy
being debated at any given time.
In the general election held in October 1964, 77 per cent of the electorate
voted, compared with 78-7 per cent in 1959. The number and percentage of
votes cast for the principal parties is shown in Table 3.

“ Others include the Speaker (for the 1964 election), Communists, Scottish and
Welsh Nationalists, Irish Republicans, Independents, and members of individual
parties, few of which were represented by more than one candidate.
The distribution of seats in the House of Commons resulting from the
general elections of 1959 and 1964 is showm in Table 4.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests to a considerable
extent upon the fact that Government and Opposition alike are carried on
by agreement: that is to say, the minority agrees that the majority must
govern and therefore accepts its decisions; and the majority agrees that the
minority should criticise and therefore sets time aside for that criticism to
be heard. The detailed arrangements of government business are settled,
under the direction of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House (who
may be the Prime Minister or some other minister), by the Government
Chief Whip in consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip. The Chief
Whips together organise the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in the House of
Commons when the question of the possibility of finding time for debating
some particular issue is being discussed. The direction of the business of the
House is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of the House, and it is
his duty to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters
about which it is concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the whips (the Chief
Whips and their assistants, chosen within the party or by the Prime Minister
for the Government party), wrhose duties include maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates. The Opposition Whips have no official position, but the Government
Chief Whip in the House of Commons is the Parliamentary Secretary to
the Treasury; of the other Government Whips, five hold titular posts as
Junior Lords of the Treasury and three are officers of the Royal Household.

a When a candidate at the polls the Speaker remains aloof from party issues, standing
as ‘the Speaker seeking re-election’. In the past it has been customary to allow the
Speaker an unopposed election but this is by no means settled practice and since the
end of the second world war the Speaker has been opposed in his constituency in
1945, 1950, 1955 and 1964.
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to make laws regulating the life
of the community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make
available finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the
funds necessary for the services of the State, and (3) to put relevant facts
and issues before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted
before the ratification of certain international treaties and agreements (in
spite of the fact that the making of treaties is a royal prerogative exercised
on the advice of the Government and, in theory, is not subject to parliamentary
approval).
Both Houses of Parliament have their own standing orders, but procedure
is based on custom and precedent (much of which dates back to the beginning
of the sixteenth century and even earlier) rather than on written orders,
which merely supplement the practice in each House. The system of debate
is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every matter is determined
upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and resolved in the affirmative
or negative, as the case may be; members speak from wherever they have been
sitting and not from a rostrum; and members do not read their speeches.
The main difference is that in the House of Commons the Speaker has a
far greater measure of control.
In the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no inherent
authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the
general sense of the House. In the Commons, on the contrary, the Speaker
has full authority to give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and
orders of the House. He must carefully guard against abuse of procedure
or any infringement of minority rights, and it is his duty to allow or disallow
any closure motion (i.e. a motion to end discussion so that the matter may be
put to the vote). He has certain powers to check irrelevance and repetition
in debate, and to save the time of the House in various other respects. In
cases of grave disorder, he has power to adjourn the House or suspend the
sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast, the Speaker must give the casting vote; he does this (if
38
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Legislation
possible) in such a way as to avoid change and leave the question to be debated
on another occasion. The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is
similar to that in the House of Commons, but the Speaker or chairman has
no casting vote. With the exception of questions relating to Bills and delegated
legislation, the House of Lords is governed by the principle that unless there
is a majority in favour, the question is decided in the negative. When the
House is sitting judicially (see pp. 83 and 86) the question is put in such a
way that, if the votes were equal, there would be no interference with the
order under appeal.
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare
occasions; the minutes (in the House of Commons called Notes and Pro¬
ceedings) and the speeches (Parliamentary Debates, Hansard) are published
daily.
Legislation can be initiated from either side of either House; but no Bill
involving taxation or the spending of public money can proceed very far
unless the Government agrees to introduce a ‘financial resolution’ to cover it.
This has the effect of giving the Government exclusive rights over a wide
field of legislation, and as a result most Public Bills are presented by the
Government. However, private members (i.e. members of the House who
are not office holders in the Government) can introduce Public Bills on their
own initiative, and such Bills can be debated on certain days expressly set
aside for the purpose in each session.1 Peers can introduce Public Bills in the
House of Lords at any time during a session without notice. In addition,
persons and bodies outside Parliament can promote Private Bills relating solely
to matters of individual, corporate or local interest.
Bills may originate in either House, unless they deal with finance or
representation when they are always introduced in the Commons. As a rule,
however, Bills likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons
before the Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature are
frequently introduced and fully debated in the Lords before being sent to
the Commons.
The process of passing a Public Bill is basically the same in the House of
Lords as in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal First Reading
on introduction; it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies
between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it
may be given a Second Reading after the result of a debate on its general
merits or principles. In the Commons, it is then referred for detailed
examination either to a standing committee or, if the House so decides, to
the whole House sitting in committee; and, in the Lords, to a committee of
the whole House. When the committee stage is finished, the Bill is reported
to the House, and a further stage takes place during which the committee s
amendments may be altered, additional amendments may be suggested and
incorporated, and, if necessary, the Bill may be recommitted to committee.
Finally, it is submitted for a Third Reading and, if passed, is sent on from
the Commons to the Lords or from the Lords to the Commons (depending
on its place of origin), where it enters on the same course again. Any amend¬
ments which the second House makes to the Bill must be agreed to by the
first House, or a compromise reached, before the Bill becomes law.
1 Private members may propose a Bill after question time on notice given, or seek leave
to introduce a Bill under the ‘Ten Minute Rule’, i.e. the Standing Order which allows
a brief speech proposing and another opposing the introduction of the Bill before the
House decides whether or not to grant leave.
GOVERNMENT
39
In practice, the Lords pass without amendment all financial Bills, such as
the Finance Bill, which authorises annual taxation and amends existing
taxation, and the Appropriation Bill, which authorises expenditure on the
Supply Services from the Consolidated Fund.1 As a general rule, these Bills
are introduced upon resolutions in a committee of the whole House of
Commons and they may be initiated only by a Minister of the Crown.
When Bills have passed through their various parliamentary stages, they are
sent to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, now usually given by commission.
The Sovereign’s power to refuse assent has not been exercised since the early
eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; they
are then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent.
However, should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would
never reach the Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it 
at any rate until a new government came into power, when it might be
revived. The Lords, on the other hand, are unlikely to be able to prevent a
Bill insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal
course of events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons and return it
unchanged; or they revise and improve it by amendments and return it for
the consideration of members of the other House, who frequently agree to
the amendments made. The Lords cannot require the Commons to agree to
amendments; nor can they delay a Bill indefinitely. They have no powers in
respect of Money Bills; and, since the passing of the Parliament Act 1949,
any other Public Bill which has been passed by the House of Commons in
two successive sessions may be presented for Royal Assent without the consent
of the Lords, provided that a year has elapsed between the date of the Second
Reading of the Bill in the Commons and the date on which it is finally passed
in that House. These limitations on the powers of the Lords are based on the
belief that the chief value of the Upper House, which is a non-elected assembly,
lies in bringing the wide experience of its members into the legislative process!
not in thwarting the elected House. In other words, proceedings in the House
of Lords give time for further reflection, and often elicit new points of view.
In substance, a Private Bill goes through the same procedure as a Public
Bill but most of the work is done in committee, where the promoters must
prove the need for the powers or privileges that they seek and where any
objections raised by opposing interests may be heard.
A committee of the whole House is presided over by a chairman instead of
the Speaker. Its function is to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after
their Second Reading. The Committees of Supply and of Ways and Means
are committees of the whole House of Commons; they discharge the financial
duties of the House concerning the grant of public money and the levying
of taxation.
There are two other main kinds of parliamentary committee, both of
which exist to relieve their parent House of some of its more specialised and
complex work. They are:
(1) Standing Committees, which are appointed by the House of Commons
as necessary, for the consideration of the committee stage of Public
Bills and, in the case of the Scottish and Welsh Grand Committees,
1 It is provided in the Parliament Act 1911 that all Money Bills sent to the House of
Lords one month before the end of the session shall receive the Royal Assent notwith¬
standing, if they are not passed by the Lords without amendment within the month.

other business referred to them. With the exception of the Scottish
Standing and Grand Committees1 2 (which deal with Public Bills and
other matters relating to Scotland), and the Welsh Grand Committee-
(which considers, on a limited number of days, subjects concerning
Wales and Monmouthshire referred to it), standing committees consist
of from twenty to fifty members nominated for each Bill by the
Committee of Selection (a body normally consisting of eleven members
drawn from the main parties in the House at the beginning of each
session); the parties are represented in proportion to their numbers in
the House. The procedure of a standing committee is generally similar
to that of a committee of the whole House.
(2) Select Committees, which are appointed to inquire into and report to
the House on special matters. Select Committees may be appointed
by either House when the occasion for such an appointment occurs,
or they may be appointed at the beginning of a session to consider all
aspects of a particular subject that may arise during the session. The
latter type of committee is known as a ‘sessional committee and includes
the Committee of Privileges, the Estimates and Public Accounts
Committees, the Committees on Nationalised Industries, Statutory
Instruments, Procedure, Public Petitions, Kitchen and Refreshment
Rooms, and Publications and Debates reports. There are also the
Selection Committee (see above) and the Standing Orders Committee,
which have duties relating to Private Bills, and joint select committees
of both Houses of Parliament which may be appointed at the instance
of either House.
In addition there are the parhamentary party committees: the Parliamentary
Labour Party, which is a corporate body comprising all members of the party
in both Houses; and the Conservative and Unionist Members Committee,
popularly known as the 1922 Committee, which consists of the back bench
membership of the party.
Delegated legislation, which is legislation not by the direct functioning of
Parliament but by powers conferred on the executive by Act of Parliament (or,
more rarely, by royal prerogative), has been part of the parliamentary system
for at least six hundred years. Parliament, however, made but sparing use
of its power to delegate legislation (except during a period of social, political
and economic change in the second half of the fifteenth and most of the
sixteenth centuries) until the end of the nineteenth century, when a changing
conception of the part that should be played by the State in the life of the
community made inroads upon parliamentary time and thus caused the
system to be adopted on a more extensive scale. With the ever-increasing scope
of government activity during the past sixty years, pressure on parliamentary
time has become even more acute; as a result, the system of delegated
legislation created under statutory powers has become generally accepted.
The system of delegated legislation empowers ministers and other author¬
ities to regulate administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order
to minimise the risk—inherent in the system—that delegated legislative

powers might supersede or weaken parliamentary government, such powers
are normally delegated to the Queen in Council or to authorities directly
responsible to Parliament, i.e. to ministers of the Crown, to government
departments for which ministers are responsible, or to organisations whose
legislation is subject to confirmation or approval by ministers who thereby
become responsible to Parliament for it. Moreover the Act which delegates
legislative power generally defines the precise limits of this power and, in
the more important cases, gives Parliament the right to confirm or annul the
statutory instruments1 by which delegated legislation is enacted. Certain
Acts also require direct consultation, before such legislation is made, with
organisations which will be affected by delegated legislation.
The House of Commons is aided in its supervision of delegated legislation
by the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments (see p. 40). The Special
Orders Committee of the House of Lords examines and reports on all
Statutory Instruments requiring affirmative resolution.
Parliamentary Parliamentary control of the Government in power is exercised in the final
analysis by the ability of the House of Commons to force the Government
to resign either by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a
proposal which the Government considers so vital to its policy that it has
made it a matter of confidence’; but this has not been its prime function
for many years (see p. 37). Parliamentary procedure offers a number of
opportunities for a searching examination of government policy by both the
Opposition and the Government’s own back-benchers. These include:
(1) Question Time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in
rotation, answer questions put to them on matters for which they are
responsible. So much parliamentary time is devoted to scheduled public
business that questions are valued as the best means of eliciting hitherto
unpublished information about the Government’s intentions; they are
also an effective way of airing, and possibly securing some redress of,
grievances brought to the notice of members by their constituents.
(2) The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the
House to initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public
concern. There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public
business every sitting day; on a day when public business ends before
the scheduled time the time saved may be used for adjournment
debates; and immediately before the adjournment for each recess
(Christmas, Easter, Whitsun and the Summer) there is a whole day
spent discussing topics selected either by the Opposition or by private
members. Moreover, if a member wishes to discuss a definite matter
of ‘urgent public importance’ he may, at the end of Question Time,
ask leave to move the adjournment of the House; if the Speaker accepts
the motion as being within the terms of the Standing Order and if, the
matter being referred to the House, 40 or more members rise to support
the motion, the matter is debated later the same day.
(3) The practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates, in Committee
of Supply, has ceased to be a consideration of the financial requirements
\ Statutory instruments are made in accordance with the provisions of the Statutory
Instruments Act, 1946, which repealed and replaced the Rules Publication Act 189-1.
Instruments of delegated legislation made under the Act of 1893 were known as
statutory rules and orders’ (‘S.R. & O.’).

of the Government and has become an occasion for the examination,
initiated by the Opposition, of some aspect of the Government’s
administrative policy, the cost of which has been included in the
Estimates.
The means by which Parliament, and more particularly the House of
Commons, exercises responsibility in the management of the revenues of the
State and payments for the public service are described in Chapter 14, Finance.
The Parliament of Northern Ireland consists of the Sovereign, a Senate and
a House of Commons. The Sovereign is represented in Northern Ireland by
a Governor, who summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament in Her
Majesty’s name; the Senate is composed of two ex officio senators (the Lord
Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor of Londonderry) together with 24 senators
who hold office for an eight-year term, 12 being elected by the House of
Commons every four years under a system of proportional representation; and
the House of Commons consists of 52 members, elected by a system of
parliamentary franchise similar to that which operates in Great Britain.
The House continues in existence for a period of five years unless it is
dissolved earlier.
The Northern Ireland Parliament has power to make laws for the peace,
order and good government of Northern Ireland in relation to all matters
except those especially reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom:
the Crown or succession to the Crown; foreign relations; defence; the
postal services; the Supreme Court; customs and excise, income and profits
taxes; coinage; standards of weights and measures; trade marks, submarine
cables; wireless telegraphy; aerial navigation; and lighthouses, buoys and
beacons. Under the constitutional practices which have developed since the
passing of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 the United Kingdom
Parliament does not legislate on matters within the powers of the Northern
Ireland Parliament unless the Government of Northern Ireland requests that
this should be done. But, because certain matters have been reserved to the
United Kingdom Parliament, provision was made in the Government of
Ireland Act 1920 for the continued representation of the Northern Ireland
constituencies in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, in
accordance with this provision, 12 members are returned to Westminster.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council,
was the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council declined in importance,
many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet, and much of its work
was handed over to newly created government departments. The present-day
Privy Council exists mainly to give effect to policy decisions made elsewhere.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy
Council (which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister as an honour to persons who have
reached eminence in some branch of public affairs in any country of the
Commonwealth. There are usually about 300 Privy Counsellors.
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk of the Council and is usually
presided over by the Sovereign. Three Privy Counsellors form a quorum,
GOVERNMENT
43
but, as a rule, not fewer than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy
Council is called together only on the death of the Sovereign or when the
Sovereign announces his or her intention to marry.
The Privy Council is responsible for the submission for the Sovereign’s
approval of Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing
fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal
prerogative, for example, those embodying royal instructions to colonial
Governors; and those which are authorised by Act of Parliament and are a
form of delegated legislation. Members of the Privy Council attending
meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not thereby become
personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders are based; this
rests with the ministers in whose departments the draft orders were framed,
whether they are present at the meeting or not. Certain Orders in Council
must be published in the London Gazette, which is an official periodical
published by the authority of the Government.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclama¬
tions, some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parliament.
Committees of
the Privy
Council
Judicial Committee
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These committees, which have advisory functions, may be
prerogative, such as the committee which deals with legislative matters
submitted by the legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man; or
they may be provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford
and Cambridge and the Scottish universities, and that which deals with
applications for the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out
in the Privy Council Office under the control of the Lord President of the
Council (see p. 44).
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal from
the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies and certain member States
of the Commonwealth, deriving its appellate jurisdiction in respect of such
appeals from the principle of English common law which recognises ‘the
right of all the King’s subjects to appeal for redress to the Sovereign in
Council’ if they believe that the courts of law have failed to do them justice.
The Judicial Committee is also the final court of appeal in a limited class of
ecclesiastical matters, from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and from
prize courts1 in the United Kingdom and dependencies.
Appeals come to the Judicial Committee either where a right of appeal
has been specially created, for example, by statute, Order in Council or
Letters Patent, or by special leave of the Sovereign in Council on the advice
of the Judicial Committee. They are heard by a board of the committee,
whose members are generally selected from the Lord Chancellor, ex-Lord
Chancellors and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, although other members of
the Privy Council who have held high judicial office (including Chief Justices
and certain other judges from other Commonwealth countries who have been
sworn of the Privy Council) may also be asked to sit when business is heavy.
The Judicial Committee does not deliver judgment; it advises the Sovereign,
who acts on its report and approves an Order in Council to give effect thereto.
1 Prize Courts deal with matters concerning property captured in time of war which, by
grace of the Crown, falls to the forces which assist in the capture.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time
being with the administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers
are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. There
are, however, always some ministers in the House of Lords, partly because
there is a statutory limit to the number of ministers who may sit and vote in
the Commons while receiving salaries from the Crown, and also because
every Government must be assured of spokesmen to expound and justify its
intentions and its actions to the House of Lords.
Composition
Prime Minister
Departmental
Ministers
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to
time, both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The
usual ministerial offices may be classified under the following heads:
The Prime Minister, who is the recognised head of the Government but
has no department.
Departmental Ministers, some of whom are known as Secretaries of State.
There are at present nine Secretaries of State: the First Secretary and Secre¬
tary of State for Economic Affairs; and the Secretaries of State for the Home
Department; Foreign Affairs; Scotland; Wales; Commonwealth Relations;
Colonies; Education and Science; and Defence. A few of the older posts
have special titles: the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for
the Treasury and a number of other departments), the President of the
Board of Trade and the Postmaster General.
Non-Departmental Ministers, who include the holders of various traditional
offices—the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster,1 the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and Ministers
without Portfolio. These ministers have few or no departmental duties and
are thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime Minister
may wish to entrust to them.
The Lord Chancellor has departmental functions; he is also in a somewhat
special position as a Minister of the Crown who is also head of the judiciary
in England and Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England
and Wales, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland,
the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of Defence Ministers of Defence, who are appointed for the Army, the Royal Navy and
the Royal Air Force under the Secretary of State for Defence.
Ministers of State Ministers of State, who are additional ministers in government departments
where the work is particularly heavy and complex, or where it involves
frequent travelling overseas. There are now four Ministers of State for Foreign
Affairs; three in the Department of Education and Science and at the Board
of Trade; and one each in the Department of Economic Affairs, the Home
Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office. The Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Secretary of State for Wales are also each assisted by a
Minister of State.
Junior Ministers Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or,
where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under-
Non-Departmental
Ministers
Lord Chancellor
and Lazv Officers

Secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to relieve
their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in parliamentary
debates and answering parliamentary questions, and by assisting in their
departmental duties. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and the
Junior Lords of the Treasury are in a different category as Government
Whips.
The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister during
the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority enjoyed by the
holder of this office derives from his ability to command a majority in
Parliament and from his power to submit his own choice of ministers to the
Sovereign and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. Nowadays,
by convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise
a general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences
and approving important departmental decisions where reference to the
Cabinet is not required. The Prime Minister speaks for the Government in
the House of Commons on the most important topics and answers questions
on its general administration in that House.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and certain other senior clergy and the incumbents of some 200
Crown livings, as well as for appointments to high judicial offices, such as
Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices of Appeal.
He also advises the Crown on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord
Lieutenants of counties1 and certain civil appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet
Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and some university appointments which
are in the gift of the Crown. The Prime Minister makes similar recom¬
mendations for appointments to various public boards and institutions, such
as the National Assistance Board and the British Broadcasting Corporation,
as well as to various royal and statutory commissions. In addition, he makes
recommendations to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and
distinctions and of Civil List pensions. He selects the trustees of certain
national museums and institutions.
The Cabinet is composed of a number of ministers (usually about 20) who
are selected by the Prime Minister personally. Its origins can be traced back
to the informal conferences that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers,
independently of the Privy Council, during the seventeenth century. After
the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an active role in politics in the eighteenth
century, and the development of organised political parties stimulated by
successive extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet
assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are2: the final determination of the policy
to be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive
in accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous
co-ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments.
1 The office of Lord Lieutenant of the county was first created in the sixteenth century.
Its holder was chief among the county justices and commander of the county militia.

Committee), 1918, Cd. 9230.

Cabinet
Meetings
Ministerial
Responsibility
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet
is a group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the
support of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the
publication of Cabinet as well as of other State papers, and a resigning
minister desiring to make a statement involving disclosure of Cabinet
discussions must first obtain the permission of the Sovereign through the
Prime Minister. From a practical point of view, this secrecy is essential in
the interests of unprejudiced discussion, which can only be maintained if there
is no risk of publicity for every statement made and every point conceded.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time, if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. During Cabinet
meetings decisions are reached on major issues of government policy, and
on other issues which cannot be settled elsewhere. A great deal of the work
of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system, which ensures that
the amount of business coming before the full Cabinet is kept at manageable
proportions. The system involves the reference of any issue either to a
standing Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc committee composed of the
ministers primarily concerned, which considers the matter in detail and
either disposes of it or reports upon it to the full Cabinet with recommendations
for action. Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend its meetings when
matters affecting their departments are under discussion; they may also be
members of Cabinet committees.
Detailed accounts of Cabinet meetings are not prepared; only the substance
of documents submitted, together with a summary of the arguments and
the conclusions, are recorded; even these records have a strictly limited
circulation. Responsibility for the keeping of records lies with the Secretary
of the Cabinet.
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which
ministers share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual
responsibility of ministers to Parliament for the work of their departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, imposes upon ministers the obligation to
act not as individuals but (in the interests of stability of government) as a
united group. It does not require every Cabinet minister to be present at
every Cabinet meeting; and the obligations of individual ministers may be
passive rather than active when the decision to be taken does not relate to
their spheres of administrative responsibility. At the same time, every
minister should be fully informed of the subject of discussion beforehand, so
that if he has any objections he may voice them at the meeting. He may not
repudiate, either in Parliament or in his constituency, policies which have
received Cabinet approval, nor may he adopt policies that have not been
agreed with the other departments concerned (including the Treasury). A
minister must also be prepared to vote with the Government on all issues,
and where necessary to speak in support or defence of its policy; if he feels
himself unable to agree or to compromise with the view of the majority of
his colleagues in Parliament or elsewhere he must resign unless the Cabinet
GOVERNMENT
47
has agreed otherwise. A minister who does not resign in these circumstances
cannot later reject criticism on the ground that he did not personally agree
with the policy adopted.
The doctrine of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet is
bound to offer unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members
do not hold identical views on a given subject.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of admin¬
istration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since
the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in
person. Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be
represented in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually their Parliamentary or Under-Secretaries.
Departmental ministers are expected to take the final decision on all
matters relating to their spheres of administration, unless these are of such
political importance that Cabinet sanction is required. If any departmental
decision brings a minister under criticism in Parliament he may be upheld
by the Cabinet, which will then treat the matter as one of confidence in itself;
or he may be disowned, when he alone will be liable to lose office.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any
departmental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament dis¬
courages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to
government policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation.
They may, and frequently do, work with and through local authorities,
statutory boards, and government-sponsored organisations operating under
varying degrees of government control.
A change of Government does not necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments, although a radical change in policy
may be accompanied by organisational change. The widening scope of
government activity in the past half-century, however, has led to the
formation of many new departments. A few have existed for over 200 years.
The work of some departments, for instance the Post Office and the Board
of Customs and Excise, covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other
departments, for example the Ministry of Labour, cover Great Britain
(England and Wales, and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland); others, such
as the Ministry of Health, cover England and Wales only, and there are
similar but separate departments for Scotland and Northern Ireland. There
is also a separate department with certain responsibilities for affairs in
Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in
which questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent
official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, Treasury ministers are responsible for a number of departments,
including H.M. Stationery Office, the Central Office of Information, the
Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Department of the Government
48
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Actuary, the Royal Mint, the National Debt Office, the Public Works Loan
Board, and the National Savings Committee. The staff of departments are
all members of the Civil Service, a body of Crown servants recruited into the
service as a career.
Internal Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
Organisation work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging
its duties there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments,
however, have certain features in common: for example, the minister of a
major department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent
secretary (known as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State in those depart¬
ments where the minister is a Secretary of State), one or more deputy secre¬
taries, and a varying number of under-secretaries and assistant secretaries. In
addition, major departments usually have a principal finance officer and a
principal establishments and organisation officer. A number of establishment
divisions have their own organisation and methods (‘O and M’) branch, the
members of which act in an advisory capacity. Many departments also have
their own legal advisers or solicitors, and their own information division.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.
Advisory Bodies Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or com¬
mittees (several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect
information, mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before
coming to a decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases
there is a statutory obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee.
In most cases, however, advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of
the minister concerned because he feels the need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved. Some are expert committees; others
include civil servants and representatives of varying interests and professions,
for instance, industrialists, trade unionists, university and industrial scientists,
educationists, lawyers and local government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recom¬
mendations on specific matters. For certain important inquiries Royal
Commissions, whose members are selected on the grounds of their wide
experience and diverse knowledge, may be appointed (by Royal Warrant).
Royal Commissions examine written and oral evidence from government
departments and other interested organisations and individuals, and on this
evidence submit recommendations. The Government may accept the
recommendations in whole or in part, or it may decide to take no further
action or may delay action until a later date. Inquiries may also be undertaken
by departmental committees, appointed by the head of the appropriate
department.

The Treasury
The Cabinet Office, a Secretariat of permanent officials, was instituted during
the first world war and has grown into an instrument of great importance in
the co-ordination of policy at the highest level. It operates under the direction
of the Prime Minister and its functions include circulating the memoranda
and other documents required for Cabinet business, preparing draft agenda
for approval by the Prime Minister, recording the discussions at Cabinet
meetings, circulating the minutes to members of the Cabinet (and a limited
number of other ministers and officials), and keeping in touch with the
progress of action on Cabinet decisions. The Cabinet Office is also responsible
for the security of all Cabinet documents.
Attached to the Cabinet Office, and an integral part of it, is the Central
Statistical Office, which is charged with the collection from departments of
statistics relating to the national economy, their analysis, and their prepara¬
tion as an agreed body of statistics to assist the Government in formulating
its economic and financial policy.
The Department of Economic Affairs is headed by the First Secretary of
State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, assisted by a Minister of
State and two Parliamentary Under-Secretaries.
The Department is organised in four inter-related groups. The economic
planning group works on the preparation of medium-term, long-term and
very long-range forecasts of the development of the economy. The industrial
policy group is concerned with medium and long-term measures affecting
industry, designed to promote efficiency and growth; the work of this group
is closely linked with the functions of the Economic Development Committees
in regard to individual industries. The economic co-ordination group is
responsible for the co-ordinati6n of inter-departmental work and also for
the application of prices and incomes policy, together with the relationship
of public expenditure programmes, to the use of resources and economic
growth; in addition it has important work in the co-ordination of external
economic affairs. The regional policy group is responsible for regional policy
and planning, including the regional aspects of policies on industry, employ¬
ment, land use and transport.
The Department works in close co-operation with the Treasury and other
departments.
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (now always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and five Junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners
never meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, assisted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and by
the Financial Secretary. There is also a Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury, who is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons.
Functionally, the Treasury is divided into four groups: the pay group,
which deals with the pay and working conditions of the various classes of civil
servants and handles questions about the pay of staffs in other parts of the
public service; the management group, responsible for developing manage¬
ment services, whose activities include organisation and methods work,
inquiries into and comparisons of management practices over a wide field,
and work on recruitment, training, manning and grading in the Civil Service;
the finance group, which brings together all questions affecting home and
overseas finance; and a fourth group, concerned with balancing public expen-

diture against national resources and organising the control of this expenditure
under such headings as defence, social services, agriculture and transport.
The Treasury has prime responsibility for short-term economic assessments
and works in close co-operation with the Department of Economic Affairs on
economic analysis and forecasting, and many other questions.
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of
all government Bills, except those Bills or provisions of Bills extending
exclusively to Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Depart¬
ment. The Office drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and
amendments moved by the Government during the passage of Bills through
Parliament; it advises departments on questions of parliamentary procedure;
and it attends sittings in both Houses of Parliament. In addition, it drafts
delegated legislation when specially instructed, and advises the Government
on legal, parliamentary and constitutional questions falling within its special
experience.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible in England
and Wales for administering government policy for agriculture, horticulture
and fishing. The Ministry administers deficiency payments schemes and
various grants and subsidies designed to improve the efficiency of the
industries, and also gives free technical advice.
Schemes for the control and eradication of animal and plant diseases are
also administered by the Ministry, whose reponsibilities extend to Scotland
in the operational control of certain diseases of animals.
In England and Wales the Ministry also deals with certain questions relating
to legislation about food, including labelling and advertising, slaughter¬
houses, and the quality and cleanliness of milk. Questions relating to the
supply and manufacture of food, its consumption, composition, preservation
and nutritional qualities, are dealt with by the Ministry for Great Britain
or the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign
countries and participates in the work of certain international organisations
concerned with agriculture, fisheries and food, such as the Food and Agricul¬
ture Organisation of the United Nations.
The Ordnance Survey is administered by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, although it is itself responsible for its day-to-day
affairs. It is in charge of the survey and mapping of Great Britain—the
maps and plans resulting from the survey ranging in scale from 1/1,250
to 1/1,250,000. The Survey also undertakes a considerable amount of agency
work in compilation, drawing and printing for other departments, particularly
the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources and the
Land Registry.
The Ministry of Aviation is responsible for the execution of government
policy relating to civil aviation, the aircraft industry and the guided weapons
industry. It is also responsible for certain aspects of space research and
technology and for procuring certain equipment for the fighting services.
The Ministry’s civil aviation responsibilities include the regulation of
flying, the promotion of air safety and efficiency, the provision, administration
and equipment of state-controlled civil aerodromes and other ground services,
the organisation of research on, and development of, civil aircraft, the
negotiation of international air transport agreements, the registration of

aircraft, the licensing of aerodromes, operators and personnel, and research on
air navigation. The Minister appoints the members of the nationalised airline
corporations and deals with various policy and financial questions affecting
them. He also appoints the members of the Air Transport Licensing Board.
The Ministry’s defence responsibilities include the research, development
and production involved in supplying the fighting services with aircraft,
guided missiles, nuclear weapons and electronic equipment.
The Colonial Office is concerned with the remaining dependent territories of
the United Kingdom. Each of these territories has its own administration
but the British Government is finally responsible for their good government
and for their relations with other countries. In discharging its responsibilities
for the constitutional and other development of the territories the Colonial
Office co-operates closely with other departments, particularly the Foreign
Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Ministry of Overseas
Development.
The Commonwealth Relations Office advises the Secretary of State for
Commonwealth Relations on all aspects of Commonwealth relations, com¬
municates on his behalf with other Commonwealth Governments, keeps in
touch with and advises other United Kingdom government departments on
Commonwealth policy, provides information to the press and the public
about Commonwealth activities, and deals generally with matters affecting
members of the Commonwealth both as a group and as individual members.
Relations with the Republic of Ireland also fall within the responsibility
of the Commonwealth Secretary; although it is no longer a Commonwealth
country the Irish Republic is for most purposes not treated as a foreign
country.
The primary work of the Board of Customs and Excise is to collect and
administer the customs and excise duties imposed from time to time in the
annual Finance Acts or by other legislation, and to advise the Chancellor
of the Exchequer on any matters connected with them. The Board is also
responsible for preventing and detecting evasion of the revenue laws, including
smuggling and illicit distillation.
The Board undertakes a wide range of non-revenue agency work for other
departments, for instance, the enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions
on the importation and exportation of certain classes of goods, exchange
currency control, and the compilation of United Kingdom overseas trade
statistics from customs import and export documents.
The government department responsible for the formulation of defence
policy and for the control and administration of the three fighting Services
is the Ministry of Defence. The Secretary of State for Defence is in charge
of the department and there are three Ministers of Defence—for the Army,
the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force respectively—who have special
responsibilities for the Service with which they are concerned and general
responsibilities for the defence service as a whole. The Minister of Defence
for the Army also acts as deputy to the Secretary of State for Defence, with
particular responsibility for the co-ordination of politico-strategic policy
other than day to day operations; the Minister for the Royal Navy
co-ordinates personnel matters and logistics and deals with problems of
administrative rationalisation; and the Minister for the Royal Air Force

The Meteorological Office provides the national weather service and meteoro¬
logical library. It supplies the material for sound and television forecasts and
much of the weather data published by the press. Local weather information
centres have been opened in London, Glasgow, Manchester and Southampton,
from which inquirers may get facts and forecasts, usually free of charge,
covering most of the northern hemisphere. The Office is also responsible for
meteorological, climatological, and geophysical research.
The Department of Education and Science is organised in two administrative
units. One of these is concerned with schools and other education (including
vocational, recreational and adult education and the youth service) in England
and Wales; the other deals with the universities and civil science throughout
Great Britain. The Secretary of State for Education and Science is responsible
for the whole work of the Department and is assisted by two Ministers of
State, one for each of the two units.
In discharging its responsibilities for the development of primary,
secondary and other education, which includes dealing with the supply,
training and superannuation of teachers, the building of new schools and
other institutions, the school health service, the special educational treatment
of handicapped children, and the provision of school meals and milk, the
Department works in co-operation with local education authorities—the
councils of the counties and the county boroughs—whose duty it is to secure
adequate facilities for all forms of education in their areas. Its relations with
the universities are conducted through the University Grants Committee
(appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to advise on State aid to
universities). Its activities in the field of civil science are discharged through
a number of research councils, including the Medical and the Agricultural
Research Councils, the Natural Environment Research Council (which
carries out and supports research in earth science and ecology) and the Science
Research Council (which carries out scientific research and is responsible for
research grants and postgraduate training awards not within the fields of
the other councils, and is also concerned with research in nuclear science
and scientific space research, both in the United Kingdom and overseas).
The Secretary of State is advised concerning finance for the research councils
by the Council on Scientific Policy.
The Foreign Office, under the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, acts
as a channel of communication between the British Government and the
Governments of foreign States for the discussion and negotiation of all matters
falling within the field of international relations, including the drawing up
of international treaties and agreements. It also provides the means by
which the British Government is represented in the United Nations and on
other international bodies1 and is kept informed of developments in foreign
countries; by which British subjects and interests abroad are protected and
trade promoted; and by which British policy is explained to foreign
Governments and peoples.
1 Other government departments provide delegates and carry the expenses of con¬
tributions to many relevant international organisations (see pp. 50, 53, 173, 221,
255 and 438). In 1964 Britain’s contributions to the United Nations’ regular budget,
to the Special Accounts and Specialised Agencies amounted to some £13 million.

with which more than one of the departments are concerned or which fall
outside the province of any of them) by the Permanent Under-Secretary of
State, Scottish Office, who is free from departmental duties.
The Department has a general responsibility for, and in most cases admin¬
isters, government measures for the promotion and development of farming
in Scotland. In certain of these functions the Department is assisted by eleven
agricultural executive committees, constituted of members of the agricultural
industry and organised on an area basis.
The Department has responsibilities for the oversight and protection of
the Scottish inshore, deep sea and fresh-water fisheries. It also has functions
relating to harbours, to steamer services in the Highlands and Islands and to
general questions concerning Highland development.
The Scottish Development Department is concerned with a number of the
main services affecting the physical development of Scotland, such as town
and country planning, new towns, housing, roads, water supplies and sewerage,
coast protection, flood protection, and the prevention of river and air pollution
(most of which are administered locally by town and county councils) and
with the policy of the Electricity Boards in Scotland. The Department is
responsible for general policy in regard to local government, including its
financial aspects such as valuation, rating, and the allocation of the Exchequer
general and equalisation grants.
The Scottish Education Department supervises the administration of the
Education (Scotland) Acts and guides, through the local education authorities
and other bodies, the development of public education in Scotland in all its
forms. The Department’s functions include: the supervision of the training
of teachers and the issue of teachers’ certificates; the regulation of teachers’
salaries and the administration of the Teachers (Superannuation) (Scotland)
Regulations; the control and distribution of specific Exchequer grants in aid
of educational expenditure; and the award of students’ allowances to those
taking full-time degree and comparable courses. The Department also exercises
general supervision over the child care and adoption services, remand homes,
and approved schools and is concerned with the administration of the Royal
Scottish Museum.
The Scottish Home and Health Department is responsible for: (a) the
central administration of functions relating to law and order; and (b) the
health and welfare services in Scotland. Under (a) the Department is con¬
cerned with the police and probation services, criminal justice, legal aid and
the services needed by the courts, and is directly responsible for the adminis¬
tration of prisons and borstal institutions. It is also the central authority in
Scotland for the fire service, for civil defence, and for legislation concerning

shops, theatres, cinemas and licensed premises (which are directly maintained
by the Department in districts in which State management is in operation).
Under (b) the Department is responsible for the administration of the National
Health Service. Its work in connection with the associated welfare services
includes the supervision of local arrangements for the aged and handicapped,
and medical and surgical treatment for war pensioners.
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Scottish Information
Office, which undertakes information services on behalf of the Scottish
departments and, to some extent, for Great Britain departments in Scotland,
and acts as the agent in Scotland of the Central Office of Information; the
Department of the Registrar-General for Scotland (the General Registry
Office); the Scottish Record Office; and the Department of the Registers
of Scotland. There are also Scottish branches of the Great Britain and United
Kingdom departments under the direction of controllers, who are responsible
for ensuring that the execution in Scotland of the policy and procedure of
their departments is in accordance with Scottish conditions and needs.
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned
with questions of legal policy and administration and is himself responsible
for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland,
and the control of summary prosecutions in the sheriff court.
In some of this work the Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate s
Department, the members of which also act as legal advisers on Scottish
questions to certain government departments who have no Scottish legal
adviser of their own. The work relevant to prosecutions is centred in the
Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland are incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department and are responsible to the minister concerned and
to the Law Officers for the drafting of all government Bills in so far as they
affect the law of Scotland. Their responsibilities in this connection are
similar to those of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury.
Executive and administrative powers on matters under the jurisdiction of
the Northern Ireland Parliament are vested in the Crown, and exercised
by the Governor, acting on the advice of the Northern Ireland Cabinet,
through a number of departments. Each of the seven ministries (Agriculture,
Commerce, Development, Education, Finance, Health and Social Services,
and Home Affairs) is under the control of a Minister responsible to the
Northern Ireland Parliament. In addition, there are a National Assistance
Board and an Exchequer and Audit Department which, together with the
Ministries of Home Affairs, Education, and Agriculture, have functions
indicated by their titles. The other departments have duties of a varied
nature, which are summarised below.
The Prime Minister’s Department includes the Cabinet Secretariat, the
Information Service and the Economic Section. It corresponds with the
Government of the United Kingdom on major matters of policy and acts as

a channel of communication between the Governor and the Cabinet and
between the Cabinet and departments.
The basic functions of the Ministry of Finance are the settlement of financial
questions with the United Kingdom Treasury, the financial control of
Northern Ireland departments, and the management of the Civil Service.
In connection with these functions the Ministry is responsible for the control
of borrowing, the issue of Ulster Savings securities, government loans to
local or public authorities, the collection of stamp duties, death duties and
certain excise duties, the collection of land purchase annuities and the staffing,
recruitment and training of the Civil Service and the regulation of its
conditions.
Other responsibilities of the Ministry include the provision of buildings for
the Northern Ireland Government and certain departments of the United
Kingdom Government, the preservation of ancient monuments, the Public
Record Office, valuation, ordnance survey, the Land Registry and the Registry
of Deeds, censuses, the registration of births, deaths and marriages, and
certain duties in relation to charities and charitable funds.
The Office of the Parliamentary Draftsmen, which prepares Bills for
introduction into Parliament, is attached to the Ministry.
The Ministry of Commerce is concerned with industrial information and
statistical services; the progress of industrial production and trade in
Northern Ireland; the development of existing enterprises and the attraction
of new ones; and the administration of schemes of financial assistance to
industry. The department also has responsibilities in relation to electricity
and gas undertakings; harbours; the tourist trade; the regulation and
inspection of mines and quarries; mineral development; scientific develop¬
ment; weights and measures; the registration of companies and friendly
societies; and the administration of the Assurance Companies Acts and the
Industrial Assurance Acts.
The Ministry of Development is responsible for housing, planning, water
supplies, sewerage, local government matters, the planning of new towns,
roads, railways and public transport.
The Ministry of Health and Social Services is responsible for the work
connected with employment services, industrial training, industrial concilia¬
tion, national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances, and has
functions relating to hospitals and health and welfare services.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of
a political or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose
remuneration is found wholly and directly out of money voted by Parliament.
The number of civil servants under this definition is about a million, for it
includes several hundred thousand government industrial employees in such
establishments as Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Navy dockyards. The
term ‘Civil Service’ is, however, generally used only to cover ‘non-industrial’
members of the staffs of the various government departments in the United
Kingdom or working overseas. The total number of non-industrial civil

the Modern
Civil Service

Service

Classes
servants employed in all departments, at home and overseas, is nearly 700,ooo1;
more than one-third are women.
Although the civil servant is legally a servant of the Crown, in practice
he serves the minister in charge of the department in which he works by
advising on the formulation of policy and by carrying out policy decisions
once they have been taken. From time to time the minister changes but the
civil servant remains to serve his successor. In Britain changes of government
do not involve changes in departmental personnel, since it is considered that
continuity makes for administrative stability.
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years.
Before then, departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying
standards were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political
jobbery was rife. Measures of reform instigated during the nineteenth
century included the substitution of open competition for the practice of
obtaining civil service appointments by favour or purchase, and the establish¬
ment of an independent body, the Civil Service Commission, to organise
recruitment to the service. The great expansion in State activity in the last
fifty years, and the consequent increase in the numbers of civil servants and
the scope of their duties, have led to further reorganisation: recruitment
competitions have been adapted to a developing educational system;
co-ordination between the various departments has been improved; and many
commissions and committees of inquiry have been appointed by the
Government to make recommendations for increased efficiency in the conduct
of public business. Moreover, civil servants, though they remain employees
of their departments, have become members of an integrated service with
common conditions of employment and their traditions and standards of
conduct belong, not to individual departments, but to the Civil Service as
a whole.
Uniformity in the Civil Service derives mainly from the fact that the
Treasury exercises general control. One of the two Joint Permanent Secre¬
taries to the Treasury is the official head of the Home Civil Service and the
principal adviser of the Prime Minister on matters affecting the Civil Service
as a whole, and in particular on appointments to senior posts in the service.
The Treasury is responsible for the salaries and conditions of employment
of all civil servants; it controls the total number of staff and the creation of
higher posts, maintains a central organisation and methods division which
serves all departments which do not maintain an organisation and methods
branch of their own, and deals with general questions relating to training
after entry into the Civil Service. It is also concerned with the number of
departments and the distribution of functions between them.
Because modern government touches almost every aspect of life, the Civil
Service comprises officers with a wide variety of professional and technical
qualifications. Where officers of a particular type are required in more than
one department they are organised in general service or linked departmental
classes. This ensures similar grading and salary structures for the same type
of officer in each department. The main classes are:
1. The Administrative Class, which is responsible for advising ministers on

one whole-time officer.

policy, for dealing with any difficulties which may arise in carrying out
existing policy and for forecasting the probable effects of new measures
and regulations. This relatively small class, which numbers about 2,300,
is recruited largely from the universities: non-graduates form about
one-quarter of the total. (The equivalent grades in the Diplomatic
Service (see below) number about 1,000.)
2. The Executive Classes (General and Departmental, numbering some
77,000), which are responsible for the day-to-day conduct of government
business, including, for instance, the higher work of accounts and
revenue collection, within the framework of established policy. Members
of these classes may, after entry, train for specialist work such as that of
auditor, actuary or statistician.
3. The Specialist Classes (General and Departmental), which number
about 131,000 in a variety of different categories, carry out the wide
range of specialised activities which are now undertaken by the Govern¬
ment. The categories include accountants, architects, doctors, engineers,
lawyers, surveyors and scientists in all branches of science. The
professionally qualified staff are assisted by a large number of technical
and drawing office staffs.
4. The Clerical Class (General and Departmental) comprises about 130,000
officers who undertake all the usual clerical work involved in running
departmental business: for instance, the preparation of accounts and
the keeping of records, the handling of particular claims in accordance
with known rules, and the summarising and annotation of documents
for the assistance of senior officers. The personal secretaries of senior
officers are included in this group, together with officers directly
responsible for the supervision of clerical work.
5. The Ancillary Clerical Classes (with about 102,000 members), which
include clerical assistants, shorthand typists and typists, duplicator
operators and a rapidly increasing number of machine-operating grades.
6. Messengerial and Minor Classes (with some 34,000 members) which, in
addition to messengers, include paper keepers, office cleaners and
similar workers.
In addition there are other departmental classes where employment is
peculiar to one department: for instance, the Post Office, with its postmen
(115,000), telephone operators (53,000), postal and telegraph officers (23,000)
and a wide range of staff for the installation, maintenance and development
of the telephone, telegraph and wireless systems. Other examples are the
Factory Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and the Schools Inspectorate
of the Ministry of Education and Science.
The Diplomatic The Diplomatic Service, comprising some 6,400 civil servants, was created
Service on 1st January, 1965, to take in the duties, personnel and posts of the former
Foreign Service, Commonwealth Service and Trade Commission Service.
The offices of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Secretary of State
for Commonwealth Relations remain separate but the staffs of the Foreign
and Commonwealth Relations Offices are drawn from the combined service.
The Diplomatic Service has its own grade structure, corresponding by
salary with the grades of the Administrative, Executive and Clerical Classes1
1 The numbers in these separate classes are included in the equivalent Home Civil
Service Grades.
66 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the Home Civil Service; it also has Secretarial, Communications and
Security Guard branches. Various specialists and advisers from home
departments or the armed forces may serve at overseas posts on secondment
or attachment to the Diplomatic Service.
The Government of Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which deals
with matters transferred to its jurisdiction under the Government of Ireland
Act 1920. Subject to regional differences, the Northern Ireland Civil Service
is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, but recruitment to permanent
and pensionable posts is effected through the medium of a separate Civil
Service Commission. Interchange of staff between the two Civil Services
occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for departmental agreement
in individual cases.
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but
because not all vacancies can be filled in this way, the Ministry for Overseas
Development and the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and
Administrations are asked to recruit other candidates, principally from the
United Kingdom.
Recruitment of The recruitment of permanent civil servants in the Home Civil Service of
Staff Great Britain and the Diplomatic Service is in the hands of the Civil Service
Commission which, in the selection of entrants, is independent of both
ministerial and parliamentary control; its members are appointed by the
Crown on the advice of the Government. The normal method of entry is by
open competition, conducted in accordance with regulations approved by
the Treasury and consisting of written examination or interviews, or both.
The main points of entry into the main classes of the Home Civil Service
are planned to correspond to definite levels in the British educational
system, and it is the Commission’s duty to study the requirements of the
Civil Service in the light of the education provided by the schools and
universities.
Temporary civil servants are normally recruited by the department
concerned. No special qualifying examinations are required.

Training after In all except the smaller government departments, there are full-time training
Entry officers and instructors who organise both general and technical courses,
ranging from courses of systematic instruction for recruits in all classes to
‘refresher’ courses covering technical subjects or broader subjects, such as
management, organisation and communications, for more experienced staff.
Young people are given opportunities to continue their studies under day
release’1 schemes.
Methods of training include discussion groups, case studies, instructional
films and the preparation of self-instruction programmes (‘programmed
learning’). There are also exchanges to enable civil servants to study the
working of appropriate outside bodies. Officers in the early years of their
service may be transferred from branch to branch and, more rarely, from
department to department, in order that they may gain as wide an experience
as possible of Civil Service activities, and there are openings for selected
1 Schemes by which young employees and apprentices are released by their employers
for study, usually on one day a week.

officers to travel abroad or to study at universities, technical colleges and
other educational establishments. Facilities are provided for officers who take
up private studies to have some degree of assistance, depending upon the
vocational value of the subject.
Training is co-ordinated by the Training and Education Division of the
Treasury, which is also responsible, with the National Whitley Council1, for
guidance and some aid to departments in the organisation and performance
of their training through a team of Training Liaison Officers. The Division
also runs central courses for members of the administrative, professional and
scientific classes at different stages of their careers and trains departmental
instructors and other special groups, for instance, superintendents of typists,
secretaries and staff in establishment divisions.
The Civil Service National Whitley Council’s Joint Committee, set up to
review training in the Service since 1944, published its report on training in
1964. Discussions on its implementation are proceeding with departments.
A period of probation (lasting from one to two years according to grade, with
extensions in certain instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent
Civil Service. Promotions from grade to grade are made by departments;
those from class to class partly through centrally conducted competitions
(open only to serving members of specified Civil Service classes), and partly
by departments themselves. All promotions to the administrative class from
other classes require Treasury approval. Promotions to most of the highest
positions in the Civil Service, i.e. permanent secretaries, deputy secretaries,
principal establishments officers and principal finance officers, must be
approved by the Prime Minister; he is advised in these matters by the official
head of the Home Civil Service.
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service
as a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council, which is composed
jointly of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate
sections of the service is provided through the various staff associations which
civil servants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil Service Clerical
Association, the Union of Post Office Workers, the Society of Civil Servants,
the Institution of Professional Civil Servants, and the Association of First
Division Civil Servants), and through departmental Whitley Councils (of
which there are about 70).
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is based on a fair
comparison with that paid for similar work outside the service and usually he
receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to
which he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the
pleasure of the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice
he enjoys a considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every permanent
civil servant, who is capable and efficient, may reasonably expect a full career
in the public service and a pension on retirement2—though this, again, is
not a legal right.
Civil servants are required to work a specified number of hours each week.

longer than the required hours. The standard working week for office staffs
is 42 hours1 in London and 43 hours2 in the provinces. Annual leave vanes
according to grade up to a maximum of six weeks, i.e. 30 working days, a
year Sick leave on full pay, less any national insurance benefit received,
may be granted to permanent civil servants for up to six months m any twelve
months, and on reduced pay up to a maximum of one year’s sick leave in any
four years; any officer whose health is permanently impaired may be retired
on medical grounds.
Officially, the position and functions of a civil servant remain the same
whichever political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the government
of the day irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to whic a
civil servant, as a private individual, is free to participate in political activities
varies according to grade. For this purpose civil servants are divided into
three groups: those who are completely free to engage in all kinds of nationa
and local political activities (although if they intend standing for Parliament,
they must resign their appointment before nomination day3); those who are
free subiect to the acceptance of the need for discretion and with the per¬
mission of the department, to take part in most activities except parliamentary
candidature; and those who are debarred from national political activi ics
though they may seek permission to take part in local government an
political activities. In the non-industrial Civil Service, the completely free
groups are the manipulative grades of the Post Office, and the minor grades
such as cleaners and messengers. The intermediate group includes mainly
clerical and typing grades, and the granting of permission by the ^partmen
depends, broadly, on the nature of the work done. The group which not
allowed to take part in national political activities includes the executive -e
professional, the scientific and technical, and the administrative grades.
In general, because the reputation of the service must be closely guarded,
permission to take part in local political activities will be refused to mem ers
of this group if the local activities are conducted on the same party lines and
through the same party organisations as national political activities Where
permission is granted, it is subject to a code of discretion and to the obligation
to notify the department of election or co-option to a local council.
Civil servants of every grade may, of course, exercise the right of all
citizens to register their private political opinions on appropriate occasions,
for instance, at general or local authority elections They may also engage
in such private activities as they wish, provided that these do not m any
way conflict with their official duties, nor with the provisions of the Official
Secrets Acts ion and 1920, and the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906.
However, since a civil servant must not use his official position to further his
private interests, he is subject to certain restrictions in commerce and business.
for instance, he may not hold private interests m public contracts and he may
not use official information in writing, broadcasting or lecturing without the
approval of his department.
The political views of civil servants are not as a general rule a matter of
official concern, but there are some civil service duties in which secrecy is
so vitally important to State security that the Government does not fee

itself justified in employing any one to carry them out whose reliability is in
doubt. For this reason no one who is known to be a member of, or actively
associated or in sympathy with, the Communist Party or with Fascist
organisations is employed in connection with secret work.
Each government department is responsible for its own internal security
and the Security Service, which operates independently under a Director-
General who is responsible for its efficiency to the Home Secretary, deals
with national security. In addition, there is a Security Commission which, if
requested by the Prime Minister in consultation with the leader of the
Opposition, may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public
service and, in certain circumstances, advise whether any change in security
arrangements is necessary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of
the United Kingdom for many centuries. In its present shape it dates back
to the late nineteenth century, when the conception of a comprehensive
system of locally elected councils to manage various services provided for the
benefit of the community was first incorporated in statute law. The large
increase in population since that time, and the equally massive transformation
in the range, complexity and scale of local authority functions, have made
it necessary to review local government throughout England and Wales.
In Greater London the system has been reorganised and proposals have been
made in other areas (see p. 77) for a new structure more closely related to
contemporary and possible future needs.
Relationship
between
Central and
Local
Government
Local authorities are set up under the authority of Parliament, and their
powers and duties are defined by Acts of Parliament. Basically councils are
responsible to the law and to the local electors and not to the central
Government. They determine their own budgets, and no minister of the
Crown has power to suspend or dismiss them, nor to inquire into the way in
which they organise their business. However, in respect of certain services,
Acts of Parliament dealing with local government give ministers of the Crown
defined powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure of national
uniformity in the standard of service provided, or to safeguard public health,
while others are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens. For
some services the minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for
some there are strictly limited powers; for others no provision at all is made
for ministerial supervision.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local
government give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory
circulars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main link between
local authorities and the central Government in England; in Scotland the
Scottish Development Department is responsible for general policy in regard
to local government; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ireland the
Ministry of Development.
Principal Types
of Local
Authority
The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
(outside the Greater London area) and Northern Ireland is a division of the
country into county boroughs and administrative counties. The county
boroughs (mostly with populations of over 75,000) are separate from the
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
counties and independent of them. The administrative counties are sub¬
divided into county districts—non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural
districts, the last-named being further divided into parishes1 2 (except in
Northern Ireland). Scotland is divided into counties (including four counties
of cities) which are independently administered; large and small burghs, and
districts. Each local authority division is administered by its own elected
council. In England and Wales (outside the Greater London area) there are
c8 county councils, 82 county borough councils, 276 non-county boroug
councils, 547 urban district councils, 473 rural district councils,- about
7,coo parish councils and some 3,300 parish meetings (in parishes not large
enough to have a parish council); in Scotland, 33 county councils (two pairs
being combined for certain purposes), 200 town councils (including ^ur lor
counties of cities) and 198 district councils (two counties not being divided
into districts); and in Northern Ireland, two county borough councils,
6 county councils, 10 non-county borough councils, 24 urban district counci s
and 31 rural district councils.
The Greater London area is administered by the councils of 32 London
boroughs and the City of London, and by the Greater London Council (GLC).
Constitution Local councils comprise a number of unpaid elected councillors (and, in some
and Election of cases, aldermen elected by the councillors), presided over by a chairman who
Councils has varied ceremonial and civic duties to perform in addition to his work
on the council. In most boroughs of England and Wales and Northern
Ireland the chairman is the Mayor; in the City of London and certain
important boroughs, the Lord Mayor; in the Scottish counties, the Convener;
and in the burghs, the Provost or Lord Provost.
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local
government is three years; aldermen normally hold office for six years. In
some local authority areas the whole council retires every third year and
another is elected immediately; in other areas elections are held annually,
when one-third of the councillors retire. Procedure at local government
elections is governed by rules laid down by the Representation of the People
Any4person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to
vote at a local government election provided that he or she is 21 years of age
or over on the qualifying date, is a British subject or a citizen of the Ins
Republic, is not subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a loca
government elector for the area for which the election is held. In Great
Britain a person qualifies for registration as a local government elector it,
on the qualifying date for the register (compiled annually), he or she is resident
in the council area or occupies therein, as owner or tenant, any rateable lan
or premises of a yearly value of not less than £10. In Northern Ireland, in
order to qualify for registration as a local government elector, a person must
have been born in Northern Ireland or, alternatively, have resided con¬
tinuously in the United Kingdom for seven years immediately prior to the
qualifying date and must have either a resident occupiers or a genera
occupier’s qualification. .
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer con¬
cerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for t e
purpose. The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar

to that for parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are more
restricted. Each elector has one vote for each seat contested in his electoral
area; he need not record all his votes, but must not give more than one vote
for each candidate.
Most candidates for election as councillor stand as representatives of one
of the national political parties; a few stand as members of an association
representing some local interest, or as independents. Each candidate must
be nominated by two electors, as proposer and seconder; and in England
and Wales (except in elections for rural district councils and parish councils)
eight other electors for the area must assent to the nomination. In Scotland
each county and district council candidate requires two proposers and each
town council candidate a proposer and five assenters. Candidates must be of
British nationality, over 21 years of age, and must (1) be registered as local
government electors in the register of electors for the area for which they seek
election, or (2) have resided within that area during the whole of the twelve
months preceding the election (or within 3 miles in the case of parish councils),
or (3) in England and Wales, own freehold or leasehold land in the area.
Candidates are also subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed
to ensure that unsuitable persons do not offer themselves for election.
Procedure at local government elections in Northern Ireland is governed by
the Electoral Law Act (N.I.) 1964 and regulations made thereunder by the
Ministry of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland. These regulations are, in
general, similar to those which apply in Great Britain, though differing in
certain particulars; for example, the town clerk or the clerk to the council
is the returning officer for all elections to the authority; there is no postal
voting and the only persons who may vote by proxy are Service voters.
Most local authority areas are divided into electoral districts for local
council elections. Administrative counties are split up, in accordance with
orders made by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Minister
of Housing and Local Government, the Secretary of State for Scotland, into
‘electoral divisions’. Boroughs (except London boroughs), urban and rural
districts in England and Wales, and burghs in Scotland, are either divided into
‘wards’, or, if they are small, left as single units. In rural districts the wards
are based on parishes which, if large enough, may be split into parish wards.
County divisions each return one member to the council. In the first
elections (held in April 1964) each London borough elected two to four
councillors to the Greater London Council: in future elections, boroughs
are to be divided into electoral areas (covering in most cases the same areas
as parliamentary constituencies), each of which will return one councillor. In
other types of local authority area each ward may return one or more members.
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer
such environmental and social services as Acts of Parliament require it to
provide and administer. It may provide additional services under the
permissive powers of a general Act or under powers granted to it by local or
Private Bill legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon their type, as follows:
in England (outside the Greater London area) and Wales county borough
councils are all-purpose authorities, while both county councils and county
district councils have particular functions allotted to them,1 which they
1 For instance, county councils are generally responsible for the police, fire and civil
defence services, while the district councils administer most of the environmental and
sanitary services.

exercise independently to a considerable extent, although there is a certain
degree of delegation from county councils to county district councils,
especially of duties connected with town and country planning and the
education, health and welfare services. Parish councils or parish meetings
have a few functions of local interest which they may exercise of right. In
Scotland the town councils of the counties of cities are all-purpose authorities;
elsewhere, the county councils, the town councils and the district councils
all share in local government work. In Northern Ireland the position is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales, except that local authorities
are not called upon to provide or administer police, civil defence or (except in
Belfast) fire services; moreover county councils do not in general delegate any
of their functions to county district councils.
In Greater London the basic units of local government are the London
boroughs; the GLC is responsible only for those services which, by their
nature, require unified administration and control over the whole area. In
the City of London (an area of approximately one square mile in the centre
of the metropolis) the City Corporation exercises the general powers admin¬
istered and duties performed by the London borough councils.
Local authority services may be classified under three heads: environ¬
mental, protective and personal. The environmental services are designed
to secure local good order, amenity and public health. They include the
inspection and abatement of nuisances, drainage, sewerage, street cleansing,
refuse collection and disposal, litter prevention, rodent control, the super¬
vision of water supplies, measures for ensuring food hygiene and for preventing
air pollution, and the provision of baths and washhouses. They also include
the services for bridge and highway construction and maintenance, for street
lighting, public safety on the roads, and the provision of recreation grounds,
parks and similar amenities. Town and country planning is the major
environmental service. The protective services are the fire service, the civil
defence service and the police service, while the personal ser\ ices range
from health services, education and housing to the provision of public
entertainment.
Local services concerned primarily with health and welfare cover the
provision of ante-natal, post-natal and child welfare clinics, and some resi¬
dential and day nurseries; the provision and supervision of midwifery services,
health visitors and home nursing facilities; measures for the pre\ ention of
illness and the aftercare of physically or mentally sick persons; the provision
of domestic help where necessary; the ambulance service, the provision of
facilities for vaccination and immunisation against certain infectious diseases,
and the services for the permanently disabled or handicapped, for the aged
and infirm and for children deprived of a normal home life. Education and
culture are promoted by the establishment and maintenance of various types
of schools; by the provision of adult education centres, and art and technical
colleges; by the award of grants and scholarships to students of all kinds,
and by the provision of libraries, art galleries and museums. Housing needs
are met, as far as possible, by building new houses (mainly to let), acquiring
old houses and converting them to provide additional accommodation,
planning for slum clearance, seeing that adequate standards are maintained
in both newly built and older houses, and generally ensuring that housing
conditions are satisfactory.
Some local authorities also engage in trading services, such as passenger
transport, water supply, and harbour, dock and pier services; they also have
power to initiate schemes to attract industrial development.

The above is only a brief outline of local authority services. Fuller
information is given under the relevant subject headings in later chapters of
this book.
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own
internal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they
will discharge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system,
whereby questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and
committees are appointed to carry out the detailed administration of the
various services. Parish councils and the smaller district councils are often
able to do their work efficiently in full session although they appoint
committees from time to time, when any special study or experience is
required. The more important of the committees of the larger authorities
divide their work among sub-committees, which stand to the parent com¬
mittee in a relation similar to that of the main committees to the whole
council. The execution of the policy decided upon by the council and the
committees rests with salaried officers and employees, whose number may
vary from about half a dozen in a small rural district to several thousands
in the large counties and in the larger county boroughs and burghs.
Apart from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of
specialists on committees and the length of time certain members may hold
office, committees of councils are free from legal restrictions; even those
which are mandatory committees are constituted according to individual
requirements and not according to any set pattern laid down. For purposes
of classification, however, they may be divided into two kinds: ordinary
committees and joint committees. Ordinary committees may be further
divided into mandatory committees, the appointment of which is compulsory
under an Act of Parliament; other standing committees, which are appointed
in accordance with the standing orders of the council on a permanent basis
according to the extent of the council’s business; and special committees,
which a council may set up for a limited period to deal with a particular
problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
Joint committees or joint boards consist of representatives of more than
one authority. They may be established, outside the Greater London area,
for services that can be more effectively administered over a wider area than
that controlled by a single council, for instance, town and country planning,
water supplies and the police service.
The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be
advisory or executive) are usually laid down in the appointing council’s
standing orders. A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees,
except its powers in connection with raising loans, levying rates, or making
financial demands on other authorities liable to contribute (raising precepts
in England and Wales and levying requisitions in Scotland) which are legally
reserved to the council as a whole. County and county borough councils
exercise their powers of delegation to a considerable extent, but in most
districts and parishes councils use their committees only in an advisory capacity.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of the council (and
of some committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered
if the council resolve that publicity for that matter would be prejudicial to
the public interest.
Generally speaking, councils are free to make such appointments as they
deem necessary for carrying out their work, although certain posts (for
74
Local
Government
Finance
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
instance, the clerk, the treasurer, and the medical officer of health) are
compulsory in almost all councils. Choice of personnel is left to a great extent
to the individual council: in theory, the appointment of certain chief officers
is subject to some central control but, in practice, the nominee of the council
is nearly always accepted.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or
chief officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial
kind; subordinate officers employed in a professional, clerical or technical
capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical work for
which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually made
at the instance of the committee or committees particularly concerned,
most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who are also
responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engagements
are always made in conformity with the council’s set establishment and
committees are informed of any appointments which they have not made
themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within
the jurisdiction of the employing council (except for the rare case where the
proposed salary of an officer requires the approval of a government depart¬
ment, as in the case of the clerk of a county council in England and Wales).
They are based on recommendations made by the Whitley Councils (see
note on p. 67), of which the largest, in England and Wales, are the National
Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Administrative, Professional, Technical
and Clerical Services and the National Joint Industrial Council for Local
Authorities’ Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers) and, in Scotland, the
Joint Negotiating Committee for Chief Officials of Local Authorities
(Scotland) and the Joint Industrial Councils for Local Authority Services. In
England and Wales conditions of service and salary scales for senior local
government officers are determined by separate joint committees. The local
government service in Northern Ireland has its separate joint negotiating
machinery at various levels.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of
conduct; as public servants they 'must not only be honest in fact, but must
be beyond the reach of the suspicion of dishonesty’.
There are three sources of local authority income: government grants
(about two-fifths); local rates, paid by occupiers of land and buildings (about
two-fifths); and rents from municipal houses, dividends and interest (about
one-fifth). Capital investment is, for the greater part, financed by borrowing.
Government grants occasionally take the form of capital grants, paid on
approval of claims made by local authorities for specific services, principally
roads and public lighting; more often they are made on an annual basis,
either as specific grants, i.e. for a particular service, or as non-specific grants.
The latter include the general grant and the rate-deficiency grants (equalisation
grants in Scotland), the latter being paid to authorities whose rateable
resources in relation to population are below the average for their class.
These two grants account for about four-fifths of all annual grants. Specific
grants are paid as ‘unit’ grants (a fixed annual payment according to the
number of units provided) for houses or as ‘percentage’ grants (a percentage
of approved expenditure) for a small number of services—mainly school
milk and meals, the police service and the construction and upkeep of roads.
The largest single grant is the general grant, which is paid by the Minister
of Housing and Local Government to county, county borough and the
Grants
Rates
GOVERNMENT 75
London borough councils in England and Wales and by the Secretary of
State for Scotland to county and town councils in Scotland. This grant is
apportioned among the authorities according to a formula that takes into
account the size of the population in their areas and also such factors as the
number of children of school age, of young children and of old people and of
exceptionally high or low densities of population. The total amount of grant
in any year is fixed in advance, after consultation between the ministers and
the local authority associations.
In Northern Ireland there is a system of grants towards the cost of specific
services (for example, education, roads, housing, health and welfare, water
supplies and sewerage), supplemented by a general Exchequer contribution
which compensates for derating and takes account of the needs and resources
of individual authorities.
Rates are a form of local tax paid by the occupiers of land and buildings
(except agricultural land and buildings) as contributions to the cost of local
services. They are levied by a poundage on the rateable value of property;
in England and Wales this is equivalent to its net annual value which, in
turn, is based on the rent which it might reasonably be expected to command
if let from year to year with the tenant bearing the rates and the cost of
insurance and repairs. Valuation for rating in England and Wales is under¬
taken by valuation officers of the Board of Inland Revenue, who are
independent of the local authorities. In the latest valuation lists (1963)
rateable values for all classes of property are based on current rental values.
The Rating (Interim Relief) Act provides for grants to local authorities in
areas with a high proportion of persons over 65 years of age and empowers
local authorities to remit, in cases of hardship, part of the increase in domestic
rate bills caused by revaluation. In addition, transitional assistance is being
given for eight years by the Greater London Council to the councils of the
home counties (Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire) of which parts have
been absorbed into the Greater London area to offset extra rate burdens
caused by the reorganisation of London government; and the Ministry of
Housing and Local Government has a scheme for reducing disparities in the
rates levied in Inner London. Charities pay half the full rate on property
they occupy for charitable purposes but may be given further reliefs by the
rating authorities, who are empowered to reduce or remit the rates for a
wide range of non-profit-making bodies.
Appeals from valuations may be made to local valuation courts, each
consisting of three members of an independent local valuation panel, and
thereafter to the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland valuation is on a basis similar to that in England and Wales;
but it is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of counties and
counties of cities. Appeals lie to the valuation appeal committee of each
valuation area and thereafter to the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the
Court of Session. A Scottish Valuation Advisory Council has been established
by the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Northern Ireland the valuation
authority is the Commissioner of Valuation, whose department is part of the
Ministry of Finance. Industry and freight transport in Northern Ireland are
rated at a quarter of their net annual value.
In England and Wales the responsibility for levying and collecting the rates
lies with the councils of county boroughs and county districts, with the
London borough councils and with the City Corporation. The rate poundage
for each county district consists mainly of a district rate and a county rate,
calculated in accordance with the respective requirements of the two
76

authorities, and the proceeds of the latter are passed on to the county council.
In rural districts the rate levied in each parish takes into account precepts
issued by the parish council or parish meeting. In Greater London the GLC
raises revenue by precepting on the London boroughs and the City. Rates
in Scotland are levied by the town councils in burghs and by county councils
elsewhere; to cover their expenditure, district councils levy a requisition
each year to the county council; a town council has to meet an annual requisi¬
tion from the county council in respect of the burgh’s share of the expenditure
on functions exercised by the county council throughout the county, including
the burgh. In Northern Ireland county councils are responsible for making,
levying and collecting the rates, except in such parts of the county as fall within
the jurisdiction of the county borough, borough, or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by local authorities for financing such items of capital
expenditure as are sanctioned by the Minister of Housing and Local
Government, Secretary of State for Wales, the Secretary of State for Scotland,
or, occasionally, the government department responsible for the service for
which the capital is required. The Greater London Council applies annually
for parliamentary sanction to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure.
In Northern Ireland the government department responsible for the service
also issues the appropriate loan approvals. Borrowing powers for specific
purposes may also be taken under Acts of Parliament of local application.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by issuing stock upon the
Stock Exchange and by private bonds which may or may not be quoted on
the Stock Exchange. Although these bonds may be for any period, local
authorities normally issue them for one year. Local authorities also have
right of access to the Public Works Loan Board, which is financed by the
Exchequer and also acts as lender of last resort to local authorities which
cannot borrow on reasonable terms on the market. Local authorities may also
borrow temporarily for a limited proportion of their outstanding loan debt.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned
by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy of
the council under constant review. In England and Wales an external audit
is carried out (except for certain general accounts in most of the county
borough and about two-thirds of the borough councils) by district auditors
appointed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. County
borough councils must use the services of the district auditor for accounts
which relate to children and education, and local health and welfare services.
In both county and non-county boroughs rating and coast protection are
also subject to district audit. For their other accounts borough councils use
mainly professional auditors; a few use ‘elective audit’, which provides for the
appointment of three auditors: two elected by the local government electors
and one appointed by the mayor. In Scotland the accounts of each authority
are audited by a professional auditor appointed by the Secretary of State for
Scotland and paid by the council concerned, and in Northern Ireland by
special local government auditors appointed by the Ministry of Development.
In the seventy years since the existing local government structure was set
up, the population of England and Wales has grown by nearly 14 million, the
greatest concentration of people being in the London area and the five other
conurbations of England (see p. 17). At the same time, the number and
scope of local authority activities have progressively increased: local authorities
are nowadays responsible not only for most of the environmental and personal

welfare services, but also for important functions in relation to a number of
services of nation-wide concern.
In contrast to all this, the basic pattern of local government has remained
virtually unchanged. In some areas, and more especially in those with a high
density of industry and population, developments inevitably have led to some
confusion and loss of efficiency, since the structure is no longer in balance
with the work that modern councils have to do. Local government in Greater
London has already been reorganised; elsewhere in England a Local Govern¬
ment Commission has been reviewing local government in the five special
review areas of the West Midlands, Tyneside, West Yorkshire, South-East
Lancashire and Merseyside and in the counties and county boroughs.
Before making proposals the Commission must consult the local authorities
and other interested bodies and persons, and take their views into account.
The final reports must be submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local
Government who decides whether or not to accept the Commission’s
proposals after holding public local inquiries, where necessary, to hear
objections. Proposals are put into effect (with or without modifications) by
means of orders made by the Minister, which must be laid before Parliament.
The Commission has already submitted its proposals for about two-thirds
of the country; the Minister has announced his decision on a number of them
and some have also been approved by Parliament. The Commission’s reviews
are being followed by reviews of county districts and parishes carried out by
the county councils. By July 1965 one council had completed its review.
In Wales a new pattern of local government is being considered; and in
Scotland the present local government structure, which has been in existence
for thirty years, is also under review.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to
a measure of central control exercised by the Home Secretary (in England
and Wales) and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The fire services in
Northern Ireland are controlled by two authorities, the Belfast Corporation
and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, which are responsible to the
Minister of Home Affairs. Every part of the United Kingdom is covered
by a public fire brigade.
There are 131 local authority fire brigades in England and Wales and n in
Scotland. In England and Wales, under the Fire Services Act 1947, separate
fire brigades are administered by the county or county borough councils, which
are the fire authorities for their areas and have powers and duties which they
exercise either separately or as combined authorities where neighbouring
councils care to make such arrangements in the interests of the efficiency of
the service. The Greater London Council is the fire authority for the Greater
London Fire Brigade. In Scotland the local authorities are grouped in eleven
areas each with a single brigade; with the exception of Glasgow, where the
town council of the city is the responsible authority, each area is administered
by a joint committee representative of the councils of the counties and large
burghs in the area.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland may make
regulations regarding the maintenance of discipline, appointments and
promotions, training, the design and performance of equipment, and pensions
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in local fire brigades, and their approval is necessary for certain reductions
in establishment schemes. In matters affecting the fire brigades as a whole
(excluding discipline and similar matters), each minister is advised by the
appropriate Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of repre¬
sentatives of the local authority associations, representatives of the chief
officers (firemasters in Scotland) and other members of the brigades, and
other persons having special qualifications. The National Joint Council for
Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain and the National Joint
Council for Chief Officers of Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great
Britain are the negotiating bodies on conditions of service of members of the
brigades. Inspectorates of fire services advise the Secretaries of State on
operational and technical matters.

Fire Losses
Each fire authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment
of officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and
location of fire stations and the number and type of appliances considered
necessary for the provision of an all-over cover of its area. Establishments
vary considerably according to the fire risks in the area concerned and are
not always up to strength, but in the whole of England and Wales there are
about 23,700 whole-time and 16,800 part-time firemen, operating more than
3,500 fire-fighting appliances (including pumps, turntable ladders, water
tenders, and emergency and salvage tenders) housed in some 1,600 fire
stations. In Scotland there are approximately 2,800 whole-time and 2,600
part-time firemen, 560 fire-fighting appliances, and 320 fire stations.
It is the duty of each fire authority to buy such vehicles and equipment
as are required. Equipment is standardised, and appliances are bought by
fire authorities to specifications which ensure that essential standards are
maintained and yet allow sufficient freedom of design to meet local
requirements.
Each fire authority must appoint a chief fire officer (firemaster in Scotland)
to be the head administrative and executive officer for its fire services. The
appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary or by the Secretary of
State for Scotland. The chief fire officer or firemaster is responsible to the
fire authority for seeing that the fire brigade is organised and managed in
accordance with policy. „ .
All brigades have a central headquarters for operational controf. Lontroi
is, however, usually exercised on a local basis by divisional officers in charge of
the geographical divisions into which most areas are divided. Each divisional
officer has at his disposal a staff of whole-time officers and men, often
supplemented—particularly in country areas—by part-time officers and men;
and he is responsible for mobilising this force in the strength necessary for
dealing with any outbreaks of fire in his division. Constant communication is
maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters and, if at any time
an outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a divisional force,
help is sent from one or more neighbouring divisions in its area, or even from
the area of another fire authority. Under arrangements for mutual help
made by all fire authorities, the nearest available force is sent to the scene of
a fire, regardless of area boundaries.
In England and Wales the number of fire calls a year rose from about
247,170 in i960 to 358,000 in 1964, including false alarms and special service
calls for such purposes as rescuing persons and animals trapped in dangerous

situations, dealing with crashed aircraft, and pumping and salvage operations.
In Scotland the number of fire calls, including false alarms and special
services, over the same period rose from 31,745 to 32,925.
During these years estimated fire losses in the United Kingdom rose by over
£33 million, accounted for in part by the growth in the value of properties
and goods, in part by the increase in the number of properties at risk, and in
part by an increase in the number of fires.
About three-fifths of the total number of firemen work on a whole-time basis.
The part-time firemen include: retained firemen who, in return for a retaining
fee, undertake to attend fires if called upon; volunteer firemen, who receive
no remuneration; and auxiliary firemen, who are enrolled as members of
individual fire brigades but with restricted duties. A growing number of fire
authorities employ women on communication and mobilising duties. In
addition, there are the fire-fighting organisations outside the local authority
service; for example, those maintained by the Service departments of the
Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Aviation, and by some large industrial
and commercial concerns.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at training schools run by fire authorities.
In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central training school which
is the responsibility of the Scottish Home and Health Department. Advanced
and specialised training courses, including fire prevention courses, are provided
for the higher ranks at the Fire Service College, Wotton House, near
Dorking, Surrey, which is maintained by the Home Office and the Scottish
Home and Health Department as the central training institution for the fire
services, and at the Fire Service Training Centre (an annexe to the college)
at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. The Home Office Fire Service
Department arranges facilities for properly accredited officers from overseas
fire services to study the organisation, current training methods, appliances
and equipment of the British fire brigades.
A number of fire authorities in England and Wales have recently introduced
schemes for the employment of junior firemen between the ages of 16 and
18 years, with a view to their being enrolled as regular firemen at the
age of 18.
A report of a joint committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory
Councils has given guidance on the broad lines on which local training schemes
should be based, leaving discretion on certain matters to local authorities.
The report suggests the adoption of syllabuses of practical fire service
training, physical, general and technical education.
The fire authorities bear the cost of maintaining the fire service. There is an
Exchequer contribution which is included in the aggregate amount of the
local authority general grant (see p. 74). For the purpose of arriving at the
amount of this contribution, the Government receives from fire authorities
(at the time when the grant is to be considered) details of the last known
actual expenditure for a year, together with estimates for the impending
general grant period.
Side by side with fire-fighting operations, fire authorities have important
responsibilities in respect of fire prevention. A statutory obligation was placed
upon them by the Fire Services Act 1947 to maintain adequate arrangements
for giving advice about fire prevention to anyone who required it. In addition,
8o

the fire authorities have been made the enforcing authority for fire pre¬
cautions under a steadily growing number of Acts of Parliament, of which
the most notable are the Factories Act 1961, and the Offices, Shops and
Railway Premises Act 1963. There are provisions relating to fire and fire
prevention in a large number of other Acts with which fire authorities are
concerned, either in their own right as fire authorities or by virtue of the
advisory functions of their fire brigade.
Within brigades, the work of fire prevention is entrusted to a staff of fire
prevention officers. Other sources of advice on fire prevention include the
various insurance companies who advise their policy holders, and the Fire
Protection Association, a non-profit-making body established by the Fire
Offices’ Committee1 as an advisory centre on a nation-wide basis for industry
and the general public on protection of life and property against fire.
Research into all aspects of fire prevention and fire fighting, and in particular
into the relationship between the frequency and severity of outbreaks of fire,
the effects of fire fighting and the provision of protective equipment within
buildings, is undertaken by the Joint Fire Research Organisation under the
general direction of the Fire Research Board. The cost of the Organisation
is shared equally between the Ministry of Technology and the Fire Offices’
Committee who, jointly, nominate the members of the Fire Research Board.
The Organisation operates from a fire research station at which tests are
carried out.
In Northern Ireland the Belfast Corporation controls the Belfast Fire
Brigade and is responsible for the area inside the city boundary, and the
Northern Ireland Fire Authority covers the rest of the country outside
Belfast.
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains five whole-time stations and has an
establishment of 263 officers and men manning 13 appliances, while the
Northern Ireland Fire Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry
and 44 other stations throughout the remainder of the area, and an establish¬
ment of 104 whole-time officers and men and 658 part-time firemen, manning
72 appliances.
The Fire Services (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland) 1963 provides that
the amount of fire service grant payable to the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority should be 50 per cent of the loan charges in respect of capital
expenditure which do not exceed £90,000 and 25 per cent of the amount
(if any) by which the loan charges exceed £90,000, together with 50 per cent
of the first £240,000 of other ne*t expenditure and 25 per cent of the excess
over that amount. Expenditure in excess of the fire service grant is apportioned
among the local authorities liable to contribute to the funds of the Authority.
Under the Fire Services Acts, the Belfast Fire Brigade cannot qualify for
the payment of fire service grant.

In the United Kingdom the maintenance of public order depends on the
obedience which the public accord to the law. Individuals obey the law out
of a sense of private conviction or public duty, or, in the last resort, because
they know that if they fail to do so they will be penalised by the authorities
of the State. On the other hand, the use of penal measures by State authorities
must be, and in fact is, confined to what the law allows.
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary state, it does not have a single
body of law applicable universally within its limits; and in England and
Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, respectively, separate systems are in
force (see p. 26). There are, however, similarities between the systems. As
between England and Wales on the one hand and Northern Ireland on the
other the similarity is general, due to the closeness of the association between
these countries since the twelfth century. As between Scotland and the rest
of the United Kingdom the differences are more extensive, although the
existence, during the past 250 years, of a common Parliament, a common
public opinion on broader issues, and a common court of appeal for civil
cases has resulted in substantial identity at many points.
A feature which is common to all the systems of law in the United Kingdom
(and differentiates them from some continental systems) is that there is no
complete code. The sources of law in all the British systems include statutes
dealing with particular subjects, and a large amount of unwritten or ‘common’
law, which can be gathered from numerous decisions of the courts and from
other sources. English law today is contained in about 3,000 Acts of
Parliament, several thousand Statutory Instruments and over 300,000
reported cases.
Statute law includes Acts of Parliament and delegated or subordinate
legislation made under powers conferred by Parliament. It is absolutely
binding on all courts of the United Kingdom, taking precedence over any
other source of law. A large volume of modern legislation, particularly in
the social field, applies throughout the United Kingdom.
The common law of England originated in the customs of the realm and
was built up by decisions of the courts. A supplementary system of law,
known as ‘equity’, came into being during the Middle Ages to provide and
enforce more effective protection for existing legal rights. It was administered
by a separate court and later became a separate body of legal rules. In 1873
the courts of equity were fused with the courts of common law, so that all
courts now apply both systems but, where they conflict, equity prevails.
In Scotland the basis of common law, which largely depends on the canon
law of Rome, helped by continental commentators, is embodied in the
writings of certain seventeenth, eighteenth and early nineteenth century
lawyers of great repute who, between them, described systematically almost
the whole field of private and criminal law as existing in their times. Broadly
speaking, the principles enunciated by these lawyers, together with the many
judicial decisions which have followed and developed those principles, form
the body of Scots non-statutory law. Scotland has never had a separate

system of equity—equitable principles having always permeated the ordinary
rules of law.
A feature common to the legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. Criminal law
is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole; civil law is
concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members of
the community between themselves.
The courts of ordinary criminal jurisdiction in England and Wales include:
magistrates’ courts, which try the less serious offences and conduct preliminary
inquiries into the more serious offences; courts of quarter sessions, which try
most of the more serious offences; and courts of assize, including the Central
Criminal Court (for Greater London) and the Crown Courts in Liverpool
and Manchester, which try the gravest offences and cases of special difficulty.
All trials at quarter sessions and assizes are conducted with a jury (see p. 94).
Most magistrates’ courts consist of two to seven lay magistrates who are
unpaid and do not normally possess any legal qualifications but obtain advice
on points of law, when required, from the clerk to the justices. In some
of the large cities, however, there are also paid, or ‘stipendiary’, magistrates
who are professional lawyers; they usually sit alone. In inner London there is
a unified system of magistrates’ courts, in which either a metropolitan
stipendiary magistrate or lay justices may sit. The great majority of offences
(over 97 per cent) committed are disposed of in magistrates’ courts.
Specially qualified magistrates sit m juvenile courts1 to hear cases involving
young persons under 17 years of age who are charged with any offence except
homicide or are brought before the court as being in need of care or protection,
as beyond control, or as persistent truants. These courts also deal with many
applications for the adoption of children.
Domestic Proceedings are also tried by not more than three justices, of
whom one should be a man and one a woman. The hearing of domestic
proceedings is separated from other business and, as in juvenile courts, the
public is excluded.
Courts of quarter sessions sit at least four times a year; in the busier places,
they meet much more frequently than this.
All counties have courts of quarter sessions and 98 boroughs also have
separate courts which exercise jurisdiction within their own boundaries. In
counties the courts are generally presided over by a bench of lay magistrates
under a legally qualified chairman. In boroughs the courts are presided over
by a single judicial officer, the Recorder, who is a barrister specially appointed
to act part-time in this capacity. In Greater London there are five areas, each
with its own quarter sessions. Each of these courts must be presided over by
a full-time paid chairman or deputy chairman.
Courts of assize are branches of the High Court presided over by High Court
judges and held at assize towns—generally in the county town of each county
and in certain of the other larger towns and cities. The judges go round
‘on circuit’ three times a year—on the autumn, winter and summer assizes.
Each town is visited once on each circuit; the larger towns are visited twice.
1 The Government has announced plans for taking children under 16 out of the
of the criminal law and the courts and appointing local family councils, with which the
parents of the children would be associated, to deal with them. It is also proposed to
divorce the arrangements for the trial and treatment of young people in the 16—21 age
group as far as possible from the ordinary criminal courts and from the penal system
as it applies to adults.

LAW AND ORDER 83
After the trial of criminal cases in each town, the judges deal with civil
cases.
In Liverpool and Manchester, Crown Courts act both as quarter sessions for
the two cities and as assize courts for South Lancashire. The courts are
presided over by the Recorders of Liverpool and Manchester, who are
whole-time judicial officers.
The Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey in the City of London acts as
the court of assize for the criminal business of Greater London. The court
sits in virtually continuous session; more than one court sits at one time and
each is presided over by a salaried judicial officer.
Appeals may be brought on a point of law, by either the prosecutor or the
defendant, direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court; but the more
usual appeal is that of a convicted person against his conviction or his sentence,
which is heard by quarter sessions.
Appeals against convictions or sentences by quarter sessions, assizes or
Crown Courts go to the Court of Criminal Appeal1. Appeals on questions of
law may be brought as of right, but on other grounds only by leave of the
court. The Lord Chief Justice usually presides in the Court of Criminal
Appeal, which consists of three or, in special cases, five judges of the Queen’s
Bench Division. On appeal against conviction the court has power to quash
the conviction and direct the appellant’s acquittal or, if the appeal is allowed
on grounds of fresh evidence only, to order a retrial.
A further appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the House of Lords
can be brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords
that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
There is no restriction on the right of a private citizen to institute criminal
proceedings, but most prosecutions in England and Wales are, in fact,
initiated and conducted by the police. In some cases the consent of the
Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions or, less frequently,
a government department is required. The Director of Public Prosecutions
is also concerned with prosecutions in all the more serious classes of indictable
offences (i.e. offences involving formal written accusation); in courts where
a substantial number of cases with which he is concerned are tried, standing
counsel are appointed by the Attorney General to appear on his behalf.
At the Central Criminal Court in London, for instance, there is a panel
of counsel known as Treasury Counsel, who are retained to prosecute in the
Director’s cases.
In criminal cases arrest may be effected either on a warrant issued by a
judicial authority on information laid before it or, in certain cases, without
a warrant. In the latter circumstances, a police officer may release the defen¬
dant on bail, that is to say he may discharge him temporarily, subject to his
entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a reasonable sum
of money, to appear in court at the time appointed for the trial. Magistrates
also have discretion to grant bail, and this discretion is liberally exercised
in accordance with well-established principles. An arrested person must be
charged at once with the offence of which he is suspected; under the Judges
Rules,2 once a person has been charged with or informed that he may be

prosecuted for an offence, no further questions relating to that offence may
be put by the police, save in exceptional circumstances for the purpose of
preventing or minimising harm or loss to any person or to the public, or for
clearing up an ambiguity in a previous answer or statement. Unless the offence
of which an arrested person is suspected is serious, he must be granted bail
if he cannot be brought before the court within a day.
If anyone is detained in custody otherwise than upon lawful grounds1 he
(or, if he is unable, someone acting on his behalf) may sue out a writ of
habeas corpus against the person who detained him, this person then being
required to appear before the court on the day named to show cause for
detention. The writ of habeas corpus may be granted by a single judge of the
High Court but may be refused only by a divisional court of the Queen’s
Bench Division.
Nearly all criminal cases are tried first in magistrates’ courts. Most involve
either summary offences which may be disposed of by the justices sitting
together without a jury, or the less serious indictable offences which may be
dealt with in the same way, if the defendant consents. For the more serious
offences the magistrates sit as ‘examining justices’ to determine if there is
sufficient evidence to justify committal of the defendant for trial in a higher
court before a jury.
Since criminal law presumes the innocence of the accused until his guilt
has been conclusively proved, the prosecution should not have any advantage,
apparent or real, over the defence. Every accused person has the right to
employ a legal adviser for the conduct of his defence and if he cannot afford
to pay he may be granted legal aid at the public expense. Anyone remanded
in custody may be visited in prison by his legal adviser. During the preparation
of the case, it is customary for the prosecution to inform the defence of any
relevant documents which it is not proposed to put in evidence and to disclose
them if asked to do so.
All criminal trials are held in open court and the rules of evidence (which
are concerned with the proof of facts and much the same in civil and criminal
trials) are rigorously applied2. For instance, although the uncorroborated
evidence of one witness is, as a matter of English law, sufficient, conviction
in criminal cases solely on the evidence of an accomplice (or accomplices) is,
in practice, never allowed unless the judge has warned the jury of the danger
of convicting without corroboration.
During the trial the accused has the right to hear and subsequently to
cross-examine (normally through his counsel) all the witnesses for the
prosecution; to call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial
of their own free will, may be ‘subpoenaed’, or legally compelled, to attend;
and to address the court either in person or through his counsel. But he
cannot himself be questioned unless he consents to be sworn as a witness
in his own defence. The right to cross-examine the accused, even when he
is so sworn, is limited by law, with the object of excluding inquiry into his
character or into past offences not relevant to the particular charge on which
he is being tried. Furthermore, although confessions made in the course of

of Parliament; for disobeying a court order to pay a civil debt when able to do so;
detention of persons found to be mentally disordered; detention of children by their
parents or guardians. The writ of habeas corpus runs in both criminal and civil cases.

mittee (in relation to criminal trials) and the Law Reform Committee (in relation to

previous judicial proceedings are admissible as evidence if they have been
made upon oath, no confessions made in any other circumstances should be
admissible unless it can be proved that they were made voluntarily, i.e.
without fear of prejudice or hope of advantage.
In criminal trials by jury it is, broadly speaking, the duty of the judge to
determine questions of law, to sum up the evidence for the benefit of the
jury, and to acquit the accused or pass sentence, according to the verdict
of the jury; but the jury alone decides the issue of guilt or innocence. The
verdict of a jury must be unanimous; if its members are unable to reach
agreement, the case must be tried before a new jury.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of
appeal and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. If a
defence of insanity is accepted by the jury the verdict is ‘not guilty by reason
of insanity’ and the accused will be detained in a suitable hospital. From a
verdict of guilty or of not guilty by reason of insanity there is a right of appeal
on the part of the defendant to the appropriate court.
CIVIL LAW IN
ENGLAND AND
WALES
Civil Courts
County Courts
The High Court of
Justice
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in England and Wales are the county
courts, which are the courts for the lesser cases, and the High Court, where
the more important cases are tried. Most appeals go to the Court of Appeal
and from there may go to the House of Lords.
County Courts (of which there are nearly 400) are so located that no part of
a county is more than a reasonable distance from one of them. They are
presided over by a paid judge, who almost always sits alone, although he may
sit with a jury consisting of eight persons if either party wishes it and the court
makes an order to that effect. There are 79 county court judges now in office,
each having a circuit, which is either one court, or a group of courts, depending
on the amount of work to be done.
Generally speaking the jurisdiction of the county courts includes all civil
actions where the amount claimed is not more than £400 or where, in actions
for the recovery of land, the rateable value of the land is not more than £400
a year. Cases outside these limits may be tried in the county court by consent
of the parties, or may be transferred to the High Court. Some actions, in
particular actions for libel and slander, cannot be brought in the county court.
In addition to the ordinary county courts, there are still a few local courts with
somewhat similar jurisdiction. Most of these are survivals from the medieval
borough courts, and have little or no work to do at the present time, but
the Liverpool Court of Passage, the Salford Hundred Court and the Mayor’s
and City of London Court are still well used.
The High Court of Justice forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature.
Its jurisdiction is both original and appellate, and covers virtually all civil
causes and some criminal causes.
The High Court is divided into the Chancery Division, the Probate,
Divorce and Admiralty Division, and the Queen’s Bench Division. The work
is distributed between them in accordance with the Rules of Court (see p. 83)
and the practice of the courts. Although the rules do not give exclusive
jurisdiction in any matter to any one division, in practice each division has a
separate field of jurisdiction and the judges are attached to a particular
division.
The High Court is staffed by 55 puisne1 judges. The Lord Chancellor is,
in strict law, the president of the whole High Court (although, in practice,
Judges without any other special office.

he does not sit in any Division); he is also nominally head of the Chancery
Division, of which the Master of the Rolls1 is another nominal member; there
is a President for the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division; and the Lord
Chief Justice of England presides over the Queen’s Bench E)ivision. For the
hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly. Appellate
jurisdiction is exercised either by divisional courts consisting of three (or
sometimes two) judges, sitting in one of the three Divisions of the High Court
or, in some cases, by a single judge.
Nearly all appeals from magistrates’ courts, ministerial decisions and the
decisions of judges sitting in Chambers2 are heard in the first instance in the
appropriate divisional court of the High Court,3 but all the more important
appeals in civil actions come before the Court of Appeal, which is part of
the Supreme Court of Judicature, and some (with leave of the Court of Appeal
or of the House of Lords) before the House of Lords, which is the ultimate
court of appeal in civil cases in the whole United Kingdom.
The Court of Appeal hears appeals from the High Court, the county courts
and assizes in civil cases. The Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the
President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, and most of the
Lords of Appeal in Ordinary are members of the court, but its effective head
is the Master of the Rolls, who is assisted by nine Lord Justices of Appeal;
the Court sits in divisions, each with three judges.
The judges in the House of Lords are the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but often sit as a group of five, and some¬
times of seven. Lay peers may not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally takes place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber),
but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may sit. The president
is the Lord Chancellor.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved
person; no preliminary inquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is
required. The most common form of proceedings is an action commenced
by a writ served on the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant
that the plaintiff has a claim on him and states the nature of the claim. If the
defendant intends to contest the claim, he ‘enters an appearance by informing
the court to this effect and documents setting out the precise question in
dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court.
Because civil proceedings are a private matter, they can at any time be
abandoned or compromised without leave of the court4 and, in fact, in the
great majority of cases, the parties to a dispute are able to settle their differences
through their solicitors before the stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that
are brought to court are usually tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases
involving claims for defamation, false imprisonment, unlawful arrest, seduction,
or breach of promise to marry, when either party may insist on trial by jury,
or in a case of fraud, when the person charged may claim this right In
trials where a jury is present, it is responsible for deciding questions of fact

(as in criminal trials) and also the amount of damages to be awarded to the
injured party.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Refusal to obey a judgment directing the defendant to do something or to
abstain from doing something may result in imprisonment for contempt of
court. Arrest under an order of committal may be effected only on a warrant
of the court.
As a rule, the court awards the costs of an action (the barrister’s fees,
solicitor’s charges and essential disbursements) to the winning party, although
in practice he always pays part of them. In certain circumstances (for instance,
extravagance or negligence in the conduct of the case), the court may, in its
discretion, refuse to order that one party’s costs should be borne by the other.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, that is,
where proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury,
or under summary procedure, where the judge sits without a jury. All cases
in the High Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff court
are tried under solemn procedure. Proceedings are taken under summary
procedure in the more minor cases in the sheriff court, and in the justice of
the peace and burgh (or police) courts.
These courts are established in burghs. The judges are town councillors who
are serving (or have served) in the office of magistrate of the burgh. In
Glasgow stipendiary magistrates act as judges of two of the courts.
These courts are organised on a county (and county of city) basis, the judges
being the justices of the peace for the county (or county of city).
Any court of summary jurisdiction sits as a juvenile court1 when hearing
charges only against persons under 17 years of age. Special justice of the peace
juvenile courts have been established in three counties and in the city of
Aberdeen.
Scotland is divided into sheriffdoms, each consisting of a county or combina¬
tion of counties, and these sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court
districts. A sheriffdom has a sheriff and a number of sheriffs-substitute who
act as the judges of the court. The sheriff courts exercise an extensive civil
jurisdiction, as well as a criminal jurisdiction.
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court of first instance.
Any one of the following judges is entitled to try cases in the High Court:
the Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of
Session), the Lord Justice Clerk, or any one of the 14 Lords Commissioner
of Justiciary who are also judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the
court is in Edinburgh, but the judges go on circuit to preside at trials in
other towns.
A person convicted in the High Court or in a sheriff court on indictment
may appeal to the High Court of Justiciary (a) against his conviction on any
ground which involves a question of law alone, or, with leave of the High
Court or upon the certificate of the judge who presided at the trial that it is a
fit case for appeal, on any ground, and (b) against his sentence, with the leave
of the Pligh Court, unless the sentence is one fixed by law. Appeals are heard

by three or more judges, and there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
A person convicted summarily may appeal to the High Court, but only on
questions of law and procedure, and not on issues of fact.
In Scotland the police make preliminary investigation of all cases of crime
discovered by or made known to them, but it is for the Public Prosecutor
concerned (the Lord Advocate in the High Court, the Procurators Fiscal in
the sheriff court, and the justice of the peace fiscal and burgh prosecutor in
the justice of the peace and burgh courts respectively) to decide whether or
not to prosecute and, in the case of the Procurator Fiscal, to decide whether
to proceed summarily or to charge the accused by petition with a view to
proceedings on indictment.
The police in Scotland have the same powers of arrest as have the police in
England and Wales. The Judges Rules do not apply in Scotland, but when
an accused person is arrested, he should be cautioned and have the charge
read over to him. Thereafter, only the accused’s voluntary statements should
be used in evidence at his trial, and the court will reject any statements made
by him unless it is satisfied that they have been fairly obtained.
As in England and Wales, a person apprehended in Scotland must be
brought before the court competent to deal with his case with the least possible
delay. There is no equivalent in Scotland to the public preliminary investiga¬
tion before examining magistrates held in England and Wales prior to
committal for trial. Where a prosecution on indictment is contemplated, the
accused is brought before a magistrate for judicial examination. The
magistrate then commits the accused for trial, but he may first commit him
for further examination. Eight days may elapse between commitment for
further examination and commitment for trial.
Persons in custody, other than those charged with murder or treason, may
be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the jurisdiction
of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or the police.
Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be accepted at the discretion
of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a right of
appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of bail,
by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against the
amount fixed.
The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High Court
of Justiciary has power to release persons unlawfully detained and accused
persons must, in any event, be brought to trial within no days of committal.
In trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ diet takes place in the sheriff
court, when the accused is called upon to plead guilty or not guilty. If he
pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ diet in the
appropriate court. If he pleads guilty, and it is a case which is to be dealt
with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it is a High
Court case it is continued to the second diet in the High Court for disposal.
The second diet is held at least nine day after the pleading diet, either
before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury. Evidence is led (without
opening speeches) and there are closing speeches for the prosecution and for
the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the jury. The jury may return
a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of which result in acquittal, or
they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case the court proceeds to deliver
sentence. The verdict (unlike that of an English jury) may be by a majority.
Fairness to the accused is ensured by the fact that, with a few minor exceptions,

Court

no person may be convicted without the evidence of at least two witnesses,
or corroboration of one witness by facts and circumstances which clearly
implicate the accused person in the crime.
At summary trials the accused is asked to plead to the charge at the first
calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the case.
Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or it
may appoint a trial diet for a later date.
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in Scotland are the sheriff courts which,
in their civil capacity, correspond roughly to the county courts in England and
Wales, and the Court of Session, which is the supreme civil court in Scotland.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to nearly all actions and is
unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the sheriff-
substitute, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-
principal or directly to the Court of Session. Minor civil matters (actions
not exceeding £5 in value) may be tried by justices of the peace.
The Court of Session has universal jurisdiction, sits only in Edinburgh, and
has sole jurisdiction, inter alia, in divorce actions. The court is divided into
two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House,
which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions
of equal status, each consisting of four judges—the first division being
presided over by the Lord President and the second division by the Lord
Justice Clerk. From the Inner House an appeal may lie to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural
matters. The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank
and dignity of a judge of the Court of Session.
Civil
Proceedings
COURTS IN
NORTHERN
IRELAND
In Scotland civil proceedings are initiated by the service on the defender of
a writ or summons, which sets out the nature of the decree which the pursuer
seeks, a statement of facts upon which the pursuer founds his claim, and a
statement of the legal propositions upon which the pursuer maintains he is
entitled to the remedy which he seeks. In Court of Session actions the next
step is the calling of the summons, which is the publication of the action in
the court lists. If the defender intends to contest the action, he must ‘enter
appearance’ within two days of calling and thereafter lodge defences to it.
In ordinary sheriff court actions ‘entering appearance’ is followed by the
‘tabling’ of the case, which involves a formal appearance in court. In summary
and small debt actions the defender is simply given notice of the date on
which the action will be heard. It is much more common in Scotland than in
England and Wales to have legal debates in court as to the competency or
relevancy of the written pleadings prior to the proof.
In Scotland a pursuer can abandon his case, including any matrimonial
case, at any time, but where abandonment is sought after the commencement
of the proof or trial, only with leave of the court. Trial by jury in civil action
in Scotland is much more common than in England and Wales, being the
usual form of proof in actions for damages for personal injuries.
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in
England and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller com¬
munity. The superior courts comprise the Supreme Court of Judicature
(consisting of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal) and the
Court of Criminal Appeal. The High Court is the superior court of first

instance, is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s Bench Division
(including probate, matrimonial and Admiralty proceedings) and the circuit
courts (assizes) and is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice, as president,
and two judges. The Court of Appeal, which is the appellate tribunal, is
constituted of the Lord Chief Justice and two Lords Justices of Appeal.
The inferior courts are the county courts and courts of summary jurisdiction
(petty sessions). Courts of quarter sessions have been amalgamated with the
county courts, which now exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction and
are presided over by county court judges, of whom there are five (two of
them having the title of Recorder—of Belfast and of Londonderry). At least
four sittings of the court are held annually in each division. Petty sessions
courts are composed of one resident magistrate (who corresponds to a
stipendiary magistrate in England and Wales) who sits alone except in some
specific cases, for instance in a special crimes court, where two may adjudicate.
Juvenile courts are composed of one resident magistrate and two lay members,
one of whom must be a woman.
Coroners’ courts are common law courts convened when a person appears
to have died a violent or unnatural death or a sudden death of which the
cause is unknown, and in certain other circumstances. In such cases, it is
the duty of the local coroner (who may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical
practitioner of not less than five years’ standing, appointed by county,
county borough, or certain borough councils) to hold an inquiry into how,
when, and where the deceased died; he may hold an inquest in court for this
purpose, and he must do so if he has reasonable cause to believe that the
deceased has died a violent or unnatural death or has died in prison or in
circumstances for which an Act of Parliament provides that an inquest must
be held. A jury must be summoned in certain cases, including those in which
there is reason to suspect that the death was due to murder, manslaughter,
or infanticide, or was caused by an accident arising out of the use of a vehicle
on the public highway. If the jury returns a verdict of murder, manslaughter
or infanticide by a particular person, the coroner must commit that person
for trial at assizes. If the death is merely a sudden death of which the cause
is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest, but may order a post¬
mortem examination to ascertain the cause of death. The law and practice
relating to coroners’ courts, the reporting of deaths to the coroner and other
matters are under review by an inter-departmental committee.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and
may report the result of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that
Crown Counsel may consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
In Northern Ireland coroners are appointed by the Minister of Home
Affairs and must, on appointment, be either barristers-at-law of not less than
five years’ standing practising in Northern Ireland or practising solicitors of
the Supreme Court of Judicature in Northern Ireland of not less than five
years’ standing.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a
rule, they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by
statute, which also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in
the social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions
LAW AND ORDER
91
on which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration,
or with another body of persons or an individual; consequently there has
been a substantial growth in the number of tribunals (there are over 2,000
in existence) and in the range of their activities during the past twenty years.
Their constitution follows a fairly general pattern: all, for instance, consist
of an uneven number of persons so that a majority decision can be reached;
members are usually appointed by the minister concerned with the subject
but other authorities (for instance, the Crown, the Lord Chancellor and the
Master of the Rolls) have the power of appointment in appropriate cases and
the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord President of the Court of Session in
Scotland, makes appointments in all cases where a lawyer chairman or member
is required; and, with some exceptions, members of tribunals hold office for
a period specified in the warrant or instrument by which they are appointed.
Administrative tribunals may be broadly classified as follows:
(i) those which have permanent members appointed for their special
knowledge, and a chairman who must be a lawyer of experience: for
instance, the Transport Tribunal, which has jurisdiction over British
Railways passenger fares within the London area and London Transport
road and rail fares and also hears appeals relating to road carriers’
licences throughout Great Britain, and the Lands Tribunal, which has
jurisdiction in a variety of matters relating to the value of property;
(ii) those which are purely administrative: for instance, the Special Com¬
missioners of Income Tax, who hear appeals on income tax matters
from the rulings of the Inland Revenue officials;
(iii) those which deal exclusively with matters of interest to one government
department or public authority: for instance, the Pensions Appeal
Tribunals, which hear appeals against the rejection by the Minister of
Pensions and National Insurance of war service pension claims; and
(iv) those which consist of ordinary people appointed by a minister to
arbitrate between individuals: for instance, the Rent Tribunals, which
have jurisdiction in the determination of rents of certain properties.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline, such as the
General Medical Council and the Disciplinary Committee of the Law
Society, but these are entirely different in constitution from the statutory
tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.
Although there is no general provision respecting appeals from statutory
tribunals, the Tribunals and Enquiries Act 1958 and other Acts provide
for an appeal, at least on a point of law, from all the more important tribunals
to the High Court and, in Scotland, to the Court of Session. An appeal may
also lie to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister of the Crown
or to an independent referee. An advisory body known as the Council on
Tribunals (appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of
State for Scotland) exercises general supervision1 over the tribunals and
reports on particular matters, those peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by
the Scottish committee of the Council.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, first appointed in 1964 by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consultation
with the Lord Chancellor, consists of a chairman of wide legal experience and
five other legally qualified members. Its function is to entertain applications

for ex gratia payments of compensation, in certain circumstances, to victims
of crimes of violence in Great Britain or on a British vessel or aircraft.
Compensation is assessed on the basis of common law damages and, generally
speaking, takes the form of a lump sum payment. During the first nine months
of the scheme nearly £66,500 was paid out.
Courts martial have jurisdiction over serving members of the armed forces
under the Army Act and the Air Force Act of 1955 and the Naval Discipline
Act of 1957. Civil offences committed in the United Kingdom by members of the
armed forces are, however, normally dealt with in the ordinary criminal courts.
Courts martial may be convened by any authorised officer. A judge
advocate, who is a qualified barrister, sits with the court to advise upon law
and procedure and to sum up upon the evidence whenever a case of importance
is involved. The Judge Advocate General’s Department acts for the Air
Force as well as the Army, but the Navy has a separate Judge Advocate of
the Fleet.
Appeals lie to the Courts Martial Appeals Court, and from that court to
the House of Lords if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords
that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
There is no Minister of Justice in the United Kingdom. In England and
Wales, responsibility for the administration of the judicial system when it
does not rest with the courts themselves, lies partly with the Lord Chancellor
and partly with the Home Secretary; in Scotland it lies with the Secretary
of State. In England the Lord Chancellor is concerned with the composition
of all courts, both criminal and civil, with parts of criminal procedure and
with everything relating to civil law, and the Home Secretary with criminal
law, preventing offences, apprehending offenders, part of the process of
trying them, and virtually the whole of their treatment. The Prime Minister
is also concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the Crown
the highest judicial appointments.
The administrative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature and the
appointment of the officers of the court (for instance, the masters, registrars
and clerks) is partly in the hands of the Lord Chancellor and partly in the
hands of the appropriate judges. The Lord Chancellor is concerned with
legal procedure in that he is a member of the Rule Committee which makes
the rules of the Supreme Court, appoints the County Court Rule Committee
and has power to alter or disallow the rules made by it. He is concerned with
law reform in that he appoints the members of the Law Commission for
England and Wales, set up under the Law Commissions Act 1965 as a per¬
manent body consisting of five lawyers of high standing, charged with the
duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its systematic development and
reform, including the possibility of codification, the elimination of anomalies,
the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enactments, and the reduction of the
number of separate enactments. The Commission has to submit to the Lord
Chancellor programmes of reform which may recommend their further
examination by itself or by some other body, such as a Royal Commission or
the existing Law Reform Committee or Criminal Law Revision Committee1.
1 The Law Reform Committee and the Criminal Law Revision Committee are standing
committees of judges and lawyers, appointed respectively by the Lord Chancellor and
the Home Secretary, to examine such aspects of the civil and criminal law as may be
referred to them by the appropriate minister.

THE PERSONNEL
OF THE LAW
Judges
The Lord Chancellor may also ask the Commission to prepare draft Bills or
advise government departments. In the course of its work the Commission
has power to consider the legal systems of other countries.
Magistrates’ courts are mainly administered by the magistrates themselves,
chiefly through committees known as magistrates’ courts committees (com¬
mittee of magistrates in inner London); but the local authorities, with
financial assistance from the Government, are responsible for meeting their
costs, and the Home Secretary, besides exercising a general oversight, has
certain specific responsibilities, including the approval of boundary changes,
approval of the appointment of justices’ clerks, and deciding disputes on
financial matters.
In Scotland the Secretary of State appoints the staff of the High Court
of Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the staffing and
general organisation of the sheriff courts. He is also responsible, jointly with the
Lord Advocate, for appointing the members of the Law Commission for Scot¬
land, which has been set up on lines similar to the English Law Commission,
but with the members, other than the chairman, acting only part-time.
In Northern Ireland the administration of the superior courts has been
reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament. The judges are appointed by
the Crown and are removable only on an address of both Houses of that
Parliament. The Minister of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland is responsible
for the staffing and general organisation of the county and petty sessions
courts; the judges of the county court and resident magistrates are appointed
by the Governor of Northern Ireland.
The operation of the law requires the participation of judges with whom,
aided in certain cases by juries, the decision of disputed cases rests; of the
officers of the court, who have general or specialised functions of an adminis¬
trative (and sometimes of a judicial) nature in the courts to which they are
attached; and of the barristers (advocates in Scotland) and solicitors who are
entrusted with representing the interests of the parties to a dispute.1
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts (since the Crown
is the historic source of all judicial power) and the Sovereign, acting on the
advice of ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary. In
England and Wales appointments to the highest positions—the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the
President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division and the Lords
Justices who are the judges of the Court of Appeal—are made on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister, while the Lord Chancellor recom¬
mends the appointment of the puisne judges, the county court judges
(except in Lancashire where they are recommended by the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster), the chairmen of quarter sessions, the recorders of
boroughs, and the metropolitan and other stipendiary magistrates. Justices
of the peace are appointed on behalf of the Crown by the Lord Chancellor,2
who is advised, as to a county by the Lord Lieutenant3 with the assistance

century. Its holder was chief among the county justices and commander of the county
militia.

of a local advisory committee, and as to the boroughs by separate advisory
committees.
In Scotland the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appoint¬
ment of the Lord Justice General and Lord President and also of the Lord
Justice Clerk. Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies
with the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State is responsible
for the appointment and removal of justices of the peace.
Judges are not engaged in politics, except in the case of the Lord Chancellor
who, as well as being head of the judiciary, is a leading member of the
Government in power. With the exception of justices of the peace, judges
have always been appointed from practising barristers or advocates and neither
their training nor their career is in any way dictated by the State.
Once appointed, judges normally hold office for life or until statutory
retiring age. However, in certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of mis¬
conduct or proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in England and
Wales may be removed from their position by the Lord Chancellor. In
Scotland the Secretary of State may issue an order for the removal from
office of a sheriff-principal on a report prepared by the Lord President of the
Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk, on the grounds of inability,
neglect of duty or misbehaviour, but this order is required to lie before both
Houses of Parliament for a period of four weeks and is subject to annulment
by a resolution of either House. A sheriff-substitute may similarly be removed
from office, but in his case no parliamentary procedure is necessary.
In England and Wales all superior judges (other than the Lord Chancellor
who, as a Cabinet Minister, changes with the Government) are subject to a
power of removal only by the Sovereign on an address presented by both
Houses of Parliament.1 Since 1701 only one such address has been moved
(against a judge convicted of misappropriation of funds, in 1830); and it can
be stated with confidence that Parliament would never use this means to
attempt to interfere with judicial independence. Similarly, although no court
in the United Kingdom would ever question the validity of an Act of
Parliament which had been legally promulgated and published it might,
through its interpretation of the statute, come to a decision contrary to the
policy of the Government which introduced the Act. In such a case the
Government could try to persuade Parliament to clarify or amend the statute
by new legislation. It would not be open to it to penalise the judge or to
try to influence the court in any other way.
A jury in England and Wales summoned to assizes or county quarter sessions,
or in a civil action, consists of twelve persons (except in county courts, where
juries consist of eight persons). In Scotland the jury consists of fifteen persons
in criminal cases and twelve in civil cases and in Northern Ireland of twelve
in criminal and seven in civil cases. Most householders (men and women
alike) are liable for jury service if they are British subjects between the ages
of 21 and 60, but persons following certain occupations can claim exemption.2
A jury is completely independent of both the judiciary and the executive.
In criminal cases the accused can have up to seven jurors (in Scotland, five)
changed without giving reasons and both defence and prosecution can object
1 There is no statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court of Session or High
Court of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation would be
required to effect such a dismissal.

issued by a departmental committee in April 1965.

for cause shown (for instance, lack of impartiality), but once members of the
jury have been sworn, they are protected from interference of any kind. It is
an offence to threaten or attempt to corrupt a juryman either before or during
a trial.
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland and at Fatal Accident Inquiries in Scotland, a jury is required to be
present to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person died.
Juries in this instance consist of from seven to eleven jurors. A jury is also
required at an inquest held by a coroner to decide whether objects of gold
or silver found in the ground are ‘treasure trove’.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Each performs distinct duties—solicitors undertake
legal business for lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems sub¬
mitted through solicitors and conduct proceedings in the higher courts—though
certain functions are common to both.
A barrister in England is required to have reached an accepted educational
standard, to have passed the legal examinations conducted by the Council of
Legal Education and to have become a member of one of the four Inns of
Court—Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s Inn, the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple.
A barrister with a substantial junior practice may apply to the Lord Chancellor
for a patent appointing him Queen’s Counsel—a proceeding known as ‘taking
silk’. Most higher judicial appointments are made from among barristers who
have become Queen’s Counsel. The professional conduct of a barrister is
subject to the scrutiny of the General Council of the Bar; but disciplinary
powers are vested exclusively in the Benchers of the Inns of Court.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable
by the appropriate committee of the Law Society (the professional organisation
of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising
solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his professional
career. The term of articles lasts for three or five years, depending upon the
educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must pass the
necessary examinations held by the Law Society and, unless he has been a
barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally required to attend
a course of studies at a recognised law school. Once a solicitor is qualified,
he may become a member of the Law Society.
In Scotland a prospective advocate must show evidence of his general
scholarship (normally by holding an arts degree) and his knowledge of law
(normally by holding a law degree of a Scottish University). The conditions
applying for the admission of solicitors are broadly similar to those applying
in England and Wales. The analogous professional organisations are the
Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.
AND Schemes for free legal assistance to persons of slender means and resources
have existed for centuries in some courts—to a limited extent in England and
Wales, and to a somewhat greater extent in Scotland. The Legal Aid and
Advice Act 1949, and the corresponding Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1949,
were introduced to improve existing arrangements in civil proceedings so that
no one would be financially unable to prosecute a just and reasonable claim
96
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Legal Aid in

Courts
or to defend a legal right, and also to make the facilities already available in
criminal proceedings more easily accessible to those who needed them.
The scheme established by the Act of 1949 for providing legal aid in civil
matters has been gradually brought into operation, until today legal aid is
available for nearly all types of civil proceedings in nearly all courts of law.
It is also available for oral legal advice and in certain circumstances where
the assistance of a lawyer is needed but which do not (or do not yet) involve
litigation.
Free legal aid in civil cases is available to persons with very small incomes and
capital, and contributory legal aid to those in higher income and capital
groups. The majority of people are financially eligible for legal aid.
The legal aid scheme in England and Wales is run by the Law Society under
the general guidance of the Lord Chancellor. It is operated by 12 area
committees and a network of local committees composed of barristers and
solicitors (who may be paid a fee), with a salaried staff. The cost is met from
the Legal Aid Fund, drawn from three sources: contributions from assisted
persons; costs recovered from opposite parties in litigation; and a grant from
the Exchequer.
Applicants for free legal aid must show that they have reasonable grounds
for asserting or disputing a claim. A successful applicant is allowed to select
from a panel a solicitor who, if necessary, instructs a barrister, and the case
is then conducted in the ordinary way. Certain types of action, including
libel and slander, are excluded from the scheme.
In Scotland the legal aid scheme is administered by the Law Society of
Scotland through a supervisory central committee, the Supreme Court
committee and sixteen local committees. To obtain legal aid for litigation an
applicant is required to show ‘probable cause’ and produce in support of his
application a statement corroborated according to the requirements of
Scottish law. Assistance is available in connection with appeals to the House
of Lords from the Court of Session, in civil proceedings before the Court of
Session, the Lands Valuation Appeal Court and the sheriff courts and in
matters not involving litigation. Where litigation is not involved, the applicant
must show he has reasonable grounds for taking the proposed legal action.
Free legal aid is available in the criminal courts in England and Wales1 under
the Poor Prisoners’ Defence Act 1930, which provides for the granting of
either a legal aid certificate which entitles the recipient to the services of a
solicitor (or, in the case of a preliminary inquiry into a charge of murder, of
a solicitor and counsel) in defending a charge heard summarily or at committal
proceedings in indictable cases, or a defence certificate which provides both
solicitor and counsel in a trial on indictment. The granting of these certificates
is in the discretion of the justices or judge before whom the applicant is to be
tried, except in the case of a person committed for trial on a charge of murder,
when a defence certificate must be granted if the defendant has insufficient
means.
Free legal aid for an appeal to quarter sessions is provided for in the
Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act 1933, which lays down that, in proper
cases, an appeal aid certificate may be granted by a magistrates’ court or
quarter sessions. The granting of legal aid appeals to the Court of Criminal
1 The system of legal aid in criminal proceedings is under review by a departmental
committee.
LAW AND ORDER 97
Appeal rests with a judge of that court who may also grant legal aid for the
purposes of a further appeal to the House of Lords.
The cost of legal aid in magistrates’ courts is paid out of the Legal Aid
Fund. In the higher courts payments are made in the first instance out of
local authority funds and the cost is reimbursed by the central Government.
Legal aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland came into operation in 1964
to replace voluntary arrangements operated by the legal profession; it is now
available in the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff courts and the special
juvenile courts (see p. 87). In these courts legal aid is available to all persons
in custody on their first appearance in court. Otherwise, it is granted at the
discretion of the court except in appeals where the final decision whether or
not to grant legal aid is in the hands of the Supreme Court Committee of
the Law Society of Scotland.
Oral advice on legal matters is available, both in England and Wales and in
Scotland, free of charge to persons in receipt of national assistance and at a
very reasonable cost, i.e. at 2s. 6d. for an interview of up to thirty minutes,
to those of limited means. Advice is given by practising solicitors paid out
of the legal aid funds of the two countries. The scheme is administered by the
two Law Societies, which also run voluntary schemes (for a fee of £1) for
those who do not qualify for statutory assistance.
In Northern Ireland free legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons
under the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 1945, the cost being met
from public funds.
Under the Legal Aid and Advice Act (Northern Ireland) 1965, a legal
aid and advice scheme similar to that in operation in England and Wales
has been introduced. The scheme is to be administered by the Incorporated
Law Society of Northern Ireland and is expected to come into operation by
the end of 1965.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The chief aims of the penal system of the United Kingdom are to deter the
potential law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of
deterrence is intended to lie in the fear of detection, public trial, and possibility
of punishment rather than in the severity of the punishment itself. In England
and Wales the penal system is under review by a Royal Commission which is
re-examining, in the light of modern knowledge of crime and its causes, the
concepts and purposes which should underlie the punishment and treatment
of offenders.
Except in relation to murder and certain rare offences for which there is a
fixed penalty, the court has discretion to select the penalty (within maxima
prescribed by law) that it considers most suitable in the light of the circum¬
stances of the offence and the offender. In general, the courts have power to
impose either imprisonment or a fine for serious offences (both in certain
cases); while most minor offences are punishable by a fine only, with the
alternative of imprisonment if the fine is not paid. Moreover, the court has
discretion to discharge an offender absolutely, to place him on probation or (in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland only) to discharge him conditionally
(i.e. subject to the condition that he commits no offence during a specified
period not exceeding twelve months). Summary courts, when they consider
98
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
sentencing a first offender to imprisonment, must be satisfied that no other
method of dealing with him is appropriate.
In England and Wales no offender under the age of 17 years may be
sentenced to imprisonment. Offenders aged 17 and under 21 are not sentenced
to imprisonment for any period between six months1 and three years (unless
they are persistent offenders, in which case a sentence of imprisonment of
18 months or more may be passed). In Scotland, no offender under 21 may be
detained in a prison. Methods of dealing with young offenders are described
on p. 102.
Corrective training or preventive detention may be imposed on persistent
offenders. Corrective training, which lasts from two to four years (seven years
in Northern Ireland), is designed to correct a man’s criminal tendency and
encourage him to become a responsible citizen. Preventive detention may be
imposed on offenders with a long record of previous offences, whose response
to previous institutional training has been unsatisfactory; the sentence runs
for not less than five years (three in Northern Ireland) or more than 14 years,
as the court decides.
Since 1957 the death penalty in Great Britain for murder has been limited
to murders classified as ‘capital murder’. These are not necessarily the type
of murder regarded as the most wicked, but are those which strike especially
at the maintenance of law and order and on which the deterrent effect of
capital punishment is believed to be most likely to operate, i.e. murder done
in the course or furtherance of theft, murder by shooting or by causing an
explosion, murder committed to escape lawful arrest or to effect or assist
escape or rescue from legal custody, murder of a police officer (or person
assisting him) acting in the execution of his duty, or murder by a prisoner
of a prison officer (or person assisting him) acting in the execution of his duty.
The penalty for murder not in capital categories is imprisonment for life,
except that the death penalty continues to apply where a person who is
convicted of murder has previously been convicted of another murder com¬
mitted in Great Britain on a different occasion. Murderers under the age of
18 years at the time that the crime was committed are not sentenced to death
or to life imprisonment, but ‘to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure’.
If it can be proved that a person accused of murder was suffering from such
abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility at
the date of conviction, he is entitled to be convicted of the lesser offence of
manslaughter.
It is the long-established practice for the Home Secretary or the Secretary
of State for Scotland to review every capital case before the law is allowed to
take its course and to consider whether there are grounds for advising the
Crown to exercise the prerogative of mercy. Where a reprieve is recommended,
the sentence of death is commuted to one of imprisonment for life. A person
subject to a sentence of life imprisonment is liable to be detained for the rest
of his life, but the Home Secretary may, if he thinks fit, release him on licence
at any time. In recent years, the period served, in an average case, by persons
whose death sentences have been commuted has been about nine years, but
the period varies according to the circumstances of the particular case and
the question of whether the prisoner’s release would be likely to involve risk
to the public.
1 The Criminal Justice Act 1961 provides for the eventual abolition of short-term
sentences (less than six months) for young offenders—such sentences to be replaced,
when sufficient accommodation is available, by detention in a detention centre for
between three and six months.

LAW AND ORDER 99
A Bill providing for the complete abolition of the death penalty is at present
(September 1965) before Parliament.
In Northern Ireland provision is made in the Criminal Justice Bill (Northern
Ireland) for the abolition of the death penalty in all but four categories of
murder: murder of a constable or other person in the service of the Crown in
the course of duty involving enforcement of the law, maintenance of law and
order or the administration or advancement of justice; murder done in the
course of furtherance of any seditious conspiracy or of the activities of an
unlawful organisation; murder which has been deliberately or callously
planned in advance; and murder done in the course of a planned and deliberate
crime likely to involve the use of violence.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary is the minister generally responsible
for legislation relating to the treatment of offenders, for collecting statistical
and other information about the operation of the penal system, for reviewing
the advantages and defects of the various methods of treating offenders, and
for bringing information about these methods to the attention of the courts.
He is specifically responsible for supervising the approved schools, for pro¬
moting the efficiency of the probation service, and for providing, maintaining
and managing prisons, borstal institutions, detention centres, remand centres
and attendance centres.
The law requires that visiting committees or boards of visitors should be
appointed at every prison, borstal institution, detention centre or remand
centre, partly to ensure that local interest in the administration of these
establishments is preserved and partly to provide some independent and
unofficial check on the administration, and particularly on the punishment,
of inmates. For each prison to which offenders may be committed directly
by a court, a visiting committee of justices of the peace is appointed by the
various courts of quarter sessions in the area, in numbers fixed by the Home
Secretary. For all other prisons and for borstals, detention centres and remand
centres a board of visitors is appointed by the Home Secretary; not less than
two members must be justices of the peace.
The penal systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland are based on principles
similar to those applied in England and Wales. In Northern Ireland the system
is the responsibility of the Ministry for Home Affairs.
The post-war increase in the total number of people found guilty of indictable
offences led to severe overcrowding in prisons and strained the resources of
borstals, detention centres and remand centres. In addition, many of the
existing prisons dated from the middle of the nineteenth century and were
unsuited to modern methods of penal treatment. Measures to deal with the
problems include a substantial increase in the number of prisons and other
penal institutions and in due course the reconstruction or replacement of a
number of old prisons.
The Prison Rules state that ‘the purpose of the training and treatment of
convicted prisoners shall be to encourage and assist them to lead a good and
useful life’. To this end prisoners in England and Wales are classified into
groups, according to their record, character and potentialities, and assigned,
so far as circumstances permit, to the establishment best suited to their needs.
The separation of male from female prisoners is required by statute; otherwise
classification is a matter for administrative direction. Untried prisoners are
separated from convicted prisoners and those under 21 are separated from
adults. Prisoners serving their first sentence, and those considered suitable to

associate with them, are classified as the Star Class and are separated from
other prisoners (the Ordinary Class).
Prisons are classified as general local, special local, regional training, and
central. All convicted prisoners are first received at the general local prison for
the area, where they are assessed and, in appropriate cases, transferred to
another class of prison. The function of the central prisons is to accommodate
all prisoners serving long sentences (a long sentence being defined as over
four years for most classes of men prisoners and over three years for women).
The function of regional training prisons is to accommodate selected prisoners
whose sentence is not long enough to qualify them for a central prison but is
long enough (twelve months’ minimum) for a comprehensive course of
training, and who are judged likely to benefit from such a course; all prisoners
sentenced to corrective training are sent to regional training prisons. The
function of the special local prisons is to relieve overcrowding by accepting
from general local prisons convicted prisoners of any class who are not
eligible for transfer to a regional training prison or a central prison. All
general local prisons are closed; all other classes of prison include open as
well as closed prisons.
On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to im¬
prisonment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their sentence
(one-fourth in Northern Ireland in respect of sentences of less than two
years), provided that this does not reduce their sentence below 31 days (in
Scotland, 30 days). A life prisoner may be released on licence by the Home
Secretary or, in Scotland, by the Secretary of State (see p. 98). All prisoners
become entitled to certain personal privileges at successive stages in their
sentence.
For breaches of discipline in prison, the prison governor, the visiting
committee or the board of visitors have power to order, among other penalties,
forfeiture of remission (postponement of eligibility for release) and forfeiture
of privileges.
In prison training, efforts are being made to provide (1) work of a kind likely
to help fit prisoners to earn their living after release, with technical training
in skilled trades for certain persons, (2) suitable educational facilities, and
(3) opportunities for the development of a sense of personal responsibility,
including (for suitable prisoners) training in open conditions.
New problems in the organisation and management of industries in prisons
have arisen as the result of changes that have taken place both in industrial
methods and in the prison system during the past thirty years, and because
of the substantial increase in the number of prison inmates for whom employ¬
ment must be found. The whole subject is therefore being studied by a
standing Advisory Council on the Employment of Prisoners, appointed by
the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Council
has so far made three reports: the first deals with suitable kinds of work,
job training and earnings for prisoners; the second with the employment and
industrial training of borstal inmates; and the third with the organisation of
prison industries.
Except in local prisons in England and Wales, where the hours are shorter,
most prisoners spend about 40 hours a week in the prison workshops or in
other employment such as building, farm work, domestic work and gardening
in the prison precincts. A few prisoners are employed outside the prisons

Services

Welfare
LAW AND ORDER 101
on various projects, such as agriculture, land drainage, road works and
forestry.
In England, Wales, and Scotland, small payments are made to inmates for
the work they do, and good work is rewarded by payments above the
minimum; in Northern Ireland there is a progressive system of earnings,
which is not related to output nor to work done.
Educational schemes are provided in prisons in England, Wales, and Scotland
by the local education authorities with the advice of the government
departments responsible for education in their respective countries, and in
Northern Ireland by the Ministry of Home Affairs. In England and Wales the
local authorities also provide tutor organisers and most of the instructors; in all
cases the full cost of their services is reimbursed. Evening classes and a wide
range of correspondence courses are also available; and the system of vocational
training courses in operation in a number of prisons enables suitable trainees
to take the examinations of recognised examining bodies.
Educational schemes are supplemented by periodical lectures, film displays,
concerts, and dramatic performances. Prisoners may also use the prison
library, which in most cases is now stocked by the county, city or borough
library committee.
Medical attention is provided by full-time and part-time medical officers whose
duties include not only the care of the physical and mental health of prison
inmates, but also the oversight of those services which affect health in
prisons.
A few prisons and borstals have their own psychiatric clinics (with qualified
medical staff, visiting psychotherapists and psychiatric social workers) to
which inmates may be transferred where necessary. In England and Wales
there is one psychiatric prison, with accommodation for some 350 people,
and a prison psychological service, whose officers are employed to assist
governors and medical officers in their work of examining and classifying
prisoners, and to advise on methods of training. The hospital facilities of
the National Health Service (see Chapter 5) are also available for the treatment
of prisoners in appropriate cases. Arrangements may be made, where
necessary, for prisoners to receive treatment after release.
A chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland, of the Church of Scotland
and in Northern Ireland, of the Church of Ireland and Presbyterian Church),
a Roman Catholic priest and a minister of the Methodist Church are appointed
to every prison. Ministers of other denominations are either appointed or
specially called in as required. Regular services are held and religious in¬
struction given. Chaplains not only visit every prisoner soon after reception,
shortly before release and regularly during the sentence, but they also pay
daily visits to all prisoners who are sick or undergoing cellular confinement
and any others who apply to see them.
All prisons now have resident social workers appointed to them; welfare
is, however, the concern not only of the social workers but of the prison
staff as a whole, in particular of the chaplains and assistant governors.
Prisoners may write and receive letters regularly and may be visited by their
relatives and friends at specified intervals. They may also receive visits from
prison visitors specially appointed for the purpose. The voluntary work
of prison visitors in England and Wales is co-ordinated and guided by the
National Association of Prison Visitors.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The social workers appointed to prisons are available to help in any personal
problems that a prisoner may have; to take such steps as may be practicable
to alleviate any anxieties he may express about the circumstances of his
dependants; and to encourage and assist him to make suitable plans for his
future. Social workers in prisons work closely with those agencies in the
community whose aid the prisoner and his family may need either during
his sentence or after his release.
In England and Wales pre-release courses, at which experts hold open
forum with prisoners nearing their release on the domestic, social and
industrial problems with which they are likely to be faced, are conducted
at all prisons. Specially selected prisoners amongst those sentenced to preven¬
tive detention, long-term imprisonment and, in Scotland, corrective training
are allowed to work in ordinary civilian jobs outside prison during the
months immediately preceding their discharge; hostels for this purpose
have been established at several prisons. Home leave, allowing five clear
days at home, is extensively granted to many categories of prisoners with
sentences of two years or over towards the end of their sentences to enable
them to make family adjustments and contacts with potential employers.
In England and Wales statutory supervision applies to prisoners released
from preventive detention and corrective training, to young prisoners and
to young persons discharged from borstals and detention centres. The
sanctions for failure to observe the conditions of supervision are recall to
prison, borstal or detention centre. Statutory supervision is carried out by
probation officers of the probation and after-care service, which is also
responsible for the after-care of prisoners released from sentences of less than
four years (three years in the case of most women) who are not subject to
compulsory supervision.
In Scotland after-care duties are carried out by after-care officers of the
Scottish Home and Health Department.
In Northern Ireland the after-care of all prisoners is carried out by the
discharged prisoners’ aid societies with the help of probation officers.
Under the English legal system, a child under the age of ten cannot be
charged with an offence. A child between ten and 14 years old, who is
charged with an offence other than homicide, must be dealt with in a
juvenile court unless charged jointly with an adult. A young person (i.e. one
between 14 and 17 years of age) charged with an indictable offence may be
dealt with summarily (as is usually the case) or committed for trial by jury.
In certain cases young persons may claim to be tried by jury, though this
right is rarely exercised.
In Scotland all children and young persons between eight and 17 years of
age who are charged with offences must be dealt with in juvenile courts,
unless they have been charged in conjunction with adult offenders or are
proceeded against on indictment.
In Northern Ireland, likewise, a child or young person between the ages
of eight and 17 will normally be dealt with by a juvenile court unless charged
jointly with an adult or committed for trial by jury in the case of an indictable
offence. Such committal may take place at the request of the accused s parents
or at the discretion of the juvenile court.
Methods of treatment available in law for dealing with children and young
persons found guilty of committing an offence include: absolute discharge;
conditional discharge (in England and Wales and Northern Ireland); fines
imposed upon the offender or, in certain circumstances, upon his parents;
LAW AND ORDER
IO3
probation; committal to the care of a fit person (normally the appropriate
local authority) until the age of 18; or committal to an approved school.
Offenders aged not less than 10 and under 21 years may be ordered to attend
an attendance centre; aged not less than 14 and under 21, they may be detained
in a detention centre; aged not less than 15 and under 21, they may be sent
for a period of borstal training. In Scotland offenders of 17 and under 21
found unsuitable for detention centre or borstal training may be detained in
a young offenders’ institution.
In England, Wales and Scotland remand homes are provided by local
authorities for the custody of boys and girls under the age of 17 before their
appearance in court, or between court appearances (while inquiries are
made as to the best method of treatment for them), while they are awaiting
vacancies in approved schools, or for a short period (up to a month) of
punitive detention. In Northern Ireland the responsibility for providing
or arranging for the provision of remand homes rests with the Ministry of
Home Affairs.
In addition to remand homes, remand centres are being established in
England and Wales (and are planned for Scotland), to which a court may send
young persons between the ages of 17 and 21 who would otherwise be
remanded to prison, and those under 17 years old who are unsuitable for
remand homes.
The system of remand offers valuable opportunities for observation, the
results of which are included in reports for the guidance of those responsible
for the future of young offenders.
Approved schools are residential schools for boys and girls under the age of
17 years who, the courts consider, need not only removal from home but
also a fairly long period of training. These boys and girls may be sent to
approved schools because they have committed an offence or are in need of
care or protection or on certain other grounds not involving the commission
of an offence. The schools may be provided by local authorities, by voluntary
organisations concerned with the welfare of children and young people on a
national scale, or by local committees formed by people interested in such
work. In England and Wales the schools must be approved by the Home
Secretary; in Scotland, by the Secretary of State for Scotland; and in
Northern Ireland, where they are known as training schools, by the Ministry
of Home Affairs.
The schools are for boys only or for girls only. They are classified according
to age on admission, and include separate schools for Roman Catholics.
Assignment to a school in the appropriate age group is determined by such
considerations as the location of the school in relation to the home, the type
of training provided, and the probable reaction of a child or young person
to the individual personalities of the staff.
The main ingredients of approved school training are education in the
formal sense, religious education and guidance, craft training (for the older
groups), attention to health and to the use of recreation and leisure, social
training and personal case-work. Its primary object is the re-adjustment of
the boys and girls for their return to the community; contact is maintained
with their homes while they are in approved schools and after they have left
help and supervision are given.
A child or young person may be detained in an approved school or training
school for three years, except for boys and girls under the age of 12 years and 4
months at the time of committal, who may be kept until the age of 15 years and
104

4 months, and those over the age of 16 on committal, who can be detained
only up to the age of 19, or 19! if they have been found guilty of absconding
or of serious misconduct in an approved school. In England and Wales a boy
or girl aged 15 years or over, and in Scotland any approved school pupil,
who presents a threat to the discipline of a school may be temporarily trans¬
ferred on a justice’s warrant to another establishment pending inquiry as to the
best means of dealing with him. In England and Wales a boy or girl of 15 years
or over who is detained in an approved school as an offender and is thought to
be more suitable for borstal training may, with the consent of the Home
Secretary, be brought before a magistrates’ court, which has power to order
removal to borstal. Managers of approved schools are under an obligation
to review the progress of each pupil in their charge with a view to granting a
release as soon as he or she is fit for it; release within the first six months of
the detention period requires the consent of the reponsible minister.
Statutory responsibility for after-care of boys and girls released from approved
schools rests on the school managers who are assisted in this work by welfare
officers and the probation and child-care services.
A number of attendance centres have been established in England and Wales
to deal with boys between the ages of 10 and 17 found guilty of offences for
which an adult can be sentenced to imprisonment. This form of treatment is
designed to teach young offenders a respect for the law and to give them
some instruction in the proper use of leisure. Boys ordered to attend must
do so during their spare time on Saturday mornings or afternoons; they may
be required to attend for up to three hours on any one occasion and for a
total of not less than twelve hours (with certain exceptions) and not more
than twenty-four. The activities include a period of instruction in handicrafts,
or a lecture (for example, on first aid) and a period of physical training or
disciplinary tasks under supervision. Efforts are made at the centres to
induce the boys to join a youth club or other suitable organisation.
There are also two centres for youths aged 17 to 21, which operate on
lines similar to those adopted at the juvenile centres, but the activities are
adapted to meet the needs of the older age group.
Detention centres provide a means of treating young offenders for whom a
long period of residential training in an approved school or borstal does not
seem necessary but who cannot be taught respect for the law by such measures
as fines or probation. In England and Wales junior centres are available for
boys between the ages of 14 and 17 years, and senior centres for boys between
the ages of 17 and 21. One centre is also available for girls between the ages
of 16 and 21. In Scotland there are two senior centres. Detention in England
and Wales may be for not less than three and not more than six months; if
consecutive sentences are passed, the total term may not exceed nine months
at any one time. Remission of up to one-sixth of the sentence may be earned
for good conduct. In Scotland the fixed period for all detention centre
sentences is three months.
As the intention is primarily deterrent, the life of a centre is strict and
vigorous, demanding a brisk tempo and the highest possible standard of
discipline and behaviour in every aspect of training. The routine provides a
normal working week of 44 hours, including one hour daily devoted to
physical training, and experience has shown that much positive training can
be given within the limits of this framework. Boys of compulsory school age
receive full-time education, and classes of further education are provided for
others in the evenings. Statutory supervision for up to 12 months of young

persons discharged from detention centres is undertaken by probation
officers.
The borstal training system consists of different borstals specialising in
different types of young offender, classified according to such criteria as age,
intelligence and criminal sophistication. There are also a few borstals for
special purposes, such as allocation or recall. In England and Wales the
period of detention ranges from six months to two years and is followed
by supervision for two years from the date of release. In Scotland, where
there is no minimum period of detention, the maximum is two years and the
supervision period is for one year from the date of release from the institution.
Sentences in Northern Ireland are for periods not exceeding three years
including the period under supervision; normally release does not take place
until at least nine months of the sentence has expired. The system is essentially
remedial and educational, based on personal training by a carefully selected
staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled trades; there is
much freedom of movement and many borstals are open establishments.
An initial period of classification ensures that each young offender is sent to
the institution best suited to his or her requirements.
The probation service is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender
while he remains at work or at school under the supervision of a probation
officer, whose duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal feature
of the service is that it relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before
making a probation order, the court must explain its effects and make sure
that the probationer understands that if he fails to comply with the require¬
ments of the order he will be liable to be dealt with for the original offence.
A probation order cannot be made without the consent of the person con¬
cerned unless (in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland only) he is under
14 years of age. The order usually requires the probationer to keep in regular
touch with the probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an
industrious life. It may also require him to live in a specified place, or to
submit to treatment for his mental condition. A probation order is made for
not less than one year and not more than three years.
Every magistrates’ court and superior criminal court must have available the
services of probation officers of both sexes. In England and Wales the appoint¬
ment of probation officers is the responsibility of probation committees com¬
posed of justices and in Scotland of probation committees composed of ex officio
members and members appointed by the local authorities, but first appoint¬
ments are subject to confirmation by the Home Secretary and the Secretary
of State for Scotland respectively. In Northern Ireland the Minister of Home
Affairs himself appoints the probation officers. Training facilities in England
and Wales are provided by the Home Office on the advice of the Advisory
Council for Probation and After-Care and are made available by arrangement
to Northern Ireland officers. In Scotland training is mainly provided during
the first year of appointment and before the officer enters on the duties of
the service.
Research into the causes and prevention of crime and into various methods
of dealing with offenders is increasingly recognised as of vital importance in
dealing with the problems of delinquency. A research unit of the Home Office
carries out a wide programme of research and maintains liaison with academic
organisations. Government grants for criminological research at universities
and other institutions are likely to amount to over £90,000 in 1965-66.

The principal university research establishment is the Institute of Crimin¬
ology in Cambridge University, which, in addition to its research activities,
conducts advanced courses in criminology for people engaged in work relating
to the treatment of offenders and the administration of the criminal law, and
a postgraduate course in criminology. Research is also undertaken at many
other universities, including Oxford, London, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
In addition to research, special inquiries into particular questions are con¬
ducted, as necessary, by advisory bodies or specially appointed committees.
Reports have been issued on such matters as corporal punishment, the non-
residential treatment of offenders under 21 years, preventive detention, and
the organisation of after-care for discharged prisoners.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organised in a system of locally
administered forces which the ministers of the Crown who are responsible
for the maintenance of law and order in their respective countries have
certain powers to influence and control. In England and Wales the responsible
minister is the Home Secretary; in Scotland, the Secretary of State for
Scotland. In Northern Ireland the police force is controlled by an Inspector-
General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
There are 152 regular police forces in Great Britain: 121 in England and
Wales1 and 31 in Scotland. Each of these forces (between which there is close
and constant co-operation) is responsible for a separate police area. In
England and Wales the forces are defined according to area of responsibility
as: county forces; county borough forces; combined forces, which are forces
whose area of responsibility extends over two or more counties or boroughs,
the Metropolitan Police Force, which is responsible for an area of approximately
fifteen miles radius from Charing Cross, but excluding the City of London;
and the City of London force. In Scotland there are county forces, burgh
forces and combined forces.
In England and Wales and Scotland police forces vary considerably in size
according to the area and population which they serve. Thus the Metropolitan
Police Force has a strength of approximately 18,000, while that of the smallest
force in Scotland is 20.
The actual strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is approxi¬
mately 80,000, including women. This is below the desirable figure, but the
improvement in recruitment shown in recent years has been maintained.
In addition to the regular police forces, there are the River Tyne police, the
police forces maintained by certain public services, such as the statutory
transport authorities, the Service and departmental constabularies, and the
special constabularies attached to each regular police force.
For each of the regular police forces there is a police authority with the duty
of securing the maintenance of an adequate and efficient force. In the counties
of England and Wales the authority is a police committee and in the county
boroughs a watch committee. Both are committees of the local council and
consist of councillors and justices in a proportion of two to one.
1 The Home Secretary has certain powers, which have recently been strengthened, to
amalgamate existing police areas in England and Wales, and establish a combine
police force.
Central

Police Officers
LAW AND ORDER IO7
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home
Secretary. In the City of London the Court of Common Council is the police
authority, although it usually appoints a standing committee to deal with all
police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland the police authority for the counties is the county council; in
the large burghs it is the town council; and where there are combined forces
there is a joint police committee.
Police authorities provide the buildings and equipment needed by their
forces and, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary or the Secretary
of State for Scotland, fix the authorised establishment. They also appoint
the chief constable in their area, subject to ministerial approval, and may
retire him in the interests of efficiency, if the Home Secretary or the Secretary
of State for Scotland agrees. Police authorities must also keep themselves
informed of the way in which chief constables deal with complaints from the
public against police officers. In the Metropolitan Police District the chief
officer of police and his immediate subordinates are appointed by the Crown
on the recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police
forces, but are answerable to the police authorities for the efficiency with
which they are used.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have a general
duty to exercise their powers to promote the efficiency of the police. They
are empowered to retire a chief constable in the interests of efficiency, to
call for a report from a chief constable on any matters relating to the policing
of his area, and to require co-operation between forces on any police matter.
Uniformity in the conditions of service and in the administration of the
police is achieved through detailed police regulations which are made by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland under statutory
powers. The police regulations cover such matters as organisation, discipline,
pay, allowances, pensions, clothing and conditions of service of the members of
all the regular police forces and of the River Tyne police. Some of these are
first negotiable on the Police Council for Great Britain; the others are dis¬
cussed on representative advisory bodies along with any general questions
affecting the police service.
In his supervisory responsibilities the Home Secretary is assisted by Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and eight inspectors. Each
inspector is responsible for a certain number of forces, and satisfies himself of
their continuing efficiency by annual inspection, ad hoc visits and consultations
when particular problems arise. The inspectors report to the Home Secretary
on the condition of all the forces, with the exception of the Metropolitan
Police Force. The Secretary of State for Scotland is similarly assisted by Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary in Scotland and one other inspector.
All police authorities receive a government grant equal to half their net
expenditure except the Common Council of the City of London, which
receives only one-third. The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for
Scotland are empowered to withhold the grant, in whole or in part, permanently
or for such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a police
area is efficiently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered,
or that the rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
There are in Great Britain regular police officers, who usually serve for
25 years or more and thereafter retire on pension, and special constables, who
I08 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
are volunteers who perform short periods of duty without pay in their spare
time from their normal occupations.1
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the
ages of iq and 30. Women entrants in England and Wales must be between
the ages of 20 and 35, and in Scotland between 20 and 30 years old. Men
over 30 years old, and women of 19* may however be appointed, on the
recommendation of the appointing authority, in special circumstances approved
by the Home Secretary in England and Wales. In Scotland the Secretary of
State may approve appointments of both men and women over 30 years old.
The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
Police District, are: chief constable, superintendent, inspector, sergeant and
constable. Intermediate ranks may also be adopted in areas where varying
degrees of responsibility make them necessary. In the Metropolitan Police
District the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.
He is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four assistant commissioners.
Next in rank are commanders, then deputy commanders; the other ranks
are the same as in the rest of the country. In the City of London the ranks are
the same as in the provinces, except that the chief officer is the Commissioner
of Police and the second in command is an assistant commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a
basic principle of the service that its members must not only be free from
political bias, but must also be seen to be free of it. All ranks, however, have
their own representative associations which can make representations to
ministers or to police authorities on matters of interest or concern to their
members.
Police Cadets Police cadets are recruited by most forces from among youths between 16 and
18 years of age. They have no police powers but are given some training in
police work, partly as useful preparation for subsequent appointment as
constables and partly to give them sufficient insight into police duties to
enable them to decide whether or not they wish to make a career in the police
service. Some forces also recruit girl cadets.
Civil Staff A number of police authorities employ civilians as shorthand-typists, switch¬
board operators, mechanics, canteen staff and cleaners, in order to release
uniformed personnel for police duties.
Traffic Wardens Traffic wardens are employed in London and several other areas to assist the
police in dealing with the problems created by parked vehicles. In specially
designated areas traffic wardens have power to give motorists who have
committed certain parking offences an option to pay a fixed penalty to the
clerk of the appropriate court instead of having their cases tried.
Police Duties Every police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public
office. His powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by common
law, are exercised by virtue of his office; he is not a servant of the police
authority. Chief officers of police in England and Wales have a vicarious
liability for any wrongful act committed by their subordinates in the
performance of their functions as constables.
The many and varied functions of a police officer as a constable range from
the protection of persons and property, road or street patrolling and traffic
control to criminal investigation and the apprehension of offenders.

subject to strict limitations.

All police forces have their own criminal investigation departments, and
many have other specialised departments, including motor patrols, river police
(in districts which include long stretches of navigable waterway), a mounted
branch (for maintaining order and safety in large crowds), and police dogs.
During recent years a number of common services have been provided by
the central government departments for the benefit of all forces; they
supplement those provided by the police authorities for their own use and
by communal arrangements made between the forces themselves. The most
important of these services are: research and planning, undertaken by the
police research and planning branch of the Home Office, which works in
close co-operation with, and makes its findings available to, all police forces
in Great Britain; training services, which in England and Wales provide ten
residential training centres and a central police college and in Scotland a central
police college with courses of recruit training and higher training; a forensic
science service in England and Wales which provides laboratories for the use
of regional groups of forces; wireless depots, which in England and Wales
supply and maintain wireless equipment for the police; and central and
provincial criminal records which are available to all forces; a recent example
of co-operation between forces is the formation of regional crime squads,
consisting of teams of experienced detectives from several forces, which
assist, on request, neighbouring police forces in investigating major crimes
involving inquiries in more than one police area. Arrangements are also made
for mutual aid between forces, providing everyday assistance by one force to
another.
Services provided by the Metropolitan Police Force for other forces include
(1) the publication of the Police Gazette,1 which contains particulars of people
wanted for crime and details of stolen property, and is supplied without
charge to the police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain other Com¬
monwealth and foreign forces; (2) the organisation and control of the special
branch of the criminal investigation department at New Scotland Yard,
whose duties include the physical protection of royalty, some ministers, and
distinguished foreign visitors; and (3) the carrying out of extradition orders
made by the courts. The Metropolitan Police Force is also available, on
request, to assist any other police force in England and Wales in criminal
investigations. Similarly, the services of the Fraud Squad, run jointly by
the Metropolitan Police Force and the City of London Police, are available
throughout Great Britain for the investigation of serious company frauds.
The National Central Bureau, which handles the business of the International
Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) on behalf of Great Britain and the
British dependencies, is part of the Metropolitan Police Force. For certain
of these services, the Metropolitan Police Force receives an additional
Exchequer grant.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary comes under the direction of the Inspector
General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs. It undertakes
the policing of the whole of Northern Ireland, its cost being borne by the
Northern Ireland Exchequer.
The strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is approximately 3,000. The
Inspector General has, under his immediate command, a deputy inspector

general, a commissioner for the City of Belfast, and a county inspector for
each of the six counties. The area is further sub-divided into districts, each
district coming under a district inspector and each sub-district under a head
constable or a sergeant. Conditions of service and pay follow closely on the
lines of the police service in Great Britain, and the general duties pertaining
to the various ranks are much the same. Although the more senior ranks bear
different titles, the ranks of head constable, sergeant and constable are broadly
equivalent to the three junior ranks in the police service of Great Britain.
The Ulster Special Constabulary also comes under the direction of the
Inspector General. In the main, this force is a part-time body with a small
nucleus of full-time personnel for organisation and training purposes. In
normal times the Special Constabulary has only a training liability, although
it may assist the Royal Ulster Constabulary on special occasions. Part-time
personnel may also be mobilised for full-time duty. The force consists of
about 11,000 part-time members, of whom about 200 are mobilised, and
some no full-time personnel.

DEFENCE
Collective
Defence
Britain’s defence policy has two purposes: to guarantee the nation’s security
and to contribute towards peace and stability in the world as a whole. These
purposes are inseparable. Neither can be achieved by armed force alone.
In the long run the security of Britain, like that of every other country, can
be assured only by general and comprehensive disarmament under the
United Nations; even in the short run it will be difficult to maintain unless
countries of different political ideologies reach greater understanding on the
limitation and control of armaments. Meanwhile Britain’s security will depend
on alliances with its friends in many parts of the world. Interdependence is
the only basis for national security in the nuclear age.
Similarly, world peace and stability can best be assured by strengthening
the peace-keeping powers of the United Nations, and this must remain the
principal objective. But until the United Nations is able to exercise the
responsibility for maintaining world peace, Britain must, to meet its obliga¬
tions to Commonwealth and allied countries, maintain a capacity for providing
military assistance in many parts of the world.
Information about defence policy and the armed forces is given annually
in a Statement on the Defence Estimates.1 The arrangements provide for closely
integrated well-trained, highly mobile, all-regular forces equipped with the
most modern weapons and organised on up-to-date lines; and for a central
strategic reserve maintained in Britain, with means of transport, including
airlift, to take it rapidly to the scene of any trouble.
The national defence policy has been increasingly based on the realisation
that no country can protect itself in isolation and the defence of Britain is
possible only as part of a system of collective defence. Britain maintains
forces in three areas of the world as contributions to the collective security
alliances of which it is a member—the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO) and the Western European Union (WEU), the Central Treaty
Organisation (CENTO) and the SEATO defence system in South-East Asia.
Close liaison is maintained with other Commonwealth countries, facilitating
considerable standardisation of equipment and training and interchange of
personnel.
Britain’s contribution to NATO includes over three-quarters of the opera¬
tional and reserve fleets, a considerable proportion of the Royal Air Force
front-line aircraft including the whole of Fighter Command and the V-bomber
force, RAF Germany, nearly all Coastal Command, and the British Army of
the Rhine. The British Polaris submarines now under construction will be
assigned to a NATO Commander. A further contribution is the provision of
facilities for a depot ship in the Holy Loch (Firth of Clyde, Scotland) for the
United States Polaris submarines.
Under an agreement between the British and United States Governments
signed in i960, a joint Ballistic Missile Early Warning Station has been built
at Fylingdales Moor, Yorkshire. The United States has provided equipment
1 The defence programme is being reviewed; this chapter describes the position in
June 1965.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for this station. The Fylingdales station completes the chain of three early
warning stations that would supply information about missile attacks to
western defence headquarters. The others are in Thule, Greenland, and
Clear, Alaska.
Britain makes annual contributions towards the defence infra-structure of
the CENTO region, keeps a Royal Air Force nuclear bomber force in Cyprus
expressly for the defence of the region and provides various military training
facilities.
Singapore is a base for all three Services. Britain has a combined commit¬
ment to SEATO and to Malaysia (which is not a member of SEATO). Here,
also, Britain provides training facilities for military personnel and, in parti¬
cular, has built a strategic airfield in Thailand with the help of Australia and
New'Zealand. Britain maintains forces in Malaysia, including those in the
Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve which comprises the Common¬
wealth Brigade and associated naval and air units, all of which are drawn from
Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
Nuclear Policy The object of nuclear defence policy is the deterrence of an aggressor by the
fear of devastating retaliation. Britain’s principal nuclear weapon is at present
the Blue Steel propelled stand-off bomb, carried by the V-bombers of the
Royal Air Force; these bombs greatly reduce the vulnerability of the bomber
as they can be released a long distance from the target. Long-term nuclear
strategy is based on the nuclear-powered submarine, equipped with Polaris
missiles (see p. 122).
The Government’s nuclear policy rests on the belief that the increased
understanding of the consequences of nuclear warfare has greatly reduced its
likelihood between the alliances of east and west. This stability might, however,
be jeopardised by the spread of nuclear weapons to countries which do not
now possess them. An urgent aim of the Government’s foreign policy is to
bring about international agreement to prevent their dissemination and
defence policy is directed towards encouraging such agreements. In the
meantime, nuclear policy is intended to provide some reassurance to non¬
nuclear powers. The Government has proposed the formation of an Atlantic
Nuclear Force in which the strategic nuclear power of NATO would be
concentrated and controlled under conditions which would both meet the
legitimate requirements of the non-nuclear members to play their part and
remove any incentive for the dissemination of nuclear weapons.
THE MACHINERY Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Prime Minister
OF DEFENCE anci the Cabinet, under the ultimate control of Parliament. Defence problems
PLANNING and their implicatioris for foreign and economic policy are dealt with on
the Cabinet’s behalf by the Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy, under
the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.
In 1964 major changes were made in the government departments respon¬
sible for defence. A unified Ministry of Defence, under a Secretary of State,
was set up, absorbing what were formerly four separate departments—the
Ministry of Defence, the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry.
The Secretary of State for Defence is assisted by three Ministers of Defence
for the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force respectively, who have a
particular responsibility for the management of the individual Services but
who also assist the Secretary of State in any general defence matters which
he delegates to them. The Minister of Defence for the Army also acts as
Deputy to the Secretary of State for Defence, with particular responsibility

for the co-ordination of politico-strategic policy other than day to day opera¬
tions; the Minister for the Royal Navy co-ordinates personnel matters and
logistics and deals with problems of administrative rationalisation; and the
Minister for the Royal Air Force co-ordinates research, development and
production, and the defence budget as a whole.
Command and administration of the armed forces is vested in the Defence
Council, under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State. The members of
the Defence Council are the three Ministers of Defence, the Chief of the
Defence Staff and the Chiefs of Staff, the Chief Scientific Adviser and the
Permanent Under-Secretary of State. The Defence Council deals mainly with
major defence policy.
The principal military advisers to the Government are the members of the
Chiefs of Staff Committee, which comprises the Chief of the Defence Staff
as chairman and the Chiefs of Staff of the three Services. The Committee is
responsible to the Government for professional advice on strategy and military
operations and on the military implications of defence policy.
The Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff are advised by the Defence
Research Policy Committee on all scientific and technical matters which may
affect the formulation and direction of defence policy. The Committee also
keeps under review the defence research and development programme. Its
members are government officials responsible for the operational and scien¬
tific aspects of research and their development for defence purposes.
The management of the three Services is delegated to Admiralty, Army and
Air Force Boards of the Defence Council, of each of which the Secretary of
State is chairman, although the appropriate Minister of Defence normally acts
for him. The Boards each have three additional civilian members from their
respective Departments (the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for
Defence, a junior minister, the Second Permanent Under-Secretary of State,
a civil servant who is secretary of the Board, and the Chief Scientist) and
six (Admiralty and Army Boards) or five (Air Force Board) Service members,
each in charge of a separate branch of administration.
Unified control of policy and management has made possible further
rationalisation of Service administration and operation. Rationalisation of
air power is under consideration and the whole structure of defence organisa¬
tion, both in the Commands and in the Ministry of Defence, is being
re-examined.
The Royal Navy has nine specialist branches: Seaman, Communications,
Engineering, Fleet Air Arm, Electrical, Supply and Secretariat, Medical,
Artificers and the Regulating Branch.
The Corps of the Royal Marines, which is part of the Royal Navy, is a body
of men trained for service on sea or land. Its official existence dates from
1664. The present-day functions of the corps are: to provide personnel for
Commandos; to provide crews for minor landing craft and certain other
parties required for amphibious assault; and to supply for H.M. ships
detachments which take part in the routine duties, including guard duty, and
provide emergency landing parties.
The Army is organised into some 30 arms and services1 which include the
Household Cavalry, the Royal Armoured Corps (the historic Cavalry Regi¬
ments and the Royal Tank Regiment), the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the
1 These arms and services include the women’s corps.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals (which provides land
and wireless communications), the five regiments of Foot Guards (the Brigade
of Guards), the regiments of the Infantry of the Line (grouped into brigades
and the Parachute Regiment), the Army Air Corps (which operates light
aircraft on reconnaissance and undertakes aerial observation and liaison work),
the Royal Corps of Transport (which operates all types of logistic vehicles
from locomotives to aircraft), the Royal Army Medical Corps, the Royal
Army Ordnance Corps (responsible for most equipment and stores), and the
Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (responsible for most repairs).
The specialist branches of the Royal Air Force are the eight Home
Commands (see p. 115).
THE DEFENCE In recent years defence has accounted for about a quarter of all central
BUDGET government ordinary expenditure. The cost of the defence programme for
1965-66 was estimated at £2,120-5 million, or 6-8 per cent of the gross
national product. Britain’s contribution to the Western nuclear deterrent is
less than 10 per cent of this total.
Britain’s contribution to the NATO forces involves a deployment of forces
overseas and a consequent heavy burden on the country s balance of pay¬
ments. The German Federal Republic relieved this burden to the extent
of about ^54 million in each of the two years 1962—63 and 1963—64, mainly
by placing in Britain contracts for military (and some civil) goods, and in 1965
agreed to make further purchases, totalling ^171 million, in the three years
ending 31st March, 1967. In 1963 the expenditure in foreign currency for the
maintenance of British forces abroad and other military purposes amounted
to some £247 million and in 1964 to some ^275 million.
The allocation of finance between government departments is shown in
Table 5.

The Ministry of Defence (Central) Estimates consist mainly of contributions
to NATO and other international defence organisations. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works Estimates cover works services for the three
Services and the Ministry of Aviation.
Home defence expenditure by civil departments in 1965-66 is estimated
at £22-7 million.
The long-term financial planning and control of the defence programme
and the allocation of resources to the three Services is the responsibility of
the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, who co-ordinates the views of
military, scientific and civil administrative staffs.

The home and overseas commands of the Services are:

British naval forces in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean area are
assigned to NATO. Naval command in the Middle East rests with the Flag
Officer, Middle East, and in the Far East with the Commander, Far East
Fleet. Smaller naval forces operate under the Commander-in-Chief, South

Royal Air Force, Germany (Second Tactical Air Force, assigned to NATO);
Near East Air Force; Air Forces, Middle East; Far East Air Force.
Operational control of the Forces in the Middle and Far East is exercised
through Unified Command Headquarters in Aden and Singapore respectively.
Responsibility for the command of British forces allocated to the area and the
planning and conduct of all operations is vested in a single commander, who
may belong to any of the three Services; he is supported by an inter-Service
staff co-ordinated by a Chief of Staff. These arrangements are one of the most
important features of the increasing unity of the Services.
The basic principle of Britain’s deployment is to retain in overseas theatres
the minimum forces consistent with commitments, and to hold ready in the
United Kingdom a Strategic Reserve, together with the air transport necessary
to reinforce at maximum speed to anywhere in the world. Of a total force of
393,000, the broad division between men based in Britain and based overseas
(including Germany) is as follows:
United Kingdom, 241,000; Germany (including Berlin), 62,000;
Mediterranean, 23,000; East of Suez, 58,000 (plus 14,000 Gurkhas);
elsewhere, 9,000.
The Strategic Reserve is a highly mobile force, transportable by air and
capable of undertaking operations in any part of the world. Royal Air Force
(RAF) Transport Command can provide airlift for men and equipment on
behalf of all three Services and reinforce tactical transport aircraft overseas.
Bomber, Fighter and Coastal Commands of the RAF have NATO commit¬
ments, like the naval forces, but are also available for overseas reinforcement.
Bomber Command can carry conventional or nuclear weapons.
Naval forces based on Britain include an aircraft carrier, cruisers, guided
missile destroyers, escorts, submarines and smaller craft.
The principal administrative, training, technical and support facilities for
all three Services are also maintained in Britain.
1 Flying Training and Technical Training Commands are to be amalgamated into a
single Training Command from 1st June, 1968.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain has a commitment to keep 55,000 soldiers and a Tactical Air Force on
the continent of Europe. In the event of an acute emergency overseas Britain
can withdraw forces temporarily.
The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) is not quite at full strength, but
the commitment of 55,000 is recognised. There are in Germany Canberra
strike and reconnaissance squadrons, Hunter fighter-reconnaissance aircraft,
Javelin fighters (being replaced by Lightnings) and Wessex 2 helicopters.
In the Mediterranean, Britain has escort vessels and some minesweepers;
small Army garrisons at Gibraltar and Malta; and two maritime and one
reconnaissance squadron. The naval and air forces are mainly deployed in
support of NATO.
In Cyprus, Britain maintains an Army garrison with supporting troops in
addition to the RAF base at Akrotiri and an RAF contingent at Nicosia. RAF
units include a Javelin all-weather fighter squadron and Canberra bomber
squadrons for the support of CENTO; the latter have a nuclear as well as a
conventional capacity.
Aden is the base for a Royal Marine Commando, Army units and RAF ground
attack and air defence, reconnaissance and transport squadrons. At Bahrein
in the Persian Gulf there is an Army detachment. The RAF is also represented
in the Gulf. Naval units on the Middle East station, with base facilities at
Aden and Bahrein, include escorts, the amphibious warfare squadron and
minesweepers. Carriers and Commando ships cover the whole area east of
Suez.
Britain’s largest forces outside Europe are in the Far East. The deployment of
aircraft carriers and Commando ships is flexible between the Middle East and
Far East and Britain expects to maintain a total of three in the area east of
Suez. In the Far East there are, in addition, guided missile destroyers and a
large number of escorts, submarines and coastal minesweepers. Among the
Army units there is the Commonwealth Brigade Group which has units from
Britain, Australia and New Zealand and integrated supporting arms and
services. RAF units permanently deployed in the Far East include Canberra
bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, Hunter ground attack aircraft, Shackleton
maritime patrol aircraft, Hastings, Beverley and Argosy transport aircraft,
Whirlwind and Belvedere helicopters and Javelin fighters.
Britain also maintains a military force in Hong Kong.

Forces in other areas include escort vessels and small ground forces in the
Caribbean, and small naval forces in the South Atlantic and on loan to
Australia and Canada.
Defence policy provides for a force of about 400,000 professional servicemen,
with the highest possible proportion in effective combat units, backed by an
equal number of civilians. The forces consist entirely of regular volunteers.
An analysis of the strength of the forces in April 1965, with estimates for
1966, is given in Table 6. In addition, there were nearly 202,000 reserve and
auxiliary forces with training liability on 1st January, 1965.

Entrants to the non-commissioned ranks of the three Services are given a
basic training, and further training is given during the course of their careers.
Young servicemen may have the opportunity to read for the General Certifi¬
cate of Education ‘O’ level (see p. 161). Technical training, though primarily
designed for Service purposes, leads in most cases to nationally recognised
qualifications and experience which will be valuable later in civilian life.
Completion of many Service technical courses, followed by experience in the
trade, is recognised by trade unions as a qualification for membership by men
who have left the Services.
Men may qualify for the rank of commissioned officer in several ways, with
some differences between the three Services. Commissions may be granted
for short, medium or long terms.
Promotion from the non-commissioned ranks is possible in all three
Services. In the Royal Navy and the Army the normal method of entry is
through cadetship in the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, or the
Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. This is followed by specialist training
which may include degree courses. The RAF trains cadets for long-term
commissions at the RAF College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire, but the majority of
entrants to the flying and executive branches take Direct Entry Commissions
(of medium length). There is special provision in the three Services for the
entry of men with appropriate qualifications including doctors, dentists and
other graduates.
Selected officers of all three Services who have had previous staff training or
have been to the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich (London), the Army
jjg BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Staff College at Camberley (Surrey), or the Royal Air Force Staff Colleges at
Bracknell (Berkshire) or Andover (Hampshire) go to the Joint Services Staff
College at Chesham (Buckinghamshire), where particular attention is paid to
the inter-Service aspects of staff work. This college caters for about 150
students a year from the Navy, Army and Air Force, the Civil Service, and
from other Commonwealth countries. A few specially selected and more senior
officers from the Services, the Civil Service, and from other Commonwealth
countries are sent to the Imperial Defence College in London.
Considerable training is done through Joint-Service and inter-allied
exercises, on which increasing emphasis is being placed. Joint-Service
exercises are held both in Britain and in many overseas countries. Inter¬
allied exercises take place under the auspices of the three regional alliances.
The three women’s services, Women s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the
Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC) and the Women's Royal Air Force
(WRAF) are integral parts of the Navy, Army and RAF respectively. The
WRNS has its own disciplinary code, but the WRAC and WRAF are subject
to the law of the respective men’s Service. Service women serve alongside
servicemen in Britain and overseas. Nursing services are provided by Queen
Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service, Queen Alexandra's Royal Army
Nursing Corps and Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service.
Resettlement A Regular Forces Resettlement Service, set up by the Minister of Labour in
1957, assists regular officers and other ranks to find civilian employment on
leaving the forces (see Chapter 16, Labour).
The structure and functions of the reserve forces are under review (see p. 111).
The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) consists of volunteer reserves—serving at
sea in the Merchant Navy or the fishing fleets or in civilian employment
ashore—who carry out training in time of peace to meet the Navy’s mobilisa¬
tion requirements. Other reserves include the Royal Fleet Reserve (RrR),
composed of certain ex-regulars; the Royal Marine Forces Volunteer Reserve
(RMFVR); and the Women's Royal Naval Reserve (WRNR).
The Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, a civilian organisation composed of
men and women volunteers, is responsible in time of war for mine watching
duties around the coast and the waterways, and other duties.
Britain’s main reserve forces are the Regular Reserve, the Territorial Army,
the Army Emergency Reserve and the Long Term Reserve; m July 1965 the
Government announced plans for reconstituting the Territorial Army and
Army Emergency Reserve as a single reserve, with effect from 1967.
The Regular Reserve consists of men who have completed the Colour
portion of their service with the Regular Army but who are retained on a
Reserve to complete a total engagement of 12 years: as such they are hah e to
recall to the Colours and for this they are paid a small daily retainer.
The Territorial Army is a voluntary force raised as local units in nearly
all corps of the Army. After mobilisation they can be used to reinforce
the Regular Army overseas (particularly BAOR), to support the cml aut o-
rities in the United Kingdom or to provide a framework on which general
preparation for war can be made. Volunteers can undertake a further liability
to join the Territorial Army Emergency Reserve (The Ever-Readies) whic
makes them available for six months’ service with the Regular Army in times
of tension.

The Army Emergency Reserve (AER) is a voluntary force, the majority of
the volunteers being specialists. It is recruited countrywide and organised
into communications units, administrative units and pools of individuals. The
AER is used to supplement either the Regular or the Territorial Army.
The Long Term Reserve (LTR) was created by the Navy, Army and Air
Forces Reserves Act 1964. As a result of this Act all men who join the Regular
Army after February 1964 will be transferred to the LTR on completion of
their Regular and Regular Reserve service. They will remain in the LTR
until the age of 45 and will be liable to recall in an emergency. They are unpaid.
The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists of two maritime headquarters units
and a maritime support unit. The units are raised and maintained by local
Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations and functionally controlled by
Coastal Command. In addition the Royal Auxiliary Air Force General List
comprises officers specially selected for service in war appointments.
The Royal Air Force Reserve consists mainly of officers and airmen who
have served in the Air Force. It includes the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve,
whose members, like the officers, airmen and airwomen of the Royal Auxiliary
Air Force, have a liability to carry out training on a part-time basis. University
air squadrons (established at 17 universities) form part of the Royal Air Force
Volunteer Reserve.
The Royal Observer Corps is a predominantly civilian and voluntary
organisation, administered by Fighter Command. Its present strength is over
15,000 men and women whose principal task would be the measuring and
reporting of radioactivity in the event of nuclear attack. Some 1,500 under¬
ground operations centres have been built for the corps.
Cadet Forces provide pre-Service training for boys and, in addition, aim to
teach good citizenship.
The Combined Cadet Force (CCF) contingents are based on schools in
which education is continued to the age of 17 or over, and normally take boys
for three years between the ages of 14 and 18. During this time they receive
training in the Royal Navy, Army, or Royal Air Force sections of their choice.
There are also the Sea Cadet Corps (for boys between 12 and 18), the
Army Cadet Force (14 to i8f) which has ‘open’ detachments in towns and
villages and ‘closed’ detachments in schools that do not have CCF contin¬
gents (boys who have left school may join ‘open’ detachments), and the Air
Training Corps (14 to 20).
The Ministry of Aviation is responsible for the supply to the Services of
aircraft, guided weapons (including ballistic missiles), nuclear weapons and
certain radar and other electronic equipment. The Ministry of Defence is
responsible for the procurement of other weapons, stores and equipment.
Under the new organisation, requirements for weapons and equipment are,
where possible, formulated on a Defence, rather than a single Service, basis by
the Defence Operational Requirements staff of the Ministry.
A substantial part of the equipment used by the Services is developed and
produced in Britain, some by private industry on a contract basis and some
by the Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal Dockyards and other establish¬
ments operated by the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Defence.
Production of nuclear warheads is undertaken by the Atomic Energy
Authority (see p. 215) under contract with the Ministry of Aviation. In some
cases—particularly where development costs would be disproportionately

high—aircraft, weapons and other equipment are bought from overseas.
Conversely, British defence equipment has been adopted by allied and friendly
nations: for example, the United States, the German Federal Republic,
Denmark and Sweden are using the British 105 mm. tank gun, and British
early warning radar equipment has been adopted by several countries and
by NATO. ,
Britain also undertakes manufacture in collaboration with other countries.
One example is the United States Bullpup short-range air-to-surface guided
weapon which has been adopted by the Royal Navy and is being manu¬
factured in Europe under a NATO international agency.
Research and development are undertaken at a number of specialised
establishments. Among the most important of those belonging to the Ministry
of Aviation are: the Royal Aircraft Establishments, Farnborough and
Bedford; the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern, and the Aeroplane and
Armament Experimental Establishment, Boscombe Down, Wiltshire. The
Navy Department’s two research establishments carry out research on ships,
maritime equipment and weapons and also on certain kinds of electronic
equipment on behalf of all three Services. They are at Portsdown (near
Portsmouth), where the design and development of ship-borne gunnery and
guided missile systems are carried out, and at Portland (Dorset), where all
aspects of work on underwater detection are co-ordinated with work on
underwater weapons. Research establishments controlled by the Army
Department include the Royal Armament Research and Development
Establishment, Sevenoaks, Kent; and the Fighting Vehicles Research and
Development Establishment, Chobham, Surrey.
Much experimental work has been carried out by the Navy, with the Atomic
Energy Authority, on nuclear propelled submarines and a nuclear submarine
power unit prototype is in operation at Dounreay (see p. 217). The hunter-
killer nuclear submarines, with new detection equipment of advanced design
and an armament of homing torpedoes, are specially effective anti-submarine
weapons. The Royal Naval College, Greenwich, has a low-power training
reactor which provides facilities for basic education in nuclear engineering
and research.
Guided missiles are tested at the Ministry of Aviation s research establish¬
ments, and guided and ballistic missiles at the Woomera range set up in
Australia under the Joint United Kingdom/Australia Guided Weapon Project.
Service firing trials of air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles are carried out at
Aberporth and at the Army gunnery range in Anglesey; a range for testing
surface-to-surface missiles has been set up on South Uist in the Hebrides.
There is close collaboration with the United States in the exchange of
information and visits by technical personnel and units.
Research into nuclear weapons began in Britain during the second world
war. It was continued, as an allied project, in the United States where the
first atomic bomb was produced. After a subsequent period of independent
development in both countries, collaboration was resumed in 1958, when an
agreement was concluded which made possible the exchange of information
on the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons. This was supplemented
by a further agreement in May 1959, which contained provisions to enable
Britain to buy from the United States component parts of atomic weapons
and weapons systems, other than actual warheads, and to make possible the
exchange of nuclear materials between the two countries.

Britain’s present nuclear programme is based on an agreement of 1963
under which Britain buys from the United States a number of Polaris missiles,
to be fitted with British nuclear warheads, for submarines to be built largely
by Britain. Four submarines are to be constructed (see p. 122), each to be
equipped with 16 missiles.
In 1963 Britain, with the United States, the Soviet Union and many other
countries, signed a treaty prohibiting testing of nuclear weapons in the
atmosphere, outer space and under water.
Military research work and development of new military equipment are
extremely expensive and complex and Britain is pursuing a policy of inter¬
dependence in this field with its NATO and Commonwealth partners and
with other friendly nations.
The new navy that is coming into being is smaller than that of the past
but highly mobile and flexible. The aircraft carrier will continue to be the core,
and grouped round the carriers will be supporting ships carrying the latest
weapons for dealing with air, surface and underwater attacks and capable of
acting by themselves on detached service. Seaborne task forces will include
commando ships and assault ships designed to carry a striking force of troops
with their tanks, guns and logistic backing.
During 1965 there were 143 ships in the operational Fleet (including
4 aircraft carriers, 2 commando ships, 2 cruisers, 4 guided missile destroyers,
7 other destroyers, 41 frigates and 35 submarines), together with 45 engaged
on trials and training and 98 support ships and auxiliaries.
The modern carriers are equipped with the angled flight deck, the steam
catapult, the automatic aircraft positioning device, and the mirror and ‘Audio’
landing aids (all British inventions).
The carrier H.M.S. Eagle will be the first ship fitted with the revolutionary
Action Data Automation system, giving command and control facilities in
advance of any system at present known. For the 1970s a force of three
aircraft carriers is contemplated, two now in the Fleet and a third which is
being designed. Two former aircraft carriers, the Bulwark and the Albion,
have been converted into commando carriers, designed to carry a Royal
Marine commando (some 750 men), together with helicopters, landing craft
and vehicles. Two assault ships of entirely new design have been launched,
the Fearless and the Intrepid. They will greatly increase the Navy’s facilities
for amphibian operations by their speed, improved communications and larger
troop-carrying capacity and their ability to land tanks, heavy vehicles and
equipment.
Three Tiger class cruisers, with fully automatic armament and the latest
control equipment, have been completed. Of six County class guided missile
destroyers planned for the Navy, four have joined the active fleet. Their
armament includes the Seaslug missile, a most effective weapon for the inter¬
ception of attacking aircraft, and the shorter range Seacat missile for close air
defence. The escort fleet also includes nine Leander class frigates, with a
further seven under construction.
The seven Type 81 Tribal class frigates, embodying the new gas turbine
boost machinery pioneered by the Royal Navy, are now operational. Eight
fast long-range conventional submarines of the Porpoise class are now in
service, as well as eleven of the highly manoeuvrable Oberon class. The Navy’s
first nuclear-propelled submarine, the Dreadnought, was commissioned in
1963. It incorporates a United States nuclear propulsion unit. The second
nuclear submarine, Valiant, of British design, was launched later in 1963.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Afloat support to the Fleet for replenishment at sea, or in harbours or
anchorages, is provided by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service, comprising
tankers, store-issuing ships, tugs and salvage vessels. These ships fly the Blue
Ensign and are manned by Merchant Navy officers and seamen.
The dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham and Rosyth provide
the Navy with major supplies and repair facilities at home. Singapore and
Gibraltar are the main dockyards overseas.
It is intended that the first Polaris submarine should be ready for patrol
in mid-1968, and three by the end of the decade. Work is in hand on the
construction on the Gareloch (north of the Clyde Estuary) of a Polaris base,
part of which will be a training school for crews; until the school is ready, in
1966, crews will be trained in the United States.
The Buccaneer, Sea Vixen and Scimitar provide the main strike and fighter
strength of the Fleet Air Arm. The United States air-to-surface guided
missile, Bullpup, is fitted to all three aircraft, improving the accuracy of high-
explosive delivery. The Buccaneer II is a long-range low-level strike aircrafl
now in squadron service; ultimately all Scimitar aircraft will be replaced bj
the Buccaneer. The Mark I version of the Sea Vixen fighter carries the air-to-
air missile Firestreak but this is being replaced by a Mark II version, whicl
has an improved weapon system incorporating the new Red Top air-to-aii
missile, giving increased effectiveness against high-flying ana supersonic
targets. The United States Phantom aircraft, powered by Rolls-Royce Spey
engines, will eventually replace the Sea Vixen.
Helicopters are being increasingly employed by the Navy. Reinforcing the
Whirlwind, a more powerful all-weather helicopter, the Wessex 5, is in fron
line service as the Navy’s main anti-submarine aircraft. It carries both homing
torpedoes and dipping sonar (sound navigation and ranging) submarin*
detection equipment. It is in service with carriers and the guided missile
carrying destroyers, and a commando troop-carrying version armed with the
SSII, a French anti-tank guided missile, is serving with the commando ships
The Wasp helicopter forms part of an advanced anti-submarine weapoi
system for the Leander and Tribal classes of frigates. With the latest detectioi
equipment and a new lightweight homing torpedo it greatly increases th|
effectiveness of the Navy’s escort forces against high-speed submarines
United States Sioux helicopters, built under licence in Britain, are beini
used by the Royal Marines.
A new range of weapons, vehicles and other equipment is coming into servio
with the Army. To achieve strategic mobility much of the Army s new equip
ment is, or is planned to be, transportable by air. Many items of equipmenl
such as tanks and self-propelled guns designed for use in BAOR, can b
deployed in war overseas only if they are stockpiled in the area of opefatio
or are transported there by sea. Equipment transportable by air includes, 0
will include, all the infantry battalion weapons, the 105 mm. pack howitzer fo
close artillery support, medium-level surface-to-air guided weapons, armoure
scout and reconnaissance vehicles, and certain engineer equipment includin
bridging.
Increased emphasis is being laid on the provision of suitable equipment t
improve the ability of our forces to undertake counter-insurgency operation
such as that currently taking place in Borneo. A new lightweight rifle will b
issued in quantity to Far East Land Force (FARELF) this year for trials, a
part of a plan to lighten the load of the fighting soldier.

To improve tactical mobility within a theatre of operations, new engineer
equipment for rapid construction and repair work and new bridging equipment
are now coming into service or are planned. The introduction into service in
BAOR of the new tracked armoured personnel carrier and the Stalwart high
mobility load carrier will improve immeasurably the mobility of the battle
group. Increased mobility and firepower for the battle group will also result
from the introduction into service, shortly, of the Chieftain main battle
tank, the Abbot self-propelled close support gun, the 175 mm. (Mi07) self-
propelled heavy gun (of United States origin) and a new Mi09 self-pro¬
pelled medium gun. The Centurion tank has meantime been equipped
with more powerful armament. The fire-power of infantry battalions is being
improved by the introduction into service of the Wombat, Carl Gustav, and
Vigilant anti-tank weapons, the 81 mm. mortar and the general purpose
machine gun, replacing both the Vickers and the Bren. The Swing fire (anti¬
tank guided weapon), mounted on the armoured personnel carrier and Ferret
scout car, is being developed and will be issued to armoured units.
Surface-to-surface guided weapon regiments in service with BAOR are
equipped with the Corporal, and composite regiments with the American
Honest John missiles and the eight-inch howitzer. The medium-level air
defence surface-to-air guided weapon system, Thunderbird I, is in service
and will be replaced by an improved, more mobile version of the same system.
A low-level surface-to-air guided weapon is being developed.
Weapons with longer ranges, greater dispersal of forces on the battlefield,
increased mobility and the heightened tempo of war will necessitate improved
surveillance and reconnaissance by day and night. Improved weapon locators,
tactical radars, airborne devices for use in aircraft and drones and night vision
aids are all coming into service. Automatic data-processing and display
systems are planned to assist in the collation and dissemination of intelligence.
Radio communications are being greatly improved with new equipment.
There is also a requirement to provide surveillance and listening devices
for use in counter-insurgency operations. A number of these devices are
currently on trial in FARELF.
The Sioux helicopter is to be integrated into Royal Armoured Corps,
Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers and infantry units and, together with the
Scout helicopter and the Canadian Beaver fixed-wing light liaison aircraft,
comprise the future group of Army aircraft.
The spearhead of the RAF is the force of Vulcan and Victor four-engined
jet bombers. They can carry the Blue Steel propelled stand-off bomb, which
has a warhead in the megaton range, and they are capable of being refuelled
in flight, giving them an increased range. Victors are also employed as flying
tankers. The V-bombers will thus contribute an effective deterrent force
for some years to come. The present reconnaissance force is composed of
Victors and Canberras.
The tactical strike forces, made up of Canberras and Hunters, can be
brought quickly into action. The Canberra light bomber and reconnaissance
aircraft continues to give good service in Germany and the Near East; it can
carry the French AS30 guided bomb.
Squadrons are being equipped with Bloodhound 2, an advanced air defence
missile which is transportable by air for overseas reinforcement. Manned
fighters continue to be needed to deal with manned aircraft, the stand-off
bomber and radar-jamming aircraft, to prevent reconnaissance and to
investigate unidentified intrusions. Fighter Command is equipped with
124
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Hovercraft
Lightning and Javelin aircraft. Both carry the air-to-air guided missile Fire-
streak. The Lightning, the RAF’s first supersonic fighter, is fitted with an
electronic computer to aid bomber interception; Lightning 3 carries the more
sophisticated Red Top air-to-air missile.
The future replacements of the Hunter will be the Phantom, which has a
high capacity both as a fighter and as a ground strike aircraft, and Kestrel \
(P.1127) vertical take-off and landing aircraft.
Coastal Command’s long-range maritime reconnaissance force, which is j
committed to NATO, is wholly equipped with Shackleton aircraft. An
improved version—the Shackleton Mark 3—is in service, and an adaptation of j
the Comet is being ordered as a replacement.
Transport Command is being re-equipped to provide increased mobility for
the strategic reserves of both land and air forces. A Comet 2 squadron formed
in 1956—the first all-jet transport squadron in any air force—has proved
very successful, and Comet 4Cs are also in service. Two squadrons of Britannia
aircraft are in service for long-range transport and fourteen VC 10 troop
carriers are on order. The Beverley and Llastings freighters and the Armstrong
Whitworth Argosy, a tactical freighter also used for trooping and the dropping
of parachutists, will all be replaced by the United States C.130E. The Belfast
aircraft is now in production as a strategic freighter able to carry large military
loads quickly over long distances. Twin Pioneer short-range aircraft are in
service and the Andover has been ordered as a medium-range tactical transport.
The Basset has been ordered for light communications work.
Increasing use is being made of helicopters for operations in support of the
Army in the field and for the Search and Rescue Organisation of Coastal
Command, which in peace time also operates for the rescue of civilians
involved in shipping accidents or other difficulties in coastal waters. The
twin-rotor Belvedere and the gas-turbine engined Whirlwind are both in
service and so is the Wessex 2, which has a greatly improved load capacity,
particularly in tropical conditions and at high altitudes.
Basic flying training schools have been equipped with the Jet Provost and
Gnat trainers. The Dominie is replacing the Varsity for advanced navigational
training.
The system of control and reporting, which has been built into a highly
efficient organisation, is closely linked with the radar systems of Continental
allies. A reconstructed radar chain now covers the whole of the United
Kingdom. A new high-performance radar system, which includes computers
and data-handling equipment for the interception of supersonic aircraft, is
being introduced. The Royal Air Force commands and operates the joint
UK-US ballistic missile early warning station at Fylingdales, Yorkshire
(see p. in).
Two Hovercraft are now in operation with a Joint Service Hovercraft Unit.
Evaluation of Hovercraft is carried out by the Inter-Service Hovercraft Trials
Unit at Lee-on-Solent.
HOME DEFENCE
The second world war showed the importance of having trained and organised
bodies of men and women ready to mitigate the effects of enemy air attacks
on the civil population; and the Civil Defence Act 1948 recognised that ^a
permanent system of civil defence was an integral part of the country s
defence plan. At the same time, the main defence objective, made imperative

by the development of nuclear weapons, is not to prepare for war but to
prevent it.
Expenditure and other information on home defence is given annually in
the Statement on the Defence Estimates (see p. 114).
Following a nuclear attack there would be enormous and immediate devasta¬
tion: there would also be millions of survivors in need of help. The civil
defence programme is designed to ensure as many survivors as possible and to
safeguard their well-being by making the best use of essential supplies and
services after an attack.
A national warning and monitoring organisation has been set up to warn the
public of the threat of air attack. The organisation would also provide civil
and military authorities in Britain (and neighbouring NATO countries) with
a scientific appreciation of the path and probable intensity of fall-out. Warning
would be given by siren from 15,000 points throughout the United Kingdom
and by BBC broadcasts.
Information about nuclear bursts and radioactive fall-out would be collected
by the Royal Observer Corps (see p. 119).
A scheme has been drawn up for the voluntary dispersal from the larger towns
of people who would be at a special disadvantage in times of enemy attack—
some 43 per cent of the population of the dispersal areas. These are mainly
children and their mothers, expectant mothers and those disabled, aged and
infirm people who are dependent on others taking part in the dispersal scheme.
It would be impossible to provide protection by shelter within any area of
complete devastation caused by nuclear explosion, and beyond the country’s
resources to provide specially constructed underground shelters all over the
country as a protection against blast, heat and fall-out. Nevertheless, protective
shelter against some of the effects of nuclear explosions could be provided
relatively simply for most households and advice on this is given in civil
defence publications.
Plans have been made for safeguarding essential supplies of food, electricity,
gas and water and for maintaining the functioning of ports, shipping and rail¬
ways. Provision is also being made for stockpiling, storing and distributing
oil and emergency medical supplies. Special attention is being given to
safeguarding telephone communications and broadcasting.
Civil defence planning in Britain is the responsibility of a number of ministers
each of whom undertakes the duties which, in war time, would represent a
natural extension of his peace-time functions. The central Government has
enlisted the assistance of local government authorities, of industry and
commerce and of public bodies of many kinds, including voluntary organisa¬
tions such as the Voluntary Aid Societies and the Women’s Voluntary Service,
for the local execution of the plans.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary co-ordinates the work of
government departments in home defence planning and supervises the civil
defence activities of the police and fire services, the Civil Defence Corps
and the Industrial Civil Defence Service. Other government departments have
direct responsibility for the civil defence applications of the services which
they control; for example, the Ministry of Health is responsible for the hospital
and first-aid services, and the Post Office for telecommunications.
In Scotland the Scottish Home and Health Department deals with questions
corresponding to those dealt with by the Home Office in England and Wales,
126
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and is responsible for such matters as the hospital and first-aid services.
In Northern Ireland the Civil Defence Act (Northern Ireland) 1950
places responsibility for civil defence matters on the Ministry of Home Affairs,
which may arrange for other departments to undertake some functions on
its behalf.
Regional
Organisation
The Civil
Defence
Services
Co-ordination of government activity in war time would be undertaken in
the nine civil defence regions in England by Regional Commissioners, who
would assume full responsibility if control by the central Government were
disrupted. Similar arrangements would apply in Scotland and Wales.
Northern Ireland would be under one central control.
In England and Wales the regions are divided into two or more sub-regions
in each of which the main government departments, the police, fire service
and public utilities would be represented, so that effective government
would continue if communications with the regional headquarters were cut
off. Below sub-regional level, control is based on administrative counties and
county boroughs and within counties, on county districts. In these areas the
warden organisation would operate through sector and wardens’ posts.
Civilian volunteers in Great Britain who undertake regular training provide
in times of peace the following part-time services:
1. The Civil Defence Corps (193,400 members in March 1965), which
helps authorities to carry out their civil defence functions. The Corps is
the nucleus of an organisation which would be greatly expanded in war.
2. The Industrial Civil Defence Service (129,400 members in October
1964), formed in the larger industrial and commercial establishments.
3. The Auxiliary Fire Service (13,400 members in March 1965), which in
war time would reinforce the fire brigades trained by local authorities
in peace time. The Fire Service would become a national organisation
in time of war.
4. The National Hospital Service Reserve (64,500 members in 1965),
limited at present to trained nurses and people willing to be trained as
nursing auxiliaries, reinforces the National Hospital Service in England
and Wales. In Scotland there is also an Ambulance Section of the
Reserve.
In Northern Ireland there are three main services: the Civil Defence
Corps, the Auxiliary Fire and Rescue Service, and the Hospital Service
Reserve.
The Civil Defence Corps is recruited and organised by certain local
authorities (the councils of counties and county boroughs in England and
Wales, or counties and large burghs in Scotland) in local divisions. The
local divisions are subdivided into five sections:
Headquarters:
Wardens:
Rescue:
Ambulance
and First Aid:
control of civil defence operations, communications,
reconnaissance (including scientific matters),
public guidance and control, reporting of damage and
radioactive fall-out, organisation of immediate self-help
measures, and the local control of life-saving operations.

In Scotland there is a First Aid Section; the ambulance services are
organised by the Scottish Ambulance Service.
In Northern Ireland the Civil Defence Corps, which is organised directly
by the Ministry of Home Affairs and not by the local authorities, consists
of three sections—Headquarters, Wardens and Welfare; the Ambulance
Service forms part of the Hospital Service, and the Rescue Section has been
integrated with the Auxiliary Fire Service to form the Auxiliary Fire and
Rescue Service.
Members of the Civil Defence Corps must undertake a standard training
in the section in which they enrol, and have two years in which to complete
this. Those who pass the standard training test may take advanced training
(Class A) and if they undertake to perform a total of 45 hours’ approved duty,
including advanced training, may qualify for a bounty of £10 to £15, according
to rank. Others may perform less onerous training (Class B) or pass to the
Civil Defence Corps Reserve.
Units of the Industrial Civil Defence Service are trained and organised
in much the same way as the Civil Defence Corps and in war would operate
closely with it.
Civil defence instructors are trained either at one of the three Home Office
Civil Defence Schools or locally under arrangements made by local authorities.
Courses and studies for senior officials are held at the Civil Defence Staff
College at Sunningdale, Berkshire, and in Scotland, at the Civil Defence
School at Taymouth Castle, Perthshire.
Auxiliary firemen are trained by officers and men of the regular brigades.
In addition, both regular and auxiliary firemen receive special training in
emergency fire-fighting at the Home Office Fire Service Training Centre at
Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. Auxiliary firemen are encouraged to
gain practical experience of fire-fighting by performing stand-by duty at fire
stations to enable them to respond, with regular members of the brigade, to
calls to fires. Exercises are also held, involving the control and operation of
large numbers of pumping and other fire-fighting appliances. Training regula¬
tions are similar to those for the Civil Defence Corps; auxiliaries are expected
to do 50 hours’ standard training before they go on to advanced training to
qualify for a bounty of ^10 to £15. Those who do not wish to qualify may
pass into the Auxiliary Fire Service Reserve, in which they are required to
attend a minimum of one annual exercise or parade.
In time of war the police would continue to be responsible for the prevention
of crime, for the maintenance of law and order and for the control of essential
service routes. They are also likely to have duties in connection with dispersal,
care of the homeless and other specialised civil defence tasks. In all these
duties they would have the aid of the Special Constabulary.
The Secretary of State for Defence plans the part to be played by the armed
forces in home defence and co-ordinates the plans of the military and civil
authorities. The main ways in which the armed forces can render assistance
are: by helping the civil authorities to maintain control and by giving assistance
to the police and the fire services; helping in the reception and care of the
128

homeless; in the treatment and evacuation of casualties and in the clearance
of radioactive fall-out zones; providing guards, helping to maintain road, rail
and water communications and undertaking light rescue, reconnaissance and
the provision and running of camps.
A number of men of the Royal Air Force have been trained in emergency
fire-fighting operations at Home Office training centres to enable them to
serve as firemen in a National Fire Service, while certain units of the Terri¬
torial Army are trained each year in emergency fire-fighting techniques.

SOCIAL WELFARE
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is now responsible, through either central or local govern¬
ment, for a range of services covering family allowances, social insurance,
help for war victims, financial assistance when required, health and welfare
services for mothers and young children, the sick, mentally disordered,
elderly and handicapped and for families in difficulties of various kinds, and
the care of children lacking a normal home life (all described in this chapter);
and for education (see Chapter 6), housing (see Chapter 7) and employment
services (see Chapter 16). Public authorities in the United Kingdom are
spending about £5,230 million a year on this range of services; that is, over
£97 a year per head of the population.
Voluntary organisations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of
nearly all the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics,
dispensaries, and social and recreational clubs before these were provided by
the State. They made themselves responsible for the welfare of the very
young and the very old, the homeless and the handicapped. Gradually the
State accepted the primary responsibility for the major services, supplementing
the voluntary services and developing a comprehensive structure that ensured
a minimum standard of living and wellbeing for all citizens.
State and voluntary social services are now complementary and co-operative.
The State often works through voluntary agencies specially adapted to serve
particular needs and ensures that necessary standards are maintained. The
officers of central and local government, in carrying out their duties, co-operate
with the workers of many voluntary social service societies, while the resi¬
dential provision made by the State and by local authorities for the care of
the chronic sick and the aged is supplemented by voluntary homes of various
types for the care of the sick and elderly, most of whom receive State pensions
or benefits.
The Charity Commission, a government department, gives free advice to
trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their trusts and purposes
when necessary; it maintains a Central Register of Charities in which in form a -
tion about all the charities in England and Wales is being gathered together;
and it works to promote co-operation between charities and State services.
Voluntary The number of voluntary charitable societies and institutions in Britain
Organisations runs into thousands; they range from national organisations to small individual
local groups. Most organisations, however, are members of larger associations
or are represented on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees.
Some are chiefly concerned with giving personal service, others in the
formation of public opinion and exchange of information.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems and mis¬
fortunes include the voluntary family casework agencies, of which the Family
Welfare Association, working mainly in London, is the best known; marriage
guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage Guidance Council; and
the Family Service Units.
130
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by the British
Red Cross, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the St. Andrew’s Ambulance
Association, but a number of societies exist to help sufferers from particular
disabilities, such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal
National Institute for the Deaf, the National Association for Mental Health,
the constituent members of the Central Council for the Disabled and their
Scottish equivalents.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specifically religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the
Committee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of
England Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work,
the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian
Association, the Society of Friends, the Crusade of Rescue, the Society of
St. Vincent de Paul, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Jewish
Board of Guardians.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s
Voluntary Service, which ‘lends a hand’ in every kind of practical difficulty,
brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and old people, minds
children, and visits the sick in hospital, as well as doing relief work in
emergencies.
A central link between different voluntary organisations and official bodies
concerned with social welfare is provided in England and Wales by the
National Council of Social Service, which brings together most of the principal
voluntary agencies for consultation and joint action, either as a whole or in
groups of those concerned with particular aspects, such as youth work or old
people’s welfare. There are also the Scottish Council of Social Service and the
Northern Ireland Council of Social Service, which perform similar co¬
ordinating functions in the voluntary sphere. It was the National Council
of Social Service which set up the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, of which there
are now about 430 in Great Britain. The primary role of the bureaux is to
give explanation and advice to the citizen who is in doubt about his rights
or who does not know about the State or voluntary service which could help
him.
Social Workers While the voluntary worker giving full-time or part-time service has done
pioneer work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an
essential part, social services of all kinds increasingly depend for their operation
chiefly on the professional social worker, that is, the full-time salaried worker
trained in the principles and technique of social work. Training for many
forms of social work consists of a basic university degree, diploma or certificate
course in social science followed by a university course in applied social
studies or specialised training for a particular service. The latter is sometimes
organised by the profession concerned. Under the Health Visiting and Social
Work (Training) Act 1962 a Council for Training in Social Work was
set up to promote the training, in the first instance, of workers in the local
authority health and welfare services and similar services run by voluntary
bodies. Full-time courses lasting two years, now being provided by eleven
colleges of further education, lead to the Council’s Certificate in Social
Work. More courses are being arranged, including two starting in October
1965 in Scotland.
Voluntary organisations were the pioneers in the employment and training
of social workers, but government departments and local authorities now
employ a considerable number of trained social workers, for example, in
SOCIAL WELFARE

child care, youth work, medical-social work, psychiatric social work, and
the probation service.
In recent years many people from Commonwealth countries in Asia, Africa
and the West Indies have entered Britain to take up employment, some with
their families but many alone, their families coming later. Often they concen¬
trate in large industrial areas where they add to the demand for housing and
increase the pressures on educational facilities and other social services.
In 1965, because the Government was not satisfied with progress in
integrating Commonwealth immigrants into the community, the Prime
Minister appointed one of the Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State in
the Department of Economic Affairs to be personally responsible for co¬
ordinating government action and promoting the efforts of local authorities
and voluntary bodies to deal with the various social and economic problems.
The Commonwealth Immigrants Advisory Council, which was set up in
1962, has published three reports on these problems. On its recommendation
a non-official National Committee was set up in 1964. The Government
intends to replace these two organisations by a new National Committee for
Commonwealth Immigrants which will promote integration efforts on a
national basis.
The Race Relations Bill 1965, of which the main object is the introduction
of legal sanctions against discriminatory behaviour, provides for local con¬
ciliation committees to inquire into complaints of racial discrimination in
places of public resort and a Race Relations Board to look into cases where
conciliation is not achieved. If necessary, the Attorney-General would take
proceedings in the civil courts.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National Insurance, Industrial Injuries Insurance, Family Allowances and
National Assistance together with (in a special category) War Pensions,
constitute a comprehensive system of social security in the United Kingdom
which ensures that in no circumstances need any one fall below a certain
minimum standard of living.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance administers the first
three of these services in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are adminis¬
tered by the Ministry of Health and Social Services. National Assistance
is administered by the National Assistance Board in Great Britain, and in
Northern Ireland by the National Assistance Board for Northern Ireland.
Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners and their dependants are
the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance through¬
out the United Kingdom. Appeals relating to claims for insurance benefits,
family allowances or war pensions, or to applications for assistance, are not
decided by the Ministries or the Boards but by independent authorities
appointed under relevant legislation.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain
can be traced back for several centuries (the Poor Relief Act of 1601 maybe
regarded as specially important in England and Wales), the modern system
of comprehensive provision is a creation of the twentieth century. Non¬
contributory old age pensions were introduced in 1908, and the first con¬
tributory pensions for old people, widows and orphans in 1926. A contributory
National Health Insurance Scheme was begun in 1912, and in the same year
a scheme of unemployment insurance was introduced which in 1920 was
extended to cover the great majority of employees. By the beginning of
132

the second world war social security provision in Britain was among the
best in the world, but lacked co-ordination by the very fact of its piece¬
meal development, and not everyone came within its scope. In the immediate
post-war years a series of Acts introduced the present comprehensive system,
which became fully operative on 5th July, 1948. Adjustments have been
made by a number of subsequent Acts. Statutory provision for the war
disabled goes back to the end of the sixteenth century, but the main lines of
the present war pension provisions were laid down during the first world war.
Family allowances and national insurance benefits or allowances, other than
maternity, unemployment or sickness benefit, are included in the taxable
income on which income tax is assessed. On the other hand, various income
tax reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the
support of dependants. War disablement pensions are not taxable.
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate
as a single system. Reciprocal agreements on industrial injuries, family
allowances and all, or most, national insurance benefits are in operation with
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the German Federal Republic, Guernsey,
Jersey, Norway and Yugoslavia. Agreements with France, Israel, Italy,
Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey cover
industrial injuries and most national insurance benefits. With Australia,
Canada and New Zealand there are agreements on family allowances and some,
or most, national insurance benefits. There is an agreement with Cyprus
on national insurance, and one with the Irish Republic which covers some
national insurance benefits; it also contains some industrial injuries provisions
relating to seafarers. Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, as well as Great
Britain, are party to most of the agreements with other countries.
Family allowances are provided in Great Britain under the Family Allowances
Act 1945, and in Northern Ireland under the Family Allowances Act (Nor¬
thern Ireland) 1945. Nearly 6 million allowances are being paid in Great
Britain to about 3§ million families with two or more children and over a
quarter of a million in Northern Ireland to 118,000 families. An allowance is
paid for each child other than the first child below the age limits. The
age limits are 15 years for children who leave school at that age, 16 years for
certain incapacitated children, and 19 for children who remain at school or are
apprentices. The rate of the allowance is 8s. a week for the second child below
the age limits and 10s. a week for the third and each subsequent child.
Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to
benefit the family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid
either to the mother or to the father. There is no insurance qualification for
title to the allowances, but there are certain residence conditions.
The National Insurance Acts 1946-64 apply, in general, to everyone over
minimum school-leaving age (15 years) living in Great Britain. There are
similar schemes in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.
The National Insurance scheme provides benefits in specified contingencies
to insured persons who have paid the required contributions. The benefits
are paid for partly by insured persons’ contributions, partly by contribu¬
tions of employers in respect of their employees, and partly by a contribution
made by the Exchequer out of general taxation. The rates of contributions
(except for retirement pensions) and benefits are standard amounts varying
SOCIAL WELFARE

only with the sex and insurance class of the insured person (with lower rates
for those under 18). For retirement, graduated contributions and pensions
were introduced in 1961; the scheme applies to all adult employed persons
earning over £9 a week and not ‘contracted out’ of it and provides for them
to earn additions to flat-rate retirement pension (but not to any other benefit)
in return for graduated contributions, related to earnings between £9 and
£18 a week and normally paid in addition to the flat-rate contribution.
Employees whose job provides them with an occupational pension, at least
equivalent to the maximum State graduated pension, may be ‘contracted out’
of the scheme. About 4^ million employees are contracted out in Great
Britain and over 39,000 in Northern Ireland.
Contributors under the National Insurance scheme are divided into three
classes:
Class 1. Employed persons. Those who work for an employer under a
contract of service or are paid apprentices—over 23 million. This class
falls into two groups: those who are, and those who are not, participating
in the graduated part of the scheme.
Class 2. Self-employed persons. Those in business on their own account
and others who are working for gain but do not work under the control
of an employer—nearly ih million.
Class 3. Non-employed persons. All persons insured who are not in class 1
or 2—over a quarter of a million.
This general classification is subject to certain modifications, made by
regulations, to meet special circumstances. Married women engaged only in
their own household duties are, in general, provided for by their husbands’
insurance and need not pay contributions. They can choose to pay contri¬
butions provided they were insured persons when they married. (Those who
were already married when the scheme began to operate on 5th July, 1948,
cannot be insured in their own right unless they were then insured under
the old scheme and continued to pay contributions as non-employed persons,
or unless they have since taken up paid work.) Employed married women
may choose whether to pay separate contributions themselves or to rely on
the cover provided by their husbands’ contributions, which make them
eligible for maternity grant, retirement pension at lower rate, widow’s benefit
and death grant, but they must pay graduated contributions if they are
employed in a participating employment and their earnings are over fq a
week. Students receiving full-time education and unpaid apprentices need
not pay contributions. Up to the age of 18, contributions are credited to them.
Over that age they may, if they wish, pay as non-employed persons (class 3)
and thus safeguard their title to widow’s benefit and to retirement pension
at full rate. Self-employed and non-employed persons whose income is not
more than £260 a year can apply to be excepted from liability to pay con¬
tributions. They too may pay as non-employed persons to safeguard
entitlement to pension.
An insured person ceases to be liable for national insurance contributions
at the age of 70 for men, 65 for women, or when he retires, or is deemed to
have retired, from regular employment after reaching minimum pension
age (65 for men, 60 for women), whichever is the earlier. If such a person
does any work as an employed person thereafter, he must pay an industrial
injuries contribution; the employer still has to pay his full share of the flat-rate
contribution.

Britain: an official handbook
All three classes pay flat-rate contributions. Table 7 shows the main weekly
rates of these contributions (including the National Health Service contribu¬
tion, which for convenience is paid with it though the two services are separately
administered). The table also shows the range of graduated contributions
which are payable by employed persons aged 18 or over (unless they have been
‘contracted out’) who earn more than £9 a week, at the rate of approximately
4J per cent of that part of their weekly pay between £9 and £18. The employer
pays the same amount.
Flat rate contributions are normally paid on a single contribution card by
national insurance stamps bought from a post office. It is the employer’s
responsibility in the first place to see that the class 1 contributions are paid,
but he can deduct the employees’ share from their wages. Graduated contri¬
butions are collected through the same machinery as is used to collect Pay As
You Earn (deduction at source) income tax. The self-employed and non-
employed must stamp their own cards. Contributions are usually credited
for weeks of unemployment, sickness or injury, or if widow’s benefit is being
paid.

The scheme provides payments to contributors in case of unemployment (if
normally working for an employer), sickness (if normally working for an
SOCIAL WELFARE
135
employer or self-employed), and confinement and the weeks immediately
before and after (for women normally working for an employer or self-
employed and paying national insurance contributions at the full rate).
Retirement pensions are paid to people who have reached 65 (60 for women)
and who, if under 70 (65 for women), have retired from regular work; widows
receive benefit in the first 13 weeks after bereavement and subsequently
while they have young children or if they have reached the age of 50 when
widowed or when their children have grown up; and there are two kinds of
allowance in respect of orphan children where a widow’s pension is not
payable. The scheme also provides lump-sum cash grants for two expensive
contingencies—the birth of a child and a death (though not for the death of
someone already over minimum pension age when the scheme started).
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First,
before benefit can be paid at all, a minimum number of contributions must
actually have been paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate
of benefit cannot be paid unless a specified number of contributions have
been paid or credited over a specified period. There are special rules to help
a widow who does not become entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood
or when her children have grown up, to qualify for sickness or unemployment
benefit in the period before she can have established or re-established
herself in insurance through her own contributions; there are also provisions
to help divorced women who were not paying contributions during their
marriage.
The basic standard rate of the majority of benefits is now £4 a week which
may be reduced if insufficient contributions have been paid, but is not
affected by other unearned income or the previous level of earnings. Earnings
made while the benefit is in payment, however, may cause its reduction or
withdrawal: unemployment benefit cannot be paid to a person earning more
than a specified amount from a subsidiary occupation; retirement pensioners
under the age of 70 (65 for women) have their pensions reduced in step with
earnings over certain specified amounts; sickness benefit, though not affected
by continued payment of wages during illness, is not normally payable to a
person doing any actual work. Exceptions to the basic standard rate are the
higher rate of £5 12s. 6d. a week payable to widows during the first 13 weeks
after bereavement, the increased retirement pension earned by someone who
has continued at work and paid contributions beyond minimum pension age,
and the lower rate of £2 15s. a week unemployment or sickness benefit
payable to a married woman who is not either separated from her husband
and receiving maintenance of less than £1 is. 6d. a week from him or else
maintaining an invalid husband. The standard rate of retirement pension for
a woman on her husband’s insurance is £2 10s. a week.
Standard increases are payable for dependants at the rate of ^2 10s. for
an adult (generally a wife), £i 2s. 6d. for the first or only child under the
family allowances age limits and 14s. 6d., over and above any family allowances
payable, for other children. However, the amounts payable to widows for
their children are appreciably larger: £2 for the first child, £1 12s. for the
second child and £1 10s. for each other child, inclusive of any family allowance
payable.
The allowance provided for a child who has lost both parents (one of
whom must have been insured under the National Insurance Acts) is a
guardian’s allowance of £2 a week. It is paid to the person in whose family
a child is, for the time being, included. For certain fatherless children there is
a child’s special allowance also at £2 a week inclusive of family allowances;

this is payable to a woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled
and who has not remarried, if her former husband dies and she has a child
to whose support he was contributing before he died.
Graduated contributions add 6d. a week to retirement pension for each
£7 1 os. of graduated contributions paid by a man, with the matching £7 10s.
paid by his employer, and for each £9 paid by a woman, with the matching
£9 paid by her employer.
The rates of grants are varied: £22 maternity grant is payable for a con¬
finement and a further £22 grant for each additional child born at the same
confinement living 12 hours after its birth; and £25 death grant on the death
of an adult (less for a child, or for an adult who was within 10 years of
minimum pension age when the scheme started).
In general, national insurance payments are paid as long as the situation
requiring them lasts. However, sickness benefit cannot be paid for more than
a year if less than 156 contributions have been paid (possible within three
years for a contributor continuously at work) and unemployment benefit is
payable in the first instance for 30 weeks, after which it may be continued
up to a maximum total of 19 months in all, according to the person’s record of
contributions paid as against unemployment benefit drawn in recent years.
Maternity allowance begins eleven weeks before the expected week of confine¬
ment and ends after the sixth week following the expected week or the actual
confinement if this is later.
Similarly, widowed mothers’ allowances at the full rate cease when the
children reach family allowance age limits, though a mother can continue to
receive £4 a week for herself while she has living with her a son or daughter
above the age limits but under 19. The widow’s pension payable to the
childless widow, provided she is over 50 (and had been married at least
three years when her husband died), and the similar pension normally paid
to the widowed mother who has reached 50 when her widowed mother’s
allowance ends, continues until she has reached minimum pension age and
retired, or at most till age 65. If she has satisfied the conditions she then
becomes entitled to a retirement pension.
The Industrial Injuries Insurance scheme, which, in July 1948, replaced the
Workmen’s Compensation scheme (first introduced by the Workmen’s
Compensation Act of 1897), provides benefits for personal injuries caused
by accidents arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for
prescribed diseases due to the nature of employment. It covers practically
everyone in class 1 of the National Insurance scheme and certain others.
Like the National Insurance scheme, the Industrial Injuries scheme is
financed partly from contributions (see Table 7) an<^ partly from taxation.
The relevant acts are the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts 1946
to 1964. Similar cover against industrial injuries and diseases in Northern
Ireland is provided by the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts
(Northern Ireland) 1946 to 1964.
Injury benefit for an adult is £6 15s. a week plus £2 10s. for an adult
dependant, £1 2s. 6d. for the first or only child under the family allowances
age limits and 14s. 6d. for each other eligible child, in addition to any family
allowance payable. It is paid when the insured person is incapable of work as
a result of an industrial accident or prescribed disease, and payment can
continue for a maximum of 26 weeks beginning on the date of the accident
or development of the disease.

Disablement benefit may be paid (but not at the same time as injury benefit)
when, as the result of industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a
loss of physical or mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the
disablement as assessed by a medical board; it varies from £6 15s. for 100 per
cent disablement to 7s. a week for 20 per cent disablement, but for disable¬
ment of less than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid, ranging up to £450.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement, at the weekly rate of £4; constant
attendance allowance of up to £2 15s. weekly, or at a special rate of £5 10s. a
week in exceptionally severe cases; a special hardship allowance of up to
fiz 14s. for a person who is unfit to return to his regular job or work of an
equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowances which raise the
benefit to that for a 100 per cent assessment during hospital treatment for
the industrial disability. Increases of benefit for dependants are payable with
unemployability supplement and hospital treatment allowance.
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit
may be paid to the dependants.
For a widow a pension of ^5 12s. 6d. a week is payable for the first thirteen
weeks of widowhood. Thereafter, the widow can receive a pension of ^4 10s.
a week if (1) entitled to a child’s allowance or over the age of 40 on ceasing
to be so entitled, or (2) over 50 years of age or permanently incapable of
self-support at the time of her husband’s death, or (3) not entitled to child’s
allowance, but having residing with her a young person under the age of 19
who was or could be treated as being in her late husband’s family, or (4) over
40 years of age when (3) ceases to apply, or (5) pregnant by her late husband.
If none of these conditions is satisfied, the widow may receive a pension of
^1 a week. If she had been living apart from her husband, the pension is
limited to the weekly rate of maintenance he was paying, if less than the rate
otherwise appropriate.
In addition, allowances are paid for children under the family allowances
age limits. For v/idows, these allowances together with any family allowance
payable amount to £1 10s. a week for each child. For other beneficiaries,
the rate is ^1 2s. 6d. for the first child and 14s. 6d. a week for each later child.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be
entitled to pensions (of up to -£1 a week), allowances or gratuities.
Pensions and allowances for people disabled or bereaved through the wars
or subsequent military service are paid under Royal Warrants and other
instruments administered by the Ministry of Pensions and National
Insurance.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private
soldier is /6 15s. a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the
degree of disablement. The latter is assessed by comparing the general
condition of the disabled person as affected by service with that of a normal
healthy person of the same age and sex. Allowances for a wife and children
are paid in addition to the basic pension. There is a wide range of supple¬
mentary allowances, the main ones being for unemployability (£4 7s. 6d. a
week), constant attendance (up to fiz 15s. and, exceptionally, ^5 10s. a week),
comforts (10s. or £1 a week), and lowered standard of occupation (up to
fiz 14s. a week). An age allowance (at rates varying between 5s. and 15s. a
week) is payable to disablement pensioners who are aged 65 or over and whose
assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary allowances are
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
free of income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any
allowance payable under the Family Allowances Acts.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate
of pension for widows of private soldiers is £5 5s. a week, with additional
allowances for their children (£2 4s. for each child), and, in certain cases,
an allowance for rent (up to £2. a week). There is an additional allowance
of 1 os. a week for widows aged 70 or over. Parents or other relatives who were
dependent on a person whose death resulted from military service may
receive pensions if they are in financial need.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance maintains a welfare
service for war pensioners, with a special branch for war orphans, which is
available to help any pensioner who requires advice and assistance. War
pensioners have priority (except over more urgent cases) for treatment of
their war disabilities in National Health Service hospitals.
Many voluntary associations, such as the British Legion and other ex-
Service organisations, give financial aid and personal service to disabled
ex-Service men and women and their families. The Ministry’s welfare officers
work in close co-operation with these voluntary bodies and with the specialist
government welfare agencies.
NATIONAL The National Assistance Act 1948 abolished the existing Poor Law in Great
assistance; Britain and, in place of the various services for the relief of need previously
provided from both central and local government funds, established for the
first time a comprehensive State service of financial assistance according to
need which is administered by the National Assistance Board. The parallel
legislation in Northern Ireland made similar provision.
Application to the Board for financial assistance can be made, with certain
exceptions relating to people in full-time work or involved in a trade dispute,
by anyone over the age of 16 who is in need. The need for assistance is
decided by reference to general standards (which are amended from time to
time) laid down in regulations approved by Parliament. These regulations
contain rules for ascertaining the requirements of the person or family group
for whom assistance is to be provided and rules for the treatment of their
resources, whether of income or capital (for instance, sickness benefit and
family allowances are taken fully into account, while some part of other
specified resources may be disregarded). The regulations make special
provision for higher rates for blind people and certain tuberculous ones, and
also allow the Board’s officer to adjust the amount payable to suit the particular
circumstances of every case. The help given is in this way related directly to
the needs of the individual or family. There is a right of appeal if the person
is dissatisfied with the officer’s decision.
There are few conditions attached to the grant of assistance, but help
given to able-bodied men or women of working age is normally conditional
on their registering for work at an employment exchange of the Ministry of
Labour; the assistance is then paid at the exchange. Otherwise assistance is
normally received as a weekly cash payment at a post office.
WELFARE All local welfare authorities have schemes, made under the National Assistance
SERVICES Act and approved by ministers, under which they provide welfare services for
Services for people who are blind, deaf or dumb, or otherwise severely and permanently
the Blind, the handicapped. These services are provided either by the local authorities
Deaf and the themselves or through the agency of a voluntary body; voluntary bodies also
Disabled gjve important help outside formal agency arrangements. The schemes require
Old People’s
Welfare
SOCIAL WELFARE
local authorities to maintain registers of all the handicapped people in their
areas who seek the help of their services.
Services for the blind and partially sighted include a home visiting and
teaching service, employing qualified home teachers to assist the blind to
adjust themselves to their blindness; instruction in craft work and in the use
of embossed symbols for reading and writing; social clubs, holiday and
other recreational facilities; the supply or loan of apparatus, such as wireless
sets, embossed and recorded books, adapted tools and games; and residential
social rehabilitation. Other benefits available include financial aid, preventive
and medical treatment, special education, training for employment and
placement in suitable occupations. Voluntary organisations for blind welfare
include local blind societies and also national bodies.
The emphasis in services for the deaf, including the hard-of-hearing, is on
achieving communication and promoting social welfare, help with personal
problems, assistance in obtaining and keeping employment, encouragement
and help to improve lip-reading and speech; and generally on relieving the
isolation which deafness can bring. Local voluntary associations play a large
part in providing welfare services for the deaf.
The welfare services for people with handicaps other than blindness or
deafness are run on similar lines and include, in particular: help with personal
and family problems arising from disability; assistance in overcoming the
effect of disability, including adaptations in the home and the provision of
aids to meet individual needs; teaching of handicrafts and help in disposing
of any saleable articles produced; provision of occupation and social centres,
recreational facilities, outings and holidays; and hostels for those for whom
training is being provided by the Ministry of Labour under the Disabled
Persons (Employment) Acts. (Training is provided in Northern Ireland by
the Ministry of Health and Social Services.)
A number of home services for old people are provided by statutory and
voluntary bodies to help them to continue living in their own homes for as long
as possible. Local health authorities supply, under the National Health
Service, home nursing and domestic help (see p. 149); over half the district
nurses’ time is spent on the aged or the chronic sick and the same group
makes the heaviest demands on the home help service.
Local authorities are enabled by the National Assistance Act to provide
meals and recreation for old people either directly or through the agency of
voluntary organisations. They also have power to assist voluntary organisations
by contributing to the cost of the services, giving or lending furniture, vehicles
or equipment, permitting organisations to use premises belonging to the local
authority and making available the services of local authority staff.
Local Old People’s Welfare Committees have been formed and are aided
by the National Old People’s Welfare Council, an associated group of the
National Council of Social Service widely representative of voluntary and
statutory bodies having direct contact with old people, or by the Scottish
Old People’s Welfare Committee, a committee of the Scottish Council of
Social Service, or by the corresponding committee in Northern Ireland.
The National Corporation for the Care of Old People was started by the
trustees of the Nuffield Foundation (see p. 210); its function is to stimulate
and to give financial support to schemes for the welfare of the aged, to
maintain an expert technical advisory service, and to encourage and undertake
research and experiment for the welfare of old people. It is now concentrating
its main effort on home services.

Local

Services
Local authorities provide residential accommodation, under the National
Assistance Act, for the aged, infirm and others, and temporary accommodation
for people who lose their homes, for example, in some disaster such as fire
or floods. The newer homes provided by local authorities for aged and other
infirm people usually have accommodation for 40 to 60 residents. These
smaller homes are gradually replacing the larger institutions inherited from
the past. As well as over 1,800 local authority homes in Great Britain, there
are over 2,500 homes for old and disabled people run by voluntary bodies or
by private individuals.
The National Assistance Board, which is responsible for influencing
‘persons without a settled way of living’ to lead a more normal life, provides
temporary accommodation for them in reception centres, sometimes through
the agency of local authorities. For men who have been unemployed for
long periods and who are in receipt of national assistance grants or are using
reception centres, it runs two non-residential and two residential re-establish-
ment centres where they are given help to fit them again for work.
In Northern Ireland the services provided under the Welfare Services Acts
(Northern Ireland) 1949 to 1961 are broadly similar in scope to those
provided in Great Britain under the National Assistance Act, the only notable
exception being the inclusion in the welfare code of domestic help services,
which in Great Britain are provided under the National Health Service Act.
Local welfare services are provided by the six county and two county borough
councils. Welfare authorities have provided 36 homes for the aged and infirm,
which have completely replaced the old ‘workhouse institutions, and other
specially designed homes are under construction. The cost of the services is
shared, as in Great Britain, between local taxation and the Exchequer.
Local authorities in Great Britain have a duty under the Children and
Young Persons Act 1963 to make available such ad\ice, guidance and
assistance as may promote the welfare of children by diminishing the need
to receive or keep them in the authority’s care or to bring them before a
juvenile court. This help may include assistance in kind or, exceptionally,
financial help, and may be given through a voluntary organisation or directly.
However, if a child seems to be in need of care, protection or control because
of adverse circumstances in which it is not receiving the standard of care to
be expected from a good parent or because it is beyond the control of parent
or guardian, the local authority may initiate court proceedings and the child
may be committed by the juvenile court to the care of a fit person , usually
the local authority, till he or she reaches the age of 18. Local authorities have
a further duty, under the Children Act I94^> receive into their care an}
child under the age of 17 who has no parent or guardian, or who has been
abandoned or whose parents are unable to provide for him temporarily or
permanently. A child so received remains in the care of the local authorit\
until he is 18 years old unless the authority finds it to his advantage to return
him sooner to his parents or guardian or to entrust him to iriends. Both
categories of children are to be treated so as to further their best interests and
afford them opportunity for the proper development of their character and
interests.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents,
who receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home
cannot be found for a child, or he is not suitable for boarding out, he ma}
be placed in a children’s home provided by a local authority or a voluntary
SOCIAL WELFARE
I4I
organisation. Many children’s homes are now provided in small houses, on
housing estates or in ordinary streets, where a group of twelve or fewer
children live in the care of a housemother or houseparents, the husband
following his normal employment. Other children may be placed in hostels
or lodgings or in other accommodation specially suited to their needs. The
desirability of returning a child to his family circle as soon as possible is
fully appreciated, and work is carried out to rehabilitate the family where
this is necessary.
To carry out its functions under the Children Act 1948 each local authority
(county, county borough and London borough council or, in Scotland, council
of a large burgh) is required to appoint a children’s committee and a children’s
officer to be responsible for the care and upbringing of children in the
authority’s care. Children’s officers are assisted by a stalf of child-care officers
who undertake inquiries and who supervise children placed in foster homes.
Regulations for England and Wales safeguarding the boarding out of children
by local authorities and voluntary organisations and the conduct of children’s
homes have been made by the Home Secretary, and, for Scotland, by the
Secretary of State for Scotland. The cost of the local authorities’ child-care
service, including the provision of training for houseparents and child-care
officers, is shared between the local authorities and the Exchequer.
In Northern Ireland the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern
Ireland) 195° gave to the welfare authorities of each county and county
borough (under the general direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs) the
duty of caring for homeless and neglected children. Legislation relating to
children and arrangements for their care follow the same general principles
as in Great Britain.
War orphans are the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and
National Insurance (see p. 137).
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, con¬
tinue to play a valuable part in this work. The larger societies, such as
Dr. Barnardo s, the Church of England Children’s Society and the Catholic
Child Welfare Council, are constituent societies of the National Council of
Associated Children’s Homes, to which a large number of smaller voluntary
homes are also affiliated. In Scotland a valuable contribution is also made by
the Children’s Homes and Hostels under the auspices of the Church of
Scotland Committee on Social Service, and by other voluntary organisations.
Children’s homes provided by voluntary organisations (of which there are
about 650 in Britain) are required to be registered under the Children Act
(in Northern Ireland under the Children and Young Persons Act). The
boarding out of children and all children’s homes, whether local authority
or voluntary homes, are subject to inspection by the Child Care Inspectorate
of the Home Office, of the Scottish Office or of the Northern Ireland Ministry
of Home Affairs.
Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own homes
include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units, which
undertake prolonged and intensive casework with families. The old-established
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its Scottish
counterpart between them maintain inspectors and visitors throughout the
United Kingdom for the investigation of cases of reported cruelty to, or neglect
of, children in their own homes; when necessary, they resort to law after
consultation with the local authority, but they prefer to achieve their purpose
by warning and advice.

Provision for legal adoption was first made in England and Wales in 1926,
in Northern Ireland in 1929 and in Scotland in 1930. About 18,500 adoption
orders are made annually by the courts in Great Britain and some 300 in
Northern Ireland; there are always more would-be adopters than children
available for adoption. Adoption is now regulated by the Adoption Act 1958
in Great Britain and by the Adoption of Children Act (Northern Ireland)
1950 in Northern Ireland. The Registrars General keep registers of adopted
children; adoption societies (there are over 80 societies which arrange
adoptions) must be registered with the local authority (in Northern Ireland
with the Ministry of Home Affairs).
HEALTH
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of
the years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second
half of the nineteenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental
or public health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal
of refuse and cleaning of streets, and the first half of the twentieth century
for the development of publicly provided personal health services, as distinct
from environmental services, culminating in the introduction in 194^ a
comprehensive National Health Service available to every citizen, scientific
discoveries of importance to medicine and health, including the development
of new drugs, and the improved services of the last fifty years, particularly
in maternity and child welfare, school health services and school meals, are
reflected in declining mortality rates (see p. 9) and improved physique.
Diseases now in the forefront of research programmes include cancer and
diseases of the central nervous system, such as muscular dystrophy. Efforts
are also being made to combat some of the most prevalent diseases which
include, besides the common cold and influenza, heart diseases, rheumatism
and bronchitis.
The Public Health Act of 1936 brought up to date and consolidated preceding
Acts; it constitutes the present basic public health code in England and
Wales. Local authorities are mainly responsible for its implementation and
they have extensive powers for the making and administration of by-laws
relating to matters of public health. T he local authorities chiefly concerned
are the councils of county and non-county boroughs, London boroughs and
the City of London, urban and rural district councils and, to a limited extent,
parish councils.
Public health services in Scotland and in Northern Ireland have developed
on much the same lines as in England and Wales, although they are based on
separate Acts and there is a different allocation of services between the various
types of local authority. The Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897 and the
Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892 constitute the basic legislation for
Scotland. The local authorities concerned are the councils of counties and
burghs. In Northern Ireland the councils of county and non-county boroughs
and urban and rural districts are mainly responsible for administering the
Public Health Acts (Northern Ireland) 1878-1962.
Local authorities are responsible for the investigation by their Medical
Officers of Health of outbreaks of infectious diseases and for disinfection and
other measures advised by them for preventing the spread of infectious
diseases in the area. They are also responsible to the Ministry of Health (or
Pure Food

the Welsh Board of Health or the Secretary of State for Scotland or the
Ministry of Health and Social Services for Northern Ireland) for recording
notifications of the prescribed infectious diseases.
Port health authorities have a general responsibility for supervising the
operation of health control at seaports and airports, the primary object of
which is to prevent the introduction of infectious disease into the country.
This health control is undertaken by health authorities using the services of
medical officers, public health inspectors, rodent inspectors and others.
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by legislation
consolidated for England and Wales in the Food and Drugs Act 1955, for
Scotland in the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act 1956, and for Northern
Ireland in the Food and Drugs Act (Northern Ireland) 1958. In England
and Wales the Act and regulations made under it are, in general, carried out
and enforced by food and drugs authorities (county, county borough, London
borough and City of London councils and, generally, the larger borough and
urban district councils) in relation to composition, adulteration and descrip¬
tion, and by local authorities (county borough, London borough, City of
London, borough, urban district and rural district councils) in relation
to soundness, purity and hygiene; the Ministry of Health and the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are the central departments responsible
for advising and for making regulations under the Act. Places where food for
sale for human consumption is prepared, sold or stored must conform to
certain hygienic standards. Authorised officers of the councils concerned may
take for analysis or for bacteriological or other examination samples of any
food for sale for human consumption. Special regulations are in force for
certain foods such as milk, meat and ice-cream.
In Scotland the local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of
counties and large burghs; the central department is the Scottish Home and
Health Department.
In Northern Ireland administration is in the hands of the county and
county borough health authorities, the central department being the Ministry
of Health and Social Services.
Local authorities are also responsible for the public health aspects of water
supply, sewerage and drainage; street paving and housing; and the abatement
of noise nuisance. They have power to establish smoke-controlled areas to
secure cleaner air.
The Acts setting up the National Health Service—the National Health
Service Act 1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947, and the
Health Services Act (Northern Ireland) 1948—came into force simultaneously
on 5th July, 1948.
The object of the National Health Service Act 1946 is ‘to promote the
establishment in England and Wales of a comprehensive health service
designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of the
people of England and Wales and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment
of illness, and for that purpose to provide or secure the effective provision
of services’. The service was originally free to users but certain small charges
were introduced under subsequent legislation. The present Government has
announced its intention of abolishing all charges. The service is available to
all according to medical need without regard to any insurance qualification.
National insurance contributors are required to pay a separate weekly national

health contribution under the National Health Service Contribution Acts
1957 to 1961 (see Table 7) but contributors and non-contributors are entitled
to the same full range of services. Visitors from other countries who come to
Britain for treatment are expected to pay for it, but treatment can be given
under the emergency provisions of the National Health Service to any who
have the misfortune to fall ill during a visit to Britain.
ORGANISATION OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH
SERVICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES*
"The services in Scotland and Northern Ireland are somewhat differently organised. In Scotland the responsible Minister is the
Secretary of State for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland the Minister of Health and Social Services
In England and Wales the Minister of Health has direct responsibility for
the provision on a national basis of all hospital and specialist services, including
those for mental disorder. He has power to conduct, or assist others to conduct,
research into the causes, prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness or
mental disorder, and he provides a public health laboratory service and a
blood transfusion service. He has indirect responsibility for the general
practitioner services and local health authority services. He is advised by the
Central Health Services Council and by standing advisory committees on
various aspects of the service.
The hospital and specialist services are administered through regional
hospital boards and hospital management committees and, in the case of
teaching hospitals, by boards of governors. The hospitals are administered
in groups, of which there are about 350 under the control of hospital manage¬
ment committees, which are in turn under the control of 15 regional hospital
boards. The regions are arranged so that the hospital and specialist services
can conveniently be associated with a university school of medicine.
The members of a hospital management committee are appointed by the
appropriate regional hospital board. The committees, by their constitution,
reflect the communities concerned, for they usually include not only medical
practitioners but members of local authorities, trade unionists and others.
SOCIAL WELFARE 145
The regional hospital boards are appointed by the Minister of Health and
are similarly constituted. The boards of governors of teaching hospitals are
appointed by the Minister, a proportion of the members being nominated
by the teaching faculty of the university, the regional hospital board and the
medical and dental teaching staff. All appointments to hospital management
committees, regional hospital boards and boards of governors are honorary.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the Minister; but
it is his responsibility to provide clinical facilities for the training of medical
students. The universities are responsible for the provision of teaching.
The general medical, dental, pharmaceutical and supplementary ophthalmic
services are administered by 134 executive councils, most of which cover
the area of a county or county borough; in some cases two areas are combined
under one council. Doctors, dentists and pharmacists are represented on the
executive councils and each profession also forms a local committee. Each
council has an ophthalmic services committee responsible for administering
the supplementary ophthalmic service. Councils of counties, county boroughs,
the London boroughs and the City of London are the 174 local health
authorities in charge of local health services.
In Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland is the responsible minister;
31 county councils and 24 town councils of large burghs are the local health
authorities; hospital and specialist services are administered by five regional
hospital boards appointed by the Secretary of State, assisted by 79 boards
of management (the equivalent of hospital management committees in
England); and there are 25 executive councils, each serving the area of one
or more local health authorities. The teaching hospitals in Scotland come
under the control of the regional hospital boards, but special medical education
commit ;ees consider matters relating to medical teaching. The Scottish
Health Services Council and the standing advisory committees advise the
Secretary of State and keep closely in touch with the Central Health Services
Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Services are described separately on page 152.
Health Service
Finance
Annual expenditure on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom
amounts to nearly 5 per cent of the total national income. The greater
part of the cost falls on the Exchequer, to be met from general taxation, and
a small part is met from local rates. Other income is derived from the national
health service contribution paid with the national insurance contribution.
There are charges for treatment in the dental service (but not for examina¬
tion only or for treatment given to people under 21 years or to nursing or
expectant mothers), for dentures (except for children under 16 or still at
school, and expectant and nursing mothers) and spectacles (except children’s
spectacles in standard frames), and for some local health authority services.
Certain exemptions or refunds are made and anyone may apply to the National
Assistance Board for help in meeting any of these charges. Under the 1946
Act, a limited number of beds may be made available for hospital patients
wishing for privacy, provided that this accommodation is not needed on
medical grounds for non-paying patients. Charges for these ‘amenity’ beds
are fixed by statutory regulations. Provision is also made at certain hospitals
for patients who wish to occupy private patients’ accommodation on payment
of the whole cost of this accommodation and treatment. Such patients may
make private arrangements for treatment by doctors of their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-
time medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept
146
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
private patients. General medical practitioners in public service are re¬
munerated mainly by capitation fees according to the number of people on
their lists. (This system is, however, under review.)
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions
they dispense. Doctors and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the supple¬
mentary ophthalmic service are paid prescribed fees for each sight test made;
opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number and type
of pairs supplied.
Practitioner
Services
Hospital and
Specialist
Services
Hospitals
The general practitioner services cover the medical attention given to
individuals by doctors and dentists of their own choice, from among those
enrolled in the service. Doctors and dentists normally work at their own
surgeries; in a few places they practise in health centres established under
the National Health Service Acts. About 23,000, or almost all, general
medical practitioners (principals and assistants) in Great Britain take some
part in the service.
Doctors previously in practice were entitled to join the service at its start
in the place where they were practising. Those now wishing to enter practice
have to apply through their executive councils to the central Medical
Practices Committee, so that a better distribution of doctors throughout the
country may be facilitated. The maximum number of patients’ names per¬
mitted to be on a family doctor’s list is normally 3,500; the average number
in England and Wales is about 2,300. It is normally through the patient’s
own doctor that access to most other parts of the health service is obtained.
There are over 10,400 dentists in England and Wales and over 1,000 in
Scotland in the general dental service.
Over 850 ophthalmic medical practitioners and nearly 7,000 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians in England and Wales, and over 70 ophthalmic
medical practitioners and 700 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in
Scotland, are engaged in the supplementary ophthalmic service. These services
provide for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Cases requiring
treatment are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
Nearly all retail pharmacists (numbering some 16,500 in Great Britain)
take part in the National Health Service. They are responsible for the dispens¬
ing of all prescriptions except for the small number dispensed by certain
general practitioners.
The hospital and specialist services provide hospital accommodation of all
kinds, including district general hospitals with treatment and diagnostic
facilities both for in-patients and out-patients, hospital maternity departments,
infectious disease units, psychiatric hospitals and units, convalescent homes,
and rehabilitation centres; all forms of specialised treatment; and the services
of specialist and other staff required for the hospitals.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service in Great
Britain were built in the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much
earlier charitable foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’s and St.
Bartholomew’s Hospitals in London. Much has been done in recent years to
improve and extend existing hospitals and a start has been made on the building
of new hospitals. In 1962 ten-year plans for hospital development were
published by the Government, setting out the probable future pattern of the
hospital services. The plans are kept under review and revisions are published

from time to time. Revisions published in 1964 assumed that £750 million
might be spent in England and Wales and £105 million in Scotland on
hospital building in the ten years to 1973-74. Further revisions are likely to
be published in 1966, covering the ten years to 1975-76.
Over 2,500 of the existing hospitals in the National Health Service are
in England and Wales, including the 26 teaching hospitals in London (actually
groups of hospitals comprising about 100 hospitals, convalescent homes,
branches, annexes, or treatment centres) and the 10 teaching hospitals
elsewhere in England and Wales (comprising some 70 hospitals and other
establishments). They have nearly 464,000 beds available for use and a nursing
and midwifery staff of 173,000 full-time and about 61,000 part-time nurses
and midwives. There are 375 hospitals in Scotland with over 25,000 full-time
and over 8,000 part-time nurses and midwives.
A small number of hospitals remain outside the service for special reasons.
Most of these are run by religious orders. Some, such as the Italian and
French Hospitals, serve a special group of patients; others are maintained
for the chronic sick or for convalescents by charitable organisations. There
are also private nursing homes, which must be registered.
Rehabilitation is an important aspect of medical care and today hospital
treatment is not limited to the relief of pain or cure of pathological conditions
but aims at helping people to resume normal living as soon as possible.
Specialised rehabilitation facilities are provided at the main hospitals and in
a few special centres. The work is carried out under the guidance of the
appropriate medical specialist by physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts,
occupational therapists and social workers, working as a team. Experience
has shown that efficient medical rehabilitation reduces the stay in hospital,
the incidence of permanent disability and the period of incapacity for full
work. The hospital departments work in close association with the Disablement
Resettlement Service of the Ministry of Labour. Rehabilitation methods have
been applied with advantage in the care of the chronic sick, the mentally
disabled, the aged and the handicapped and have enabled many patients to
become self-sufficient or to be discharged from hospital and to resume an
independent life in their own homes.
Most hospitals have social work departments staffed by workers trained to
apply the principles of social casework to the problems of the hospital patient.
Medical and psychiatric social workers co-operate with clinical and other
staff in the patient’s treatment by making social investigations as an aid to
diagnosis, taking social action to alleviate problems and anxieties surrounding
admission to hospital, and arranging when necessary after-care which will
ensure that the patient is helped to readjust to life, whatever his continuing
disability.
The National Blood Transfusion Service in England and Wales is adminis¬
tered by the regional hospital boards under the National Health Service.
Donors give their blood voluntarily without payment. In 1963 there were, for
the first time, a million individual active donors in England and Wales. The
blood is kept in the regional blood bank, or issued to area blood banks
maintained at general hospitals in each region. Each regional transfusion
centre acts as a reference centre for all transfusion problems arising in the
region. There are two central laboratories administered by the Medical
Research Council on behalf of the Ministry of Health: the Blood Group
Reference Laboratory, which prepares grouping serum and investigates blood
grouping problems referred to it, and the Blood Products Laboratory, which
148 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
prepares dried plasma and plasma fractions. In Scotland the Blood Trans¬
fusion Service is under the direction of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion
Association, which is an independent voluntary body but is supported in the
main by a grant from the Scottish Home and Health Department. In Northern
Ireland the Blood Transfusion Service is operated by the Northern Ireland
Hospitals Authority.
Chest Radiological
Service
Bacteriological and
Virological
Laboratory Services
A Chest Radiological Service, which is freely available, is provided by mass
radiography units, chest clinics and the radiological departments of general
hospitals. The mass radiography units alone X-ray about 3^ million people
each year, concentrating increasingly on specially susceptible groups in the
population.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection
of Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms.
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, where there is no separate public
health laboratory service, bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital
laboratories.
Drug Safety
Since 1964 the Committee on Safety of Drugs, set up by the health ministers,
has been responsible for considering reports of toxicity testing and clinical
trials of new drugs and for studying reports of adverse reactions to drugs in
use. Members of the manufacturers’ organisations have undertaken not to start
clinical trials or to market a new drug without or against the advice of the
Committee.
Mental Health Treatment for mental disorder is provided as part of the National Health
Services Service. Patients can consult the family doctor and receive specialist advice
at hospital out-patient clinics as they would for any other kind of illness and
can enter hospital for in-patient treatment without formalities.
Under the Mental Health Act 1959, and in Scotland the Mental Health
(Scotland) Act i960, mentally disordered patients can, where necessary in
the interests of their health or safety or for the protection of other people,
be compelled to enter hospital for treatment. There are procedural safeguards
to protect patients from unnecessary detention in hospital and in England
and Wales patients may apply to a Mental Health Review Tribunal for
discharge; in Scotland they may apply to the sheriff.
Local health authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping the
mentally disordered in the community, for their care and after-care. Recent
developments in treatment of mental illness, enabling patients to be discharged
from hospital more quickly provided support is available in the community,
are adding to the demands for these services. Arrangements may include
facilities for training or occupation, and residential accommodation. If
necessary, the local health authority can place a mentally disordered person
under guardianship within the community. In Scotland education authorities
share the responsibility for providing training or occupation.
Welfare Foods Under the welfare foods service expectant and nursing mothers, children
Service under five and certain handicapped children can obtain a pint of milk a day
at a reduced price from their usual milk supplier by means of tokens supplied

by the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. Other welfare foods are
distributed by local health authorities. These foods are dried milk, as an
alternative to liquid milk and at an equivalent price; orange juice, cod liver oil
and vitamen A and D tablets at cost price. Families who cannot afford to pay
for any welfare food can apply to the National Assistance Board for special
tokens to enable them to obtain supplies free of charge.
The Local Health Services administered by the county, county borough,
London borough and City of London councils (county and large burgh
councils in Scotland) consist of the maternity and child welfare services
(including welfare centres, maternity care, dental care and day nurseries),
the services for the prevention of illness, for care and after-care, including
vaccination and immunisation, health visiting, home nursing and domestic
help, and care in some cases of mental disorder, the ambulance services in
England and Wales (for Scotland and Northern Ireland see p. 150) and the
provision, equipment and maintenance of local health centres. The develop¬
ment of the health and welfare service of local authorities in England and
Wales over the decade 1964-74 is following the plans published in Health
and Welfare {The Development of Community Care), HMSO, 1964. In Scotland
fundamental studies of services are being carried out as a guide to authorities
in their plans for expansion.
Maternity and child welfare centres are part of the advisory and preventive
services of the local health authority; they offer regular supervision by doctors
and nurses to expectant and nursing mothers and young children. Special
sessions are held for vaccination and inoculation and for early testing of
babies for deafness and other defects, and a feature of the service is the
education of mothers by means of talks, discussion groups, demonstrations and
classes. About 73 per cent of all babies born in 1963 were taken to the centres.
The expectant mother may arrange to have her baby at home or in hospital
according to the advice given by the doctor or midwife, or according to her
own preference if sufficient hospital beds are available over and above those
required for priority cases, that is, those for whom domiciliary confinement
is inadvisable for medical or obstetric reasons or because of adverse home
conditions. The proportion of confinements taking place in hospital varies
considerably between different areas; the national average has increased over
the past 25 years and is now 68 per cent for England and Wales and 82 per
cent for Scotland.
For a home confinement a mother may have the services of either a general
practitioner obstetrician or her own family doctor, if he is willing to undertake
her maternity care, besides those of a trained midwife in the domiciliary
service of the local health authority. The doctor carries out ante-natal and
post-natal examinations, attends at the confinement and gives any other
medical care required. The services of a consultant obstetrician are also
available if the doctor wishes to ask for his advice. Routine supervision and
advice is given by the midwife, who visits regularly before the confinement to
examine the mother and give her advice and help generally. In addition, the
expectant mother may attend the ante-natal clinic for instruction in preparation
for motherhood and in some cases for interim ante-natal supervision.
Frequently it is the midwife who undertakes the actual delivery. Both she and
the doctor attend during the ten days after confinement. Midwives work in
close touch with the welfare centres in the care of the mother both before
and after the birth of the child.

Other Maternity
and Child Welfare
Services
Health Visiting
Many local health authorities make special arrangements for premature
babies remaining in their own homes, by lending equipment and appointing
experienced nursing staff to supervise their care.
There are about 500 day nurseries for children under five in Great Britain
provided by local health authorities or voluntary associations working with
them. The National Health Service Act 1952 gave local authorities power
to make charges for the use of day nurseries. Private or factory nurseries (of
which there are about 1,300 in Great Britain) must be registered with the
local health authorities; this regulation applies also to persons paid for
looking after more than two children who are not all of the same family.
Most local authorities contribute to the cost of the work done by voluntary
denominational and other bodies which care for unmarried mothers and
their babies; a few authorities make direct provision for their special needs
through their health departments. The voluntary associations employ specially
trained workers to help the unmarried mother in making plans for herself
and her child. Most homes and hostels for the ante-natal and post-natal care
(and, in some cases, the confinement) of these mothers are provided by such
organisations.
Health visitors (see p. 153) are employed by local health authorities to visit
people in their own homes to give advice on the care of young children,
expectant and nursing mothers, people of all ages (with increasing attention
to the elderly) suffering from illness, including mental illness, and any injury
or disability requiring medical or dental treatment, and on measures necessary
to prevent the spread of infection. Their duties include health education and
attendance at ante-natal and child welfare clinics. They may also undertake
tuberculosis visiting and school nursing.
Home Nursing
Domestic Help
Ambulance Services
The employment of nurses to attend patients who require nursing in their
own homes is the responsibility of the local health authorities. Most authorities
employ nurses directly for this purpose, although some have arranged for
voluntary district nursing associations to provide a service on their behalf.
Local health authorities (welfare authorities in Northern Ireland) have the
power to make arrangements for domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’)
in households where it is needed owing to illness, confinement, or the
presence of children or old people. This service is mainly used in the care
of old or chronically sick people, in maternity cases and, to a lesser extent
but increasingly, for families where such help is needed to prevent children
having to be cared for away from home, for example, during the absence
of the mother. The authorities may recover from those assisted such charges
as it is considered they can afford to pay, but the service may be provided
without charge to people with very small incomes.
Free conveyance by ambulance in England and Wales between home and
hospital or clinic is provided, where needed, by local authorities^ either
directly or by arrangement with voluntary organisations. The Hospital Car
Service (organised by the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross
Society, and the Women’s Voluntary Service) augments the ambulance
service in many areas for the conveyance of sitting patients. In Scotland
ambulances are run by the Scottish Ambulance Service (St. Andrew s
Ambulance Association and the Scottish branch of the British Red Cross
Society) on behalf of the Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland they are
run by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.

Problems of the
National Health
Service
Local health authorities are responsible for prevention, care and after-care
arrangements for mental disorder, which is becoming an increasingly important
task (see p. 148), and for tuberculosis. They are responsible for BCG
vaccination and other preventive measures against tuberculosis and also for
rehabilitation. Diagnosis and treatment, however, are the responsibility of the
hospital service and are provided through hospitals and chest clinics, in which
the work is closely co-ordinated with that of local authorities.
Care and after-care arrangements are made to varying extents for other
types of illness; in particular there are certain services for people being
nursed at home, such as the loan of special equipment or the laundering of
bed linen. A chiropody service is provided in nearly all areas. A charge may
be made for some of these services if the person wishing to make use of them
can reasonably be expected to contribute towards their cost.
As part of their preventive work, local health authorities may give help
and advice to families, particularly those in difficulties and in danger of
breaking up, where there is a danger to the physical or mental health of the
children. Medical and psychiatric social workers are to an increasing extent
employed in the health and welfare services of local authorities, where their
training enables them to help people living in their own homes who are
handicapped by mental or physical disability or illness.
Local health authorities may make arrangements with statutory water
undertakings for fluoride to be added to water supplies to help in preventing
dental decay.
Since the publication in 1962 of the report of the Royal College of
Physicians on smoking and health, emphasis in health education programmes
has been placed on the dangers of smoking.
All local health authorities have arrangements for vaccination, without charge
and as part of the National Health Service, against diphtheria, poliomyelitis,
smallpox, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough.
Vaccination against poliomyelitis by local health authorities is normally
restricted to people under 40 years of age (apart from people liable to special
risk who are eligible for vaccination at any age); those over 40 may be vac¬
cinated, free of charge under the National Health Service, by their general
practitioner. BCG vaccination against tuberculosis by local health authorities
is available to children of ten years and upwards and to others particularly
exposed to risk of tuberculous infection.
Twenty-one health centres which provide primarily for the association of
general medical practice with maternity and child welfare services and the
school health service have been set up by local health authorities in England
and Wales. This is one form of co-operation between the different elements
in the health service. Other forms of co-operation are growing, such as the
siting of group practices adjacent to local health authority clinics, the atten¬
dance of midwives for ante-natal sessions at general practitioners’ surgeries
and the attachment of health visitors to particular practices for the whole or
part of their time. The provision of the three health centres and a diagnostic
centre in Scotland is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland
and not of local health authorities.
The National Health Service is not without its difficulties and shortcomings.
The total cost of the Service has continued to rise, because of such factors as
increases in prices and in staff salaries, the high cost of many new drugs and
of modern equipment, the increased use made by the public of the services

provided, and extensions and improvements of the Service. Despite a high
rate of capital expenditure on hospital buildings and equipment, more is
required to improve the general standard. More doctors, dentists, midwives
and nurses are needed by an expanding service. There is also some disparity j
between different parts of the country; some areas have more family doctors |
than others, more hospital beds for confinements of mothers who would
prefer to have their babies in hospital though they do not need specialist
medical care, and more extensive local authority services.
Against these shortcomings may be set the steady improvement in the
country’s vital statistics to which the National Health Service has largely
contributed, the decrease in ill health from neglected ailments, and the
removal of anxiety about the cost of treatment, from which many of those
who now use the Service previously suffered.
HEALTH
SERVICES IN
NORTHERN
IRELAND
The health sendees established under the Health Services Act (Northern
Ireland) 1948 correspond fairly closely to the medical care system established
under the National Health Service in Great Britain and they are financed
in the same way as in the rest of the United Kingdom.
The hospital and specialist services are administered by the Northern
Ireland Hospitals Authority (which corresponds approximately to a regional
hospital board in Great Britain) through hospital management committees.
In hospital administration the role of the central Government is not quite
so immediate and direct as in Great Britain1: hospital property, for example, j
is vested not in the Minister of Health and Social Services but in the
Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority, which has under its control 75 hospitals
containing in all about 17,000 beds. The administration of the general
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and supplementary eye services is in the
hands of the Northern Ireland Health Services Board, which takes the place
of the executive councils in Great Britain. Local health services are adminis¬
tered by the six county councils and the two county borough councils in
Northern Ireland. The range of local authority services and the arrangements
made by the Northern Ireland General Health Services Board for the
provision of services, and for the remuneration of the people providing
them, are similar to those already described for the rest of the United
Kingdom.
VOLUNTARY AID
FOR THE
SICK AND
HANDICAPPED
A number of voluntary organisations provide extensive welfare sendees for
sick and handicapped people in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the
provision made by central and local authorities. Many convalescent homes
and homes for the infirm and for people with specific handicaps are, or ere
originally, provided by voluntary effort. In many areas invalid children and
others needing care in their own homes are visited and helped by voluntary
organisations. Though the need for material aid from private sources becomes
less as public provision extends, many forms of help to meet individual
needs that would not otherwise be met are given by voluntary agencies, i
Their most valuable role is probably in providing small personal services
and the continued personal interest that can mean so much to a sick or
handicapped person. These voluntary agencies usually depend largely on the
work of part-time or full-time unpaid volunteers. ... j
A great deal of help is given to hospitals by voluntary bodies and individual
voluntary helpers. The majority of the hospitals in England and W ales hav e

Ireland more closely into line with Great Britain in this respect.

their own Leagues of Friends or similar bodies of voluntary workers who
organise and undertake a variety of services. Many hospitals also have help
from the British Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the
Women’s Voluntary Service, or a similar organisation. The operation of
canteens for out-patients, and trolley-shops and book and picture library
sendees for in-patients, visiting in the wards, receiving new patients, and
mending linen are among the tasks commonly undertaken.
0nly Persons whose names are on the medical register can practise as doctors
under the National Health Service. Apart from registered medical prac¬
titioners, only persons whose names are on the dentists’ register can practise
the full range of dentistry in Britain; dental auxiliaries who have undergone
a two-year training course may do some simple work under supervision. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’
training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year’s experience
as a resident assistant doctor in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years
at a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical profession
is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the dentists is
the General Dental Council, which succeeded the Dental Board in 1956.
The British Medical Association is the main doctors’ professional association;
that of the dentists is the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration
as a general trained nurse is three years. Training is available also in sick
children s, mental, and mental subnormality nursing. An enrolled nurse takes
a two-year course. The examining body of the nursing profession is the
General Nursing Council. Midwives must have the certificate of the Central
Midwives Board. Most pupil midwives are already state registered general
nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the two-year midwifery training
period is reduced to one year and, for state enrolled nurses, to 18 monthst
The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives are the
professional bodies for nurses and midwives. Health visitors are state registered
general or sick children’s nurses who have undergone at least the first part
of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing before taking a year’s course in
health visiting, promoted by the Council for the Training of Health Visitors.
In order to describe himself as a pharmacist, a pharmaceutical chemist
must have his name entered in the register maintained by the Pharmaceutical
Society of Great Britain, the governing body of the profession. Qualifications
requirmg four or five years’ academic study and practical training are
necessary for registration. Dispensing of medicines on National Health
Service prescriptions and the sale of certain specified medicines can be
carried out only by, or under the supervision of, a registered pharmaceutical
chemist. Under the Opticians Act, 1958, a General Optical Council regulates
the. professions of ophthalmic optician and dispensing optician; onlv
registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered medical practitioners) m’ay test
sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes three years followed by a year
under supervision. ‘ :
State registers have recently been established for chiropodists, dieticians,
medical laboratory technicians, occupational therapists, physiotherapists
radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are seven boards’
(called, for example, the Chiropodists Board or the Dieticians Board) under
the general supervision of the Councils for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine. A professional training lasting two or three years or more is
needed to qualify for registration. Only state registered members of these

professions may be employed in the National Health Service and some other
public services.
Medical social workers must obtain the certificate of the. Institute of
Medical Social Workers, or have taken a recognised university course to
qualify them for membership of the Institute. Psychiatric social workers are
required to have a certificate showing they have attended the mental health
course provided at certain universities. Speech therapists need a good general
education and three years’ professional training.
MEDICAL Medical research in Britain receiving support from government funds is
RESEARCH carried out by the Medical Research Council, the universities and their
associated medical schools, and also in hospitals in the National Health
Service. Further support for medical research is provided by private organisa¬
tions, of which the British Empire Cancer Campaign and the Nuffield
Foundation are among the largest. There is close co-operation between the
Medical Research Council and these organisations to ensure the best allocation
of their respective resources. Research is also undertaken by the pharmaceutical
industry. (For fuller information on medical research see p. 213.)

EDUCATION
I55
Educational
Administration
There are about nine million children and young people in full-time
attendance at schools, universities, training colleges or technical colleges in
Britain. The great majority of schools, attended by over 90 per cent of school
children, are publicly provided or aided. Most technical colleges and other
centres of further education are also publicly maintained. Universities are
autonomous self-governing institutions but are aided from public funds, as
are nearly 95 per cent of their students.
The bulk of expenditure on education in Britain comes from public funds
although many of the older-established schools and colleges continue to
benefit from private endowments. In 1964-65 total public expenditure on
education, including university education (but excluding school meals and
milk), was nearly ,£1,397 million.
In England and Wales the main development of publicly provided primary
education dates from 1870, and that of secondary education from the beginning
of the present century. In 1833 the Government began to make annual
grants to the voluntary societies which were providing schools, and the
Elementary Education Act of 1870 accepted the principle of compulsory
education. By the end of the nineteenth century elementary education had
become virtually both compulsory and free of charge. Public provision of
secondary education (already begun in Wales) started in England under the
Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public education in
England and Wales. The Scottish and Northern Ireland educational systems
both have long histories independent of that of education in England, but
the same general policy is now being implemented throughout the United
Kingdom, with some national variations. The governing acts are the Education
(Scotland) Act 1962 (a consolidating measure) and the Education Act
(Northern Ireland) 1947.
A rising birth rate, a decline in the numbers of early school leavers and a
more widespread recognition of the value of higher education has increased
the demand for educational facilities and stimulated expansion at all
levels.
All aspects of education in England and Wales, and of universities (and civil
science and the arts, see p. 52) throughout Great Britain are the responsibility
of the Secretary of State for Education and Science. (The Secretary of State
for Wales is concerned with the supervision of the national educational
policy in Wales.) The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of
Education for Northern Ireland have corresponding educational respon¬
sibilities, except that the Secretary of State for Scotland is consulted about
Scottish universities but is not responsible for them.
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is
divided between the central government departments, local education
authorities, and various voluntary organisations. The relation between these
three groups is based on consultation and co-operation, both by direct contact
between the parties and through Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Education who
act as liaison officers, particularly between local education authorities and the
156
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SCHOOLS
Management
departments. The Schools Council for the Curriculum and Examinations,
which was set up in 1964 to act as an advisory body on all aspects of the
school system is representative of all educational interests.
The local education authorities are responsible for ensuring that adequate
provision is made in their areas for the two stages of school education
(primary and secondary), and that those pupils who would profit by proceeding
to a university are not deterred by lack of financial means. They are also
responsible for the provision of all forms of further education (see p. 162).
The planning of the curriculum is largely in the hands of the head teacher
of each school and the individual teachers.
In England and Wales colleges of education (formerly known as teacher
training colleges) are under the financial and administrative control of local
education authorities or voluntary organisations, but the organisation of
courses is based on university institutes of education. The Scottish colleges
of education are under the control of specially appointed governing bodies;
in Northern Ireland they are under the control of the Government or
voluntary agencies.
The universities are administratively independent of the Department of
Education and Science (and in Northern Ireland the Ministry of Education);
their relations with the departments concerned are conducted through the
University Grants Committee (see p. 167). Their governing bodies are
appointed according to the terms of their individual charters.
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive
efficient full-time education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of
5 and 15. (The school-leaving age is to be raised to 16 in 1970-71; it is
estimated that this will increase the school population by 425,000.)
At present there are over 8f million school children at about 40,000 schools.
In England and Wales there were over 7 million children in publicly main¬
tained schools in 1964, besides some 124,000 others at schools receiving
direct grants from the Department of Education; there were also about !i
470,000 children of all ages at about 3,750 independent schools. In Scotland
893,000 children were attending publicly maintained or aided schools and
nearly 18,000 were at independent schools. In Northern Ireland 300,000
children were attending publicly maintained or aided schools; there were
very few at independent schools. The number of school children in Britain
is increasing mainly because the birth rate has continued to rise steadily
since 1955, so that primary school numbers are very high. Each year, too,
more children stay on at school beyond the minimum leaving age and the
school population is expected to rise by 2 million by 1975. There is, therefore,
a continuing need for more teachers and more school buildings.
In England and Northern Ireland it is usual for boys and girls to be taught
together in primary schools. In England and Wales over half and in Northern
Ireland less than half the secondary schools are for boys or girls only. Mixed
schools are more common in Wales and in Scotland, where all but a few
city schools take both boys and girls. There are a few co-educational
independent schools, including those with classes for small children, but the
majority are for either boys or girls.
Schools supported from public funds are of three kinds in England and
Wales: county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained
by local education authorities wholly out of public funds; voluntary schools
(mostly ‘aided’ or ‘controlled’ schools) which have been provided by a

voluntary body, usually of a religious denomination1, and direct grant schools
which are completely independent of local education authorities but receive
a grant-in-aid from the Department of Education and Science. These last
(the smallest group) mostly provide education of the grammar school type; they
include some schools of ancient foundation. In Scotland most of the schools
supported from public funds are provided by education authorities and are
known as public schools (in England this term is used for a type of independent
school, see p. 160). There are also a few grant-aided schools (some of ancient
foundation) conducted by voluntary managers and receiving grants direct
from the Scottish Education Department. In Northern Ireland county
schools, managed by local education authorities, and voluntary schools,
under voluntary management, are both grant-aided by the Government.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
schools maintained by local education authorities (i.e. over 90 per cent of
the school population) and books and equipment are supplied free. Direct
grant schools charge fees, but must offer 25 per cent of their places free to
pupils who have attended maintained or grant-aided primary schools for at
least two years; these places are usually offered through, and paid for by,
local education authorities. The direct grant schools must also put a further
25 per cent of their places at the disposal of local education authorities, if
required, for candidates who have not necessarily attended grant-aided
primary schools. Tuition fees for the remaining places are payable, but relief
may be claimed in accordance with an income scale approved by the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science; the Department pays the governors of the
school the amount of the fees so remitted. (For independent schools, see
p. 160.) In Scotland education authorities may charge fees in a limited number
of schools provided that this does not prejudice the provision of free education
for all who are entitled to it. In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to
parents of children attending grant-aided schools, with the exception of
grammar schools, where qualified pupils receive from the local education
authorities scholarships which cover the whole or most of the fees charged
by the school.
Local education authorities in England and Wales must ensure that there
are sufficient schools available for their area; teachers are not subject to
direction from the central department on curricula or teaching methods.
Her Majesty’s Inspectors, who are responsible for the inspection of all schools
including independent schools, review and report on the content and value of
the education provided and, during their visits, are available as advisers.
Local education authorities also employ inspectors to advise on the schools
which they maintain. Further advice is available to teachers as a result of
research undertaken by the Schools Council. In Scotland the broad outline
of schemes of work in primary and secondary schools is subject to the approval
of one of Her Majesty’s Inspectors. In Northern Ireland the curriculum of
each grant-aided school is subject to the approval of the Ministry of Education.
1 The local education authority is responsible for the running costs of all voluntary
schools and for the cost of all building work at controlled schools. Aided schools have
more independence than controlled schools and are responsible for part of the cost of
external repairs and any building work. Over a third of the 30,000 schools maintained
by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary schools and the
majority of these are Church of England schools. There are some 2,000 Roman Catholic
voluntary schools and smaller numbers belonging to other religious bodies.

In both countries considerable latitude is afforded in the scope both of the
curriculum and the teaching methods employed.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools
receive religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents wish them to be withdrawn. In county schools, and in
certain circumstances in voluntary schools, religious instruction of an un¬
denominational Christian character is given. In all kinds of voluntary school
there is opportunity for denominational instruction. In county schools in
Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access to give religious instruction
to children of their denomination for a limited period each week. In Scotland,
subject to safeguards for the individual conscience, matters relating to religious
instruction are in the hands of the school managers, but there are a number
of denominational schools conducted by education authorities.
Services in the school chapel and religious teaching are an essential part
of the life and education of the independent public schools and at most of
these schools conform to the teaching of a particular church (in the majority
of cases, Anglican).
Physical education, including organised games, is a part of the curriculum
of all schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must have
the use of a playing field and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Organised games include tennis, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse and netball.
The School Health Service provides periodic medical inspection and
arranges for free medical and dental treatment for all children attending
schools maintained by local education authorities. Treatment facilities include
dental clinics and child guidance centres. (There are also child guidance
clinics in the National Health Service.) In Northern Ireland the School
Health Service is operated by the health authorities.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to all school children
who wish to have it, and the Schools Meals Service provides a midday dinner
at a subsidised price (remitted where there is need) to just over half the
pupils in county and voluntary schools. Education authorities have power to
provide free transport for children who live more than a certain distance from
the schools they attend.
There are some nursery schools which provide informal educational and play
facilities for children between two and five years old. At five, the age at
which education becomes compulsory, children in England and Wales go to
infant schools or departments until they are seven and then on to junior schools
until the age of about eleven (also in Northern Ireland; twelve in Scotland).
The controversial subject of the age of transfer from primary to secondary
schooling is included in the terms of reference of the Central Advisory
Council for Education (England) which, under the chairmanship of Lady
Plowden, is considering primary education in all its aspects; the Council’s
report is expected in 1966. In the meantime, under the Education Act 1964?
local education authorities and voluntary bodies in England and Wales may,
subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for Education and Science,
organise new schools so that the age of transfer is not necessarily at eleven.
Primary departments in Scotland take all children between the ages of five
and twelve.
In Scotland primary pupils must be taught reading, writing, arithmetic,
English, music, art and handwork, nature study, physical training and, at

the appropriate stage, history, geography, and written composition; girls
must learn needlework. Religious instruction is also given. In England,
Wales and Northern Ireland, the curriculum is similar in scope with the
addition, in Wales, of the teaching of Welsh. (Children who speak Welsh
at home normally receive the early stages of their primary education in Welsh
and are taught English as a second language.) Many interesting developments
are taking place in the teaching of mathematics and foreign languages as
well as in physical education, drama and art.
The public or state system of education aims to give all children an education
suited to their particular abilities. A change in the means by which this should
be achieved in England and Wales was announced by the Government in
November 1964, when it was stated that, as a matter of national policy, all
secondary education should be reorganised gradually on a comprehensive
basis.
Wales Comprehensive schools are not selective and provide all types of secondary
education for all or most of the children of a district. This means that they
provide a far wider range of courses than the schools that they will replace—
mainly grammar and secondary modern schools. Comprehensive schools can
be organised in a number of ways. Some take the full secondary school
age-range from 11 to 19; others, such as those in parts of Leicestershire, are
‘two-tier’, with junior high schools for pupils between 11 and 14 and upper
schools for pupils guaranteeing to stay there at least two years.
Grammar schools, for children who are successful in the selection procedures
at the age of eleven (hence the term ‘eleven-plus’), provide an academic
education orientated towards university entrance; secondary modern schools
were originally designed to give a general education with a practical bias;
there are also a few secondary technical schools offering a general education
related to industry, commerce and agriculture; and schools providing all three,
or any two types of education, in separately organised streams and known as
multilateral or bilateral schools. The system of allocating children to different
types of school at the age of eleven and the selection methods used have
provoked much public discussion and critical thought. Also, as it has become
increasingly clear that many pupils want and benefit from a more academic
type of course, many modern schools have been providing courses of the
grammar and secondary technical type. When the Government announced in
1964 that it favoured a comprehensive policy, many local authorities, with
more than two-thirds of all secondary school pupils in their areas, had already
implemented or were planning to introduce comprehensive systems.
Most grammar school pupils remain at school until they are 16 and the
rest leave between the ages of 17 and 19. Although the majority of secondary
modern pupils leave during the year in which they are 15, nearly one-fifth
(17-5 per cent in 1963-64) stay on for another year or longer. In compre¬
hensive schools 16-7 per cent of all pupils were over statutory school leaving
age in January 1964. Some 62 per cent of the 15 to 16 year old age group in
England and Wales are in full-time education at maintained schools or colleges
of further education and 29 per cent of the 16 to 17 year old age group.
Scottish secondary schools fall into two main categories, those providing
courses extending normally to three years, generally called junior secondary
schools, and those providing courses of four, five or six years, known as senior
secondary schools. In each type of school the courses are intended to provide
a general education, but they are differentiated in character to suit the varying
l6o BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
needs and abilities of the pupils, and include literary, commercial, boys’
technical, domestic and rural courses. About 45 per cent of the schools are
junior secondary and 55 per cent senior secondary; of the latter about 75 per
cent are comprehensive, a type traditional in Scotland. Over one-third of all
pupils go on to senior secondary courses on reaching secondary school age.
Pupils are transferred to the different types of secondary school on the basis
of teachers’ estimates of attainment, intelligence tests, and attainment tests,
with due regard to the wishes of the parents. There is provision for an appeal
to the Secretary of State for Scotland in the event of a dispute between the
education authority and the parent and also for the reconsideration of original
allocations later.
Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools, secondary (intermediate) schools,
which are the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in England and
Wales, and technical intermediate schools, which offer the same facilities as
secondary technical schools in England and Wales. Some changes in organisa¬
tion are likely as the result of the 1964 White Paper, Educational Development
in Northern Ireland.
Special Special educational treatment, either in special schools or otherwise, is
Educational provided for children who require it because of any physical or mental
Treatment handicap, including maladjustment. For children at special schools attendance
is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16, although a number of schools
accept children outside this age range. There are about 970 special schools
in Britain, including hospital schools, day and boarding schools. There are
also boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary schools.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are ten categories of
handicapped pupils for whom local education authorities must provide special
educational treatment: blind, partially sighted, deaf, partially hearing,
delicate, educationally subnormal, epileptic, maladjusted, physically handi¬
capped and children suffering from speech defects. (There is no separate
category for the delicate in Scotland.)
Independent Independent schools in England and Wales must be registered with the
Schools Department of Education and Science, to show that they conform to certain
minimum standards. Schools achieving certain higher standards may apply
for recognition as ‘efficient’; independent schools so recognised contain
about two-thirds of the pupils. Similar registration arrangements exist in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. Fees at independent schools (for tuition and
boarding) range between ^300 and ^55° a year* A number of them offer
scholarships. The largest and most important of the independent schools
in Britain are known as public schools, although not all schools classed as
public schools are independent (those which are not are mostly direct-grant
schools) and public schools form only a minority of all independent schools.
(These schools should not be confused with the State-supported public
schools in Scotland.)
Public schools for boys have made a notable contribution to English education,
many dating from at least the sixteenth century. The public school today is
characterised by a high staffing ratio and a high proportion of pupils doing
advanced work and is often, although not necessarily, a boarding school.
The usual age of entry to the independent public schools for boys is 13 and
the leaving age about 18. There are some girls’ public schools modelled to
a certain extent on the public schools for boys. The Government has stated
EDUCATION
161
Secondary
School
Examinations
School Building
that it intends to consider how the independent schools may best be inte¬
grated into the state system of education.
Independent schools also include preparatory schools, many of them
boarding schools, for boys aged from about 8 to 13 years, most of whom are
intending to enter public schools; a few similar schools for girls; and a wide
range of other day and boarding schools covering every age group and grade
of education and many types of educational method. Some of these schools
are owned and managed, often under a trust deed, by independent non-
profit-making bodies. Others are privately owned by proprietors for whom
the running of the school provides a living.
There is no national leaving examination in England or Wales, but secondary
school pupils (and candidates not attending school) may take the General
Certificate of Education (GCE) or the Certificate of Secondary Education
(CSE). The GCE, which is on a single subject and not a grouped subject
basis (i.e. no subject is obligatory and individual subjects may be taken at
different times), is conducted at ‘ordinary’ and ‘advanced’ levels. Most
candidates for the ordinary level are about 16 years of age, although many
take it earlier, at the discretion of their head teacher. Most grammar, direct-
grant and independent school pupils and an increasing number from other
secondary schools take the ordinary examination, and passes in various subjects
are widely accepted for entry to courses of vocational training. The advanced
examination is at university entrance level (supplemented, since 1963, by
special papers to help university authorities in selecting students) and is
accepted also for purposes of entry to many forms of professional training.
The CSE, instituted in 1965, is designed for pupils who have completed
five years’ secondary education but who are not taking GCE; it is also on a
single subject basis and is controlled by teachers serving in the schools
providing candidates. The highest grade of pass in the CSE is intended to
be of the same standard as a pass in the GCE O-level.
In Scotland courses in senior secondary schools lead to examinations
conducted by the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board.
School pupils in the fourth year of secondary courses sit an examination at
16 years for the award of passes on the Ordinary grade of the Scottish Certificate
of Education, and pupils in the fifth year can obtain passes on the Higher
grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education. Examinations at both grades
are open to candidates who have left school.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Junior Certificate Examination,
at about the age of 14, and the Northern Ireland General Certificate of
Education, at about the age of 17.
Local education authorities and voluntary bodies are responsible for providing
the schools and other buildings needed for public education in their areas.
The central departments exercise control by approving annual building
programmes, put forward by local education authorities, framing regulations
and fixing cost limits; they also offer guidance to authorities by means of
building bulletins and in other ways.
An extensive school building programme has been carried out in recent
years. This has resulted in the completion of over 8,000 new schools in
Britain between 1947 and 1964; together with extensions, alterations and
remodelling of existing schools, about 4I million new places have been
provided, at a cost of about £1,090 million. In England and Wales new work
to the value of £80 million has been authorised to start in each of the years
..
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1965-66 and 1966-67. In Scotland the comparable authorisations are for
£14 million and £17 million. In Northern Ireland expenditure is expected
to be over £4 million a year.
Grants of up to 75 per cent of the approved cost are normally available
from the Department of Education and Science for the building of new
voluntary aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to existing
aided schools. The Northern Ireland grants amount to 65 per cent of the
total cost of the expenditure by voluntary bodies on both new schools and
improvements.
The extensive school building programme has been accompanied by new
ideas and methods in design and construction. Industrialised building
techniques have been widely adopted. The new schools are light, airy and
colourful, with a high standard of finish and generous provision of teaching
area and outdoor games space.
The British system of further education is distinctive for its flexibility.
Further education is available to all above school-leaving age and at all
levels, full-time or part-time, and may be vocational or non-vocational. Most
of the colleges of further education are conducted by local education authorities.
The most advanced courses, which are of university standard, may qualify
for the approval of the Council for National Academic Awards, which will
then award degrees to students successfully completing them (see p. 170).
This section mainly describes other forms of further education.
In England and Wales local education authorities maintain about 500 colleges,
which provide technical and commercial courses at every level and a number
of GCE courses. There are also a number of agricultural colleges (see p. 348)
and art colleges (see p. 228). The 25 regional colleges, of which nearly all the
students work at or near degree level, are also maintained by local authorities.
(The colleges of advanced technology (see p. 167), concentrating entirely on
advanced work, were also part of the further education system before they
obtained university status.)
Six national colleges linked to a particular technology are administered
jointly by the industry and the Department of Education and Science. They
are the colleges for rubber technology; food technology; heating, ventilating,
refrigeration and fan engineering; agricultural engineering; the National
Foundry College; the National Leathersellers College (and formerly the
Royal College of Art, see p. 229). These receive grants from the Department
of Education and Science.
In Scotland there are about 80 local further education colleges offering
full and part-time day courses and a number of evening courses and 13 Central
Institutions for further education doing advanced work.
In Northern Ireland there are 30 institutions of further education, of
which six conduct advanced level courses.
Since most of the technical colleges and other further education establish¬
ments in Britain are either maintained or aided from public funds, tuition
fees are moderate, and often nominal for young people under 18 years of age.
Many full-time students are helped by awards from local education authorities.
The awards are generally based on the results of the General Certificate of
Education or a corresponding examination; they are assessed to cover tuition
fees and a maintenance grant, but parents who can afford to contribute
towards the cost are required to do so. There are also some scholarships

Students
Technological
and Technical
Courses
Business Courses
163
available from endowments, and others are awarded under schemes organised
by particular industries or companies for the most promising of their young
workers.
Capital expenditure for all further education institutions in Great Britain
was over ^206 million in the ten years 1955-65, of which ^23-3 million was
expenditure in Scotland. The Government increased the capital fund available
for new projects at institutions of further education in England and Wales
from £16 million in 1964-65 to £24 million in 1965-66 and have announced
a 1966-67 programme of ^27 million (although there is to be some revision
of its timing). In Scotland ^3-3 million was allocated for capital expenditure
on institutions of further education in 1964-65. In Northern Ireland in the
period 1955-65 capital expenditure amounted to over £4 million.
In 1964 there were 215,700 full-time and sandwich course (see below) students
and if million (including evening) part-time students in technological,
technical, art and commercial colleges in Britain (i-6 million in England and
Wales, 313,000 in Scotland and 46,500 in Northern Ireland). The total number
of students on advanced courses in England and Wales was 158,000, in
Scotland, 4,900 and in Northern Ireland, 1,150.
The courses provided are full-time, sandwich (three to five years in length,
generally consisting of alternate periods of about six months of full-time study
in technical college and supervised experience in industry), block release (on
similar principles, but for shorter periods), day release (generally attendance
at a technical college for one day a week during working hours), and evening
classes.
Sandwich courses are popular at advanced levels. For lower level courses
day release and block release courses are replacing evening courses to a large
extent and are likely to become more widespread. The Industrial Training
Boards being established under the Industrial Training Act 1964 will
probably prescribe day and block release courses as the appropriate further
education to be associated with the industrial training of various categories
of young workers.
There is a wide variety of craft courses for young people in various trades
and occupations, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course
of three to five years. Some experiment is taking place with courses of a more
professional character which are suitable for technicians or for those who aim
ultimately at membership of a professional institution. There are many others
leading to the National Certificates approved by joint committees representa¬
tive of the education departments and the appropriate professional body (for
example, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers). These courses are normally
at two levels, ordinary and higher. The Ordinary Certificate courses last two
years and students usually follow them between the ages of 16 and 19. The
Higher Certificate (an advanced course) requires a further two years’ part-
time study and is generally considered to reach a level corresponding to a
pass degree in the subject concerned. Similar in standard are the Higher
Diploma courses, awarded by joint committees in the same way as the
Higher National Certificate. These require three years’ full-time or sandwich
study. (For degree courses, see p. 170.)
A fair proportion of evening institutes and some independent colleges offer
courses in shorthand, typing and bookkeeping. Most local technical colleges
offer some lower level work; higher level work is generally concentrated in
technical colleges with a department of commerce or in specialised colleges
164
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Adult
Education
of commerce. The Scottish Council for Commercial Education awards senior
and advanced commercial certificates to students aiming at professional
careers in commerce. In 1963 a Certificate in Office Studies for young entrants
to clerical and other non-technical posts was introduced in England, Wales
and Scotland.
Some business education is related to the specialised examination require¬
ments of various professional bodies; large numbers of the candidates taking
such courses do so through correspondence courses. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland there are part-time courses leading to the Ordinary
National Certificate and Higher National Certificate in Business Studies.
There are also more advanced full-time and sandwich courses leading to the
Ordinary National Diploma and Higher National Diploma in Business Studies.
Adult education is generally taken to mean courses of non-vocational education
for people over 18. In this context it comprises the courses provided by the
residential colleges of adult education and courses of a mainly non-vocational
character provided, either separately or in conjunction, by the extra-mural
departments of universities, the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA) and
other voluntary bodies, and by local education authorities.
The residential colleges, the university departments and the voluntary
bodies, such as the WEA, recognised by the education departments as com¬
petent to provide adult education, receive government grants. So too do
various national bodies which promote educational activities of a non-political
kind, such as the National Federation of Women’s Institutes. Many of these
bodies also receive grants from local education authorities for services
rendered locally.
A major share in the provision of adult education is increasingly being
assumed by local education authorities. Most of it is on a part-time basis,
mainly in the 8,000 or so evening institutes, which have a total of over a million
students, and also in schools of art, adult education centres, community centres,
literary institutes and youth clubs. There are about 30 short-term residential
colleges in Great Britain, maintained or aided by local education authorities,
providing courses varying in length between a weekend and a fortnight. Many
of the courses are practical, but there are widespread opportunities for
academic study.
The village colleges of Cambridgeshire, Leicestershire, Peterborough,
Huntingdonshire and Derbyshire, combining facilities for secondary and
adult education, are another local education authority development. Com¬
munity centres, though aided by the local education authority, are usually
managed by community associations many of which are affiliated to the
National Federation of Community Associations.
Eight residential colleges (seven in England and Wales, one in Scotland)
provide courses of one or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The
colleges vary in character, although they all aim at providing a liberal education.
Six of the colleges are grant-aided.
A number of voluntary bodies provide adult education as part of their
services. The Women’s Institutes and Townswomen’s Guilds, for example,
generally offer courses in social studies, arts, drama and handicrafts. These
too are aided by local education authorities.
In general, courses at the highest levels in liberal studies are provided by
the extra-mural departments of the universities, many of which have full-time
staff appointed for this purpose and can call on the services of other members
of the university staff; and by the Workers’ Educational Association, which
EDUCATION ^
also employs organising tutors and works closely with the university extra¬
mural departments. In 1964,352,000 students in Britain attended such courses.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides in London a centre of
information and research for adult education, as well as a channel for
co-operation and consultation for the many organisations in England and
Wales which are interested in this subject. It is assisted by a grant from the
Department of Education and Science. The Scottish Institute of Adult
Education is the corresponding body in Scotland.
Changes in the structure of education in Northern Ireland and increased
government grants are resulting from acceptance of the main recommenda¬
tions of the report, published in 1964, of the committee under Sir Charles
Morris.
TEACHERS AND Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing
bodies or managers. In 1964 there were about 331,000 full-time and 30,000
part-time (equivalent to 14,000 full-time) teachers in publicly maintained
primary and secondary schools in Britain, an average of one teacher to 24
pupils; but because of the shortage of teachers, particularly those for younger
children, and their uneven distribution throughout the country, many classes
have more than the statutory maxima of pupils (40 pupils for primary and
30 for secondary school classes in England and Wales; in Scotland 45 for
primary, 40 for classes in the first three years and 30 for classes in subsequent
years of secondary departments). The rise in school population has created
a need for more and more teachers; although greater numbers are entering the
colleges of education (see p. 169), more university graduates are turning to
teaching, and many married women, formerly teachers, are returning to the
profession, yet more are needed if the Government’s aim of eliminating
oversize classes is to be achieved. In 1964 there were over 36,000 full-time
teachers in grant-aided establishments of further education in Britain, other
than colleges of advanced technology and central institutions (see p. 167),
and, because of the special conditions, many more part-time teachers. Most
teachers in technical colleges have industrial and professional experience.
There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland,
and in Northern Ireland; and these scales influence the salaries paid to
teachers in independent schools. There are also national superannuation
schemes which are administered by the central departments.
Under the Remuneration of Teachers Act 1964, salaries in England and
Wales are negotiated by three joint committees, each consisting of representa¬
tives of the teachers on the one hand and of local authorities and the
Department of Education and Science on the other. They are concerned with
salaries for teachers in maintained schools, institutes of further education
and farm institutes. The machinery for salary negotiation in Scotland differs
in that the Secretary of State for Scotland is not represented on the
negotiating committee; he can, however, modify the committee’s recom¬
mendations.
Many teachers serve overseas for a short period (see p. 174).
Radio broadcasts to schools and colleges of further education are well
established. In 1964-65 the School Broadcasting Department of the BBC sent
out 67 different radio series, many of which were repeated each week; they
were used by about 75 per cent of schools (31,000) in Britain. The BBC also
produced three different series for technical colleges. Television reaches
Teaching Aids

about 22 per cent of schools (some 9,000); 19 weekly programmes, all repeated
the same week, were broadcast by the BBC and 14 weekly programmes,
many of which were repeated, were produced by five of the independent
companies (Rediffusion Limited, Granada, Associated Television, Scottish
Television and Grampian Television) and broadcast by the Independent
Television Authority (ITA).
Radio provides a great variety of educational programmes for adults, both
vocational and non-vocational; most of them are grouped in the ‘Study
Session’ hourly programmes on five nights a week. Television programmes
for similar audiences have grown fast. The BBC provides them daily and
ITA has a regular ‘Sunday Session’. There have also been a number of
experimental projects sponsored between the BBC, some of the independent
television companies, universities, local education authorities and a voluntary
body, the National Extension College (NEC). The NEC has been experi¬
menting with television series, supported by correspondence courses and
occasional contacts between students and tutors.
Both the BBC and ITV have educational advisory bodies and there is
consultation between the two broadcasting services to prevent duplication of
education programmes.
More recent developments include the use of aids which take over part of
the repetitive teaching functions, allowing more of the teacher’s time to be
devoted to individual pupils. There has been a rapid development in the use
of programmed learning for educational purposes and a National Research
Documentation Centre has been established in the Department of Education
at the University of Birmingham. The number of language laboratories (using
tape recorders in individual sound-proof booths) being used at all levels of
the educational system is increasing rapidly. Closed circuit television is in
regular use at several universities, medical schools, colleges of education and
schools.
There is a trend in schools and colleges towards co-ordinating different
methods of audio-visual presentation, including films, colour slides, wall
charts, maps, models and recording tape. For example, the BBC’s ‘Radio¬
vision’ programmes for schools on art and languages, introduced in 1964,
used coloured film strip synchronised with sound programmes and extension
to other subjects was planned for 1965-66. The National Committee for
Audio-Visual Aids in Education is the main promotional body in England
and Wales; it runs a national information and exhibition centre and an
experimental development unit.
Higher education in Great Britain is being rapidly expanded in universities,
colleges of education, and in technical colleges and certain other institutions
where some courses are of advanced level. (For higher education in Northern
Ireland, see p. 171). The expansion has been accelerated by the Government’s
acceptance of the target figures up to i973—74 the substance of certain
other important recommendations of the Committee on Higher Education
under Lord Robbins’ chairmanship. The Committee’s report, published in
1963, suggested that by i973—74 there should be 390,000 places in
higher education, of which 218,000 should be in university institutions. Early
1^1965 the Government decided that 122,000 of the remaining places should
be for training teachers, a move that will almost double the number of
teachers in training.
The colleges of advanced technology and two Scottish central institutions
are to have university status, and the Royal College of Art, London, and the

College of Aeronautics, Cranfield, are also to be brought within the ambit
of the University Grants Committee (see below). Instead of establishing new
universities (apart from Stirling, approved in 1964) or giving university
status to other institutions, the Government has decided to provide the
additional places required during the next ten years in existing universities.
An exception which is being considered is the possible creation of a new
technological university institution in north-east England.
Further expansion of technological education and the selective development
of institutions is being encouraged. These include the Imperial College of
Science and Technology (University of London) Manchester College of
Science and Technology, Strathclyde University and, possibly, the new
institution mentioned above.
Teacher training colleges in England and Wales are being renamed
colleges of education (as they are already known in Scotland) and it will be
possible for some of their students to take degrees. Two business schools for
postgraduate students with business experience are being established (see
p. 171). A Council for National Academic Awards has been set up (see p. 170)
with the power to award degrees to students on suitable courses outside
universities. (The Robbins Committee was particularly concerned that there
should be the same awards for work of the same standard whatever institution
the student attended.)
There are over 30 universities in Great Britain and the number will shortly
reach about 45 as the colleges of advanced technology (CATs) attain
university status and three new universities come into being in Scotland.
Although the Department of Education and Science is responsible for pro¬
viding nearly three-quarters of universities’ income it does not control their
work or teaching nor does it have direct dealings with the universities. It is
advised, and its grants distributed, by the University Grants Committee, whose
members are appointed for their personal academic or industrial experience.
The English universities are: Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Durham,
Exeter, Hull, Keele, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Manchester,
Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Sheffield, South¬
ampton, and the new Universities of Sussex, at Brighton (opened in October
1961), York (1963), East Anglia, at Norwich (1963), Essex, at Colchester
(1964), Lancaster (1964), Kent, at Canterbury (1965) and Warwick, at
Coventry (1965). The Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, St. Andrews and Strathclyde. There is a University of Wales; and
St. David’s College, Lampeter, whose arts degree courses are aided by grants
through the sponsorship of the University College of South Wales and
Monmouthshire.
Many of the colleges of advanced technology are changing their names as
they achieve university status and some are moving sites. Their new names, as
proposed in their charters, are shown in brackets (where they are known).
They are Battersea College of Technology, London (University of Surrey,
at Guildford), Birmingham College of Advanced Technology (University
of Aston in Birmingham), Bradford Institute of Technology (University of
Bradford), Brunei College, Acton (Brunei University), Bristol College of
Science and Technology (Bath University of Technology), Chelsea College
of Science and Technology, Loughborough College of Technology (Lough¬
borough University of Technology), Northampton College of Advanced
Technology, London, Royal College of Advanced Technology, Salford, and
the Welsh College of Advanced Technology, Cardiff.

The new Scottish universities are: Stirling, a completely new foundation;
Queen’s College, Dundee, which is preparing to become a university indepen¬
dent of St. Andrews; and Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, formerly a
central institution. The second central institution which was promised
university status, the Scottish College of Commerce, joined with the Royal
College of Science and Technology in the new University of Strathclyde.
There are three other institutions where the work is predominantly of
university standard: Manchester College of Science and Technology, the
Royal College of Art, and the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
As universities administer themselves according to the terms of their
individual charters, their forms of government vary. Oxford and Cambridge
are each composed of a number of residential colleges which are corporate
bodies governed by their own fellows and distinct from the university. Most
of the fellows of the colleges, however, are university teachers or officers and
the majority of university teachers are also fellows of colleges. Only the
universities themselves have the right to confer degrees, and they provide
central libraries and laboratories as well as much formal instruction. Govern¬
ment of these universities is entirely in their own hands. The Universities of
London (with over 28,000 students, by far the largest in Britain) and Wales
are federal; academic and financial matters concerning the whole university
are controlled by the central authorities, which include lay representatives;
the constituent colleges and institutions manage all other matters for them¬
selves. At most of the other universities, especially those which owe their
foundation to local initiative, the lay element has an important role in
university administration. Oxford, Cambridge and Keele have high propor¬
tions of students in residence. At other universities the proportion is less
than half. Nearly a third of all full-time students in Great Britain are in
colleges or halls of residence, just over half are in lodgings and the remainder
live at home.
The Government contributes about 70 per cent towards the current income
of universities and about 90 per cent towards their capital programmes.
Money is given mainly in the form of block grants to the University Grants
Committee, which then distributes the grants to individual universities. In
addition to those for building work, grants are also made for purchasing sites
and properties, for professional fees and equipment. Further sums are raised
by the universities themselves.
Recurrent grants for 1964-65 amounted to over £99 million and will rise
to over £125 million in 1966-67, compared with £23 million in 1954-55.
Capital grants of £60 million were made in 1964-65, compared with nearly
£6 million in 1954-55. In recent years about 70 per cent of capital expenditure
in each year’s programme has been for buildings to accommodate teaching
and research in the various faculties; over half for science subjects and
technology. The remaining 30 per cent has been for general service buildings,
such as halls of residence, student unions, refectories and libraries.
Courses in arts and science are offered by all universities. At nearly all
universities courses are available in one or more applied sciences: Imperial
College, London, Manchester College of Science and Technology, the
University of Strathclyde and the Colleges of Advanced Technology con-

centrate on technology although the colleges of advanced technology and
Strathclyde are now offering a number of courses in social studies and modern
languages. At the beginning of the academic year 1964-65, 44 per cent of
full-time university students (excluding those at CATs) in Great Britain were
taking arts or social studies courses and 41 per cent were studying science or
technology; a further 10 per cent were studying medicine and the remainder
dentistry, agriculture, forestry and veterinary science.
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though
in medicine five or six years are required. The first degree of Bachelor
(Master in the older Scottish universities) is awarded on the completion of
such a course, depending on satisfactory examination results. In most
universities an ordinary (or pass) degree or an honours degree can be taken,
although the majority of students in England and Wales take honours courses.
A feature of the CATs is the four-year ‘sandwich’ course degree (see p. 163)
and the highly specialised ‘refresher’ courses for senior industrial staff.
Further study or research is required at the modern universities for the degree
of Master and by all universities for that of Doctor. Actual degree titles vary
according to the practice of each university; some differentiate between the
arts and sciences and some do not. Diplomas and certificates are awarded
after shorter courses in some subjects.
University teaching combines lectures, practical classes (in scientific
subjects) and small group teaching in either seminars or tutorials, the last
being a traditional feature of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all
universities there are postgraduate students engaged in research. There has
been an expansion of research in science and technology, particularly in
recent years (see p. 201).
x\dmission to the universities (including the CATs) is by examination and
selection; there is no religious test and no colour bar. Women are admitted
on equal terms with men, but at Cambridge their numbers are limited by
statute. The general proportion of men to women students is nearly three to
one; at Oxford it is six to one, and at Cambridge ten to one.
Despite recent expansion programmes, applications for places at universities
still exceed the number available. Prospective candidates for nearly all the
universities apply for places through the Universities Central Council on
Admissions (set up in 1963) instead of to individual universities and this
clearing house automatically passes on rejected applications to the next
university of the candidate’s choice. The only students to apply directly are
Scottish students for the Scottish universities except Edinburgh, which takes
its students through the Council’s machinery.
At the beginning of the academic year 1964-65 there were 150,000 full-time
university students including 15,000 from the former CATs and Heriot-Watt
College. Over 25,000 were postgraduate. There were also about 25,000 part-
time students, about three-fifths of whom were working for university-level
qualifications.
In 1964-65 there were nearly 19,000 full-time university teachers in Great
Britain; about 11 per cent of them were professors. The ratio of staff to
students was about 1 to 8.
Teachers in maintained schools must hold qualifications approved by the
education departments. In England and Wales the majority qualify by
obtaining an award after a three-year course of studies at a college of education.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
170
Plans are being worked out to give wider opportunities for college students
to obtain a degree as well as a professional qualification by means of a four-
year course. University graduates and certain specialist teachers are qualified
by their degree or specialist qualification although many do an additional
one-year course at a university or college of education. There are special
shortened courses for well qualified older students. In Scotland all qualified
teachers must hold a Teachers’ Certificate, awarded after a course at a college
of education; moreover, all secondary school teachers and all men teachers
of general subjects in primary schools must be graduates.
In England and Wales there are over 150 colleges of education (about a
dozen of which are for day students only), 26 university departments of
education, four colleges for training teachers for technical institutions and
16 art teacher training centres. In 1964-65 there were over 61,000 students
in the colleges of education (including 3,000 in the day colleges), nearly 5,000
in the university departments of education, and 1,200 and 800 in the technical
and art training establishments respectively: a total of some 68,000 students
in all. In Scotland there are nine colleges of education, which in 1964-65
had 7,800 students.
Plans for raising the numbers in colleges of education in England and Wales
to 80,000 by 1970-71 are already well advanced and will be extended to reach
the target of 111,000 students (122,000 in Great Britain) announced for
! 973-74. The Government has also announced a programme to supplement
the long-term measures and to help provide enough teachers for the rising
school population. The measures are mainly aimed at attracting back into
teaching former teachers, now married, and increasing the numbers of part-
time teachers. More day training colleges are to be opened, some training is
to be organised on a part-time basis and there are to be more refresher courses,
and more nursery classes for children of potential teachers.
The education departments, universities, local education authorities and
other bodies provide a variety of short courses for practising teachers.
Other Higher Many students in Great Britain (over 163,000 in 1964-65) take advanced
Education courses outside universities in a wide variety of subjects including architecture,
art and design (see p. 228), catering, engineering, natural sciences and business
studies. In 1964 the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) was
set up to administer degrees and other awards to students on courses of
approved degree standard outside universities. The Council has taken over
the responsibilities of the National Council for Technological Awards which
between 1956 and 1964 approved four-year sandwich courses of honours
degree standard leading to the Diploma in Technology and also instituted the
postgraduate standard award of Membership of the College of Technologists.
The CNAA degrees were awarded immediately for existing Diploma in
Technology courses and in 1965 for new courses. The Council’s powers
extend to the whole of Great Britain.
Management studies are provided by universities and technical colleges,
by individual companies and by trade and industrial federations. Certain
independent colleges specialise in management training. Several universities
have introduced management studies into the curriculum and courses for the
postgraduate Diploma in Management Studies are run by certain technical
colleges. In Scotland courses leading to the Certificate of Business Administra¬
tion are provided for students in junior supervisory positions. In Great
Britain, as a result of the recommendations of the Robbins report and
the report of a private committee under Lord Franks, two postgraduate

business schools were set up in 1964 at the Universities of London and
Manchester.
An Advisory Council on Management Education for the United Kingdom
was established in 1961 to keep under review provision for management
education outside the universities and to advise interested bodies.
Scholarships and other awards are now very widely available, for it is the
national educational policy that no able boy or girl shall be prevented by
lack of means from taking an advanced course at a university or elsewhere.
About 90 per cent of university students in Great Britain are aided from
public or private funds.
In England, Wales and Scotland all British students with certain qualifica¬
tions are eligible for awards from public funds in order to attend full-time
at a university, college of education or major further education establishment.
The present awards system in England and Wales was established by the
Education Act 1962 which made it the duty of local education authorities
to provide awards. In Scotland students’ allowances for advanced courses are
awarded by the Scottish Education Department. An award depends upon the
income of the student or his parents. Studentships for advanced postgraduate
study are offered annually by the Department of Education and Science and
by the Scottish Education Department. In 1965 over 2,500 studentships were
offered in the sciences and 1,000 in arts and social sciences—an increase on
previous years.
Higher education in Northern Ireland is also expanding. The Government
accepted most of the recommendations put forward in 1965 by the committee,
under Sir John Lockwood’s chairmanship, on higher education in Northern
Ireland. The Government agreed that there should be between 8,000 and
9,000 full-time university places by 1973-74 and that there should be a second
university, at Coleraine.
Technological studies are to be concentrated at the existing university,
Queen’s, Belfast, and the new university will be expected to build up
the study of biological sciences. The Government also accepted in principle
the committee’s proposals for teacher training. An education centre for
non-graduate teachers is to be established within the new university and
the general teacher training colleges are to be renamed colleges of education
and brought into closer association with Queen’s University. Higher
education outside the universities is to be centred on the Ulster College, an
association of the colleges of technology, catering, commerce, drama and
music.
Queen’s University, Belfast, and a recognised college, Magee University
College, Londonderry, had a total of 4,500 students in 1964-65. Between
1957 and 1964 nearly million was spent on university building projects
and further expansion over the next fifteen years, to cost about £1 million
a year, is planned. Recurrent expenditure in 1964-65 was estimated at £1 -8
million. Government grants are made by the Ministry of Education on
the advice of the University Grants Committee. Teacher training takes places
in one university department of education and six training colleges, with
over 100 and nearly 200 full-time students respectively, in 1964-65.
Technological education outside the university is given at the Belfast College
of Technology, under the sponsorship of the Joint Authority for Higher
Technological Studies. Under the proposed reorganisation technological
studies will be transferred to Queen’s University and the Joint Authority

will be wound up. University and further education scholarships are awarded
by local authorities and postgraduate awards and teacher training scholarships
by the Ministry of Education, the conditions of award being identical with
those for Great Britain.
The bodies mainly concerned in carrying out research into both the theory
and practice of education are the National Foundation for Educational
Research, the Scottish Council for Research in Education, the Northern
Ireland Council for Educational Research, the universities and teaching
associations. Some research is carried out by the central government
departments through Her Majesty’s Inspectorate and in England and Wales
by the Schools Council, an independent body which is currently considering
the sixth form curriculum and its relationship to the requirements of higher
education, the curricula preparations for the higher school-leaving age, and
the way English is taught at all levels.
The National Foundation for Educational Research, an independent
organisation, receives an annual grant from the Department of Education
and Science. More than half of its total income is provided by local education
authorities whose requests for guidance on, for example, classroom tests
or methods of allocating children to secondary school courses, give rise to
much of its work. The Foundation also undertakes research work commissioned
by the Department of Education and Science: present projects include a
study of primary school organisations and an investigation into the relative
value of day and block release in further education.
Financial support is also provided by philanthropic bodies. The Nuffield
Foundation (see p. 210), for example, is supporting a project for teaching
languages in primary schools.
There are many opportunities for overseas students to study in Britain and
for British students to study abroad and British teachers are encouraged to
serve overseas for a period.
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In
1964-65 there were over 64,000 overseas students in Britain, of whom about
one-quarter were at universities, another quarter at technical colleges and the
remainder training as teachers, doctors and nurses, for the law, or in industry.
About two-thirds of all overseas students were from the Commonwealth.
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to students and research workers
from other Commonwealth countries. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship
and Fellowship Plan, the Governments of certain Commonwealth countries
have made awards available at their own institutions of higher education to
men and women from other Commonwealth countries. The British Govern¬
ment has allocated nearly £3! million for the five-year period 1960-65 to
enable an average of 500 of these scholarships to be held in Britain at any time;
and for some 550 teachers and others to train in Britain under the
Commonwealth Bursary Scheme. An example of smaller government
schemes is the Athlone Fellowship Scheme, under which about 40 fellow¬
ships a year are awarded to Canadian engineering graduates for up to
two years’ further study, training and research in institutions or industries in
Britain.

About 500 British Council1 scholarships, tenable usually for one year in
Britain, are offered annually to graduates of overseas universities. Twenty-four
Marshall Scholarships for two years’ study at any university in Britain are
offered annually by the British Government to graduates from the United
States of America and over 60 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to
Commonwealth and United States graduates for two years of study at the
University of Oxford. Other universities and colleges themselves offer many
scholarships for which graduate students of any nationality are eligible2.
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are
available under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Special Commonwealth
African Assistance Plan and British technical assistance programmes for
several other countries. Large numbers of awards for study or training in
Britain are made under the United Nations Programmes of Technical
Assistance and the Colombo Plan.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee, set up after the
Commonwealth Education Conference of 1959, supplements normal direct
dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth. Further
Commonwealth Education Conferences were held in 1962 and 1964.
Responsibility for overseas students in Britain rests with the institutions of
higher education to which they are attached and with the students’ own
national representatives in Britain (High Commissions or Embassies). The
British Council, by agreement with various Governments, acts as agent for
the overseas departments of the British Government on matters affecting
students’ welfare.
The British Council has overseas students’ centres in London (where a new,
and larger, building was opened in 1963) and in other university cities. The
Council organises a varied programme of lectures, discussions and social and
other activities. Many British people like to invite students to their homes and
the British Council arranges introductions. In the vacations there are courses
in many parts of the country which offer opportunities for getting to know
more about British life in town and country. In term time there are visits to
various places of interest, and theatre and concert parties are arranged. The
British Council assists many students to find accommodation and about 10,000
are met annually on arrival and helped to settle down quickly in their new
environment.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas
students are the East and West Friendship Council, Rotary, Round Table,
the Victoria League, the Royal Over-Seas League, the Royal Commonwealth
Society, the National Union of Students, the English-Speaking Union and
1 The purpose of the British Council (founded in 1934) is defined in its Royal Charter as
the promotion of a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the English language
abroad and the development of closer cultural relations between Britain and other
countries. The Council is governed by an executive committee of 30 members,
broadly representative of many elements of the life of Britain and including nine
members nominated by ministers. It is financed almost entirely from public funds.
The activities of the Council, which has staff in some 80 overseas countries, include
English language teaching and other educational work, fostering personal contacts
between British and overseas people, especially in the educational, professional and
scientific fields, and running, or helping to maintain, libraries of British books and
periodicals overseas. Its work in Britain is concerned mainly with professional visitors
and with the welfare of overseas students.
2 The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes every two years a list of
postgraduate awards tenable at universities in Britain, and awards at overseas univer¬
sities for which British students are eligible; it is entitled United Kingdom Postgraduate
Awards (see Bibliography).

Churches of all denominations. The London Conference on Overseas
Students, for which the British Council provides the secretariat, co-ordinates
their work in the metropolis. In some London boroughs and in other large
cities there are committees which help students to make contact with local
residents and organisations. Similar conferences have come into being in other
large cities in Britain. These organisations also help by entertaining overseas
students and by providing hostels. In 1961 the British Government provided
£2 million for the Overseas Students Welfare Programme which is adminis¬
tered by the British Council; £2% million is being used to assist voluntary
organisations in providing an additional 3,400 residential places in hostels,
mainly for overseas students, and 2,000 of these places were already in use
in January 1965.
Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, a number of
scholarships are made available annually to United Kingdom students by the
Governments of other Commonwealth countries for study in their universities,
colleges and other institutions of higher learning. At present Commonwealth
Scholarships are being held by United Kingdom students in Australia,
Canada, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Rhodesia and Sierra Leone. In 19641116 Commonwealth Education Conference
introduced the Study and Serve Scheme, designed to enable British students
to undertake a year’s postgraduate study at universities in the developing
Commonwealth countries on condition that they also work for a year in
appropriate employment in the country concerned.
For many years the United States has offered awards for British students,
the best known being the Fulbright travel grants for postgraduate study at
American universities. Notable among recently established scholarships are
the Kennedy scholarships, to enable British students to study at three American
universities, and the Churchill travel scholarships, for men and women in all
walks of life. Students of British nationality are also offered scholarships
(mostly for one academic year) at institutions of higher education in 20
European countries, and in Brazil, Indonesia, Iran, Israel and Japan (see
footnote, p. 173).
Over 1,700 teachers left Britain in 1964-65 for posts in schools, teacher
training colleges, technical colleges and universities in other parts of the
Commonwealth, including 1,5°° who went to serve in the developing countries
of the Commonwealth. The number of British teachers recruited to serve in
these countries has trebled in three years. Steps taken by the Government
to encourage school teachers to serve for a period overseas have included the
establishment of a National Council for the Supply of Teachers Overseas and
the introduction of special measures to safeguard their interests both while
abroad and on their return home. Recruitment is carried out by the Ministry of
Overseas Development, the British Council and the voluntary teacher
recruiting agencies, such as the Catholic Overseas Appointments and the
Overseas Appointments Bureaux.
There are about 1,000 British university teachers serving overseas, most of
them recruited through the Inter-University Council on Higher Education,
the Association of Commonwealth Universities or the British Council.
Government encouragement also includes support for the work of the
Committee on University Secondment and the introduction, in 1964, of
Special Commonwealth Awards, which are made to leading scholars from
British universities who are willing to work for a minimum of two years in

important posts in the universities of developing Commonwealth countries.
Outside these schemes, an increasing number of volunteers are going over¬
seas for one or two years, a large number to teach. Many of them go with the
support of voluntary bodies (like Voluntary Services Overseas) which receive
some financial assistance from the Government.
Interchange schemes, under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for
a year with teachers overseas, include one with the United States and another
with Commonwealth countries, whereby each year over 100 British teachers
exchange posts with teachers from Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Official exchange schemes also operate between Britain and several European
countries both for teachers and for temporary assistants’ posts for language
specialists.
Britain provides, on request, assistance to the developing countries in several
other ways, including the loan of educational experts for technical and
consultant services and specialist missions, through various educational
organisations and the Ministry of Overseas Development. Financial assistance
is also given for building and equipping educational institutions; recent
examples include the £5 million grant for educational development in Nigeria
and the ^1 million grant for the University of Zambia.
YOUTH SERVICES
The object of youth services in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time
activities of young people under 21 years of age, and to offer them opportuni¬
ties—complementary to those of home, formal education and work—for
discovering and developing their personal resources, so that they may be
better equipped to be responsible members of the community. Membership
of youth organisations is voluntary and the facilities they offer are sufficiently
varied to appeal to every type of boy and girl. A recent trend has been the
active part taken by many youth clubs in helping old people and giving
service to their community.
Responsibility for youth services in Britain is shared by the education
departments, local education authorities, voluntary organisations and the
Churches. There is no attempt to impose uniformity or to create any national
youth organisation. A number of youth organisations have spontaneously
developed over the last century, mainly by voluntary effort. Government
encouragement in England and Wales dates from the 1930s. In 1939 the Youth
Service (as it is known in England and Wales) was created as a partnership
of voluntary organisations, local education authorities and central government.
The status of Youth Service as an essential part of the educational system of
Great Britain was confirmed by the Education Act of 1944 and the Education
(Scotland) Act of 1945; in Northern Ireland, youth welfare work was promoted
under the Physical Training and Recreation Act of 1938, and the Youth
Welfare, Physical Training and Recreation Act of 1962.
The education departments provide grants in aid of the administrative
and training work of national voluntary youth organisations, towards the
expense of training full-time youth leaders and towards the cost of premises
and equipment of youth clubs provided by voluntary bodies.
Local education authorities co-operate with voluntary organisations in
their areas: most give some financial help and lend premises and equipment;
most also employ youth organisers to help in the promotion and encourage-
176
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
ment of youth work. Where voluntary services are considered inadequate,
local authorities themselves organise youth centres and clubs. Most local
authorities have appointed youth committees on which official and voluntary
bodies are represented.
In addition to grants received from the State and local authorities, voluntary
organisations may receive help for special projects from charitable trusts,
notably from the King George’s Jubilee Trust (see p. 178)- The greater
part of the funds of the voluntary organisations is, however, raised by their
own efforts.
Since i960 developments in the Youth Service have been greatly influenced
by the recommendations of a committee set up to examine the service, under
the chairmanship of the Countess of Albemarle.1 On the advice of the Youth
Service Development Council, formed as a result of one of the committee’s
recommendations, the Department of Education and Science is making
larger grants towards the headquarters expenses of national voluntary youth
organisations and special grants for voluntary projects, some of which are
experimental; it has authorised a building programme for the period 1960-66
at an estimated cost of ^20-5 million and co-operated with a local education
authority in designing an experimental club; and, to supplement existing
facilities, has established a national training college at Leicester for youth
leaders. Local authorities’ contributions to the Youth Service have also
increased; their expenditure for 1965-66 is estimated at million. Progress
made in the Youth Service since the publication of the i960 report is being
considered by a committee of the Youth Service Development Council, of
which Lady Albemarle is chairman.
The Albemarle Committee’s inquiry extended only to England and Wales,
youth provision in Scotland having already been the subject of reports by
advisory bodies; but some of its main recommendations applied to Scotland,
while others reflected the existing Scottish position. A Standing Consultative
Council on Youth Service in Scotland, with functions similar to those of the
Youth Service Development Council for England and Wales, was set up by
the Secretary of State for Scotland in December 1959* ^ was reconstituted
in 1964 and given wider scope as the Standing Consultative Council on
Youth and Community Service. In 1963 permanent arrangements for training
in youth leadership for full-time youth leaders and organisers were made.
More money is being made available from central funds to national voluntary
organisations in Scotland and, as in England and Wales, increased expenditure
on youth services by Scottish education authorities (estimated at / i million
in 1965-66) is taken into account in calculating the Exchequer general grant.
A White Paper on the development of youth services was presented to the
Northern Ireland Parliament in 1961. This did not propose any change in
the general pattern of youth services but local education authorities were
urged to take a more active part in youth work than they had previously done.
Such changes as required statutory authority were given effect in the Youth
Welfare, Physical Training and Recreation Act (Northern Ireland) 1962.
The functions of the Youth Committee, set up in i944> were taken over by
the Youth and Sports Council and extended to reflect the larger part to be
played in youth welfare by the local education authorities and sports organisa¬
tions. Statutory provision was made for larger Ministry grants towards the
training costs and salaries of full-time youth leaders and for expenditure on
playing fields.

EDUCATION
177
The Voluntary The voluntary organisations vary greatly in character since nearly all of them
Organisations were formed to serve specific groups of young people, but most of them
provide educational and religious activities as well as social and recreational
pursuits for their members, and all of them seek to inculcate high ideals of
personal conduct and service to the community.
Twenty-seven national voluntary youth organisations with memberships
of at least 10,000 are constituent members of the Standing Conference of
National Voluntary Youth Organisations, a consultative body which, although
it takes action only in the name of its member bodies and with their consent,
represents their interests on a great number of committees. A further 25 bodies
are associate or observer members, for example, the Church of England
Youth Council, which represents about 272,000 young people who are
members of clubs sponsored by the Church of England. The corresponding
body in Scotland is the Scottish Standing Conference of Voluntary Youth
Organisations, in Northern Ireland the Standing Conference of Youth Organisa¬
tions, and in Wales the Standing Conference for Wales of Voluntary Youth
Organisations.
These major organisations have a total United Kingdom membership of
about 3 million young people under 21.
Among the youth organisations with a mainly religious origin and purpose
are the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) and Young Women’s
Christian Association (YWCA), with approximately 48,000 and 20,000
members under 21 respectively; the Boys’ Brigade (151,000), the Church
Lads’ Brigade (13,000), the Girls’ Life Brigade (63,000), the Girls’ Friendly
Society (20,000), Girls’ Guildry (28,000), the Methodist Association of
Youth Clubs (163,000), the Salvation Army Youth Organisations (106,000),
the Catholic Young Men’s Society of Great Britain (25,000), the
National Council for Catholic Youth Clubs (37,000), the Young Christian
Workers (17,000), the Grail (14,000), and the Association for Jewish Youth
(18,000).
The Boy Scouts Association and Girl Guides Association have world-wide
affiliations; they are undenominational and non-political, and were founded
by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 to develop character and good
citizenship in boys and girls. They have various sections, based on age
groups, but most of their members are under 16 years. Their total United
Kingdom membership under 21 is about 477,000 scouts and 552,000 guides.
The National Association of Boys’ Clubs, with nearly 2,000 affiliated clubs
and 155,000 members, and the National Association of Youth Clubs, with
over 3,000 affiliated clubs and 234,000 members, are concerned mainly with
the 14 to 20 age-group. Each affiliated club has its own rules, but all aim at
giving young people opportunities to develop into mature members of
society. Representatives from clubs form local committees and these send
representatives to the national members’ councils.
The Girls’ Venture Corps, with about 4,000 members, formed in 1964
from the Girls’ Training Corps and the Women’s Junior Air Corps, has an
Air Wing offering aviation courses. The pre-Service organisations for boys
(the Combined Cadet Force, Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air
Training Corps) combine social, educational and physical development with
training for possible entry into the armed forces; their combined membership
is about 141,500.
The National Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs in England and Wales
has about 40,000 members between 10 and 25 years old, the Scottish
Association of Young Farmers’ Clubs has about 7,500 and Northern Ireland

Young Farmer Clubs over 4,000 members: in addition to encouraging
interest in agriculture and appreciation of country life, the clubs provide
training in the arts of citizenship and develop ability to serve the community.
The Welsh League of Youth (Urdd Gobaith Cymru) has a membership
of about 43,000; its aim is the ‘development of Christian citizenship among
the youth of Wales’, and its work takes full account of the Welsh background
of its members.
The Youth Hostels Associations in England and Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have a network of hostels for walkers and cyclists, particu¬
larly intended for young people of limited means. They seek to promote
knowledge and love of the countryside, and are closely linked with each other
and with similar organisations in other countries.
Adult organisations with youth sections include the British Red Cross
Society, St. John Ambulance Brigade and the political parties.
King George's Jubilee Trust was established in 1935 by King George V, to
promote the welfare of the younger generation. The trust fund originally
consisted of the nation’s gift of approximately Ji million, subscribed to mark
the King’s silver jubilee but has since been augmented and at the end of
March 1964 stood at £ 1,520,844. Since its inauguration the Trust has disbursed
£1,556,844 to the headquarters of the principal voluntary youth organisations
and to many local projects, particularly those of an experimental nature.
In 1965 about 200,000 young people between the ages of 14 and 20 took
part in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which is a scheme operated by local
authorities, schools, youth organisations, industrial firms and other bodies,
and is designed as a challenge to boys and girls to reach certain standards of
achievement in three progressive stages in leisure-time activities. The scheme
for boys covers sections on public service, pursuits and interests, expeditions
and fitness. The scheme for girls is divided into sections on design for living,
interests, and adventure and service. A number of Commonwealth countries,
including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, now operate the scheme.
The Outward Bound Trust maintains in Great Britain five schools for boys
which offer 26-day character-building courses, based on adventure and
overcoming testing experiences. There is a similar school for girls, with
modified courses. About 5,000 boys and 850 girls take part each year. The
courses are mainly for boys and girls aged 16 to 19 years; but there are also
junior courses for boys and girls aged 14 to 16 and senior courses for young
people up to 25 years old, which are of particular value to potential teachers
and youth leaders.
The aims of the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the Scottish Council
of Physical Recreation and the National Playing Fields Association bring them
into touch with many youth organisations: their activities are described in
Chapter 19: Sport.
In addition to organisations on a nation-wide basis, there are a large
number of town, district or village social clubs run by voluntary groups for
general or particular purposes; photographic societies, folk dance, table
tennis or jazz clubs, for instance. In small communities social clubs may not
be specifically for young people but those with the more strenuous activities
(for example, tennis clubs) usually have a high proportion of young people
as members.

PLANNING AND
HOUSING
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and it is
essential to plan land use for a satisfactory national distribution of employment
and population, for agricultural development, to preserve the amenities of the
countryside, and to improve the places where people live and work.
From 1909 successive Acts of Parliament recognised the principle of the
planned use of land, but because the pattern of development over much of
the country had already hardened into large unplanned urban concentrations
the powers granted to planning authorities were inadequate for the task
in hand.
The twenty years between the two world wars were decades of rapid social
and industrial change and of developments in industry, engineering, house¬
building, and motor transport; the population was increasing and becoming
more mobile; there was a widespread demand for improved standards of
accommodation and consequently a greater need for systematic planning than
had hitherto been required. At the beginning of the nineteen-thirties a major
effort was made to strengthen planning law and to extend the planning powers
of central and local authorities. This resulted in the Town and Country
Planning Acts of 1932 which remained the basis of planning law for fifteen
years.
Although inter-war planning legislation improved sanitary and environ¬
mental conditions and did something to preserve amenities, its general effect
was unsatisfactory mainly because it failed to deal adequately with the problems
involved in compensating property owners who stood to lose by the intro¬
duction of positive planning schemes. Local authorities often hesitated to
exercise their powers effectively for fear of being involved in financial liabilities
beyond their means, and as a result there was still much unregulated urban
development and spoliation of the countryside.
Renewed efforts to tackle these problems were made immediately before
and during the second world war. Between 1937 and 1942 three expert com¬
mittees were appointed to study and report upon (1) the unregulated growth
and spread of industry, (2) the hampering of planning by the financial and
administrative difficulties of compensation and betterment and (3) the
encroachment of urban development upon the countryside. After the war
other committees studied the question of new towns and national parks.
Almost all the principal planning recommendations of these committees
have now been incorporated in Acts of Parliament, as follows: the New Towns
Acts 1946 to 1964; the Town and Country Planning Acts 1947 to 1963; the
Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Acts 1947 to 1963; the National
Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949; the Town Development
Act 1952; the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act 1957; the
Local Employment Acts i960 and 1963; and the Caravan Sites and Control of
Development Act i960. Town and country planning in Northern Ireland is
governed by the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland) 1931; the
i8o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Planning (Interim Development) Act (Northern Ireland) 1944; the Planning
Acts Amendment Act (Northern Ireland) 1944; and the Amenity Lands
Act (Northern Ireland) 1965.
Planning in The Town and Country Planning Act 1962 (which consolidated earlier
Great Britain planning legislation in England and Wales), and the Town and Country
Planning (Scotland) Act 1947, are the principal Acts that govern the pattern
of land use in Great Britain. They provide for the co-ordination of planning
by means of development plans drawn up by local planning authorities and
approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary
of State for Scotland; and they control development by making it subject,
generally, to the permission of a local planning authority or of a central
government department. They also give extensive powers to public authorities
to acquire and develop land for planning purposes, and deal with certain
questions of amenity, for instance, the preservation of buildings of special
historic or architectural interest, and of trees and woodlands, and the control
of advertisement display.
In September 1965 the Government published proposals for a major new
instrument of planning—a Land Commission—in a White Paper (Cmnd.
2771. is. ^d.), prior to the introduction of legislation being prepared by the
Minister of Land and Natural Resources. The Commission will have wide
powers to acquire, manage and dispose of land for development.
Development Plans Under the Town and Country Planning Acts 1947 local planning authorities
(in England and Wales, the councils of counties and county boroughs, the
London authorities and, in some areas, joint planning boards; and in Scotland,
councils of counties and of large burghs, and the councils of the two small
burghs of St. Andrews and Thurso) were required to prepare and submit
development plans covering the whole of their areas to the Minister of
Housing and Local Government and to the Secretary of State for Scotland
respectively. Each development plan includes maps and a written statement
describing the major projects in the plan and is accompanied by a report giving
the background to the plan in terms of existing land use, communications and
similar matters. Plans normally cover a period of about 20 years; they must be
reviewed at least once in every five years, and may be extended and altered at
any time so that they are kept up to date. Development plans for the whole of
Great Britain (except the remoter parts of Scotland) have now been submitted
to the appropriate ministers, and almost all have been approved.
Many local planning authorities have submitted amendments and additions
to their original plans and a number have completed their first five-yearly
reviews. Their proposals for changes in their development plans must be
advertised and the ministers concerned must consider objections and repre¬
sentations from the public. Usually a public local inquiry has to be held before
the proposals are decided. A development plan or its amendment can be
legally challenged only on the ground that it is ultra vires or that statutory
requirements have not been fulfilled, and such a challenge must be made to
the High Court within six weeks of publication of the approval or amendment
of the plan.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of the large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
special character of a town, the policy has been adopted of establishing ‘green
belts’ around all or part of certain urban areas. In addition to restricting
Green Belts

of Industry
New Towns
PLANNING AND HOUSING l8l
undesirable growth, these green belts serve to keep the townsman in reach
of the countryside. Within a green belt there is a general proscription against
any new development except for a limited amount of building in existing
villages, development to serve agriculture, and other special uses of land
appropriate to a rural area.
The Town and Country Planning Acts and the Local Employment Acts i960
and 1963, contain provisions relating to the location of industry and offices.
General problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number
of government departments, but the consent of the local planning authority
is, as a rule, required for any new industrial building, any extension of a
building or any change in the use of an existing building. The use of these
powers, together with the more positive powers of the Board of Trade to
inhibit the expansion of industry in some areas and encourage it in others,
has had a considerable effect on the location of industry; during the past
decade new smaller and more widely dispersed centres have grown up,
notably in southern England (see p. 260). Special control of office building
in and around London and in Birmingham was instituted under the Control
of Office and Industrial Development Act 1965.
The New Towns Act 1946 gave the Minister of Housing and Local
Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland power to make an
order designating any area of land (which may include any existing town
or other centre of population) as the site of a proposed new town, and in
1965 the same power was given to the Secretary of State for Wales. The
appropriate minister must consult the local authorities concerned on the
proposal and must be satisfied that it is in the national interest that the land
should be developed as a new town. Once the site has been designated, the
minister appoints a development corporation (consisting of a chairman, a
deputy chairman and up to seven other members) to be responsible for the
development of the new town. A master plan showing how the town is to be
built is then prepared, and this becomes the basis for development proposals,
each of which covers a part of the town. Each proposal is submitted to the
responsible minister, who must consult the local planning authority and,
together with the Treasury, be satisfied with the proposal on economic
grounds before giving approval.
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the
consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Secretary of
State for Wales or the Secretary of State for Scotland) to acquire, by agreement
or compulsory purchase, any land or property in the designated areas which
is necessary for their purposes, or, in certain circumstances, land adjacent
to or outside those areas, and they may provide houses, flats, commercial
and industrial premises, estate roads and other buildings or services essential
for the development of the towns. In England and Wales the Minister of
Housing and Local Government has made a special development order to
exempt the development corporations from having to obtain planning
permission from the local planning authorities; in Scotland the Secretary of
State has made a similar order in respect of Cumbernauld and Livingston
new towns.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced to the corporations
from public funds and is repayable over 60 years out of the income from the
property. The corporations submit annual reports (which include copies of
their audited accounts) to the Minister of Housing and Local Government,
102
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Secretary of State for Wales or to the Secretary of State for Scotland,
who lay them before Parliament.
As each new town in England and Wales is substantially completed the
development corporation is dissolved and, under the terms of the New
Towns Act 1959 its assets and liabilities are handed over to a central agency
 the Commission for New Towns. The Commission has assumed respon¬
sibility for Crawley and Kernel Hempstead and is preparing to do so for
Welwyn and Hatfield. It is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the
value of the land entrusted to it; but in discharging its functions it is required
to have regard to the purpose for which the towns were established, and to the
convenience and welfare of the people working and living in them. No new
towns central authority has been proposed for Scotland, where new town
development is at a less advanced stage.
Twenty-one new towns have been, or are being, established in Great Britain:
seventeen in England and Wales and four in Scotland. Eight of the new towns
in England and Wales (Basildon and Harlow in Essex; Kernel Hempstead,
Stevenage, Hatfield, and Welwyn in Hertfordshire; Crawley in Sussex; and
Bracknell in Berkshire) are designed to help in absorbing excess population
from the Greater London area; of the others, Corby in Northamptonshire,
Aycliffe, Peterlee and Washington in Durham, and Cwmbran in Monmouth¬
shire are to serve the special needs of their areas; Skelmersdale in Lancashire
and Runcorn in Cheshire are to meet the overspill needs of Liverpool; and
Dawley in Shropshire and Redditch in Worcestershire will take population
from Birmingham. Proposals have been announced for a new town in the
Leyland-Chorley area of Lancashire, to take population from Manchester,
for one in north Buckinghamshire, to provide housing for people from
London, and for one in mid-Wales. The Government has also proposed
expansion of Ipswich, Peterborough and Northampton and consideration is
being given to the desirability of using the machinery of the New Towns
Act for these schemes. The Scottish new towns (East Kilbride in Lanarkshire,
Glenrothes in Fife, Cumbernauld in Dunbartonshire and Livingston in
West Lothian) are helping to house people from Glasgow. Livingston is also
to be a focus for industrial activity in the central belt of Scotland. A further
new town is proposed, at Irvine.
New cities for the Southampton-Portsmouth, Bletchley, and Newbury-
Hungerford areas, to provide alternative centres of development to London,
are proposed in The South East Study (see p. 258). Other new towns are
suggested at Ashford, in Kent, and Stansted, in Essex.
In Northern Ireland it is planned to create a new city and to expand a
number of key towns (see p. 186).
The new towns represent a notable achievement in positive land use.
They are generally recognised as one of the most successful post-war experi¬
ments, both socially and industrially, and as a profitable long-term investment.
Many’thousands of people have moved into the new towns during the past
decade and to meet their needs an extensive building and civil engineering
programme has provided houses, flats, factories, schools, shops, roads, water
supplies and sewerage on a very large scale. Additional gas and electricity
supplies, more police, fire and bus stations, extra postal, telegraph and
telephone services and new health centres have also been provided and most
of the towns are well equipped with parks and playing fields of various
kinds.
All the more important public buildings (the town hall, the central post
office, the public library, the health centre, the college of further education

and the magistrates’ court) are situated in the town centres, where some of
the most recent planning ideas (notably the separation of the pedestrian
from the motorist) are being put into practice. A number of the more
developed towns are becoming regional centres and, as the populations grow
large enough to give the necessary support, full entertainment and recrea¬
tional facilities such as skating rinks, dance halls, bowling alleys, swimming
pools and sports stadiums are gradually being provided.
Under the New Towns Act 1946 Parliament approved a consolidated
fund of ^50 million to provide for advances to the development corporations
for work on the new towns. This fund was increased by subsequent Acts
and now stands at £550 million. A total of about £400 million had been
advanced to the corporations by March 1965.
The Town Development Act 1952 makes provision for the relief of con¬
gestion in large industrial towns in England and Wales by encouraging the
transfer of population and industry from these areas to places suitable for
expansion. Schemes have been approved for moving more than a quarter of
a million people and, so far, about 32,000 families have moved under
arrangements of this kind.
The Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act 1957 makes
similar provision for Scotland; agreements between Glasgow Corporation and
other authorities provide for the housing of over 15,000 Glasgow families
outside the city.
Redevelopment of outworn and obsolete areas is taking place in many
towns: Glasgow, for example, has started a programme of rebuilding 30 areas,
housing nearly a third of its population and accommodating much of the
industry and commerce of the city. Detailed proposals for four of these areas
have been approved and the work of clearance and rebuilding is well
advanced.
National Parks The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 provided that
and Access to selected areas of beautiful country in England and Wales should become
the Countryside national parks, where the characteristic landscape would be safeguarded and
facilities for open-air recreation provided or improved.
A National Parks Commission was set up by the Act and its work has
resulted in the establishment of ten national parks: the Peak District, the Lake
District, Snowdonia, Dartmoor, the Pembrokeshire coast, the North York
Moors, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and the Brecon
Beacons. These parks cover a total area of 5,254 square miles, almost one-
eleventh of the area of England and Wales. They have various forms of
administration, based on representation of the local planning authorities of
the areas in which they are situated, plus members nominated by the Minister
of Land and Natural Resources. These specially constituted authorities
control development in the parks (which are still in private ownership) and
take steps to preserve and enhance the natural beauty of the landscape and
to promote enjoyment of the area by the public. For instance, trees are
planted to screen blemishes on the landscape, unsightly structures are
removed, new building is made to harmonise with the natural surroundings,
advertisement displays are reduced, and car parks and camping and caravan
sites are provided in suitable localities, together with information centres to
help visitors. Government grants at the rate of 75 per cent are available for
certain measures designed to enhance natural beauty and improve recreational
facilities.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are no National Parks in Scotland but the Scottish National Parks
Working Party, set up to consider the five areas recommended as national
parks by the Scottish National Parks Survey Committee, submitted a report
on each of them. They are: Loch Lomond—Trossachs; Glen Affric—
Glen Cannich—Strath Farrar; Ben Nevis—Glen Coe—Black Mount; the
Cairngorms; and Loch Torridon—Loch Maree—Little Loch Broom. Close
supervision is being maintained over development in these areas by means
of Scottish National Parks Directions, which require the local planning
authorities concerned to refer proposed developments to the Secretary of
State for Scotland for consideration. Local planning authorities have recently
been asked to re-examine their areas and to define those of great landscape
value in their development plans.
The National Parks Commission also has power to designate areas in
England and Wales outside the national parks as ‘areas of outstanding natural
beauty’. Eighteen of these areas had been designated by April 1965; others
are under consideration. Government grants are also available for certain
measures designed to enhance the natural beauty of these areas.
Designation of a park or area of outstanding natural beauty does not
mean that the general public has right of access. Local planning authorities
must survey the extent to which land in all parts of England and Wales, as
well as in national parks and areas of outstanding beauty, is already open to
the public, and may increase it by means of agreements with owners or by
access orders. Government grants are available towards the cost of making
such agreements or orders and in the Peak District, particularly, large tracts
of moorland have been opened to the public in this way.
A survey of all footpaths and bridleways in England and Wales is being
made by local authorities as a comprehensive national record of public rights
of way; and in some areas existing footpaths and bridleways are being linked
to form long-distance routes, which will become continuous rights of way.
Responsibility for making proposals for long-distance routes, footpaths or
bridleways rests with the National Parks Commission; once the proposals are
approved by the Minister of Land and Natural Resources, it falls to the
local authorities to give effect to them. Ten routes—in all, nearly 1,300 miles
—had been approved by April 1965. Large stretches of these paths are
already public rights of way and the first long-distance footpath to be completed
(the Pennine Way, which stretches for some 250 miles) was opened in 1965.
The establishment of further routes is under discussion.
The Forestry Commission has formed, and opened to the public, seven
Forest Parks in some of the finest country in Britain: Argyll, Glen Trool,
Glen More, and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the Forest
of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and Wales;
Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park (adjoining the Northumber¬
land National Park to the westward), which includes forests on the borders
of Northumberland and Cumberland in England and of Roxburgh in
Scotland. The total area of the seven parks approaches half a million acres.
Camping facilities are provided in all the parks. .
The historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a Forest Park, is
also open to the public.
The responsibility for nature conservation rests with the Nature Conservancy,
which is a committee of the Natural Environment Research Council (see
p. 218). The Council derives its powers in this field from its royal charter and
the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, as amended by
PLANNING AND HOUSING
Preservation of
Amenities
185
the Science and Technology Act 1965. The object of conservation is to
influence soils, water, vegetation and animal life by means of research,
experiment and control. This entails the acquisition and management of a
representative series of reserves, as well as the establishment of laboratories
for use in long-term research schemes (see p. 219) and the making of
grants-in-aid for specified research.
The Nature Conservancy is responsible for m nature reserves in Great
Britain, with a combined area of 228,353 acres (by June 1965), of which
over 58,800 acres comprise the Cairngorms, the largest reserve in Britain
and one of the largest in Europe. Nine other areas (mostly in the north) are
managed by local authorities, using their powers under the National Parks
Act, in consultation with the Conservancy.
Twelve forest nature reserves have also been set up; of these, eight have
been created by agreement between the Forestry Commission and the
Nature Conservancy and consist of forest land managed under joint super¬
vision ; one is the result of a similar arrangement made with the Crown Estate
Commissioners; two derive from Forest Nature Reserve Agreements made
with the Duchy of Cornwall; and one from an agreement made with the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.
Responsibility for the preservation of the historic, scenic and architectural
beauties of Great Britain is vested mainly in the Minister of Housing and
Local Government, the Minister for Land and Natural Resources, the Secre¬
tary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of State for Wales, and the local
planning authorities. Lists of buildings of special architectural or historic
interest are being compiled and so far more than 110,000 buildings have been
listed. Local authorities have special powers to prevent the demolition
of such buildings and to control other works that would damage their
character. The Ministry of Public Building and Works is responsible for the
maintenance of royal parks and palaces, for the protection of ancient monu¬
ments (under the Ancient Monuments Acts), and for making grants (on the
recommendation of the appropriate Historic Buildings Council, see p. 230)
for the repair and maintenance of buildings of outstanding historic or
architectural interest or their contents and for the upkeep of adjoining land.
About 700 of the more important protected monuments in Britain are in the
care of the Ministry; and grants totalling over £5 million have been made
towards the cost of urgently needed repairs to over 1,000 historic buildings
in England, Scotland and Wales.
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts 1947 local planning
authorities have power [a) to protect trees and woodlands by means of tree
preservation orders (some 5,000 of which are in force throughout Great
Britain); (b) to prevent mineral workings becoming permanent eyesores by
attaching suitable conditions to planning permissions; and (c) to restrict or
regulate the display of advertisements in the interests of amenity or public
safety. Local authorities are also empowered, under the Clean Air Act 1956,
to declare ‘smoke control areas’, in which the emission of smoke from
chimneys constitutes an offence, and to make grants towards costs incurred
by owners and occupiers of premises in these areas in making the necessary
changes in their appliances.
Voluntary amenity societies, wholly dependent upon the support of their
members, include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England,
founded in 1926 to organise concerted action to secure the protection of rural
scenery and of town and country amenities from disfigurement or injury; the
i86

Association for the Preservation of Rural Scotland (founded in 1926) and
the Council for the Preservation of Rural Wales (founded in 1928); the
Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society, the Ramblers
Association; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, the Pilgrim
Trust; the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; and the National Trust for Scotland.
The National Trust for England, Wales and Northern Ireland (which was
founded in 1895 and now has some 155,000 members) is (apart from the Crown)
the largest land-owner in the United Kingdom. It has acquired, mainly
through gifts, over a thousand properties, which it holds for the enjoyment
of the public; it administers more than 320,000 acres of land of great natural
beauty; and it owns many fine gardens. The National Trust for Scotland,
an independent body, founded in 1931 to promote the preservation of places
of historic or architectural interest or of natural beauty in Scotland for the
benefit of the public, now has about 27,000 members and has under its care
over 60 properties, covering in all over 79,000 acres.
The Council for Nature (established in 1958) is a foundation of about 300
natural history societies and voluntary bodies concerned with nature con¬
servation and represents the interests of some 100,000 naturalists at public
inquiries on developments likely to threaten British flora and fauna. The
Council, which undertakes practical tasks of nature reserve management as
well as information work on all aspects of natural history in the British Isles,
receives grants from the Department of Education and Science, the British
Broadcasting Corporation and the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust.
Under the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland) 1931 local authori¬
ties are empowered to prepare planning schemes for their areas in order to
secure proper sanitary conditions, amenity and convenience in the laying out
and use of the land.
The planning provisions of the 1931 Act are permissive, but the Planning
(Interim Development) Act (Northern Ireland) 1944 brought under planning
control all land not subject to a scheme under the 1931 Act and empowered
local authorities to secure more effective control of development until planning
schemes came into operation. .... ■ c
Since 1944 progress has been made by the authorities in the preparation of
outline advisory plans. These plans indicate broadly the proposals for their
areas and provide a foundation for more detailed plans. They also facilitate
the control of development until planning schemes are completed.
Interim development control is exercised in accordance with the 1944 Act,
which requires that, where application is made to an authority for permission
to develop, the authority may grant the application conditionally or un¬
conditionally or may refuse it altogether. In the event of a refusal or
conditional approval, the applicant may appeal to the Ministry of Development
for Northern Ireland (the department primarily responsible). .
Planning in Northern Ireland has entered a new phase in recent years with
the publication of the Belfast Regional Survey and Plan, m April 1964, and
the Report on Economic Development in Northern Ireland, in February 1905.
These reports have led to a greater emphasis on regional planning in Northern
Ireland and their general thesis of preserving and enhancing Northern
Ireland’s physical environment has been accepted by the Government.
The Government and local authorities are co-operating in limiting the
growth of the Belfast urban area and plans are being prepared for a new city
linking the two boroughs of Lurgan and Portadown in County Armag .

Plans are also being prepared for the expansion of a number of other key
towns including Antrim, Ballymena and Newry. The New Towns (Northern
Ireland) Bill 1965 provides the machinery for the development of new towns
and the expansion of existing ones.
A White Paper, The Administration of Town and Country Planning in
Northern Ireland, published in 1964, contains proposals for a central planning
authority responsible for the overall planning of Northern Ireland which
would work with a number of local development committees in the detailed
planning of each area.
The Amenity Lands Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 enables the Ministry of
Development to acquire or control areas of natural beauty or amenity; to
designate National Parks; to create nature reserves; to provide facilities for
visitors to such areas; to put areas of outstanding natural beauty or of scientific
interest under a special form of planning control; and to secure the clearing
of derelict sites in rural areas.
The Ministry of Development co-operates with the Ministry of Commerce
in the selection of industrial sites in order to secure the best possible use of
the land and to facilitate the efficient provision of housing and other services
in connection with industrial development (see p. 271).
Northern Ireland’s first forest park at Tollymore Park, Newcastle, County
Down, was opened to the public in 1955. Situated at the foot of the Mountains
of Mourne, it covers an area of 1,200 acres. It contains an arboretum com¬
prising a wide variety of native and exotic trees, and an exhibition of natural
history, and is rich in mountain, river and parkland scenery. Caravan facilities
and a camping site for youth organisations are available.
HOUSING
Between 1945 and March 1965 over 5 million new houses and flats were
built. Today, the numbers of dwellings and households are roughly equal.
Despite this achievement much still remains to be done before all the housing
problems facing the country are solved. The major problems are: a shortage
of housing resulting from the increase in population, the even more rapidly
increasing number of households, and rising living standards; the modernisa¬
tion of 4 million structurally sound old houses that lack amenities now
considered essential; and the many slum houses remaining to be cleared in
the large cities, a legacy of the nineteenth century, when a mass of poor
quality houses was put up in industrial areas.
Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in
England, by the Secretaries of State in Scotland and Wales and the Minister
of Development in Northern Ireland. To help in dealing with long-term
problems of land for housing, industry, agriculture and transport, the Ministry
of Housing and Local Government is undertaking regional surveys of popula¬
tion trends and future needs for land as a basis for regional plans covering
development over a period of twenty years. The plans will be revised at least
every ten years.
The actual provision of housing accommodation in any area is the concern
of the local authority. In England and Wales and Northern Ireland the local
housing authorities are the councils of county boroughs, boroughs, urban
districts and rural districts, the Greater London Council, the London
188

borough councils and the Common Council of the City of London. In
Scotland all town and county councils are housing authorities.
There are 17! million dwellings in Britain: 15^ million in England and
Wales, 1,690,000 in Scotland and about 404,000 in Northern Ireland. About
one house in four is owned by public authorities (in Scotland the figure is
almost one in two), more than one in three are in owner occupation and
most of the remainder (mainly older houses) are rented from private landlords.
Today one family in four lives in a post-war dwelling.
Private enterprise is now responsible for over half the housing being built
in Britain (some 224,000 of a total of 383,000 dwellings built in 1964); the
rest is built by local authorities, new towns development corporations, the
Scottish Special Housing Association Ltd., the Northern Ireland Housing
Trust1 and certain government departments (for housing families of the
armed forces or other services). Local authority housing is normally built for
letting; privately sponsored dwellings for owner-occupation. The Govern¬
ment is encouraging the highest possible rate of house-building, particularly
by local authorities and housing associations, which are non-profit-making
bodies providing houses for letting rather than for sale; it is also encouraging
the co-ownership of groups of new dwellings by their occupants (see p. 190).
Most of the new dwellings in Britain are houses (usually of two storeys);
the remainder are flats or maisonettes, mostly in blocks of from 2 to 20
storeys, although a few blocks may be higher. High blocks are generally
built in central urban areas where they replace old, overcrowded dwellings.
In the new towns and on new housing estates they provide focal points and
help planners to achieve higher densities of population per acre, where
desirable, while still providing open spaces.
Accommodation in a house designed for a family of four or five people
includes one or two living rooms, a kitchen, a store, a bathroom and a water
closet and two or three bedrooms. A typical 3-bedroom house built by a local
authority in England and Wales in 1964 had a superficial area of about 920
square feet and cost £2,303 to build.
Nearly 58 per cent of houses and flats built since 1945 have been built by local
authorities (that is, generally, by private builders under contract to the
authorities). Local authorities are responsible for seeing that adequate
standards are maintained in all newly built houses, for slum clearance and
for ensuring that, as far as possible, housing conditions are satisfactory in
their areas. In their building programmes they are being encouraged to use
systems of industrialised housing, with standardised components. These
offer the advantages of very rapid construction on the site, greater independence
of weather conditions, and the use of fewer skilled workers than traditional
building methods require, an important factor in areas where there is a shortage
of skilled building labour. Control of building standards is the responsibility
of the central departments, which issue manuals of guidance on design and
layout for different types of houses and flats provided by local authorities.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government has set up offices in
Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Birmingham, Leeds, Bristol and Notting¬
ham to advise local authorities on methods of increasing their rate of house
1 The Scottish Special Housing Association, a statutory body, was established in 1937
to erect houses for letting to supplement building by local authorities. It now owns
about 58,000 houses. The Northern Ireland Housing Trust was set up in 1945 for a
similar purpose. It has built about a quarter of Northern Ireland’s post-war houses.
PLANNING AND HOUSING 189
building and slum clearance. As the slums are dealt with, attention is being paid
to the renewal of the decaying areas in towns and the demolition or improve¬
ment of the 4 million old houses remaining, many of which are obsolescent.
For many years local authorities have provided an increasing number of
smaller dwellings for old people—mainly one-bedroom bungalows or flats.
In 1964 they built nearly 33,000 in England and Wales, over a quarter of
their total house-building. They have also built flatlets for frail or infirm
old people who can lead independent lives with some help: the flatlets
normally consist of small blocks of centrally heated bed-sitting rooms with
kitchens and lavatories; other rooms such as bathrooms, laundry and large
lounges are shared and the residents relieved of the work of keeping them
clean. A resident warden helps the old people with jobs they cannot manage
single-handed and is on call in emergencies.
In selecting tenants for council dwellings local authorities give preference
to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory conditions. Rents are low,
particularly in Scotland, in comparison with privately owned housing, with
the result that most authorities have a deficit on their housing account that
is made good from other income. In order to avoid subsidising council-house
tenants who can afford to pay an economic rent, about two-fifths of the
councils operate rent-rebate schemes, under which the general level of rents
is high enough to cover housing costs, and rebates are given to tenants with
low incomes.
Research and Research into building techniques and into new methods of house construction,
Development as well as into the needs of families, is carried out by the Urban Development
Groups of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and of the
Scottish Development Department, the Building Research Station, the
architects’ departments of major local authorities and the research groups in
big constructional firms. All government building research and development
is co-ordinated by the Directorate of Research and Development at the
Ministry of Public Building and Works. In 1964 the Ministry set up the
National Building Agency to help in speeding up the rate of public and
private building by giving technical advice.
Slum Clearance Of the estimated slum dwellings in Britain in 1955—about one million—some
three-fifths had been cleared by 1965. It is expected that in about ten years’
time the great majority of the 1,700 housing authorities in Great Britain
will have succeeded in getting rid of all their present slums. In certain
areas, however, particularly the older industrial towns, including Birmingham,
Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester, four of the biggest cities in the country,
the proportion of unfit houses is so high that clearance will take much longer.
To help in those areas of Britain where the number of slum houses is so
large that it would not be practicable to replace all of them within the next
few years, local authorities can acquire houses unfit for human habitation
and ‘patch’ them in order that they may provide passable accommodation
pending their demolition. The intention is that these houses should be
demolished as soon as possible: the temporary repairs are not intended
as an alternative to slum clearance. Exchequer contributions are available to
meet part of the costs of acquisition and essential repairs.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists,
or can be provided by them, for people displaced from slum clearance areas.
Where an unfit house is demolished by order of the local authority and the
owner retains his land, he normally receives no compensation. If the local
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
authorities acquire an unfit property in order to demolish it themselves
and to rebuild on the land, the normal basis of compensation is the market
value of the house as it stands or the value of the site after clearance, which¬
ever is the less. In England and Wales, however, owner-occupiers who bought
between 1939 and 1955 at present receive full compensation for their loss
regardless of whether the sites of their houses are being acquired by the
authority or not; similar terms apply to business occupiers. In England,
Wales and Scotland the slum clearance code provides for special payments
for condemned houses which have been well maintained although inherently
unfit and business occupiers may receive hardship payments in certain cases.
In Northern Ireland provision is made for payments to owner-occupiers,
business occupiers and for good maintenance of older houses.

Housing Subsidies
and Improvement
Grants
The initial capital cost of houses built by or for local authorities is met by
raising loans; current expenditure, including loan repayment and interest on
loans, is met from rents supplemented by subsidies from the Exchequer and,
in many cases, from the rates. Local authorities may raise loans for housing
either in the open market or by borrowing from the Public Works Loan
Board (see p. 76). In Northern Ireland local authorities, the Housing Trust
and housing associations may borrow from the Government Loans Fund.
Loans to enable people to buy their houses by a system of instalment
purchase are available from various sources, including building societies,
insurance companies, industrial and provident societies and local authorities.
Building societies, of which there are about 730, are the most important
of these agencies. They do not build houses themselves but provide long-term
loans on the security of property bought for owner-occupation. Most societies
are now prepared to make advances of up to 95 per cent of the value of the
houses. Loans are usually repayable over periods of up to 25 or even 30 years,
by equal monthly instalments to cover capital and interest. The societies’
funds are derived mainly from investment of relatively modest sums by the
general public.
Many local authorities operate a scheme whereby, for a house costing up
to ^2,500, they guarantee part of the loan made by a building society so that
an advance greater than normal may be made to the purchaser. The Exchequer
undertakes to share any liability local authorities may incur under this scheme.
Local authorities also have power to make loans under the Housing Acts for the
acquisition, conversion, improvement, repair and alteration of houses. Under
the House Purchase and Housing Act 1959 ^ey maY rnake loans of up to
100 per cent of the house’s value.
The Housing Act 1961 authorised Exchequer loans to approved non-profit-
making housing associations for the building of houses to let at unsubsidised
rents. This provision was increased and extended by the Housing Act 1964
under which a Housing Corporation was set up to stimulate the formation of
housing societies. Building societies advance to a housing society two-thirds
of the cost of each approved housing scheme, the Corporation providing the
remaining third. The housing societies build dwellings either to let at
unsubsidised rents or for co-ownership by a group of occupants. Co-ownership
gives the occupants most of the advantages of house ownership at a lower
cost. The Corporation also has power to buy land for the housing societies.
Housing subsidies, at varying rates and for varying purposes, have been
provided in Britain since 1919, when they were first introduced to facilitate
the building of houses for letting at moderate rents.
PLANNING AND HOUSING
I9I
In recent years various systems of subsidy have been introduced under
successive Housing Acts. The present subsidies in England and Wales
provide for a flexible system whereby all local authority dwellings approved
by the Minister of Housing and Local Government receive a subsidy, the
amount of it depending on the financial need of the housing authority.
Authorities with inadequate resources receive a basic subsidy of £24 a year
for 60 years for each house built, which may be increased in stages to £40 for
authorities with particularly low reserves. For other authorities the basic
rate is £8. Additional subsidies exist for high flats, expensive sites, precautions
against mining subsidence and building in certain materials. Special subsidies
exist for dwellings provided for overspill (£28) and to meet the urgent
needs of industry (£24). These provisions enable authorities to build where
need exists and help to ensure that Exchequer assistance is available chiefly
for those authorities in most need of help.
Private owners in England and Wales can obtain Exchequer assistance for
the improvement of houses built before 1945 or conversion of large houses
or other buildings for housing. Cash grants may be made by local authorities,
with Exchequer assistance, to people converting or improving existing
buildings for housing at a cost of over £100 per dwelling. The grants may
amount to half the cost, with a maximum grant of £400 for each dwelling.
There are certain technical conditions which the dwellings as improved or
converted must fulfil, to ensure that public money is spent only on property
that will provide satisfactory accommodation for a sufficiently long period.
Grants for similar work in houses owned by local authorities may also be
paid by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, but on an annual
basis over 20 years. In either case, the payment of grant is at the discretion
of the local authority or the Minister, as the case may be.
Local authorities are, however, obliged to make grants called ‘standard
grants’, for the provision in houses built before 1945 of a bath, wash basin,
water closet, hot-water supply and food store; these cash grants cover half the
cost of the work, subject, normally, to a maximum grant of ^155, or smaller
sums if some of the five items already exist. Grant for the provision of the
last three facilities may be made where further improvement is not practicable.
Similarly the Minister is obliged to make standard grants to local authorities,
but again on an annual basis over 20 years. The Acts under which these
improvement grants are available are the Housing (Financial Provisions)
Act 1958, the House Purchase and Housing Act 1959, and the Housing Acts
1961 and 1964. From 1949 to March 1965 nearly 883,000 grants had been
made.
Building subsidies, improvement grants and standard grants are also
provided in Scotland and Northern Ireland; the amounts of subsidy are
generally higher owing to different circumstances. In Scotland the Housing
(Scotland) Act 1962 provides for subsidies according to a local authority’s
financial needs. The basic subsidy is ^32 per house, which may be increased
by stages up to £56 (depending on their financial position) for authorities with
inadequate resources and £12 per house for other authorities. There are
higher rates of subsidy for housing for special purposes (such as overspill,
multi-storey development, agricultural workers). Grants are also available to
local authorities and private owners for the improvement or conversion of
existing properties, and to private owners for the provision of new houses for
farm workers. In Northern Ireland annual subsidies are paid to local authori¬
ties, the Northern Ireland Housing Trust and housing associations. Grants
for improvements and conversions are payable both to public authorities and
192

private persons. In addition, ‘lump sum’ subsidies are paid to private persons
who build houses for letting or for owner-occupation. Grants are available for
the provision of new houses and for the reconditioning of existing premises to
accommodate farmers and approved workers.
The average annual cost of housing subsidies in Britain has been over
£100 million since 1954, some three-quarters of the total being paid by the
Exchequer and about a quarter by local authorities.
Rent control, originally introduced in 1915 and intended as a temporary
war-time measure, was retained by successive Acts until 1957* During this
period nearly all privately owned houses let unfurnished were subject to a
system of rent control which gave the tenant a fixed rent and security of tenure.
The Rent Act 1957 released from rent control all dwellings with a rateable
value over £40 in the London Metropolitan Police District and in Scotland
and over ^30 elsewhere; it freed from control all new lettings, whatever the
rateable value of the property. A reversal of policy was embodied in the
Rent Bill 1965. Broadly, the Bill’s proposals were for a new system of rent
regulation which would cover all privately rented unfurnished property except
the most expensive. Rents would be determined by locally appointed rent
officers or, failing agreement between the officer, landlord and tenant, by
independent rent assessment committees appointed by the minister concerned.
Once determined, the rent would not normally be reviewed for at least three
years. For furnished premises the existing system, under which a tenant may
go to a rent tribunal for determination of a reasonable rent, would apply over
a much wider range of property than previously and tenants would be given
greater security of tenure. Eviction without a court order would be made
unlawful and harassment of occupiers would become a criminal offence with
severe penalties.
Measures of control and de-control also apply in Northern Ireland. In 1951
legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases in the rent of
controlled houses, provided that they were maintained in good repair; and
the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Rent Restriction Law (Amend¬
ment) Act (Northern Ireland) 1956 permitted an increase of one-third in the
rent levels fixed by the 1951 Act where the landlord had recently incurred
expenditure of a certain amount on repairs. The 1956 Act also released from
control houses with a net annual value of over £50 (with certain safeguards)
and houses with a net annual value of over £26 of which the landlord was in
actual possession when the Act came into force, or of which he subsequently
obtained possession.

The Church of
England
THE CHURCHES
Every person living in Britain possesses the right of religious freedom as
described in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: he
may change his religion at will, and may manifest his faith in teaching,
worship and observance without interference from the community or the
State. Churches and religious societies of all kinds may own property, conduct
schools, and propagate their beliefs in speech and in writing.
Freedom of conscience in religious matters was achieved gradually from
the seventeenth century onwards; in many cases relaxation in the adminis¬
tration of laws discriminating against minority religious groups preceded the
repeal of the legislation concerned. Heresy ceased to be a civil offence with
the passing of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677, and the Toleration
Act of 1688 granted freedom of worship to Protestant dissenters. In 1828
the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts freed nonconformists from
political disabilities and made it possible for them to be appointed to public
offices; Roman Catholics gained political emancipation under the Roman
Catholic Relief Act 1829; the Jewish Relief Act 1858 enabled Jews to become
members of Parliament; while religious tests that had been imposed on
prospective students and members of the academic staff of the universities
of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham were successively abolished by Acts of
1854, and 1871. Nowadays, there is no religious or denominational bar
to the holding of public office, except that the Lord Chancellor may not be
a Roman Catholic.
In the services administered by the State, such as the armed forces, the
national hospitals and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of
England or the Church of Scotland provide the principal ministrations and
are paid a salary by the State for this part of their work. Priests of the Roman
Catholic Church and ministers of other denominations may also be appointed
or specially called in as required. Voluntary schools (see p. 156) provided by
churches of any religious denomination may be wholly or partly maintained
from public funds.
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number
of adherents to the various churches in the United Kingdom, since no inquiries
are made about religious beliefs in population censuses or other official
returns, and each church adopts different criteria in counting its members.
The membership figures given in the following sections should therefore be
taken as approximate.
The Church of England is the Established Church, and claims to be the
ancient catholic church of the land. At the Reformation in the sixteenth
century, it repudiated the supremacy of the Pope, but retained the historic
episcopate, and the creeds and sacraments upon which its doctrines are based;
therefore it claims to be both ‘catholic’ and ‘reformed’. Its form of worship
is embodied in the Book of Common Prayer, which was first compiled in 1549.
The Church is uniquely related to the Crown in that the Sovereign, who
must be a member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the
Faith’ (a statutory title as protector of the Church) and promises on his or
194
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Church

her accession to uphold it. The coronation of the Sovereign is performed by
the Archbishop of Canterbury; prayers for the Sovereign and other members
of the royal family are said in all the statutory services of the Church; Church
of England archbishops, bishops and other senior ecclesiastical dignitaries,
as well as incumbents of Crown livings, are appointed by the Sovereign on
the advice of the Prime Minister1; and all clergymen take the oath of
allegiance to the Crown.
The Church is also linked with the State through the House of Lords,
in which the archbishops of Canterbury and York and twenty-four senior
diocesan bishops have seats (see p. 33)* This makes it possible for the views of
the Church leaders to be expressed freely on any moral issue raised in
connection with the corporate conduct of the State as well as on specifically
ecclesiastical issues—a matter of particular significance in view of the fact
that the clergy of the Church of England (together with those of the Church
of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church) are
legally disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons.
The Church is not free to change its form of worship, as laid down in the
Book of Common Prayer, without the consent of Parliament2; canons (Church
rules) cannot be made or amended without the consent of the Queen, and
the measures of the Church Assembly (as distinct from its regulations) also
require the Royal Assent.
The Church of England is organised by geographical areas into two provinces
and 43 dioceses. The Province of Canterbury contains 29 dioceses and that
of York 14. Each diocese is subdivided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which
there are about 14,500 in all. The Archbishop of Canterbury is Primate of
All England and bishop of his own diocese of Canterbury; the Archbishop of
York is styled Primate of England and is bishop of his own diocese of York.
The baptised membership of the Church is about 27 million, i.e. two-thirds
of the population born and resident in the two provinces.
Spiritual authority in the Church rests with the bishops. The authoritative
bodies in matters of doctrine, belief and practice are the Convocations of
Canterbury and York, each presided over by its archbishop, and consisting
of an upper house of bishops, and a lower house of representatives of each
cathedral chapter, archdeacons and elected clergy. The Convocations meet
not oftener than three times a year.
The legislative and central administrative body of the Church is the
National Assembly of the Church of England, which is commonly called the
Church Assembly. It was set up in 1919 at the request of the two Convocations,
and was given power to legislate by measure by the Church of England
Assembly (Powers) Act of 19 tQ" ^ ^a11 discuss any matter connected with
the Church of England, but may not make any doctrinal statements, nor
infringe upon the rights of the Convocations. It consists of three houses,
bishops, clergy and laity. The first two houses are composed of the members
of the Convocations; the house of laity consists of men and women elected
every five years by the lay members of diocesan conferences, and the con¬
stitution allows for ten co-opted members.
The Church Assembly usually meets three times a year. Measures, after
1 A committee has been set up to discuss with the Government’s legal advisers the form
of necessary legislation about Crown appointments, with power to prepare any measure
thought desirable. . .
2 A measure (Prayer Book (Alternative and Other Services) Measure 1965) permitting
limited revision of the Prayer Book and changes in the form of worship has received the
Royal Assent and the process of revision will shortly begin.

passing through various stages in the assembly, are presented to an ecclesias¬
tical committee of both Houses of Parliament, consisting of 30 members,
of whom 15 are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and 15 by the Speaker
of the House of Commons. This committee lays the measures, together with
a report upon them, before both Houses. If both Houses so resolve, the
measure is sent to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, after which it has the
same force and effect as an Act of Parliament. Parliament, though it may
reject a measure, has no power to amend it.
The Church Assembly is the centre of an administrative system consisting
of boards and councils dealing with various aspects of the Church’s work,
such as education, recruitment and training for the ministry,1 and Church work
at home and overseas. The Church Assembly, through the Schools Council
of its Board of Education, is responsible for some 7,200 Church of England
schools of all types, for approximately half of wdiich the Church bears a
quarter of the cost of improvements, alterations and repairs.
Parochial church councils were set up in 1921 to associate the laity with
the government of the Church in the parish. The members of these councils
are appointed by the parochial electors, i.e. persons who are baptised, are
not members of any other church, are 17 years of age and over, and have
applied for membership of the electoral roll of the parish where they habitually
reside or worship. The estimated number on the parish electoral rolls is
about 2f million.
The Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts. Their jurisdiction
today consists largely of faculty cases, with very occasional cases of discipline
against clergy, either for moral or ecclesiastical offences. A faculty is necessary
for any specific alteration or addition to the fabric or ornaments of a church
or to a churchyard.
There are 25 Church colleges of education in England and two in Wales,
all of which are run by independent governing bodies. With substantial
grants from the Department of Education and Science a major programme of
expansion, including the opening of two new colleges, has taken place during
the last few years; this has raised the total number of students in the colleges
to about 12,000. The cost to the Church, mainly from funds provided by the
Church Assembly, has been about £3 million.
The Church Assembly has also nearly completed a programme of modern¬
isation and improvements of theological colleges (of which there are 26) and
establishments for the training of women in the pastoral work of the Church,
and has provided grants for the greater part of the cost.
Each parish is responsible for its own finances, and also contributes an
annual apportioned quota to diocesan funds, and each diocese similarly
contributes to the Church Assembly. In the diocese, the financial authority
is the diocesan board of finance, which administers the money contributed
by the parishes, and acts as trustee on behalf of the parochial church councils,
which have only limited powers of holding property. The Central Board of
Finance administers the Church Assembly Fund, supported by diocesan
contributions, and devoted to the maintenance of central services, including
capital expenditure on training colleges and theological colleges and the
grants for training candidates for ordination.2
1 A commission, consisting of not more than 20 members (bishops, clergy and laity) has
been appointed to study what reforms are necessary in the deployment and payment of
the clergy.
2 A small standing body has been set up by the archbishops to bring the needs and
resources of the Church of England under continuous review.

The State makes no payment direct to the Church as such, though it
pays for the services of chaplains in the armed forces and in prisons and
hospitals, and contributes substantially to the maintenance of Church schools
and training colleges.
The endowment income of the Church is mainly administered by the
Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for the payment of
clergy stipends and the provision of finance for pensions, new churches,
parsonage houses and, to a small extent, church schools. The total net income
from the Commissioners’ investments (nearly £18 million in 1964) has
greatly increased during the past ten years; in broad terms, this has meant
a rise in the stipends of the poorer clergy and that the Commissioners have
been able to embark on schemes of assistance for providing better parsonage
houses, for church buildings in new areas of population, and for better
pensions for clergy and their widows.
The Anglican Communion comprises 19 autonomous churches in the United
Kingdom and overseas, with a total membership of over 40 million.
In the British Isles, in addition to the established Church of England,
there are unestablished Anglican Churches in Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
the Church of Ireland has 14 dioceses; the Episcopal Church in Scotland,
7 dioceses and some 98,000 members; and the Church in Wales, 6 dioceses
and some 200,000 Easter communicants.
The Lambeth Conference for unofficial consultation between all Anglican
bishops meets every ten years; it is presided over by the Archbishop of
Canterbury. The conference has no executive authority, but enjoys great
moral prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other
communions, and on the attitude of the Anglican churches to political and
social questions are widely studied.
An executive officer of the Anglican Communion is the secretary of the
Anglican Advisory Council on Missionary Strategy, and exercises general
supervision on behalf of the consultative body of the Lambeth Conference
over all matters affecting the welfare of the Anglican Communion which
call for attention between the meetings of the conference.
The established church in Scotland is the presbyterian Church of Scotland.
It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church which is established
and yet is free’. Its position, defined in the Treaty of Union 1707, was
further safeguarded by the Church of Scotland Act 1921, under which it
has complete internal self-government within the terms of the schedule to
the Act, ‘Articles Declaratory of the Faith of the Church of Scotland’.
Whereas in episcopacy church government is a hierarchy of persons, in
presbyterianism there is a hierarchy of courts. All ministers are of equal
status, and each of the 2,027 churches is governed locally by the Kirk Session,
consisting of the minister and elected elders (of whom there are nearly
48,000); above this is the Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of the
Synod, and finally the General Assembly, which meets annually and consists
of elected ministers and elders presided over by an elected Moderator who
serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at the General Assembly
by the Lord High Commissioner. The Church of Scotland has complete
freedom in all spiritual matters and the right to appoint its own officers and
to decide all matters of doctrine and discipline. Its decisions are not subject
to parliamentary debate or modification.
The training for the ministry, which lasts at least six years, has given the

Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The membership of the Church of Scotland
is estimated at about 1,260,000.
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is now commonly used to describe those churches
in England which were more generally known in the past as ‘nonconformist’
churches; and protestant churches in Scotland (except the established
Church of Scotland), Wales and Northern Ireland. The main Free Churches
are the Methodist, Baptist and Congregational Churches, and the unestablished
presbyterian churches throughout Britain. In addition, there are a number
of other protestant denominations in the United Kingdom as well as such
religious associations as the Society of Friends and the Salvation Army,
which have certain links with the main Free Churches.
The word ‘nonconformist’ signifies dissent from certain of the formularies
and practices of the established church. In general, the Free Churches base
their reason for existence on their distinctive convictions regarding organisation
and worship.
The largest of the Free Churches, the Methodist Church, which originated
in the eighteenth century following the evangelical revival by John Wesley,
took its present form in 1932, with the union of the majority of separate
Methodist Churches. It has over 710,800 adult full members. The supreme
authority is the annual conference and the system of government is in many
ways presbyterian, the leaders’ meeting corresponding to the kirk sessions,
with circuit meetings and district synods resembling presbytery and synod.
One of the characteristics of Methodism is its strong emphasis on lay
leadership. There are some 21,600 trained lay preachers sharing the work of
4,200 ministers and preaching in many local churches.
Methodist Churches which did not join the union in 1932 include: the
Independent Methodists, in which ministerial service is on a purely voluntary
basis and women (many of whom are ministers) have full equality with men;
and the Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 5,600 members) which, while
retaining the essential Methodist doctrine, gives autonomy to each of its
157 individual churches.
The Congregational
and Baptist
Churches
The Unestablished
Presbyterian
Churches
The Congregationalists are the oldest community of dissenters in Britain.
In 1831 most of their churches were formed into the Congregational Union.
Local churches have formed county and national unions, whose secretariat
and assemblies have much influence, but no compulsive authority over them,
since great importance is attached to the autonomy of local church meetings.
Adult membership is approximately 202,300.
Like the Congregationalists, the Baptists are for the most part grouped
in associations of churches and the majority of these belong to the Baptist
Union formed in 1813. Baptists differ from Congregationalists in that they
practise the baptism of believers only; they do not baptise infants. The
Baptist churches have about 300,900 members.
The Presbyterian Church in Ireland has a membership in Northern Ireland
of 140,400. The Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales,
which arose from the revivalist movement led by Howell Harris in 1735,
numbers some 127,000. The Presbyterian Church of England has nearly
69,900 members; its highest court is its general assembly; women are
admitted to the eldership and ministry.
Other presbyterian churches in Britain include: the Free Church of
Scotland; the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church
Ig8 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed
Presbyterian Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian
Church of Ireland.
Other Among other Protestant denominations in the United Kingdom are: the
Denominations Unitarian and Free Christian Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also
in the United States of America as Disciples of Christ), which have been an
organised community in Britain since early in the nineteenth century; the
British Province of the Moravian Church, which is an international missionary
Church; the Free Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which
was formed in 1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; the Society
of Friends; and the Salvation Army.
The Society of Friends, or Quakers, came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox. A distinctive feature
is the way of worship: outward sacraments are not observed and there is no
separate ministry. Friends place great emphasis on work for peace, and their
influence in many parts of the world, especially in social reform and in the
relief of suffering, is very wide in relation to their numbers. There are 440
Quaker Meetings in Britain and over 21,000 members; and the Society has
nine schools (the pupils and staff of which are not exclusively Quaker).
The Salvation Army, founded in 1865 (as the Christian Mission), is a
religious movement, composed of men and women who seek the spiritual
and social betterment of their fellows, primarily by preaching the gospel to
those hitherto untouched by religious effort. The movement, in which
military rather than ecclesiastical terminology is used, has branches all o\er
the world, and its social work (particularly that connected with the welfare of
members of the British armed forces serving overseas) is well supported.
The Christian Scientists, who are in no way connected with any other
church, have about 330 branch churches and societies in Britain.
The Roman The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became
Catholic Church temporarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850, the
Scottish hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was
restored in 1878, while the Irish hierarchy never became completely extinct.
The normal government of the Roman Catholic Church, namely by territorial
archbishops and bishops, is once again the rule in the whole of the United
Kingdom.
The central territorial unit of the Roman Catholic hierarchical organisation
is the province or archdiocese under the metropolitan, who is always an
archbishop. The chairman of the bench of bishops in England and Wales is
the Archbishop of Westminster. A province normally comprises several
dioceses, each under a bishop aided by a chapter of canons and others, and
by priests in charge of the parishes into which the diocese is subdivided. In
England and Wales there are five provinces and archdioceses (Westminster,
Liverpool, Birmingham, Cardiff and Southwark), 14 dioceses, and nearly
2,300 parishes; in Scotland there are two provinces and archdioceses (St.
Andrews and Edinburgh, and Glasgow), six dioceses, and about 400 parishes,
in Northern Ireland there are six dioceses (several of which have territory
partly in the Irish Republic and partly in Northern Ireland since there is one
hierarchy for the whole of Ireland) and about 170 parishes. In the whole of
the United Kingdom there are some five million adherents (including children)
to the Roman Catholic faith.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education
of its children in their own faith, and requires that the children of marriages

The Muslims
between its own members and members of any other denomination should be
brought up as Roman Catholics. Many schools for Roman Catholic children
in the United Kingdom are staffed by members of the religious orders for
men and women, who also undertake other social work such as nursing,
child care, and the conduct of homes for the aged.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
present Anglo-Jewish community dates from 1656, the earliest arrivals being
the Sephardi (from Spain and Portugal). At the end of the seventeenth
century an Ashkenazi community (from Germany and East Europe) was
established, which increased rapidly and spread to the principal provincial
cities. As a result of the virtual destruction of whole Jewish communities on
the Continent during the second world war, the present Anglo-Jewish com¬
munity of some 450,000 is the largest group of Jews in Europe.
The Anglo-Jewish community is divided into two schools of thought,
each of which has its own form of worship and its own services: the Orthodox
(the original groups) and the Reform. The Reform Movement, which attaches
less religious importance to some of the ancient rituals and practices of the
Jewish faith, began in 1840. It was followed in 1901 by the establishment of
the Liberal Jewish Movement which, in addition, lays emphasis on the
re-interpretation of traditional Judaism in the light of modern thought and
custom. Of the Jews in Great Britain who belong to any kind of synagogue,
about 80 per cent are Orthodox. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest
group (Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the
Sephardi group.
Synagogues in Britain number approximately 450. There has been an
increase in the number of Jewish denominational schools, which are now
attended by about one in eight Jewish children; other Jewish children attend
the ordinary State or independent schools and receive extra-curricular
instruction in the Jewish faith.
Many immigrants to Britain from overseas Commonwealth countries and
foreign countries have established centres for worship for their own commun¬
ities in the United Kingdom, and especially in London. The Christian
communities include the Greek, Russian, Polish and Serb Orthodox, with
some Estonian and Latvian Orthodox, and also the Armenian Church. There
are also churches belonging to the Lutheran Churches of Denmark, Finland,
Germany, Norway and Sweden, and centres where Estonian, Latvian and
Polish Lutherans worship according to their creed. In addition, the French,
Dutch, Swiss, Hungarian and Polish Reformed Churches are represented in
Britain, the first three having their own places of worship. There are also a
number of other religious sects of British or foreign origin; figures of
membership in Britain of most of them are not available.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Muslims and the Buddhists.
The Muslims are the more widely represented, their number in Britain
being estimated at about 250,000, of whom over 90,000 are in London where
the London Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre, the Shiah Islamic
Assembly Centre and the East London Mosque are situated. The Shah
Jehan Mosque is at Woking, Surrey, and there are mosques or Islamic centres
in many of Britain’s larger cities.

The Buddhists
Go-operation
between the
Churches
There are several thousand adherents of Buddhism in Britain. The Buddhist
Society has its headquarters in London, with a Shrine Room; there are also
Shrine Rooms in the two Vihara in London, in one of which live monks from
the East and in the other western monks.
An outstanding feature of recent years has been the growth of co-operation
between the Churches. The British Council of Churches, founded in 1942,
includes official representatives from almost all the churches of the British
Isles, with the exception of the Roman Catholic Church. The Council
facilitates common action between the churches and seeks to further the cause
of Christian unity. The Archbishop of Canterbury is president. In addition,
most, though not all, of the Free Churches in England and Wales are members
of the Free Church Federal Council (formed in 1940 by the amalgamation
of the Federal Council of Evangelical Free Churches with the National Free
Church Council), the aims of which are to promote unity and joint action
between the Free Churches, and to provide a channel through which the
Free Churches can communicate and negotiate with central and local govern¬
ment authorities as a united body. The report of the conversations held
during the past six years between representatives of the Church of England
and the Methodist Church visualised union between the churches in two
stages: the first to be a period of full communion during which the two
churches remain distinct, and the second to be the achievement of organic
union. Discussions on changes in organisation to allow of closer relations have
also been taking place between the Church of England, the Church of Scotland,
the Episcopal Church in Scotland, and the Presbyterian Church of England.
The Archbishop of Canterbury is advised on these matters, both at home
and abroad, by the Missionary and Ecumenical Council and the Church of
England Council on Foreign Relations.
The Anglican, Presbyterian and Free Churches in the British Isles also
participate in the World Council of Churches, which was constituted at
Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1948. The council links together 171 churches in
over 50 countries for co-operation in action and the study of common problems.
Co-operation of other Churches with the Roman Catholic Church takes
place on some specific issues through the Churches’ Main Committee. The
Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding between
members of the two religions and deals with problems arising in the social field.

PROMOTION OF THE
SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
Scientific research is carried out, as it always has been, by individual scientists.
In former times the agencies promoting and financing it in Britain were
mainly wealthy men, privately endowed universities and learned societies.
But in recent times a growing awareness of the importance of scientific research
and development as a basis of military, economic, social and cultural, strength,
has led to large-scale government support and the budget for science has
assumed a prominent position in total government expenditure. The Govern¬
ment is now the main patron and source of funds for scientific research as a
whole though private industry provides a larger proportion of funds for civil
research. Considerable sums are also provided by public corporations,
independent trusts and foundations, and learned societies.
Furthermore, it has become an acknowledged responsibility of the Govern¬
ment not only to undertake research directly but also to keep under review
facilities for the training of scientists, to encourage fundamental research, to
finance certain research projects, and to ensure that adequate research is
directed to matters of national interest. As a result, a system of collaboration
which leaves the greatest possible measure of freedom to individual scientists
has developed between the universities, industry and the Government. The
learned societies, members of which work in all three, play an important part
in the discussion and publication of the results of research. Important work
is also undertaken by independent organisations.
THE PATTERN OF Total expenditure, government and private, on research and development in
EXPENDITURE Britain was estimated in the most recent survey undertaken for the former
Advisory Council on Scientific Policy to have increased from £300 million
in 1955-56 to £634 million in 1961-62.1 This represented 2-7 per cent of the
gross national product compared with 1-7 per cent in 1955-56. Of this, the
Government provided £385 million, including £139-3 million for civil
research and development, compared with £6-58 million in 1945-46. By
1964-65 the latter figure had increased to £204-4 million, as shown in detail
in Table 8.
In 1961-62 government departments provided over 60 per cent of the
funds and carried out 28 per cent of the research, whereas private industry
provided 33-6 per cent of the funds and carried out 58 per cent of the research,
some of it with government funds, but the proportionate contribution of
private industry to civil research seems since to have been increasing.
Expenditure on research in various sectors of private industry is given on
p. 211.
1 Another full-scale official survey is in progress but results have not yet been published.
One unofficial estimate suggests that total expenditure has reached £800 million a
year, of which £500 million is on civil research.

THE GOVERN¬
MENT AND
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
Organised scientific research dates back at least to the founding of the Royal
Society in 1660 (see p. 209), but active participation by the Government is
largely a twentieth century development, stimulated by two world wars.
Government financing of science before 1900 was confined to the Royal
Greenwich Observatory (see p. 218), founded in 1675 and the first of Britain’s
state-supported scientific institutions; the Geological Survey (1835)—the
first national institution of its kind in the world; a chemical laboratory, now
the Laboratory of the Government Chemist (1842: see p. 211); and the
Meteorological Office (1854: see p. 205). From 1900-1914 government
support for science grew steadily with the establishment in 1900 of the
National Physical Laboratory, in 1909 of the Post Office Research Section,
and also of the Development Commission, to promote research into agriculture
and rural industries; and in 1913 of the Medical Research Committee. During
the first world war government recognition of the importance of scientific
research and its application was hastened and led to the establishment of the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). The Medical
Research Council (MRC) superseded the Medical Research Committee in
1920, and the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) was established in 1931.
Since the second world war government support of science has been extended
to include several new organisations. The Nature Conservancy, now part of
a new research council (see p. 218), was set up in 1949, the Atomic Energy
Authority in 1954 and the Department of Technical Co-operation, now
succeeded by the Ministry of Overseas Development (see p. 222), in
1961.
Ministerial Government participation in civil science was for many years the responsibility
Responsibility of a minister holding one of the ancient offices of state traditionally within
for Civil Science the Cabinet—the Lord President of the Council or the Lord Privy Seal-
advised (from 1947) by an Advisory Council on Scientific Policy (ACSP).
Following publication in 1963 of reports of the Robbins Committee on
higher education (see p. 166) and of the Trend Committee on the organisation
of civil science,1 a Secretary of State for Education and Science was appointed
from 1 st April, 1964, to be responsible for a department dealing with
education and civil science (see p. 203).
The decisions of the new Government, elected in October 1964, on the
reorganisation of governmental civil science were given legislative effect in
the Science and Technology Act 1965. Central responsibility for civil science
rests with the Secretary of State for Education and Science, advised by a
Council on Scientific Policy, which replaced the former Advisory Council,
and for technology with the Minister of Technology, advised by an Advisory
Council on Technology. Other government departments continue to be
responsible for certain branches of research and development.
Under the Act, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
(DSIR) was dissolved on 1st April, 1965, and its activities distributed among
other departments and research councils, including two new ones: the
Science Research Council and the Natural Environment Research Council.
The Secretary of State for Education and Science is now responsible for
directing and financing the Research Councils, formerly directed by Com¬
mittees of the Privy Council (which were dissolved under the Act) and
financed either through the Treasury or the Department of Education and

to make payments hitherto borne by other departments or research

The Department The Department of Education and Science (see p. 52) is responsible, among
of Education other things, for the universities and civil science throughout Great Britain.
and Science The Department’s relations with the universities are conducted through the
University Grants Committee (see p. 167); and its responsibilities for civil
science are discharged mainly through the research councils (see below).
The Department also has, in consultation with other departments, general
governmental responsibility for Britain’s scientific space research programme,
which is co-ordinated by the Science Research Council (see p. 211). The
Department has taken over inter alia from the former DSIR responsibility
for overseas scientific liaison, including the scientific attaches at overseas
missions and for promoting more efficient handling and utilisation of scientific
and technical information. For the second purpose it has set up the Office for
Scientific and Technical Information, which will be responsible for the
National Lending Library for Science and Technology and for grant aid

to the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB)
(see p. 220). There are at present four research councils for which the
Secretary of State for Education and Science is responsible: the Science
Research Council (see p. 211), the Medical Research Council (see p. 213),
the Agricultural Research Council (see p. 214), and the Natural Environment
Research Council (see p. 218). Others may be established under the terms
of the Science and Technology Act.
In the exercise of his responsibilities for the formulation and execution of
government scientific policy the Secretary of State for Education and Science
is advised by the Council on Scientific Policy (CSP), which replaced the
former Advisory Council on Scientific Policy. The Council, which was
appointed in January 1965, consists of a chairman and thirteen other members;
unlike its predecessor the new Council is composed entirely of independent
members. There are, in addition, assessors from the research councils and
from the University Grants Committee. Among the issues with which the
Council is concerned is the balance of scientific effort in those areas for
which the Secretary of State is responsible.
The Ministry of Technology has the general responsibility of guiding and
stimulating a major national effort to bring advanced technology and new
processes into British industry.
The Ministry has taken over sponsorship responsibility for the machine
tool and computer industries from the Board of Trade and for the electronics
and telecommunications industries from the Ministry of Aviation and the
General Post Office respectively. The Technical Support Unit, formerly
under the Treasury, forms the basis of a Computer Advisory Unit. The
Ministry undertakes technical and economic studies of selected industries
and processes to determine where action is needed, followed by the preparation
and implementation of specific programmes for technological advance,
particularly in those branches of industry for which it has assumed sponsor¬
ship. The Ministry is also responsible for examining, in collaboration with
other government departments, other factors affecting technological advance,
including engineering standards practice, the use of public purchasing
contracts and the status and supply of engineers and technologists.
The Ministry is responsible for important research laboratories (see
p. 211). Arrangements have been made to continue the long-standing close
association of the Royal Society with the work of the National Physical
Laboratory. The Ministry gives financial aid to 48 co-operative industrial
research associations. In discharge of a responsibility under the Science and
Technology Act 1965, to further the practical application of research, it
maintains a regional service and helps to finance industrial liaison officers
centred on colleges of technology and technical colleges throughout the
country.
The Minister is responsible for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority, which he may require to undertake research and development
outside nuclear energy, and for the National Research Development
Corporation.
The Minister of Technology is chairman of the Advisory Council on Tech¬
nology, set up to advise on the application of advanced technology in British
industry. There is a deputy chairman and ten other members, representing
scientific, economic, trade union and industrial interests.

The Committee on Scientific Manpower of the former ACSP has been replaced
by the Committee on Manpower Resources for Science and Technology,
established in February 1965. The new Committee, which reports directly
to the Secretary of State for Education and Science and to the Minister of
Technology, will be concerned with the total national resources of qualified
scientific and technological manpower, which includes not only those who
qualify each year but also the existing population of scientists and technologists,
and their effective utilisation. The Committee includes 16 independent
members, including the chairman, chosen for their wide experience in
educational and industrial matters, as well as departmental representatives.
A number of other government departments remain responsible for certain
branches of research.
The Ministry of Transport is concerned with research into road construction,
safety and traffic flow (see p. 377), most of the basic work being carried out
by the Road Research Laboratory, at Harmondsworth, west of London,
now responsible to the Ministry of Transport, and by the Ministry of Defence.
Research on radio aids for marine navigation is undertaken by the Ministry
of Defence, which is also responsible for inter-Service electronic valve
research at the Services Electronics Research Laboratory (SERL). The
Government’s programme of research on marine nuclear propulsion is under¬
taken by the Atomic Energy Authority.
The Ministry of Aviation, which carries out most of the research needed
to meet the technical requirements of air defence (see p. 120), is also responsible
for some civil research, for instance, at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at
Farnborough and Bedford and the National Gas Turbine Establishment at
Farnborough, and at the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern. Some
fundamental research is carried out for the Ministry by universities and
industrial organisations. The Minister is advised by an Aeronautical Research
Council and an Electronics Research Council.
The Ministry of Power is responsible for research into safety and health of
mineworkers. The coal, electricity and gas industries are required to settle
their general programmes of research in consultation with the Minister.
The Ministry of Defence finances the Meteorological Office, which is
responsible for research in meteorology and geophysics, mainly directed to
non-military ends. The headquarters of the Office and most of its research
sections are at Bracknell, Berkshire. The Forecasting Research Section has
been equipped with a large-capacity electronic computer. Balloon and aircraft
soundings and radar techniques are used to investigate the movement and
composition of the atmosphere, and instruments are being designed which
will be used in rockets and an earth satellite. The Ministry of Defence also
makes grants for fundamental meteorological research carried out under the
auspices of the Royal Society or in university departments.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government and the Ministry of Land
and Natural Resources deal with geographical, geological, economic and
sociological research relating to the use and development of land in England
and Wales. Similar arrangements are made in Scotland by the Scottish Home
and Health Department, and in Northern Ireland by the Ministry of
Development.
The Post Office, through its Engineering Department, undertakes research

and development on telecommunications systems, electronic devices and
materials. Amongst its current projects are: trans-oceanic cable systems
capable of carrying up to 1,000 conversations and the high-frequency long-life
transistors required for them, the development of electronic telephone
exchanges, further automation of mail-handling equipment and studies of
character recognition, and pulse-code modulation for use in the inland net¬
work. An extensive programme on satellite communications continues,
largely at the Post Office earth station at Goonhilly Downs, Cornwall, which
is being used successfully in tests with the Telstar, Relay and Early Bird
satellites. Studies of colour TV signals are being made with a view to agreeing
an international system. The Post Office co-operates with industry in the
engineering of new systems, field trials and equipment standardisation, and
with many government departments having similar interests.
A number of scientific institutions administered by government departments
undertake research work in addition to their other scientific activities. These
include the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded in 1759 and now
administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which
has the largest collection of living plants in the world. Its three research
departments are: the Herbarium, concerned primarily with the classification
and accurate determination of plants; the Jodrell Laboratory, for the study
of plant anatomy and plant physiology, cytology and genetics; and the
Museum of Economic Botany, dealing with the economic exploitation of
plants. The library, attached to the herbarium, was founded in 1853; it
consists of more than 55,000 botanical books, about 80,000 reprints and
separately issued items and a collection of over 150,000 drawings and paintings
of plants. In 1964 the 400-acre estate known as Wakehurst Place, Ardingly,
Sussex, was taken over by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The Royal
Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, founded about 1660, is administered by the
Ministry of Public Building and Works.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee was founded at the end of 1939
by members of the House of Commons and replaced the former Parliamentary
Science Committee. It is one of a number of unofficial, all-party parliamentary
groups which have grown up spontaneously and have varying degrees of
influence. Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party in
both Houses, and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-
making scientific and technological organisations in Britain as may be affiliated
under its constitution. The Committee provides, as far as possible, for a
regular exchange of information between members of Parliament and scientists.
The learned societies have had a profound and lasting influence upon the
development and organisation of science in Britain. They have provided the
background for continuity of research from the seventeenth century onwards,
a forum for scientists to exchange ideas and a reliable source from which
new ideas for the enrichment of knowledge can flow. Although today most
research is conducted under other auspices, the learned societies have retained
their traditional function of facilitating the spread of scientific knowledge.
At present there are over 200 learned scientific societies in Britain with
approximately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical
institutions and professional associations, many of which are playing a dis¬

in the education and professional well-being of their members. Prominent
examples of these are the British Medical Association, the Institutions of

The most eminent of the learned societies concerned with science in its
broadest aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests
and activities) are the Royal Society, Royal Society of Arts, Royal Institution
and British Association.
The Royal Society, or more fully, the Royal Society of London for the
Improvement of Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique
place in the country’s scientific affairs and corresponds to national academies
of science in other countries. Election to it is regarded by scientists as a high
honour. The Queen is Patron. There are today three main categories of
Fellowship: Royal Fellows, comprising the Queen Mother and three Royal
Dukes; Foreign Members, of whom there are about 65; and the main body
of Fellows, numbering about 625. Election to the Fellowship, which is for
life, was for many years restricted to 25 persons a year and the foreign
membership to four a year but in 1965 the former was increased to 32 with
the intention of awarding some of the new places to applied scientists in
both the physical and biological sciences. The Society is governed by a
council of 21 members.
Its present activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication
of research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings’,
the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. Among its research appointments are the
Foulerton, Wolfson and Sir Henry Dale Research Professorships and eight
other research professorships supported by parliamentary grant-in-aid. The
highest medal awarded is the Copley Medal, for which scientists from all
countries are eligible; there are also three Royal Medals, and the Rumford,
Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester, Hughes and Leverhulme Medals. There are
five lectureships: the Croonian (biology), the Bakerian (physical sciences);
the Ferrier (nervous system); the Wilkins (history of science); and the
Leeuwenhoek (microbiology). In recent years the Society has set up com¬
mittees, some of them jointly with other bodies, to promote improvements
in education in science and to emphasise the importance of applied sciences,
especially engineering.
Although an independent private corporation, the Society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which provides its accommoda¬
tion and makes grants for research activities administered by it. The President
of the Society is consulted on scientific appointments to government research
councils and Fellows serve on most governmental advisory councils and
committees concerned with research.
The Society represents the United Kingdom in the international unions
comprising the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) and
appoints national committees for each of them. It also plays a leading part
in international scientific programmes such as the International Geophysical
Year (IGY) (1957-58), the International Years of the Quiet Sun (IQSY)
(1964-65) and the International Biological Programme (1965-70).
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encourage¬
ment of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific,
artistic, technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in I754>
however, one of the Society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress

STATUS
and application to the useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils
this purpose chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The Society
regularly holds meetings for the delivery of lectures, and publishes a monthly
Journal, thus providing effective media for the exposition and assessment by
leading authorities of developments which have a public as well as a specialist
interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’.
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today,
the Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are
given on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge.
Its library of some 60,000 books includes many early scientific works and
manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as well
as by eminent scientists. In addition the Association plans special lectures,
exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publica¬
tion of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study
groups and liaison with the press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The Association has area committees and three lectureships for young
scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences to
encourage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The
British Association has an organised relationship with over 150 scientific
bodies and learned societies. It has also played an important part in the
development of science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles
to the discovery and application of scientific knowledge.
In 1964-65 the total estimated university expenditure on scientific research
was about £37-4 million. The most important government contribution
was through the University Grants Committee (UGC), which provides about
70 per cent of the income and about 95 per cent of the capital needs of the
universities. This Committee advises the Secretary of State for Education and
Science on the recurrent grants needed by the universities on a quinquennial
basis, assessing their requirements on the basis of plans and proposals put
forward by the universities themselves, bearing in mind such factors as
national needs, available resources of academic manpower, potential student
numbers in various fields and existing gaps in teaching or research. Moreover,
since the total cost of all the universities’ desirable projects is likely to exceed
any financial provision that any government would be able to make, it is the
Committee’s responsibility to achieve some balance in the total expenditure
on new developments between universities and between fields of development.
From the funds provided by the Government the Committee allocates block
grants to each university for each of the five years. The Committee exercises
no close supervision over the subsequent expenditure of these grants, although
it indicates to the universities the direction in which new developments

for Aid to
Research
during the next quinquennium would most appropriately take place; and
it would normally expect to be invited to agree to any major deviation
from the programmes put forward in the universities’ quinquennial sub¬
missions.
Scientific research in the universities is also supported from the Exchequer
through the Department of Education and Science. This support takes two
forms. First, about half the postgraduate students in science and technology
in the universities receive maintenance awards from the research councils,
through postgraduate scholarships, studentships or fellowships. These awards
are in some cases for periods of up to three years for training in research work
and in others for shorter periods for advanced studies. The cost of these
studentships is currently of the order of £3 million a year. Second, grants are
given to the universities by the research councils for specific projects,
particularly in new or developing fields of research. In recent years the
research councils, in addition to making grants of this kind, have made funds
available for expensive items of university equipment required for specific
programmes of research. The research councils’ support for research in the
universities, excluding expenditure by the Medical Research Council and the
Agricultural Research Council on their own research units within the
universities (which remain under the control of, and are wholly financed by,
the councils themselves), amounted in 1964-65 to about £7 million or one-
ninth of the expenditure on research in the universities.
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the
independent foundations, which provide funds amounting in the aggregate
to about ^5 million. The contributions from sources other than the University
Grants Committee amount to nearly a third of the total university expenditure
on research.
In addition to the universities, colleges of advanced technology in England
and Wales, which are acquiring the status and title of universities, and central
institutions in Scotland are playing an increasing part in scientific and
technological research and development. These colleges and institutions are
financed by the education departments but are now making a growing
demand on the support for research provided by the research councils.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries. The tendency is
increasing although the industries in each district are becoming more and
more diversified.
All universities and university colleges in the United Kingdom have labora¬
tories or research departments.1 The government research councils provide
grants for research projects in universities and award a substantial number of
studentships for postgraduate training in science and technology, as well as
post-doctoral research fellowships; the National Research Development
Corporation (see p. 221) awards development contracts to university depart¬
ments ; and leading firms in such industries as chemicals, oil, motor vehicles,
textiles, electrical equipment, food manufacture, and mining provide grants
for specific research projects or endow research fellowships, such as the
Imperial Chemical Industries and Leverhulme Fellowships, or professorships.
Foundations which provide similar benefactions include the Nuffield

Foundation,1 the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Trust, the Wellcome Trust
and Courtaulds’ Scientific and Educational Trust Fund. Among individuals
whose major contributions to universities have included provision for research
facilities have been Lord Nuffield, with gifts to the Clarendon Laboratory,
Oxford, Lord Austin, who provided new buildings for the Cavendish Labora¬
tory, Cambridge, members of the Wills family, who financed the Physics
Laboratory at Bristol, members of the Boot family at Nottingham and of the
Brotherton family at Leeds.
Co-operation between industry and commerce and the universities and
colleges of advanced technology is common. A notable example is the
Manchester Joint Research Council, set up in 1944 by the Manchester
Chamber of Commerce and the University of Manchester, which organises
lectures and discussion meetings and conducts investigations into the use
made of research by industry. Another example is the Glass Delegation of
the University of Sheffield, which directs the work of the Department of
Glass Technology and is composed of members appointed by the Council
of the University and representatives of firms and companies who subscribe
funds for training and research. An example of co-operation between the
Government, an independent organisation and a university is the radio
telescope at the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Observatory, Jodrell Bank,
Cheshire (see p. 218), financed jointly by the Government, the Nuffield
Foundation, the late Lord Nuffield personally and Manchester University,
the last being responsible for its development.
Following a scheme already in operation in Scotland, a technical information
service for industry is being expanded by the Ministry of Technology and
the Department of Education and Science, based on colleges of advanced
technology and technical colleges; industrial liaison officers spend part of their
time on teaching and other work in the colleges. Collaboration was agreed
in 1964 between the AEA’s establishment at Risley and Manchester College
of Science and Technology; as a first step Risley staff are giving assistance as
part-time professors and lecturers at the College.
Statistics, based on replies to questions put to a 10 per cent sample of the
population at the 1961 census, showed that in 1961 there were 287,610 people
in Great Britain with scientific and technological qualifications (136,520
scientists and 151,090 engineers and technologists). On the basis of a survey
made in 1956 the then Committee on Scientific Manpower (see p. 205) of the
Advisory Council on Scientific Policy estimated that the number of scientists
and engineers qualifying annually would need to be raised from 10,000 in
1956 to 20,000 between 1966 and I971* The Government accepted this figure
as a reasonable goal and supported measures to ensure that the universities
and technical colleges together would be able to produce at least this number.
In 1962 what was then known as the Committee on Scientific Manpower
of the ACSP forecast an annual growth rate in these figures of 4-8 per cent in
the period 1962-65. It also forecast a shortage of mathematicians, electrical
and mechanical engineers and physicists.
The emigration of scientists, though a matter of concern to a country such
as Britain, whose economy relies increasingly on science-based industries, is
no new phenomenon and is common to all advanced countries. It is in the
interests of science that interchanges should take place. Many of those who

leave return later and others come to work in Britain from the Commonwealth,
Europe and the United States.
The Science Research Council (SRC), which came into formal existence on
ist April, 1965, and consists of a chairman and eleven other members, covers
all branches of fundamental science other than those for which the other
research councils are responsible. It supports research in engineering and
technology in the universities. Provision is made for it to carry out research and
development through its own establishments; to encourage and support
similar research by any other person or body; to provide and operate equip¬
ment for common use by universities, technical colleges and similar
institutions; to make grants for postgraduate studies; and to disseminate
knowledge of science and technology. Its own establishments include the
Royal Greenwich Observatory, previously financed by the Ministry of
Defence (Navy), the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, formerly financed by
the Treasury, the Radio Research Station, formerly attached to DSIR, and
the establishments of the National Institute for Research in Nuclear Science
(NIRNS)—the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory, Berkshire, and the
Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory, Daresbury, Lancashire (see p. 217).
The SRC also co-ordinates the British scientific space research programme
and advises on British policy towards international research bodies, such as
the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the European
Space Research Organisation (ESRO).
According to the report of the former Advisory Council on Scientific Policy
(see p. 204) total expenditure on research and development by the different
industrial sectors in 1961-62 (excluding establishments of less than 100
employees) was as follows (in £ million): aircraft I40-6; electronics 49’9>
chemicals and allied industries 39-7; electrical engineering 36-2; mechanical
and marine engineering and shipbuilding 33-7; metal manufacture 10;
motor vehicles, locomotives, etc., 9-8; scientific instruments 9-2; textiles,
leather, etc., 8-7; food, drink and tobacco 7-1; mineral oil refining 6;
construction 1-5; other manufacturing industries 13-5.
The greater part of industrial research in Britain is undertaken in the
research organisations of the larger firms. Industrial research organisations
vary widely between the largest firms employing over 4,000 qualified staff
and some employing very few; though the emphasis is on commercial
development, some fundamental research is done. Other main agencies are
government laboratories, universities and technical colleges, industrial
research associations, independent institutes for sponsored research and
consultant laboratories.
Ministry of

Stations
The following research institutions have been transferred to the Ministry of
Technology from the former DSIR.
The Forest Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, 36 miles
west of London, studies the mechanical, physical and chemical properties of
home-grown and imported timber. The Hydraulics Research Station at
Wallingford, on the River Thames, studies problems of water flow in open
channels such as rivers, estuaries and harbours, and coastal erosion. The
Joint Fire Research Organisation, controlled jointly with the Fire Offices’
Committee, is concerned with the detection, suppression, and inhibition of
fires and the safety of life in fires. The Laboratory of the Government Chemist
in London has a statutory function as official analyst and as an adjudicator in

cases of disputed analyses and also carries out analytical research and advisory
work for government departments on request. The National Physical
Laboratory at Teddington, near London, conducts research in various
branches of non-nuclear physics and maintains British primary standards and
physical units and includes the former National Chemical Laboratory, con¬
centrating on basic chemical research applicable to a wide variety of industries.
The National Engineering Laboratory at East Kilbride, south of Glasgow,
carries out basic and applied research in mechanical engineering to provide
industry with information required to solve its own particular problems and
has unique facilities for making precision engineering measurements and
testing hydraulic machinery and heat exchange plant. The Torry Research
Station at Aberdeen (with a branch laboratory at Hull) investigates problems
arising in the handling, processing, and transport and storage of fish. The
Warren Spring Laboratory near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, provides facilities
for research and development, including pilot-scale work on subjects of
national importance which cannot be fitted into the programme of other
organisations, undertakes sponsored research and can accommodate teams
from industry. It also compiles the official British register of research in
human sciences (see p. 219). The Water Pollution Research Laboratory at
Stevenage is concerned with the safe disposal of sewage and trade effluents
and with the purity of water supplies. The Building Research Station near
Watford, Hertfordshire, is concerned with the techniques of building design
and construction, and the organisation, productivity, and economics of
building work.
The scheme by which the Government gives financial help to groups of firms
with similar interests to form organisations known as research associations, to
carry out industrial research co-operatively, was started in 1917 and is now
operated by the Ministry of Technology. At the end of 1964 there were 48
such associations, with a combined income of ,£11 million (compared with
£5-1 million in 1955), of which a little less than a quarter was contributed
by the Government. Suitably specialised associations are now available for
about 70 per cent of British industry, varying in size from the British Iron
and Steel Research Association (BISRA) with an annual income of over
£1.3 million, of which £159,000 is provided by government grant, to the
British Brush Manufacturers Research Association with an income of only
£16,000. The largest are those dealing with the metals and electrical engineer¬
ing industries, coal utilisation, cotton and man-made fibres, production
engineering, motor vehicles, marine engineering and shipbuilding. (Particulars
of these and other associations are given in the relevant sections of Chapter 11,
Industry.) The amounts of the government grants are related to the contri¬
butions made by the industries concerned.
The research associations are autonomous bodies governed by their own
councils, the members of which are mostly representatives of industry,
although the Ministry of Technology is also represented. The councils are
advised in preparing research programmes, for which they have complete
responsibility, by research committees representative of their industrial
members, often with the addition of university or government scientists.
The Ministry of Technology appoints two Visitors for each association:
normally, one is a scientist and the other an industrialist—both of some
eminence. Nearly all research associations admit to membership Common¬
wealth manufacturers and a growing number of foreign manufacturers. The
associations make the results of their work known to member firms by a

variety of methods, among which are bulletins, technical reports, lectures,
films, training classes, exhibitions and mobile demonstration units.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations (see Chapter 11), in particular those con¬
cerned with fuel and power:the National Coal Board, the Central Electricity
Generating Board, the Gas Council. They also give support to organisations
concerned with research on matters of interest to them.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
In these institutes research organised by private firms can be carried out
confidentially, so that the results remain the property of the sponsor.
Among British institutes of this type are: Fulmer Research Institute, Stoke
Poges, Buckinghamshire, which is now owned by the Institute of Physics
and the Physical Society, concentrates on metallurgy and allied subjects;
Sondes Place Research Institute, Dorking, Surrey, which is concerned mainly
with chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering; Arthur D.
Little Research Institute, Musselburgh, near Edinburgh, a British institute
working in close collaboration with a well-known American institute with a
similar name; the International Research and Development Company at
Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne; and the United Power Company at Heston,
near London.
A Medical Research Committee was appointed in 1913 to administer the
research funds provided under the National Plealth Insurance Act of 1911.
In 1920 the Committee was superseded by the Medical Research Council
(MRC), established under Royal Charter and supported by a grant-in-aid
provided by Parliament, now through the Secretary of State for Education
and Science.
In addition to financing the Medical Research Council, the Government
gives substantial support to medical research particularly in the basic sciences,
through block grants to universities distributed through the University Grants
Committee; and to clinical research through the National Health Service.
Other government-financed research for defence purposes, for example at
the Microbiological Establishment at Porton, Wiltshire, has civil applications
related to medical science.
Important contributions to the support of research in particular subjects
are made by private industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, and by
private charities or fund raising organisations, of which the Nuffield
Foundation and the British Empire Cancer Campaign are the largest.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) is responsible to the Secretary of State
for Education and Science. There are twelve members of the Council, nine of
whom, representing different branches of medical knowledge and the funda¬
mental sciences on which these are based, are appointed after consultation
with the President of the Royal Society and with the Council itself; on
retirement, these scientific members are not eligible for immediate reappoint¬
ment. Three are lay members, one of whom must be a member of the House
of Lords and one a member of the House of Commons.
The MRC’s chief function is to promote research into all aspects of health
and disease. In planning and carrying out its research programme, the Council
214
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is assisted by special committees appointed to advise on particular subjects.
Three of the more important of these are the Clinical Research Board, set
up in consultation with the health departments to assist the development of
clinical research, and the Tropical Medicine Research Board, appointed in
consultation with the Ministry of Overseas Development, to advise on the
promotion and co-ordination of research in this field; and the Biological
Research Board, which advises on the promotion of research in the non-
clinical field. Its arrangements for the support of research fall under four
main headings: (i) investigations by members of the Council’s scientific staff,
mostly working in its own research establishments; (2) temporary researc
grants to independent investigators in universities and elsewhere; (3) long¬
term research grants in support of specific research programmes in university
medical departments (‘research groups’); and (4) research fellowships and
scholarships for tenure both at home and abroad. The programme includes
fundamental studies of the structure and natural processes of the body;
clinical and laboratory studies of disease; the development and evaluation of
special methods of treatment and also of prophylaxis and diagnosis; and the
study of social and occupational factors affecting health and the efficiency
of body and mind.
The National Institute for Medical Research, at Mill Hill and Hampstead,
London, is the Council’s main research establishment; in addition, there are
about 80 smaller establishments, generally known as research units, which
are attached in most cases to universities and hospitals in the United Kingdom.
The Council also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support from
funds made available through the Ministry of Overseas Development, main¬
tains laboratories in the Gambia and units in Uganda and Jamaica.
AGRICULTURAL
RESEARCH
Agricultural research in its early days was not centrally organised and the first
igricultural research institutes were privately maintained. The Development
Commission, set up under the Development and Road Improvement Act
iqoq recommended that financial aid should be made aval able from the
Development Fund to ‘aid and develop agriculture and rural industries by
promoting scientific research’ and in 1911 this fund was used to promote
a scheme which led to the establishment of many of the present-day
agricultural institutions. In 1931 the Agricultural Research Council (ARC
was established by Royal Charter. In addition to advising the agricultural
departments on the programmes of the institutes and, in the early stages,
acting as scientific adviser to the Development Commission, the ARC was
given funds to spend at its own discretion and gradually took over the
Commission’s responsibilities for agricultural research.

The Council makes special research grants to support promising new lines
of work in university departments. It awards postgraduate studentships to
provide special training for those wishing to make a career in research and
fellowships to enable research workers of exceptional promise to undertake
independent research.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which has a Scientific
Advisory Panel, established in 1965, carries out applied research in its own
veterinary laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey, and at Lasswade, Midlothian,
and also at its plant pathology laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire;
while at its infestation control laboratory at Tolworth, Surrey (with a field
station at Worplesdon), it co-ordinates work on the control of insect pests
of stored food and conducts research on the control of harmful mammals
and birds. The Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge has been
appointed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the third international
laboratory for biological students. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of
Agriculture is responsible for the promotion of agricultural research and
research divisions dealing with a variety of aspects have been established.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains four labora¬
tories for marine, shell-fish and salmon and freshwater fisheries research,
and four research vessels. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for
Scotland maintains a marine research laboratory and four research ships at
Aberdeen, and a freshwater research laboratory at Pitlochry.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science
and Plant Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
is responsible for formulating the Ministry’s general policy on the acquisition
and dissemination of scientific and technical information about food and the
food handling and processing industry; for furnishing scientific advice to the
other divisions of the Ministry; and for sponsoring or carrying out experi¬
mental work. The division has its own experimental laboratories and kitchens
in London. The Food Research Advisory Committee, appointed by the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for
Scotland, advises on food problems requiring investigation or research which
should be undertaken with the aid of public funds.
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to
silvicultural and allied problems (see p. 355). By means of grants, it also aids
forest research work undertaken by various universities and other institutions,
including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford.
The Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), set up under the Atomic Energy
Authority Act 1954, is responsible for research and development in nuclear
energy. It is answerable to the Minister of Technology, who is responsible
under the Atomic Energy Acts 1946 to 1949 for promoting and controlling
the development of atomic energy and ensuring that the proper degrees of
importance are attached to its various applications. The Authority has a
large programme of research into, and development of, the peaceful applica¬
tions of nuclear energy. As an essential part of the British Government’s
nuclear power programme, the Authority develops new types of nuclear
power stations to the stage at which they can be adopted for the generation of
electric power on a commercial scale and for this purpose it builds and operates
experimental and prototype nuclear reactors. Construction and operation
of the nuclear power stations themselves is the responsibility of the Central
Electricity Generating Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board.

The Minister of Aviation is responsible for the development and production
of nuclear weapons for the Services in accordance with agreed defence policy,
in practice, however, the Atomic Energy Authority produces the explosive
nuclear material and assemblies for nuclear weapons under contract and
carries out weapon research.
The Ministry of Technology and the Authority collaborate with a number
of other government departments and with the Radiological Protection
Service on various aspects of health and safety in relation to atomic energy.
Expert advice on radiation hazards is provided by the Medical and Agri¬
cultural Research Councils and by the Radioactive Substances Advisory
Committee, appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science.
This committee advises ministers on regulatory aspects of safety measures in
the use of radioactive substances and apparatus producing radiation.
The Ministry of Technology and the Authority are jointly responsible for co¬
operation with other countries in the atomic energy field. This is accomplished
partly through the medium of bilateral agreements with a large number
of individual countries and partly through British membership of the Inter¬
national Atomic Energy Agency and the European Nuclear Energy Agency.
The Atomic Energy Authority, the members of which are appointed by the
Minister of Technology, at present consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman
and eleven other members, seven of whom are part-time.
The Authority, like other statutory public corporations, is free from day-
to-day government control (subject to the power given to the responsible
minister to issue directions to the Authority in matters of overriding national
importance), but differs from them in that most of its revenue is derived from
money voted by Parliament. The commercial activities of the AEA have
recently been separated from its other functions and are now financed
through a trading fund with an initial capital of about £37 million. Under
the Science and Technology Act 1965 the functions of the Authority have
been extended so that the Minister may, after consultation, require it to
undertake research and development outside nuclear energy.
The organisation has a London office, responsible for central financial and
administrative matters and for procuring raw materials. Its establishments
are divided into five groups. _ .
The Research Group's principal establishment is the Atomic Energy
Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell. Others are the Wantage Research
Laboratory, which does research into new and improved uses of radioisotopes
and an establishment for research into plasma physics and controlled thermo¬
nuclear fusion at Culham. Harwell also runs an isotope school at Wantage,
and a reactor school, which provide training for home and overseas students
The Weapons Group, centred on Aldermaston, conducts research on and
development of nuclear weapons and other research work with civil, as well
as defence, applications. It has outstations at Foulness and Orfordness in
eastern England. .
There are three groups with headquarters at Risley, in north-western
England. The Reactor Group works on the design and development m
reactors. It is responsible for the prototype Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor
(AGR) at Windscale, which has been operating successfully since February
1963 and which formed the basis of the design chosen for the first nuclear
power station in Britain’s second nuclear power programme (see p. 289).
The Group also includes the Atomic Energy Establishment at Winfrith,
Dorset, where work on a wide range of reactor types is carried out.

A prototype Steam Generating Heavy Water (SGHW) reactor, with an
electrical output of 120 MW, is being constructed there and a number of
experimental reactors of different types have been in operation for some time.
It is also the location of the Dragon project, a 20 MW reactor financed jointly
by the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), including members of the European Atomic
Energy Community (Euratom). The Reactor Group also includes the
Dounreay experimental reactor establishment in the north of Scotland,
which houses a materials-testing reactor and a fast-breeder reactor. The
latter has achieved the highest power output of any of its type in the world.
The Group has research laboratories at the main establishments of the
Production Group, which is responsible for the operation of factories pro¬
ducing and reprocessing fissile material at Windscale (Cumberland),
Capenhurst (Cheshire) and Springfields (Lancashire) and the AEA’s nuclear
power plants at Calder Hall (Cumberland) and Chapelcross (Dumfries), and
for the Calder Operations School. The work of this group is now mainly
commercial; it not only supplies all the nuclear fuel for the British nuclear
power stations which form Britain’s first nuclear power programme, but is
also supplying fuel for similar power stations in Japan and Italy. The Group
has also attracted large overseas orders for the reprocessing of nuclear fuel.
It also controls the Radiochemical Centre at Amersham, which produces and
sells radioisotopes. The third group with headquarters at Risley is the
Engineering Group, responsible for the construction of plant, works and
buildings, and for the design and inspection of fuel elements for production
purposes.
In 1957 the Government set up a National Institute for Research in Nuclear
Science (NIRNS), to provide, for common use by universities and others,
facilities and equipment beyond the scope of individual universities and
institutions. On 1st April, 1965, NIRNS was dissolved and its functions
taken over by the Science Research Council (see p. 211). The SRC establish¬
ments concerned with high energy physics are the Rutherford High Energy
Laboratory, Chilton, which houses a 7,000 million electron volt (MeV)
proton synchrotron (particle accelerator), completed in 1963; the Daresbury
Nuclear Physics Laboratory, Cheshire, which is to house a 4,000 MeV
synchrotron; and the Atlas Computer Laboratory, Chilton, which is also
used for other scientific work.
The Secretary of State for Education and Science, in consultation with other
ministers, has general governmental responsibility for Britain’s space research
programme. Under the Science and Technology Act 1965, the co-ordination
of the programme is the responsibility of the Science Research Council
(see p. 211). The execution of the programme remains in the hands of
scientists in universities and government research establishments, under the
general supervision of a Space Research Management Group, within the
SRC, which is responsible for channelling and administering grants to
universities provided from government funds. Identifiable government
expenditure on the space research programme is at present some -£3 million
a year. Advice on the programme’s purely scientific aspects is given by the
British National Committee on Space Research, appointed by the Royal
Society. This Committee provides British representation on non-govern¬
mental international scientific groups and is responsible for experiments flown
in rockets and satellites. Private industry also develops and provides

equipment and materials needed in space research; for instance, the third
Anglo-American artificial earth satellite, UK-3, and the upper atmosphere
Skylark rockets are being made by private industry. Two organisations in
which Britain is playing a leading part have been set up to give European
countries the opportunity to participate more fully in space research and
technology—the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) and the
European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO). The first stage of
the planned ELDO satellite launcher will be provided by the British Blue
Streak rocket, which had its first live firing in 1964 from the Woomera range
(see p. 120). The SRC provides the United Kingdom contribution to ESRO.
In November 1964 a committee to review Britain’s defence interests in
space and to make recommendations on future research and development was
set up.
The satellite prediction centre at Slough, attached to the Radio Research
Station, also the home of one of the three World Data Centres for space
research, co-ordinates optical and radio tracking activities in Britain. Optical
observation of satellites is carried out regularly by many individual observers
in the British Isles and by the Royal Edinburgh Observatory’s outstation
(see below), radio tracking is undertaken at the Radio Research Station itself
and by the radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank and the Royal Radar Establishment
at Malvern. The Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough is carrying
out a programme of basic satellite technology and has undertaken a design
study for a communications satellite. The General Post Office undertakes
research work connected with experiments in satellite communications.
Under two inter-related international agreements reached in July 1964, in
Washington, Britain is taking part in a world-wide satellite communications
system together with the United States, European and other countries.
Large optical telescopes were first constructed in Britain by Herschel and
Rosse in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. At present British optical
observatories are being extensively re-equipped. The Isaac Newton 98-inch
telescope, nearing completion for the Royal Greenwich Observatory, Herst-
monceux, will provide additional facilities for optical astronomers in Britain,
and grants to the Radcliffe Observatory in South Africa, with its existing
74-inch telescope, and the merger of the Royal Observatory, Cape Town,
and the Royal Greenwich Observatory and Anglo-Australian observatories
built and projected in Australia enable astronomers to have improved use
of large optical telescopes in both hemispheres. The Royal Edinburgh
Observatory has been re-equipped with modern instrumentation for use in
stellar spectroscopy and photometry.
Radio astronomy, developed since iqSL carr^e<^ out mainl}' at Cambridge,
at Jodrell Bank, Cheshire, and at the Ministry of Aviation’s Royal Radar
Establishment at Malvern. A Radio Astronomy Planning Committee, set up
in December 1961 to advise on the nature and extent of Britain’s radio
astronomy research programme both nationally and internationally, is now
responsible to the Science Research Council. In a report published in 1965
the Committee recommended that ^4 million should be spent in support of
increased facilities for radio astronomy in Britain, which occupies a pre¬
eminent position in this subject.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), which was established
in June 1965, supports research in earth sciences and ecology. It has taken
over the Nature Conservancy, the Geological Survey and Museum (with
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS

which has been merged the Directorate of Overseas Geological Surveys from
the Ministry of Overseas Development) the Hydrology Research Unit, the
National Institute of Oceanography, and the functions of the Development
Commission in relation to marine and freshwater biology and fishery
research.
The Nature Conservancy was set up in 1949. Its functions are to provide
scientific advice on the conservation and control of the natural flora and
fauna of Great Britain; to establish, maintain and manage nature reserves
in Great Britain, including the maintenance of physical features of scientific
interest; and to organise and develop the research and scientific service
related thereto. Research stations have been set up at Merlewood, Grange-
over-Sands, in Lancashire; at Furzebrook, Wareham, in Dorset; at Bangor,
Wales; and at Speyside, Inverness. There are field stations at Moor House,
Westmorland, and at Anancaun, Ross, and an experimental station at Monks’
Wood, Huntingdon; at these, long-term ecological research is undertaken
into such problems as the relation of vegetation to soils and climates, peat
growth, effects of grazing and of moor burning, coastal erosion and roadside
spraying. Grants are made for research, and the Nature Conservancy awards
annually a number of postgraduate studentships.
The NERC is also responsible for the support of long-term forestry research
in consultation with the Forestry Commission; it has financial and policy
responsibility for the research in seismology and geomagnetism carried out
by the Meteorological Office and co-ordinates research in meteorology
generally with that carried out by the Meteorological Office. It is establishing
committees for each main activity, based on the body previously responsible.
Joint arrangements are being made between NERC and the Ministry of Land
and Natural Resources (see p. 55) about the work done by the Nature
Conservancy and the Geological Survey.
The past ten years have seen appreciable expansion of research in the social
sciences. These include: the purely social disciplines, such as economics,
demography, sociology, social anthropology, political science, and their
applications; the bio-social disciplines, such as social psychology and
personality and development psychology; and a third group, taking in social
and psychological medicine, social and industrial administration, market
research and management studies.
Several government departments have funds allocated for social research.
The Warren Spring Laboratory of the Ministry of Technology maintains a
register of British research which lists projects in hand in colleges, government
departments, industrial associations and firms. Other government departments
concerned include the Home Office, which has a large research unit which
carries out a wide variety of sociological studies, and the Central Office of
Information, with its Social Survey Division which conducts sample survey
inquiries at the request of government departments and from time to time
also carries out studies in collaboration with universities and other independent
research organisations.
An independent committee of inquiry, set up under the chairmanship of
Lord Heywood, to review research in social studies in government depart¬
ments, universities and other institutions, and to advise whether changes were
needed in arrangements for supporting and co-ordinating research, issued its
report in June 1965. The Government has accepted the Committee’s recom¬
mendations and a Social Science Research Council is being established under
the Science and Technology Act.

Among other research agencies may be mentioned the zoological societies
and scientific museums.
Zoological research is among the activities of the world-famous Zoological
Gardens, extending over 34 acres in Regent’s Park, London, which were
opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1828. A natural zoo of 500 acres
was opened in 1931 at Whipsnade, in Bedfordshire, by the Society. Among
other well-known zoos are those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester and Dudley,
and a small, private, natural zoo at Chessington, Surrey.
The British Museum (Natural History) is the principal centre in the
Commonwealth for the general study of natural history; it has extensive
collections of extant and fossil animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and
meteorites. The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and
applied science in all countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held
a leading place in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics,
and in the development of industrial machinery and processes, all of w hich
are represented in the museum’s collections. The geology of Britain is known
in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and the
Geological Survey, responsible for this work, has an outstanding collection of
exhibits in its Geological Museum. These three museums are in South
Kensington, London.
Important collections outside London are the Museum of Science and
Industry, in Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at
Oxford.
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume
of information has grown. The traditional method of scientific publication,
in which results are written up into papers and published in journals, is still the
main means of communication among scientists. The leading learned societies
have for long been important agencies for communicating scientific information.
The Ministry of Technology and the AEA devote considerable sums to
information services. The Department of Education and Science, through
the Office for Scientific and Technical Information, gives financial support
to ASLIB, which runs a technical information department and maintains a
panel of translators and a Commonwealth Index of Translations covering
scientific subjects. A national Reference Library for Science and Invention is
being formed, based on the Patent Office Library; it will be part of the
British Museum Library. There are plans for erecting a new building on the
south bank of the Thames. The National Lending Library for Science and
Technology, now under the Department of Education and Science, at
Boston Spa, Yorkshire, has been in full operation since 1962. It covers all
subjects in science and technology, and to some extent medicine, and is also
responsible for increasing the number of translations of foreign (especially
of Russian and Chinese) scientific literature, in which work it collaborates
with the National Science Foundation of the United States. A description of
the general library services, which also cater for scientific needs, is given
on p. 232. . U AT?A L
Besides information services provided by its various groups, the ALA has
an information centre and an isotope information bureau at its London
headquarters.

In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux
(see p. 222) provide abstracts and an information service in various branches
of agricultural science. The ARC publishes an Index of Agricultural Research
in Progress, and gives an account of current developments in its annual
reports. The advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research
results directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals; but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.

Several agencies assist in the commercial development and spread the use
of new inventions.
The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) was set up in
1949 under the Development of Inventions Act 1948, to secure the develop¬
ment and exploitation of inventions in the public interest. For this purpose
the Board of Trade was empowered to make advances of capital to the
Corporation. All functions of the Board of Trade in regard to NRDC were
transferred to the Ministry of Technology in February 1965. Capital of
£5 million, provided for during its first five years, was increased in 1958 to
million over twenty years. Under the Development of Inventions
Act 1965, the amount was increased to £25 million and the time limit
removed.
Projects so far sponsored by the Corporation include, among many others,
such varied items as Hovercraft, electronic digital computers, towed flexible
barges (known as dracones), interferon (an anti-viral agent), selective weed¬
killers, a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell as a transportable source of electricity
and a group of new antibiotics called cephalosporins, at least one of which,
Ceporin, is now commercially available. The Corporation has a substantial
annual income from the exploitation of inventions. In the case of Hovercraft
the NRDC has participated not only in early research and development but
in the subsequent activities of Hovercraft Development Limited, which it set
up to continue the work.
Britain plays a considerable part in overseas scientific collaboration, including
the exchange of scientific information. In areas of non-governmental collabora¬
tion, under the aegis of the International Council of Scientific Unions,
the primary representative of the United Kingdom is the Royal Society.
The Government is concerned with inter-governmental organisations:
these include specialised agencies of the United Nations (the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the World
Health Organisation (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission); the organisa¬
tions concerned with nuclear energy (the International Atomic Energy Agency,
and the European Nuclear Energy Agency), and space research, and the
proposed International Agency for Research on Cancer. There are agreements
between the United Kingdom AEA and other atomic energy authorities,
including that of the Soviet Union (and there are permanent representatives
of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in London and of the
United Kingdom AEA in Washington). In addition, there are inter¬
governmental agreements with Euratom, and bilateral agreements with other
countries. Britain is also represented on the Committee for Scientific and
Technical Personnel and on the Committee for Scientific Research of the
OECD.

The Commonwealth Scientific Committee (CSC) consisting of the heads of
the national research organisations of Commonwealth countries, formed in
1958 from the previous Standing Committee set up in 1946> meets biennially.
Operating under the CSC are: the Commonwealth Scientific Liaison Offices
and the various specialist committees on fuel research, mineral resources and
geology (including a Commonwealth Geological Liaison Office), mineral
processing and the collection of micro-organisms.
The secretariat for the Committee is provided by the Commonwealth
Scientific Liaison Offices.
A British Commonwealth Scientific Conference held in 1946 recommended
the continuance and extension of the scientific collaboration of the war years
by the creation of the Commonwealth Scientific Liaison Offices, a group now
consisting of the Scientific Liaison Offices of the various Commonwealth
countries together with the Overseas Liaison Group of the Department of
Education and Science.
The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux comprise three Institutes and ten
Bureaux, all of which except one bureau are in Britain and each of which is
concerned with a particular branch of agricultural science. Their purpose is
to act as clearing houses for the interchange of information of value to research
workers in agricultural science throughout the Commonwealth. This the\
achieve by scanning and indexing journals of scientific repute in all languages,
by keeping in touch with agricultural research in progress and by the dis¬
semination of this information by the periodic issue of Abstract Journals.
Fifteen Abstract Journals are published periodically and have a combined
annual circulation of about 22,500 copies. A list of research workers in agri¬
culture, animal health and forestry in the Commonwealth is published from
time to time, and this list includes an indication of topics under investigation
by the individual workers concerned. The Bureaux also issue monographs
on their own particular subjects and deal with inquiries received from
research workers in all parts of the Commonwealth. In addition, the Institutes
provide taxonomic and identification services.
One of the main aims of the Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM)
is the promotion of scientific research in the interests of developing countries.
The aid given covers specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits, confer¬
ences for exchange of information, training scientists from overseas in
universities and research institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from
Britain, and providing support for existing research services overseas, for
example, in East Africa and the Caribbean. Some equipment is also given to
encourage scientific training and applied research. The Department works
with the many specialist bodies concerned, particularly the research councils
and the Ministry of Technology. It administers and supports the work of,
for example, the Anti-Locust Research Centre in London, internationally
recognised as a world centre for locust research since 1931. The Tropical
Products Institute in London aims at improving the economical viability of
the less-developed countries of the tropics, especially those within the
Commonwealth, by research into new uses for tropical plant and animal
products. The ODM provides some ^2 million a year to support
research for the benefit of developing countries, mostly in agriculture and
medicine.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
223
The British
Council
The aims of the British Council in the sciences (including agriculture, medicine
and technology) are to foster co-operation between British scientists and
scientists of other countries, and to promote among overseas specialists a
better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific achievements.
In co-operation between scientists emphasis is placed on the interchange
of scientists between Britain and other countries. Overseas tours and advisory
visits by British specialists are arranged and scientists recruited for overseas
posts. In the other direction the Council invites senior specialists to Britain
for visits and discussions with British experts, and makes awards to post¬
graduate students; it also administers the programmes of a large number of
senior specialists and students who travel to Britain under the auspices of the
UN specialised agencies, or under various bilateral technical assistance
schemes, or as private individuals. A number of high-level scientific short
courses are organised each year for overseas specialists. The Council is also
responsible for administering travel grants awarded under the Foreign and
Commonwealth University Interchange Schemes. It is also increasingly con¬
cerned with science education at school level in the developing countries.
Information on Britain’s scientific achievements is provided either through
the Council’s overseas libraries or direct from the London headquarters
which includes specialist departments (and libraries) for medicine and science.
Material published or compiled by these London departments includes
British Medical Bulletin, British Medical Booklist, the universities section of
Scientific Research in British Universities and Colleges (see Bibliography), and
publications listing certain British training facilities.
THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
This section describes the assistance and encouragement given to the arts
by the Government, local authorities, voluntary societies and other
organisations. Although valuable support comes from private sources,
including trusts and commercial concerns, the Government and local
authorities are taking an increasingly active part. In October 1964, for the
first time, a minister was appointed to take a special interest in the arts.
The Government considers that its role is not ‘to dictate taste or restrict
the liberty of even the most unorthodox and experimental of artists’ but to
support the arts so that a high level of artistic achievement can be sustained
and the best in the arts made more widely available.1 Government support
to the arts can be grouped under three heads: education, preservation and
patronage.
The main educational functions are carried out in England and Wales
through the Department of Education and Science, in Scotland through the
Scottish Education Department and in Northern Ireland by the Ministry of
Education. In partnership with local education authorities and voluntary
bodies, they are concerned with schools, colleges of further education and
community centres. The Department of Education and Science is also
concerned with public libraries and is responsible for the Victoria and Albert
Museum, and the Scottish Education Department is responsible for the
Royal Scottish Museum.
The Government aids the preservation of Britain’s cultural heritage by
means of grants which largely finance most of the national museums and
galleries; through the Ministry of Public Building and Works, which looks

Contributions
after historic buildings and ancient monuments; and by giving financial help
to independent bodies concerned with preservation, such as the National
Trust. General help for the arts is given through government grants for
music, drama, painting and sculpture; these are channelled for the greater
part through the Arts Council, which contributes to the aspects of the arts
not provided for by other agencies. Other state-aided organisations include
the British Film Institute and the Council of Industrial Design.
Estimated government expenditure on the arts in Great Britain in 1965-66
was over ^i6|- million. Direct allocations included nearly £6 million for all
national museums and galleries, j£2§ million for the Arts Council and
million for the preservation of historic houses and ancient monuments.
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established under a Royal Charter
in 1946. Its members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Education
and Science, in consultation with the Secretaries of State for Scotland and
Wales. Its main objects are to develop in the public greater knowledge and
understanding of the fine arts, to improve the standard of execution and to
advise and co-operate with government departments, local authorities and
other organisations. The Council’s grant from the Government amounted to
£2-8 million in 1965-66.
The Arts Council of Northern Ireland, which has similar aims, receives
a grant from the Northern Ireland Government of £36,000, plus up to a
maximum of £14,500 on a £ for £ basis on contributions from local
authorities.
The British Council (see footnote, p. 173) takes an active part in displaying
overseas the best in British drama, music and the visual arts.
Municipalities play an important part in encouraging the arts. Under the
Local Government Act 1948 they may levy up to a sixpenny rate in England
and Wales (just under fivepence in Scotland) for expenditure on entertainment
in all its forms, including cultural activities. They may also spend money on
buildings for the arts and provide and maintain museums and art galleries.
As a rule local councils refrain from actual management of orchestras and
theatre companies (usually having a representative on the governing boards
or trusts concerned), but they often provide the buildings for the performance
of music or drama.
Birmingham, for example, has one of the finest museums in the country,
partly finances an orchestra, plans to build a new repertory theatre and has
made a loan to an amateur theatre; it is also contributing to an arts centre
for young people. Manchester completely finances a civic theatre, Sunderland
has added an arts centre to its museum and generously supports its theatre.
The London County Council (the Greater London Council since April 1965)
see p. 70) built the Royal Festival Hall and is building an arts centre on the
south bank of the River Thames (to comprise the National Theatre, an opera
house, a new concert hall and an exhibition gallery as well as the Festival
Hall); it contributes to the finances of three orchestras, supports several
museums, took the initiative over the National Theatre (see p. 236) and
commissions sculpture for its schools. The authorities for the new towns in
Great Britain have power to make contributions to the cost of amenities and
to appoint social development officers to make known the needs of voluntary
organisations.
There are many voluntary bodies concerned with promotion of the arts
including such charitable trusts and foundations as the Carnegie United

Kingdom Trust, the Pilgrim and Foyle Trusts, the United Kingdom branch
of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the Rayne Foundation. A large
number of organisations are concerned with separate aspects of the arts;
examples are mentioned later in this chapter. Some of their most valuable
work is done in assisting projects during the early stages. Industrial patronage,
including support from television companies, has increased considerably in
recent years.
The arts benefit most when the patrons—central and local government,
voluntary bodies, industry, the universities and individuals—combine. The
most outstanding example is the Edinburgh Festival Society; other arts
festivals which have developed a similar basis of responsibility are those of
Bath, Cheltenham, King’s Lynn, Leeds, Norwich and York.
A special venture in 1965 was the Commonwealth Arts Festival. Over
13,000 performers from 19 Commonwealth countries took part at festival
centres in London, Liverpool, Cardiff and Glasgow. Trades Councils, the
Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and others are supporting Centre 42, an
organisation started in 1962 at the suggestion of the Trades Union Congress.
Its aim is to bring the arts into the life of the community by means of local
festivals, but its first permanent centre will be in London.
Regional co-operation in arts patronage is growing. The pioneer organisa¬
tion was the North Eastern Association for the Arts which combines
representatives of local authorities, chambers of commerce, Tyne-Tees
Television Ltd., universities, industrial firms and trade unions. It helps to
support an orchestra, three arts centres and a theatre. Three other regional
arts associations have since been set up and the Government hopes to see
such bodies established on a country-wide basis.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, winning 53 international prizes since 1949 and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at
home has been stimulated by an increasingly lively attitude towards display
on the part of museums and galleries, and by the varied activities of many
institutions, societies and private galleries.
Painting and sculpture receive state support by grants to national institu¬
tions and, indirectly, through purchase grants made to local art galleries and
museums, to local education authorities for art schools and other means of
promoting education in art, and to the Arts Council, which takes an active
part by organising exhibitions and building up its own collection of con¬
temporary British art. The Government is advised on grants and matters of
policy by the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries and the Royal
Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland.
Knowledge of Britain’s fine arts is fostered overseas by the British Council’s
exhibitions and lectures. It also provides information and advice to inquirers
abroad and to visitors in Britain. In 1964-65, 44 fine art exhibitions organised
by the Council were shown in 50 countries and the Council was also
responsible for British participation in five international exhibitions.
Over 900 museums and art galleries are open to the public in Britain, though
many are only small collections.
There are 18 national museums and art galleries in Britain. Those in London
probably contain between them the most comprehensive collection of objects

of artistic, archaeological, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist
within one city. The British Museum has unparalleled collections of archaeo¬
logical and ethnographical material in addition to housing the national library
of printed books, manuscripts, newspapers and periodicals; its Department
of Prints and Drawings also possesses collections of the widest extent and
richness. The Victoria and Albert Museum contains works of fine and applied
art of all countries and periods, arranged mainly according to material,
though primary collections have been arranged to bring together, by style,
period or nationality, masterpieces of all the arts. The National Gallery
houses paintings by almost all the greatest European masters. The Tate
Gallery has collections of paintings of the British school from the eighteenth
century onwards, with a few earlier works, and modern foreign schools
(since 1850) and modern sculpture.
The other important national collections in London are the National
Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum,
the London Museum (to be amalgamated with the Guildhall Museum into
the Museum of London, with one collection illustrating the history and
archaeology of the capital, and which will be housed in the City), the \\ allace
Collection (furniture, armour, ohjets d’art and paintings, mainly French
works of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries); and the British Museum
(Natural History) and the Science Museum (see p. 220).
There are six national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland,
the Royal Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, the
Scottish United Services Museum, and the Scottish National Gallery of
Modern Art. The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at
St. Fagan’s Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed; and in Northern
Ireland there is the national Ulster Museum in Belfast.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (Tower of
London), the Public Record Office (see p. 232) and the Soane Museum.
Almost every city and large town has a museum devoted to art, archaeology
and natural history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes
by a local learned society or privately by individuals or trustees to whom some
wealthy collector in the past has bequeathed his treasures. Both Oxford and
Cambridge are rich in museums, mostly associated with the universities the
Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, is the oldest in the country
and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has fine art galleries and a notable
collection of engravings, manuscripts and books. Other universities ha\e
notable collections, primarily for teaching purposes but also open to the public.
There are important museums and art galleries in Birmingham, Bristol,
Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich, Southampton
and York. In Northern Ireland there are notable museums in or near Belfast
(the Ulster Folk Museum and the Northern Ireland Arts Council Gallery)
and in Armagh City. (
In recent years there has been a notable development of ‘period-house
museums’, for which outstanding private residences of former times have been
taken over by national and municipal authorities, as at Temple Nev sam
(Leeds), Aston Hall (Birmingham), and the Royal Pavilion (Brighton). Many
private art collections housed in historic family mansions (including those in
the ownership of the National Trust) are open to the public at certain times.
In 1962 a small but important gallery was opened in Buckingham Palace
for exhibition of pictures from the extensive royal collections.

The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum at Coventry, which opened in i960,
was the first to be built in Britain since 1939. Since i960 new, or extensively
altered, museums have been opened at Derby, Doncaster, Durham (the
Gulbenkian museum, at the University), Manchester (the Whitworth Art
Gallery) and Scunthorpe. New, or greatly extended, museums and galleries
are planned for Bristol, Hull, Liverpool, Belfast and Cardiff.
X function of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries is to
advise the Government on the relationship between national and provincial
institutions. Close relations are fostered by the seven area museum councils
so far established in Great Britain. They are grant-aided by the Government
and help to improve technical facilities.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas
members, is an independent organisation. The Association serves as a central
body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters relating
to museum administration, and as a training and examining body for
professional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions produced by the Arts Council, the Art Exhibitions
Bureau, and the Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum
are a regular feature of many museums.
In the year which ended on 31st March, 1965, the Arts Council arranged
71 separate art exhibitions in Great Britain, the most important of which
were at the Tate Gallery or its own gallery in London; 359 showings of these
exhibitions were given in 161 other centres. The Arts Council of Northern
Ireland arranged 15 exhibitions in Belfast, of which 4 toured 28 different
centres. All exhibitions at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in east London are
loan exhibitions (mainly of contemporary artists). The National Gallery and
British Museum also have loan exhibitions. The Greater London Council
exhibits modern sculpture in one of its parks every third year and is building
an exhibition gallery, due to be opened in 1966, as part of its arts centre.
Commercial exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists are held
throughout the year in the galleries of the art dealers of London (largely in
the Bond Street area).
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy,
which holds summer exhibitions of works by members and non-members and
winter exhibitions usually devoted to national schools of painting or the art
of a particular period; the Royal Scottish Academy; the Society of Scottish
Artists; the Royal Society of British Artists; the Royal Society of Painters
in Water Colours; the Royal Society of Portrait Painters; the Artists’ Inter¬
national Association; the Women’s International Art Club; and the London
Group (all the foregoing are associations of professional painters); and the
Institute of Contemporary Arts. Some of these societies, notably the Royal
Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in London. In
Northern Ireland there are the Royal Ulster Academy of Arts, the Ulster
Society of Women Artists and the Ulster Arts Club. Among regional societies
are the Newlyn Society of Artists, the Midland Group of Artists (Nottingham),
the Birmingham Society of Artists and the Penwith Society of Arts, while
an increasing number of amateur art societies throughout the United Kingdom
hold local exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts in various
ways. John Moore’s exhibition, held in Liverpool every two years, is open to
all British painters and sculptors and sets a high professional standard;
prizes are awarded. There are also exhibitions of children’s art, including the

All national collections are financed from government funds, both those that
are the direct responsibility of the Department of Education and Science
(the Victoria and Albert and the Science Museums) and those run by trustee
bodies. Besides meeting the administrative costs, this finance makes provision
for annual purchase grants, which rose from £125,000 in 1958-59 to nearly
£800,000 in 1965-66. The Government also provides special ad hoc purchase
grants and collections may receive certain pre-eminent works of art acquired
by the Treasury in lieu of estate duty. The buildings are maintained by the
Ministry of Public Building and Works. Local museums and art galleries can
be helped in building up their collections through the annual government
grant (£108,000 in 1965-66) administered by the Victoria and Albert and
Royal Scottish Museums.
The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust which has done much to encourage
the growth of museums during the past thirty years spends an average of
£10,000 a year for this purpose. Among voluntary bodies which buy pictures
for public collections are the National Art Collections Fund and the
Contemporary Art Society.
The Council of Industrial Design (CoID) was set up in 1944 by the President
of the Board of Trade as a grant-aided body to improve British industrial
design. The Council has 29 members, a majority being prominent industrialists,
and there is a separate Scottish committee. The CoID runs exhibitions and
displays at the Design Centre, in the Haymarket, London. There is a selective,
changing display of well-designed British consumer goods in current
production. Supplementing it and maintained at the Centre is an illustrate
record of good design, known as Design Index. Up to 20 Design Centre
Awards are presented annually to the makers of outstanding products in the
Index and an additional award, the Duke of Edinburgh s Prize for Elegant
Design, is presented annually to the designer of a single product chosen from
the Index. A recent development at the Design Centre is the series of
exhibitions showing in detail particular design problems in both the consumer
and capital goods industries. There is a Scottish Design Centre in Glasgow ,
and there are permanent design exhibitions in Bristol, Nottingham and
Manchester which function independently but have duplicates of Design
Index. The CoID organises conferences, courses and exhibitions in Britain
and overseas, and maintains a record of designers and a photographic and
reference library on industrial design. It has an education section, a retail
section and publishes a monthly magazine, Design.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society
of Arts (see p. 207), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is
the representative professional body in Great Britain of designers engage
in industry and commerce, and the Design and Industries Association (D1A),
a voluntary association of industrial companies, designers, and others interested
in the promotion of good design in industry. The Crafts Council of Great
Britain, which runs the Craft Centre at Hay Hill, London, is a voluntary
body. Its aims are to improve the standard of craft design and to promote
closer relations between craftsmen and industry.
Formal art education is given in publicly supported art colleges, university
art schools, the Royal Academy Schools and a few private art schools. I here

are the regional colleges and local art schools and classes administered by the
local education authorities; and at a senior level there is the Royal College
of Art, London, whose students have usually completed a course at a local
education authority college. (The Royal College of Art is to be financed in
the same way as the universities, see p. 166.) Art is also taught at an advanced
level at the four Scottish Central (Art) Institutions administered by the
Scottish Education Department. University art schools include the Slade
School of Fine Art and Goldsmiths College (London), the Ruskin Drawing
School (Oxford), the Reading School of Art, the Department of Fine Art of
the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and the School of Art of University
College, Aberystwyth.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history
of art are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department
of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the
Warburg Institute, also a part of London University.
The structure of publicly supported art education has recently been under
review. In England three-year full-time courses leading to a Diploma in Art
and Design were instituted in 1963 and are available to students who have
successfully completed a pre-diploma course. A post-diploma qualification
will soon be available. The Diploma is broadly comparable to a university
pass degree, and is administered by the National Council for Diplomas in
Art and Design (an independent self-governing body set up by the then
Minister of Education in 1961). In Scotland each of the four schools of art
awards a diploma which is roughly equivalent to the pass degree of a
university.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school, and the Society
for Education through Art, among other activities, encourages the purchase
by schools of original works of art by organising an annual Pictures for
Schools exhibition. A loan scheme for reproductions of works of art which is
used extensively by schools is operated by the Arts Council.
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned with
encouraging the best in new building and preserving the best that has been
inherited from the past.
Several government departments are concerned with domestic architecture
and help to promote good design in various ways, such as the award of
medals for housing design. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government,
the Scottish Development Department, and the Northern Ireland Ministry
of Development are responsible in their respective countries for approving
the layout and design of local authority housing schemes, and issue reports
and circulars setting standards for local authority housing. The Ministry of
Housing and Local Government has under its chief architect a research and
development group responsible for examining methods of building more
cheaply, and for maintaining a high standard of design. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works is responsible for the design, building and
maintenance work of all government departments and has a research and
development group under an architect Director-General which co-ordinates
research and development groups throughout the government service. The
Architects and Building Branch at the Department of Education and Science
and the Development Group of the Scottish Education Department carry
out research and development for the school building programmes. The
Ministry of Health is carrying out a very large building programme and the
Regional Hospital Boards, through their architectural departments, are

responsible for the design and construction of a large number of hospitals
and ancillary buildings. < . -ui.nl
Government departments are assisted in an advisory capacity by the Royal
Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland, which also
advise planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of public
amenity or artistic importance. Many large-scale modern buildings have had
the approval of the commissions. . .
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions
exist to further the interests of architecture.
The Minister of Public Building and Works has duties in connection with
the preservation of ancient monuments and historic buildings in Great
Britain; in Northern Ireland this responsibility is vested in the Ministry o
Finance. The Treasury has powers to accept historic houses and their
collections of works of art in lieu of death duties; such properties are normally
transferred to the National Trusts (see p. 186). The Royal Commissions on
Ancient and Historical Monuments for England and for Wales and Mon¬
mouthshire record in detail all ancient and historical remains in their
countries and publish a series of surveys. They are responsible for the National
Buildings Record, maintaining and enlarging the library of over half a million
photographs of English and Welsh architecture, and keeping an index of
architectural records in public and private possession. The Royal Commission
on the Ancient and Historical Buildings of Scotland has the same responsi¬
bilities as the English and Welsh Commissions, but the National Buildings
Record for Scotland is maintained by the Ministry of Public Building and
Works The Ancient Monuments Boards for England, Scotland, and Wales,
set up under the Ancient Monuments Acts, consider which monuments
should be listed in accordance with those Acts and advise the Minister ot
Public Building and Works on questions concerning ancient monuments.
In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Finance administers the Ancient
Monuments Acts (Northern Ireland) and is advised by the Ancient Monu¬
ments Advisory Council. The Historic Buildings Councils for England,
Scotland, and Wales, constituted under the Historic Buildings and Ancient
Monuments Act 1953, advise the Minister of Public Building and Works on
such questions as the provision of grants towards the repair or maintenance
of buildings of outstanding historic or architectural interest. The His one
Buildings Council for Scotland also advises the Secretary of State for Scotland
on the exercise of his functions relating to such buildings under the planning
Acts. A Historic Buildings Bureau looks for new uses for unoccupied historic
buildings of outstanding interest. , . . ,
There are many voluntary preservation bodies, both local and national, sue
as the Georgian Group, the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings,
and the National Trust in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the
National Trust for Scotland, which together own more than a hundred
houses of historic or architectural interest, many of which contain pictures
and other works of art. Most of these houses, and a number of other ancestral
homes, are open to the public at a small charge and attract large numbers of
visitors The Historic Churches Preservation Trust was formed in 1952 to
raise funds to supplement the efforts of parishes to put their churches into
good repair: by the end of 1964, it had allocated about ^800,000 to about
1,700 churches and chapels of various religious denominations.
The Civic Trust seeks to promote high standards in architecture and ci\ic
planning and to encourage a wider interest in the appearance of towns,

villages and the countryside. The Trust makes awards for good architectural
design in housing layout, planning developments and improvement schemes.
A Civic Trust for Wales was established in 1964 and there are 550 local civic
societies which, though independent, have similar aims and are advised and
encouraged by the Civic Trust.
In Britain it is illegal for a person to practise under the title of ‘architect’
unless registered with the Architects’ Registration Council of the United
Kingdom. Most students train at a full-time school of architecture, of which
there are 29 recognised for exemption from the Intermediate and Final
examinations of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and three
recognised for the intermediate examination only. In addition, there are
40 schools of art and technical institutes (eight full-time) which prepare
students for the external examinations of the RIBA.
The Royal Institute of British Architects is the leading professional
architectural institution in Britain. Allied to it are 50 autonomous societies
covering the whole of the United Kingdom and most of the overseas
Commonwealth. Membership is 21,000 with some 6,000 students. It has one
of the largest and most important architectural libraries in the world housing
70,000 books and periodicals and many thousands of drawings. The RIBA
is concerned with a wide range of activities covering professional practice,
science, technology, statistics, architectural competitions, professional and
public relations; arranges lectures and discussions on a variety of subjects,
presents exhibitions and, through its Board of Architectural Education,
controls the training and examination of architects. The Royal Gold Medal
for Architecture is awarded annually by the Queen on the recommendation
of the RIBA. Among other associations are the Incorporated Association of
Architects and Surveyors, the Institute of Registered Architects and the
Faculty of Architects and Surveyors. Societies include the Architectural
Association, the Architecture Club, and several which cover particular
aspects of architecture, such as the Modular Society.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges
and universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country,
private libraries and a large number of private literary societies. Book reviews
are featured in the press and on radio and television and there are numerous
periodicals concerned in whole or in part with literature.
Government support is given through the Arts Council which makes
triennial awards for the best books of poetry published and provides bursaries
for poets, encourages poetry readings and subsidises the Poetry Book
Society. It has founded a reference and lending library of modern English
poetry (see p. 232) and in 1963 collaborated with the British Museum in
setting up a national collection of contemporary poets’ manuscripts.
Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given in the form of literary
prizes, a number of which are awarded annually, for instance, the Queen’s
Gold Medal for Poetry, the James Tait Black Memorial prizes for biography
and literature, the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial prize for young writers of
promise, the Hawthornden prize for imaginative writing, the Winston
Spencer Churchill Literary Award for an outstanding work in the history
of the English-speaking peoples, the Library Association Carnegie Medal
for an outstanding book for children, the Kate Greenaway Medal for the
best children’s book illustration and the Somerset Maugham award for young
writers.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The British Museum Library in London (over 7 million volumes) is the largest
in Britain. The National Library of Scotland (over 2 million volumes) is in
Edinburgh, and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (nearly 2 million volumes).
Together with the Bodleian Library of Oxford University million
volumes) and the Cambridge University Library (2! million volumes) these
comprise the ‘copyright’ libraries of the country and are entitled to receive
a copy of each new book published in Britain: the British Museum Library
must receive a copy, the other libraries may claim one.
Other national libraries are the National Lending Library for Science
and Technology (see p. 220), the Patent Office Library (see p. 220) and the
National Central Library (see p. 234).
The Science Museum, Victoria and Albert and the British Museum
(Natural History) in South Kensington all have large libraries and many
government departments have old-established libraries of considerable size
and importance, for example those of the Board of Trade, Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and War Office (now in the War Department
of the Ministry of Defence). The Public Record Office contains the non-
current records of the superior courts of law and of most of the government
departments, as well as such famous historical documents as Domesday
Book; it also houses the National Register of Archives (maintained by the
Historical Manuscripts Commission) which contains particulars of numerous
local and private records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the John Rylands
Library, Manchester, and the Signet Library, Edinburgh, there are the rich
resources of the learned societies and institutions.1 Examples are the libraries
of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Royal Commonwealth
Society, the Commonwealth Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the
Royal Institute of British Architects (see p. 231), the British Drama League
(see p. 237), the Royal College of Music, Royal Academy of Music, the Central
Music Library (administered by Westminster City Council), the National
Library for the Blind and the National Book League, which also houses the
Arts Council library of modern poetry.
The great expansion in education in recent years has increased the strain on
library resources at all levels of education. The ancient university libraries
of Oxford and Cambridge are not matched by any of the more recent founda¬
tions, although the combined library resources of the colleges and institutions
of the University of London total over 3! million volumes and the university
libraries of Edinburgh, St. Andrews, Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool,
Manchester and Leeds each have over half a million volumes. However,
many universities have succeeded in building up large and important research
collections in special subjects; for example the Barnes Medical Library at
Birmingham and the Brotherton Library of English Literature at Leeds.
The new universities are also rapidly building initial collections, and the
University Grants Committee (see p. 167) has a library committee to consider
university library problems in relation to university development and
expansion.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, give instruction in the use of libraries. This service is often
organised by the public library and stock and staff are common to both
services. The Inner London Education Authority has a school library stock

of 200,000 volumes and is the largest single employer of qualified librarians
in the country. Liaison between schools and public libraries is frequent in
most areas and parties of schoolchildren are regularly introduced to the
public library system, which they can use in addition to the school library.
Britain is served by a complete network of public libraries, administered by
over 500 public library authorities (county councils, county borough councils,
London borough councils, municipal borough councils and urban district
councils). The authorities in Great Britain, which provide more than 40,000
service points, have a total stock of nearly 80 million books. (These figures
do not include the libraries in the publicly maintained schools.) Nearly
one-third of the total population are currently registered members of public
libraries.
Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964, which implemented
the principal recommendations of the Roberts Report on the Structure of the
Public Library Service in England and Wales (Cmnd. 660, HMSO, 1959)’
the Secretary of State for Education and Science is charged with the super¬
vision of the public library service in England and Wales from 1st April, 1965.
Under the Act, public library authorities are designated and have a duty to
provide an efficient and free lending and reference library service for books
and periodicals. The Secretary of State, who is assisted by two advisory
councils, has accepted the Standards of Public Library Service in England
and Wales (HMSO, 1962—the recommendations made by a Working Party)
as the level of service to be provided by library authorities.
Rural areas are served by a number of means including the travelling van
or mobile library; about 350 vehicles are now in service. Public libraries also
send books by post. There are facilities for people who cannot normally get
to public libraries, including people in hospitals, prisons and borstals, and,
especially in Scotland, those on many of the off-shore lighthouses and islands.
In addition to lending books, about a quarter of the library authorities now
lend gramophone records of various kinds and a growing number are adding
loan collections of works of art, either originals or reproductions. Nearly all
library authorities provide children’s departments and reference libraries and
many of the larger towns have built up collections of national importance in
various subjects. Art, music, commercial and technical departments are being
provided in increasing numbers to meet growing and more specific demands
and nearly every library authority possesses a significant collection of books
and documents illustrating the local history of its area. Qualified and
specialist staff are available for consultation in all but the smallest libraries.
The city libraries of Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, the Guildhall
Library of the City of London, Hull, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield
and Westminster have especially large and important collections.
The public library is often a local cultural centre. Film shows, lectures,
adult education classes, book-week exhibitions, drama groups, gramophone
recitals and children’s story hours are among the many activities. About one
in five public libraries provides special facilities for these extension activities.
Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964, statutory recognition is
given to the hitherto voluntary system of library co-operation in England
and Wales which has grown up since the first quarter of this century. The
ten existing regional library bureaux in England and Wales (consisting
mainly of public libraries in each area) aim to be largely self-sufficient in
the interlending of current British books by means of a national system of
subject specialisation. They organise co-operation through their own member
234

libraries and through the National Central Library, which is responsible for
interlending at national and international level and has a bookstock of its
own of nearly 300,000 volumes built up by purchase, gift and the operation of
the British National Book Centre exchange scheme with foreign libraries. The
combined resources of libraries available to the interlending machinery of
the National Central Library, which includes university, industrial and other
non-public libraries, amount to some 100 million books and many thousand
sets of periodicals. It is envisaged that under the 1964 Act the regional bureaux
will be replaced by fewer, larger, regional councils.
There is a growing number of local co-operative schemes outside the normal
framework of interlending. These are associations of industrial and com¬
mercial libraries combining their resources normally through the agency of
the local public or technical college library so that specialist books and
periodicals as well as information are made available to participating members.
There are some 20 of these schemes varying in scope, some of the better
known being centred on Sheffield, Acton (London), Liverpool, Newcastle,
Hull, Nottingham, Bradford, Bristol, Hertford and Coventry.
The Scottish Central Library carries out, in Scotland, functions similar
to those of the regional bureaux and of the National Central Library. Both
Central Libraries are financed in part by Exchequer grants. In Northern
Ireland there is no equivalent to the National Central Library and no regional
library bureaux; access to the stocks of all co-operating libraries is available
on application to the Belfast public libraries, Queen’s University Library
and the county libraries.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association, which
was granted a Royal Charter in 1898 to unite all persons engaged or interested
in library work; to promote the better administration of libraries and, inter
alia, to hold examinations in librarianship and to issue certificates of efficiency.
The Association in 1965 had a membership of over 15,000, of whom 2,000
were from overseas countries. It maintains a Register of Chartered Librarians,
publishes books and pamphlets, a Yearbook and an official journal, The
Library Association Record. The Association and its branches, groups and
sections hold regular conferences in various parts of the United Kingdom.
There are also associations of libraries of which the Association of Special
Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB, see p. 220) and the Standing
Conference of National and University Libraries (SCONUL) are of major
importance.
New books constitute the large majority of all books published in Britain.
In 1964 nearly 1,100 British publishers issued 26,154 separate titles, of which
20,894 were new books and the rest reprints or new editions. In recent
years there has been a great increase in the number of paperbacked books
of all kinds.
The above figures include only a small selection of government publications
by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, which is the largest publishing organisa¬
tion in Britain. The great majority of books, however, are produced by about
300 of the principal commercial publishers. These include the university
presses, notably the Oxford University Press (including the Clarendon Press)
and the Cambridge University Press.
Using the copies deposited under copyright law in the British Museum,
the British National Bibliography is published weekly, with three, six, nine
and twelve monthly cumulations, listing in a classified order, with indexes, all
new books and new editions, excluding reprints, of books published in Britain.

Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the
Booksellers’ Association. The Society of Authors is a professional association
of writers. The National Book League has a membership covering all who are
interested in books: authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and readers.
It encourages an interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain and
some overseas. Knowledge of British books and periodicals overseas is greatly
assisted by the British Council through the lending and reference libraries
(about 180) run or supplied by it, and through the many book and periodicals
exhibitions which it tours overseas. (For sales and exports of books in 1964)
see p. 325.)
Societies for the promotion of literature include: the English Association and
the Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of
Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies, generally known as the
British Academy, is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives
a grant from the Treasury.
A number of societies sponsor poetry readings and recitals; the Poetry
Society, the Apollo Society and the Barrow Poets are among the best known.
Poetry also plays an important part in various annual festivals, including the
National Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales—the Stratford-upon-
Avon Festival of Poetry, the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, and the
biennial poetry festival organised by the Poetry Book Society in London.
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. There are a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book
Society and the Poetry Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new
books to their members.
Government support for drama is given through the Arts Councils of Great
Britain and of Northern Ireland which grant subsidies to certain theatrical
managements operating on a non-profit-distributing basis (that is, using
profits to finance future productions), provided that such managements have
given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high standards of practical
competence. The Arts Council of Great Britain operates a scheme to promote
new drama: guarantees may be offered to managements giving the first pro¬
fessional production of selected new plays; and promising authors may be
awarded bursaries. Schemes are also in operation to train stage designers,
producers and those wishing to take up theatre administration. Subsidies are
given for parties travelling to the theatre from outlying districts.
The British Council makes the British theatre better known abroad by
organising and sponsoring international tours by important companies such
as the Royal Shakespeare Theatre Company, and by sending overseas drama
lecturers and exhibitions of theatrical design or of books dealing with the
British theatre, and by providing newly published plays through its overseas
libraries.
There are about 200 professional theatres in Britain. The centre of theatrical
activity is in London, where there are some 30 principal theatres in the
‘West End’ and several more in the suburbs, but important developments
are taking place in the provinces. In London, with six exceptions (Covent
Garden, Sadler’s Wells, the Old Vic, the Royal Court, the Mermaid and the
-36
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Aldwych) the theatres are let to some 25 producing managements on a
commercial basis for each production.
Among London companies receiving Arts Council grants are the English
Stage Company, which produces contemporary plays mainly at the Royal
Court Theatre, the Mermaid, the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare
Theatre Company.
The National Theatre Company was formed in 1963; it will eventually
play in the new National Theatre, to be built on the south bank of the Thames
in London. The capital costs of the theatre will be met mainly by the
Exchequer and the Greater London Council; grants towards the Company s
running costs are being made by the Arts Council and the Greater London
Council. The Company, whose repertoire consists of classical and modern
plays from all countries, is large enough for simultaneous productions to be
undertaken in London (at the Old Vic Theatre) and in the provinces or
overseas. Provincial tours are seen as an important part of its function as a
National Theatre.
The Royal Shakespeare Company presents Shakespearean plays at the
Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, and international classical
and modern plays at the Aldwych Theatre, London. It will eventually have a
permanent London home in the proposed City of London arts centre in the
Barbican. Since 1964 world-famous companies have presented their own plays
in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre Company’s World Theatre Season at the
Aldwych.
The provincial theatres are served by productions touring either before or
after London presentation, by companies specially formed for touring, and
by local repertory companies. An important development is the growth of
the civic theatre. The term is generally taken to include some companies which
have the use of their own theatres (as in Bristol, Lincoln, Liverpool, Notting¬
ham, Salisbury, Perth and Birmingham) or rent them from a local authority
on favourable terms, and those like the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, which
was built by the city council and where the activities include drama study
and teaching (see p. 238). Many of these companies are assisted by the Arts
Council. London managements watch their activities and may sometimes
bring their productions to the West End. Many of the leading dramatists,
producers, designers, actors and actresses in Britain started their careers in
such companies, whose work influences current theatrical practice.
A number of new theatres have been opened both in London and the
provinces in recent years, including, in London, the Mermaid Theatre and
the completely reconstructed Queen’s Theatre. Coventry’s Belgrade Theatre,
opened in 1958, was the first full-scale theatre to be built by a civic authority
since 1939. Since then civic theatres have been built at Croydon, Eastbourne
and Torquay, and smaller theatres have been opened at Middlesbrough,
Richmond (Yorkshire) and Whitehaven (Cumberland). The new Nottingham
Playhouse and the Phoenix Theatre, Leicester, opened in 1963 and the
Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, at Guildford, in 1965. New theatres are being
built or planned for Birmingham, Bromley, Plornchurch, Ipswich, Manchester
and Norwich. A Festival Theatre opened in 1962 at Chichester, Sussex.
Entertainments centres to include theatres are proposed for Bolton, Blackpool,
Bradford, Exeter and Sheffield.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Group Theatre in Belfast specialises in
Ulster comedy; and the Belfast Arts Theatre presents some international
drama and lighter theatrical entertainment. The Lyric Players Theatre, a
non-profit-making organisation, under a board of trustees, presents Irish and

international drama, and plans to build a small theatre in or near Belfast.
All professional theatres are eligible for grants in respect of specific productions
approved by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
All plays are subject to the provisions of the Theatres Act 1843, which deals
with the licensing of theatres and plays and requires all new plays to be
approved by the Lord Chamberlain,1 who may forbid the presentation of any
play ‘for the preservation of good manners, decorum, or of the public peace’.
In the commercial theatre, the Lord Chamberlain may require amendments to
be made to the text of a play, but the number of plays for which a licence is
refused amounts to under one per cent of the total submitted. He does not,
however, exercise his powers over theatre clubs for regular patrons, some of
which are run in connection with some of the company-owned theatres and
where seats are sold only to theatre club members (for instance, the Arts
Theatre, London).
Most managers and artists are members of professional organisations such
as the Theatres’ Advisory Council, the London Theatre Council, the Pro¬
vincial Theatre Council, the Society of West End Managers, the Theatrical
Managers’ Association, the Council of Repertory Theatres, British Actors’
Equity (the actors’ trade union) and the League of Dramatists. The trade
union of theatre staffs is the National Association of Theatrical and Kine
Employees.
Amateur
Theatre
Dramatic
Training
and Study
There are thousands of amateur dramatic societies in Britain with an active
membership of some half a million. They are encouraged by local education
authorities, by other public bodies, and by four special organisations—the
British Drama League, the Standing Conference of Drama Associations,
the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association of Ulster
Drama Festivals. Amateur companies which stage productions in their own
theatres belong to the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain; for instance,
the Maddermarket Theatre in Norwich and the Questor’s Theatre, Ealing,
which opened in 1964 and is London’s most up-to-date theatre, designed for
completely flexible staging.
The British Drama League, founded in 1919, has both affiliated and
individual members. It arranges courses, lectures and competitions in
dramatic work; it has a library with the largest collection in Britain of plays
and books on the theatre, and an information bureau; it also gives advice on
playwriting, production, stage management and the organisation of drama
festivals. The Standing Conference co-ordinates the various bodies concerned
in the amateur dramatic movement. Functions similar to those of the league
and the conference in England and Wales are fulfilled in Scotland by the
Scottish Community Drama Association, which receives some financial
assistance from the Scottish Education Department.
Most universities have active amateur drama clubs and societies; those at
Oxford and Cambridge are among the most famous. In 1959 Bristol inaugurated
the International Festival of University Theatre, now held annually in
Britain.
Dramatic training is provided mainly in the dramatic schools and institutions
established throughout Britain. Among the most important are the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art (which is grant-aided by the Department of

Training College, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, the
Webber-Douglas School, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the
Arts Educational Schools, all of which are in or near London; and the Old
Vic School in Bristol. In Scotland there is the College of Dramatic Art which
is an integral part of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music in Glasgow and
is grant-aided by the Scottish Education Department.
An increasing degree of recognition is given to dramatic training by
universities. The University of London offers a Diploma in Dramatic Art;
Bristol University has a department of drama offering a course which an
arts student may take as part of a general degree course. Manchester
University offers courses in drama for honours or general arts degree students,
and a diploma course in Theatrecraft (embracing sound and television
broadcasting). The University of Hull has also recently established a
Department of Drama with courses leading to degrees or diplomas, and an
advanced course in Drama in Schools is offered by the University of Durham.
Hull University is building a theatre of its own; Exeter University’s theatre,
like the recently completed Nuffield Theatre at Southampton, is for the use
of both students and the public.
The Society for Theatre Research brings together those interested in the
history and technique of the British theatre. The International Theatre
Institute has a British centre in London. Its headquarters are in Paris and
there are 44 member countries. The main purpose of the institute is to foster
international goodwill and understanding by interchange of students,
theatrical companies, theatre personnel and all theatrical information. The
British centre’s committee is composed of representatives of the Arts Council,
British Council, League of British Dramatists, British Drama League,
Conference of Repertory Theatres and representatives of the theatre.
Many schools and youth clubs put on plays and provide some education in
drama. In 1964 a new drama centre for the London education service opened
at Toynbee Hall in east London. At Coventry special productions are arranged
for schoolchildren and members of the Belgrade Theatre’s staff teach at local
schools; there is also an advisory service for school productions. Nottingham
has a Youth Theatre Workshop.
A large number of organisations such as the Unicorn Theatre Trust and
Shakespeare for Schools present children’s plays in London and the
provinces. The National Youth Theatre, consisting of schoolboys, presents
Shakespearean productions in London, the provinces and abroad.
Music in all its forms draws large audiences; and music festivals, orchestral
concerts, choral singing, brass bands, opera and ballet are important features
of British cultural life. The increase in musical appreciation among the general
public during recent years is shown by the size of the audiences for concerts
and for broadcast music. About 101 million gramophone records were
produced during 1964. The National Federation of Gramophone Societies
has about 350 affiliated societies.
The City of Westminster houses the Central Music Library which lends to
other libraries and individuals. Another well-known music collection is the
Henry Watson Music Library at the Manchester Central Library. Many
other public libraries have collections of music that can be borrowed, and
an increasing number also lend gramophone records.

PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 239
The Arts Council makes grants to a number of symphony orchestras,
opera and ballet companies, and music societies. The British Council gives
financial assistance to some of the overseas tours of British orchestras, soloists,
and opera and ballet companies; it sponsors some recordings of works by
British composers, and maintains 127 libraries of British music (scores and
records) in 83 countries overseas and, at its London headquarters, a reference
library of records, scores and books on music. Musicians from abroad are
sometimes invited to Britain as the Council’s guests.
The National Music Council, representative of every aspect of British
musical activity, is affiliated to the International Music Council and
UNESCO.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities of Britain. In London the principal concert halls are the
Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, used for both orchestral
concerts and recitals; the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington, where mainly
orchestral concerts, including the annual summer season of Promenade
Concerts, are given; and the Wigmore Hall, which is the principal recital
centre. An additional small concert hall and a recital room are being built by
the Greater London Council on the south bank of the Thames.
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the
London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic, the New Philharmonia (formed
in 1964 from the Philharmonia), the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle
(Manchester), the City of Birmingham Symphony, the Bournemouth Sym¬
phony, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle upon Tyne), the Scottish National
and the BBC Symphony, Northern and Scottish orchestras. There are also
specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the Philomusica of
London, the English Chamber Orchestra and the London Mozart Players,
and a number of new orchestras which have been formed during the past
few years. Many of these receive financial aid from the Arts Council and
local authorities to help with the cost of maintaining ensembles, of presenting
new or unfamiliar works, and of improving standards generally; some of them
also receive assistance from commercial television and other business organisa¬
tions. The City of Belfast Orchestra is financed jointly by the Belfast
Corporation and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC
Choral, the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic
Choir, the London Philharmonic Choir, the New Philharmonia Chorus
(formed in 1964 from the Philharmonia), the Bach Choir, the Royal Edinburgh
Choral Union and the Belfast Philharmonic Society. These and many other
choral societies are associated with famous orchestras in major choral works;
most of them, together with hundreds of similar choral and orchestral societies
and music clubs, are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies,
through which they are supported with funds provided by the Arts Council.
Membership of the National Federation has risen to about 900 societies.
Among societies which specialise in encouraging the performance of the work
of living musicians are the Society for the Promotion of New Music, the Music
Section of the Institute of Contemporary Arts and Macnaghten Concerts.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in
existence for over 200 years. The festival idea has developed considerably
in recent years, and festivals of music and other arts are now held annually in

many cities and towns throughout the United Kingdom. The famous Edin¬
burgh International Festival lasts three weeks; other festivals such as at
King’s Lynn, last a week or less. Among the better known are the Royal
National Eisteddfod of Wales; the Llangollen International Eisteddfod; the
National Gaelic Mod, held at a different place in Scotland each year;
the Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted to contemporary British music; the
Aldeburgh Festival; the Bath Festival; the Coventry Festival; the Haslemere
Festival; the biennial York Festival; and the Leeds and Norwich Festivals of
choral music, which are held triennially. An annual international festival of
folk song and dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by the work of County
Music Committees,1 which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music. The
Rural Music Schools Association is concerned with music-making by
amateurs in country districts; it brings together professional musicians,
teachers, administrators and amateurs.
Professional organisations which look after the interests of music and
musicians include the Musicians’ Union, the Incorporated Society of
Musicians, the Composers’ Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London, leased by the Government2 to the Royal Opera
House, Covent Garden, Limited, which was formed in 1944 to make the
famous opera house the home of a national opera and ballet, and which
receives a government grant through the Arts Council. The Royal Opera
House has its own resident opera company and ballet company which give
performances in London and elsewhere. The opera company, wdiich numbers
about 200 and has a permanent orchestra, makes an annual tour of provincial
centres. The ballet company, incorporated in 1957 with the Sadler’s Wells
Theatre Ballet and the Sadler’s Wells School to form the Royal Ballet, has
a high international reputation gained in many overseas tours.
Seasons of opera are also given at the Sadler’s Wells Theatre in London,
with two permanent opera companies, Sadler’s Wells provides a full London
season, and opera and operetta for 42 weeks in other centres.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international
cast is specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies
include the English Opera Group, formed in 1947, and noted for its perform¬
ances of operas by Benjamin Britten; the New Opera Company, formed in
1057 by members of the Cambridge Opera Group to produce new operas
in London and give opportunities to promising amateurs and young pro¬
fessionals; the Handel Opera Society; the Intimate Opera Company, which
performs works for very small casts in any hall available; and the Welsh
National Opera Company. The Scottish Opera Society presents annual
seasons in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted by
the Grand Opera Society of Northern Ireland and the Studio Opera Group,
both receiving a subsidy from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. The
Arts Council (Great Britain) manages three small operatic groups (Opera for
All) which specialise in introducing opera to audiences in small towns who

hitherto have been unfamiliar with it. There are also a number of amateur
opera clubs in London and the provinces, in Glasgow and Edinburgh, in
Northern Ireland and in universities.
Among other ballet companies are the Ballet Rambert, Britain’s oldest
ballet company, which has discovered many distinguished dancers and
choreographers, London’s Festival Ballet and two companies specialising in
contemporary works, the Western Theatre Ballet and the recently formed
London Dance Theatre. The work of the Patricia Mulholland Irish Ballet
Company in Northern Ireland, which is sponsored by the Arts Council of
Northern Ireland, combines traditional music, dancing and mime.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the
most prominent are the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of
Music in London, the Royal Manchester College, and the Royal Scottish
Academy of Music in Glasgow; all are grant-aided. There are also the Trinity
College of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, both in
London, and the School of Music in Birmingham.
The London Opera Centre for Advanced Training and Development was
opened in 1963. It shares some facilities with the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden. Its courses last two or three years.
The leading ballet schools are the Royal Ballet and the Rambert Ballet
Training Schools and they have played an important part in raising British
ballet to its present high standard.
Other schools offering general education combined with drama and/or
ballet are run by the Arts Educational Trust, the Corona Staff Schools and
the Italia Conti School.
Young people are encouraged to take an interest in music, opera and ballet.
There are frequent children’s concerts, given by symphony orchestras directed
by prominent conductors. The National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain
and the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, made up of the most promising
members of school orchestras, are noted for their high standard of performance,
and so is the London Schools’ Symphony Orchestra. A Youth and Music
organisation, affiliated to the international Jeunesses Musicales encourages
musical education and performances for young people.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and
over 120,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the exam¬
inations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, the largest
proportion (over 70,000) choosing the piano as their instrument.
The Royal Ballet has recently sponsored a new organisation, Ballet for All,
to give lecture-demonstrations, mainly to schools.
Although cinema attendance has been steadily declining in Great Britain
since its peak of 1,635 million in 1946 to 408 million in 1965, and the number
of cinemas has declined from 4,709 in 1946 to 2,056 in March 1965, British
films, actors and creative and technical talent are appreciated both at home and
abroad and frequently achieve success at international film events. Television
offers very large potential audiences for films and provides opportunities of
employment for technicians and actors.
Cinematograph films were first shown to the public in Britain in 1896, and
within ten years Britain was in the forefront of film production, but this early
ascendancy did not survive the impact of the first world war and since 1914
British films have had to contend with keen competition in the home market

from the United States. However, London is one of the most important centres
for the making of films for international markets and export earnings are an
important part of total earnings. The British Film Producers Association
and the Federation of British Film Makers are the two trade associations to
which many feature film producers belong.
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back
to 1929, when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive
and imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial
organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since
then, British documentary technicians have continued to produce high
quality factual films which have won numerous international awards. An
interesting development has been the attempt to re-interpret the documentary
tradition in contemporary terms by a group of young technicians—the Free
Cinema movement-—and by the television film units of the British Broad¬
casting Corporation and the Independent Television Authority programme
companies. The Federation of Specialised Film Associations, the trade
association of documentary, short, industrial, advertising and cartoon film
makers, has about 100 members.
Films from abroad made in languages other than English often draw large
audiences in London and a few other large cities, but are rarely shown through¬
out the country.
Production About 10 per cent of British first feature films are made and about 40 per cent
and are distributed by the Rank Organisation and the Associated British Picture
Distribution Corporation, which have companies for production, distribution and exhi¬
bition. Most producers who are independent of either group make films in
association with other film distributors. There are numerous companies
(many of them small) which produce short films.
The art of film production is a costly one which depends upon a commer¬
cially prosperous industry for its development and needs adequate financial
backing combined with freedom for the film-maker to experiment and to
express his own ideas. There is no state-owned film production unit in
Britain, but the National Film Finance Corporation, a statutory body set up
in 1949, lends money for feature film production. Its members—a chairman,
a managing director and three to five others—are appointed by the Board of
Trade. Its funds (limited by statute to £8 million) are provided up to
£6 million by advances from the Board of Trade; the remaining £2 million
may be borrowed from non-governmental sources. In recent years the
Corporation has been financially concerned with about half the first feature
films made in British studios.
There is also a levy on cinema admissions to provide a film production fund.
The money so raised is paid out as a percentage of a film’s takings, so that
the more successful a film is at the box-office, the more it receives from the
fund. Started by the industry in 1950 on a voluntary basis, the scheme
became statutory under the Cinematograph Films Act i957> which gave the
President of the Board of Trade powers to make regulations governing the
collection, by the Board of Customs and Excise, of a levy from exhibitors,
and the distribution of the proceeds for the benefit of British film production.
The British Film Fund Agency undertakes the distribution.
The Government sponsors a wide range of films and film material to
inform audiences overseas about British life and achievement, including
documentary films, television programmes and newsreels; they are produced
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 243
through the film, television and newsreel services of the Central Office of
Information (COI), which commissions their production by private com¬
panies. These, together with other films acquired from private industry and
public bodies, are distributed throughout the world, in English and many
foreign languages, by British Information Services.
Films are also sponsored by other government departments for the home
market. These, too, are produced by the COI and include films on such
subjects as science, agriculture, health and industry, designed for specialised
audiences, as well as films for the general public on, for example, road safety
and health education.
A large number of films are sponsored by industrial concerns and other
organisations, such as the British Travel Association and the British
Productivity Council. The best of these and industrial films from other
countries are made available to industrial audiences through the COTs
Central Film Library1 and other agencies.
The Films of Scotland Committee promotes the production of Scottish
films covering the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
Quota System
Cinema Licensing
and Film
Censorship
To help British films to meet the keen American competition, legislation
passed in 1927 introduced the quota system (continued by subsequent
legislation), under which a certain proportion of British films must be shown
in British cinemas each year. The proportion is fixed by the Board of Trade
annually after consultation with the Cinematograph Films Council, any
change being effected by statutory instrument approved by both Houses of
Parliament. For first feature films it has stood at 30 per cent since 1950.
The State takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but before it
can be shown a film must be licensed by the local licensing authority. There
are about 700 of these (usually the local authorities or, in some areas,
magistrates). In considering the suitability of films the authorities normally
rely on the judgment of an independent body, the British Board of Film
Censors, to which are submitted all films (other than newsreels) intended for
public showing.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative
of the cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in
the films offered to the public. It consists of a president, a secretary, and
five examiners (including two women). The President, who is usually a man
prominent in public life, is appointed by a trade committee after informal
consultation with the Home Secretary and the principal associations of local
authorities. The Board, which does not use any written code of censorship,
may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate to a film; very
rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the Board are placed in one
of three categories: ‘U’ (suitable for universal showing); ‘A’ (more suitable for
adults than children) and ‘X’ (suitable only for adults). A child under 16
years of age may be admitted to a cinema showing an ‘A’ film only if accom¬
panied by a responsible adult, and may not be admitted on any condition if
an ‘X’ film is being shown.
Appreciation
of the Film
Film reviews appear regularly in the press and on sound and television
programmes and many organisations are interested in different aspects of
the film. There are numerous private film societies.
1 The Central Film Library also makes available on hire to schools, colleges and other
institutions films on many specialised subjects.

British Film
Institute
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film
Institute, founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant.
The Institute encourages the making and showing of good films and helps
the public to appreciate them. It also administers the National Film Theatre
in London and the National Film Archive, runs an annual summer school, and
maintains a film library from which films may be hired, a library of books on
the film and an information service. It makes grants to the Scientific Film
Association, the University Film Council and the Society for Education in
Film and Television.
The National Film Archive contains over 18,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and
about 500,000 photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the
art of the film and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre, on the south bank of the Thames, in London,
shows films of outstanding historical, artistic or technical interest; it holds
a unique position as a cinema offering regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the films shown.
Society of Film and The Society of Film and Television Arts, formed in 1958 by the amalgama-
Television Arts tion of the British Film Academy and the Guild of Television Producers and
Directors, has as its aim to improve the standard of film and television
production and to stimulate public appreciation of the arts.
Festivals The National Film Theatre organises an annual London Film Festival,
which includes films receiving their first showing as well as films which have
been successful in international competitive festivals. A council on which
leading British film organisations are represented organises a film festival as
part of the Edinburgh International Festival.
Children and The Cinematograph Act 1952, which came into force in January 1956,
the Cinema provided for the making of regulations by the Home Secretary to protect
the health and welfare of children attending film shows. Cinemas which give
children’s shows require a special licence from the licensing authority, which
may impose conditions. There are about 900 children’s cinema clubs which
provide special programmes on Saturday mornings; they are organised y
the cinema groups and have become very popular. An important contribution
to these programmes is made by the Children s Film Foundation, w icn
produces and distributes entertainment films specially designed for children
and publishes at intervals a list of films particularly suitable for children and
for exhibition at children’s matinees. The Foundation is a non-profit-making
body set up by the British film industry in 1951 and, under the Cinematograph
Films Act 1957, it receives grants from the British Film Fund Agency.
THE NATIONAL
ECONOMY
BACKGROUND
Britain ranks about 75th in size among the countries of the world, with
about 0*18 per cent of the world’s land area. In population, approaching
2 per cent of the world’s inhabitants, it ranks tenth. In density of population
it is fourth: of the major countries, only Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands
are more crowded; and there are nine times as many people to the square
mile in the United Kingdom as in the United States. In world trade, it ranks
third, accounting for nearly one-tenth of the total. It takes about a fifth of the
world’s exports of primary products, and provides about one-sixth of the
world’s exports of manufactured goods.
Britain, from its own soil, provides only about half of the food it needs,
and-—apart from coal and low-grade iron ore—it has few natural resources;
thus it is the world’s largest importer of such products as wheat, meat, butter,
fodder grains, citrus fruits, tea, tobacco, wool, and hard timber. In return,
it is one of the world’s largest exporters of aircraft, motor vehicles, electrical
equipment, chemicals, textiles and most types of machinery. No other
country has such a small proportion of the working population engaged in
agriculture (only about 3^ per cent).
The United Kingdom is also the central banker of the sterling area, an
area with a quarter of the world’s population. Many countries outside the
sterling area use sterling in their international transactions, and it is the
currency in which about one-third of the world’s trade is conducted.
The Economy During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
before 1939 manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able
to support a rapidly increasing population at a rising standard of living.
During the period from 1870 to 1890 British industrial expansion had the
clearest lead over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914 growing
industrial competition from Europe and North America began to make
itself felt, but its effects on Britain’s staple export industries, particularly
cotton textiles and coal, were offset by the general rise in world trade, by
the continued demand for British textiles from India and other eastern
countries, and by the continued high level of overseas investment.
The new problems confronting British industry and trade in the twentieth
century became apparent after the first world war. Textiles from India and
Japan, where labour was cheaper, established themselves firmly in the large
eastern markets, to a great extent replacing the more expensive and often
higher quality British products. The extension of the world demand for coal
was slowed down by the increasing use of oil, while coal from the newer
European mines competed keenly with British coal.
In the old-established branches of the vehicles and engineering group of
industries (for instance, locomotives, ships and textile machinery) world
demand fell away after a brief post-war boom, and Britain failed at first to
gain a compensating share of the expanding world trade in the new types of

engineering products (for example, vehicles and electrical goods). Most
countries were tending towards self-sufficiency, and some sought deliberately
to protect nascent and even established industries by tariffs and (later) quotas
and exchange restrictions. _ .
Income from overseas investments and a substantial improvement in the
terms of trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) cushioned
the effect of a fall in the volume of exports, and imports remained high.
The loss of export markets led, however, to a contraction of Britain’s staple
industries—coal, cotton, iron and steel, and the older branches of engineering.
The result was heavy unemployment, the general rate of which averaged
14 per cent of the working population in the years i92i-39> reaching a peak
of 22 per cent in 1932, when the slump in world trade was at its worst. In
districts relying mainly on one or other of the staple industries, the rate was
much higher.
After 1932 an improvement in the levels of production and employment
took place, stimulated by an increase in home investment which was aided
by the policy of cheap money, by some revival in world trade and, after i935>
by the armament programme. The decade saw a strong expansion in the
vehicles, electrical, chemicals and aircraft industries, while the construction
of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the building and ancillary
industries. By 1937 average real income per head was about 14 per cent
higher than in 1929.
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic
capital by about £3,000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and
arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements. Some ^1,000 million
worth of overseas investments were sold, nearly half in North America, and
new external debts of £3,000 million were accumulated. By 1944 exports had
fallen to less than one-third of their 1938 volume as a result of the war
effort.
In the two decades since 1945 Britain has experienced, with few interruptions,
a steady growth in output of goods and services and a high level of employment.
New inventions and technological advances and shifts in world demand have
altered radically the character of British industry. Industries in which new
techniques have predominated, notably electronics, aircraft, motor and
chemicals industries, new branches of machinery construction, and petroleum
are contributing a significantly larger share of the total output and of total
exports and providing wider employment opportunities for an increasing y
skilled labour force. Expenditure on industrial and scientific research is
increasing steadily and facilities for technological education have been greatly
enlarged.
At the same time, Britain has had to deal with some persistent economic
problems; in particular, to fulfil its overseas obligations and to maintain its
traditional role in world commerce and finance, it has needed to achieve and
maintain a substantial balance of payments surplus. While exports of both
goods and services have maintained an upward trend, in some years the rate
of increase has been insufficient to pay for a rising volume of imports (almost
all quantitative restrictions on imports having been removed), to meet
defence commitments abroad and to provide for overseas investment and
economic assistance to developing countries.
The persistent rise in prices, a continuing problem shared with most other
countries, has been a central factor in the framing of economic policies.

THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
247
During some periods it stemmed from an excessive pressure of demand-
exports, investment at home and abroad, personal consumption, defence and
other public expenditure both at home and overseas—on the nation’s
resources, but more recently the tendency for money incomes to rise faster
than production, thus raising costs, has been a more dominant influence.
The Government is, therefore, increasingly directing its efforts towards
working out policies for relating increases in money incomes to the rate of
economic growth and evolving machinery for longer-term planning of the
economy.
THE STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY
The following sections sketch briefly the salient features of the national
income and expenditure of Britain in recent years. The source of Tables 9 to
12 is Preliminary Estimates of National Income and Balance of Payments 10^0
to ig64 (Cmnd. 2629).
In 1964 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the
value of total goods and services produced at home and net income from
abroad) is estimated to have totalled £28,691 million. In real terms, that is
after allowing for price changes, the increase over the ten-year period to
1964 has amounted to about 30 per cent. In terms of national income per
head the United Kingdom ranks appreciably below the United States and
Canada and slightly below Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland,
and about on a par with France and the German Federal Republic.
The working population has been rising relatively slowly; in the ten years
to the end of 1964 it increased by about million (or some 6 per cent) to
about 26 million, of whom two-thirds are males. The expansion of the
national income over the same period has, therefore, been mainly the result
of higher productivity. Unemployment over the past two decades remained
very low, on average less than 2 per cent of the working population being
out of work, compared with 14 per cent between the two world wars. Apart
fiom the severe winter of 1962-63, when it rose to over 950,000, and for a
brief spell in 1958, the total in the last 15 years has never exceeded 500,000.
A decline in some of the staple industries, notably coalmining and ship¬
building, has given rise in some areas to rates of unemployment considerably
above that for the country as a whole; averaging 37 per cent in Scotland,
3-5 per cent in north-east England and 6-6 per cent in Northern Ireland in
1964. Assistance, both fiscal and administrative, has been given by the
Government to promote additional employment in those districts where
new opportunities for work are needed (see p. 270).

Table 9 shows the distribution of total supplies of goods and services
since 1950, at 1958 prices, divided between consumers, public authorities,
investment and exports; the diagrams below and on p. 249 show changes in
national expenditure between 1955 an<^ I9^4 (a^ I95^ prices) and trends in
the gross domestic product, output and prices since 1900.
Manufacturing industry contributes about 35 per cent to the total output
of goods and services, and together with mining and quarrying, construction
and public utilities (gas, electricity and water) makes up just under half of
the total; agriculture, forestry and fisheries account for just under 4 per cent
and transport and communications, together with the distributive trades, for
20 per cent. The remainder, just over one-quarter of total output, includes
public administration, education, health and financial services. Over the past
ten years the only marked change has been the decline in the proportion
contributed by agriculture (though agricultural output is still rising).
Defence expenditure has made heavy calls upon resources, especially in
the engineering industries, at certain periods; in peak years in the early
1950s it absorbed over 10 per cent of the gross national product, but by the
end of the 1950s the proportion was about per cent; in 1964 it was just
under 7 per cent.

Investment
In real terms, between 1955 and 1964 gross fixed capital formation rose
by 70 Per cent; exports of goods and services and consumers’ expenditure
both went up by nearly 30 per cent; public authorities’ current expenditure
was up by 12 per cent, the increase having been concentrated in the period
since i960.
Gross fixed investment has risen markedly in the last 15 years. In 1948 fixed
investment in the United Kingdom was about 14 per cent of the gross national
product; it has been maintained at a high level in recent years, reaching
20 per cent in 1964. In some years, such as 1951, i960 and 1964, the level of
economic activity has been influenced by a high and rising investment in
stocks and in work in progress. Fixed investment in manufacturing reached
a peak of £1,239 million (27 per cent of the total) in 1961. It fell to £1,067
million in 1963, partly as a result of the completion of large programmes in
the motor vehicle and steel industries, but recovered to £1,236 million in
1964 (21 per cent of the total). Chemicals and electronics are other manu¬
facturing industries in which investment has been especially high. Housing
received a substantial share of capital resources in the early part of the 1950s,
but as a proportion of total investment tended to decline until 1958; since
then it has risen in real terms by 84 per cent and a further big expansion in
house-building is planned for the second half of the 1960s. Electricity
generation and transmission and the distributive trades are other sectors in
which investment has been at particularly high levels.
Except in 1961, more than 40 per cent of total fixed investment over the
years 1951 to 1964 has been carried out by the central Government, the local
authorities and the public corporations, the last accounting for an average of

45 per cent of public investment over the period, and the central Government
for about 15 per cent. Public investment in 1964 amounted to ^2,604 million,
an increase of £456 million over 1963, reflecting increased expenditure on
education, hospitals, roads, electric power supplies and other services.
Table 10 shows the division of gross fixed investment in 1955 and 1964 by

total of £97,000 million at 1958 prices (new). This is about 50 per cent
higher than in 1948, on the same basis of calculation. About 30 per cent of
the £97,000 million was attributable to dwellings and 22 per cent to assets
in manufacturing and construction.
The marked growth of investment has been greatly facilitated by a substantial
increase in personal savings (see Table 11). Personal savings in 1964 amounted
to £1,922 million, having risen by £199 million over the previous year. As a
proportion of disposable income (8 per cent) personal savings were below
the 1961 level of 9 per cent; total savings, however, were more than double
the level in 1955.

“ Gross saving, i.e. before providing for depreciation and stock appreciation and for
tax, dividend and interest reserves.
The rise in personal savings has taken various forms. There has been
increased investment by the personal sector itself in new dwellings and fixed
assets. Life assurance premiums and other forms of contractual savings, such
as superannuation funds, have grown almost without interruption for many
years and now contribute about half the total. National Savings have also
increased since the early 1950s, although the improvement in 1964 to £357
million still fell short of the record peace-time total of £390 million in 1959.
Building societies are able to attract considerable sums of personal savings,
which reached a peak of £514 million in 1964.
The largest contribution to savings comes from companies, which up to
I959 provided about half the total, but there was a fall in company profits
in 1961 and 1962 compared with i960 and only in 1963 did their savings pass
the i960 total; in 1964* they increased by about 20 per cent and accounted
for about 45 per cent of total savings.
Public corporations, as part of the policy of financing a larger share of their
investment needs from their own resources, have raised their savings total
considerably since 1959 and the 1964 figure was about a tenth of total savings.
Current expenditure, i.e. excluding public investment but including interest
paid on debt, by the central Government (including the national insurance
funds) and the local authorities, has for some years been about one-third of
the gross national product, though after falling to a relatively low level in
the mid-1950s the proportion has been rising again. It amounted to about
37 per cent in 1964. The main causes of this rise have been the continuing
growth of the social services, and especially education, and (since i960) in

defence expenditure, which accounted for 18 per cent of the total current
expenditure of the public authorities in 1964 (compared with a peak of
27 per cent in 1953). Total expenditure by the public authorities rose by a
third between i960 and 1964.
The expansion of the national income has enabled central government tax
revenue to increase by about 30 per cent since i960, despite several reductions
in taxation rates. Revenue from the taxes on income in 1964 accounted for
39 per cent of central government receipts, and taxes on expenditure for
37 per cent. National insurance and health contributions accounted for
16 per cent and the remainder was from rent, dividends and interest, and
trading income. Receipts from taxes on expenditure, a large part of which
were at the higher rates imposed in the 1964 Budget, increased by about
10 per cent in 1964, while receipts from taxes on income rose by only 4 per
cent. Revenue from rates imposed by local authorities rose by over 40 per cent
from i960 to 1964. Rates account for 38 per cent of the latter’s total receipts,
including grants from the central Government.

of the yield from income tax and surtax came from persons with annual
incomes in this latter category, although the total incomes before tax of this
group accounted for only about a third of all personal income.
The ownership of property and personal assets tends to be more concen¬
trated than income after tax. Estimates made by the Board of Inland Revenue
indicate that, in 1963, 78 per cent of net personal wealth (including landed
property), amounting to about £63,700 million, was owned by 4,240,000
individuals, 8 per cent of the population.
While consumer expenditure rose by over 60 per cent between 1955 and
1964 to reach a total of £21,038 million, in real terms (i.e. after discounting
the effect of price changes) the increase was only about 30 per cent. The
proportion devoted to food has been falling slightly each year and now accounts
for under 27 per cent (1955, 30 per cent); outlay on tobacco and alcoholic
drinks is about 12 per cent of consumer expenditure. Housing absorbs
9 per cent of total expenditure. Spending on motor cars and other personal
transport has shown a steep rise for several years, particularly in 1963 and
1964. There has also been a substantial growth in spending on household
electrical equipment, fuel and light, and clothing. Outlays on running costs
of vehicles have risen from £254 million in 1955 to £666 million in 1964.
In general the pattern of consumer spending reflects the social changes and
other developments outlined in Chapter 1. The diagram on p. 253 shows the
change in consumers’ expenditure in real terms since 1958 and at current prices.
As noted earlier, the economy has been greatly affected by an almost
uninterrupted upward trend in prices; and the periods of price stability have
been of short duration, such as between 1953 and 1954 and again between
1958 and i960. The main immediate cause has been the tendency for money
incomes to rise faster than the long-term rate of increase of national production
at a time of full employment, and a very high level of utilisation of productive
resources. Since 1953 the average annual rate of increase of domestic incomes
has been about 6 per cent, while the increase in the gross domestic product
per head of the labour force has been only between 2 and 2% per cent.
Retail prices rose by 28 per cent between January 1956 and December 1964;
over the same period average weekly earnings of manual workers went up by
53 per cent. Company profits are subject to large cyclical swings but since
1955, and especially since i960, they have increased more slowly than incomes
from employment.
Measures taken by the Government to check gradual inflation have included
the prevention of excessive demand by monetary and fiscal measures—bank
rate, bank advances, hire purchase controls, taxation changes—and efforts to
promote voluntary restraint in increases in money incomes of all kinds.
A general prohibition of resale price maintenance has been imposed under
the Resale Prices Act 1964 (see p. 277) and legislation was introduced in 1965
to strengthen the Government’s powers to deal with monopolies, restrictive
practices and, for the first time, mergers. The legislation is intended to
encourage competition and thus contribute towards greater stability of costs
and prices.
A strong balance of payments is vital to Britain because of its exceptionally
high degree of dependence on international trade, its many overseas com¬
mitments, and its position as banker to the sterling area.
In normal times it is necessary for Britain to earn a substantial surplus on
current account in order to finance a capital outflow in the form of private

investment and government grants and loans. There are also, however,
important commitments which Britain has to meet within the current account.
The most important of these are the costs of overseas military expenditure,
which rose from £167 million in 1959 to £275 million in 1964, and economic
grant assistance to less developed territories, mainly the dependent territories,
which totalled £82 million in 1964; in addition, there is multilateral assistance,
in the form of contributions to international agencies, such as the International
Development Association.
Britain also has to make repayments of capital and interest on post-war
loans from the United States and Canada, the servicing of which requires
about £67 million a year. In addition, there has been a substantial increase
in recent years in government loans to developing countries. (Total official
aid from Britain to overseas countries, including gifts, loans, and subscriptions
to international organisations rose from about £130 million in 1959 to just
under £300 million in 1964.)
On capital account, the largest component is generally private investment
abroad (net of disinvestment) and over the last five years the outflow has
averaged well over ^3°° million a year. A considerable proportion of this
outflow has been to the less developed countries and has thus maintained the
traditional role of Britain as a source of finance for overseas development.
At the same time there is a steady flow of private capital to Britain from
overseas, mainly from the United States. In recent years the net capital
movement has been outward; it was estimated to amount to £251 million in
i964.
Britain’s overseas short-term liabilities in the form of net sterling balances
and claims in sterling held by other countries and non-territorial organisations
are substantial, amounting to £4,050 million at the end of 1964. Gold and
foreign currency reserves at the end of August 1965 stood at £923 million. As a
second line of reserves, the United Kingdom has a substantial portfolio of
dollar securities of which the market value has recently averaged about $1,250
million. In addition, Britain has drawing rights on the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) which it has exercised on four occasions, in 1947, 1956, 1961
and 1965.
Estimates of Britain’s total external assets and liabilities show that the
United Kingdom is on balance a net creditor country. At the end of 1964
the United Kingdom had a total stock of long-term assets of about £11,000
million. Of this, over £1,000 million were official assets, £4,000 million were
private holdings of overseas portfolio securities at market values and about
£6,000 million were direct investments of all kinds.
(For a fuller account of the balance of payments, see Chapter 15.)
ECONOMIC PLANNING
In recent years the main objective in government economic policies has been
the achievement of faster economic growth. A framework of longer-term
economic planning and consultation is being evolved within which the aim is
for increases in productivity, industrial efficiency and real incomes to be
reconciled with a high and stable level of employment, a favourable balance
of payments and the promotion of social justice. A new government depart¬
ment, the Department of Economic Affairs (see p. 256), was set up in October
1964 to be responsible for economic planning. It works in close consultation
with the Treasury and other government departments. A Ministry of
Technology (see p. 59) was set up at the same time, to stimulate a more

rapid application of scientific and technological advances in British industry.
A number of other bodies dealing with economic planning and consultations
have been in existence for some years; they include the National Economic
Development Council (NEDC), the National Joint Advisory Council (NJAC)
and organisations dealing with the special problems of Scotland, Wales and
the English regions.
The Department of Economic Affairs has been given the responsibility of
framing and supervising the plan for economic development and for the
general co-ordination of action to implement the plan, including, in particular,
policies for industry, the regions, incomes and prices, and economic growth.
It works with representatives of both sides of industry directly and through
the National Economic Development Council.
The department is organised into four inter-related groups: an Economic
Planning Division concerned with the preparation of medium-term, long¬
term and very long-range forecasts of the development of the economy; an
Industrial Policy Division which is closely linked with the NEDC’s Economic
Development Committees (see below), and considers and reports on the
problems and obstacles to growth in individual industries; an Economic
Co-ordination Division, concerned with the application of prices and incomes
policy, the relationship of public expenditure programmes to the use of
resources and economic growth and efficiency, and the implementation of the
growth plan; and a Regional Policy Division responsible for regional policies
and planning.
The National Plan, covering all sectors of the economy and prepared in
consultation with both sides of industry, was published in September 1965.
Its aim is to increase the gross domestic product by 25 per cent between
1964 and 1970. At 1964 prices, the production of goods and services should,
therefore, go up by £8,000 million a year by 1970. It will be necessary to
increase productivity by 3-4 per cent a year, investment by 5J per cent a year
and exports by 5^ per cent a year over the plan period. Four essentials
to the plan are a sound balance of payments, improved efficiency in industry,
a balanced regional development and increased investment.
The National Economic Development Council (NEDC) was set up in
February 1962, originally to examine the economic performance of the
nation with particular concern for plans for the future in both the private
and the public sector, to consider uses of national resources and to seek
agreement upon ways of increasing the rate of sound economic growth. The
NEDC was reorganised in November 1964. The principal responsibility for
preparing a national economic plan was taken over by the Department of
Economic Affairs but the NEDC is the designated body for the discussion
of policies and through which the involvement of both sides of industry in
the formulation and implementation of the plan is secured.
The chairman of the NEDC is the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
Other members are the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of
Labour, the Minister of Technology, the Chief Industrial Adviser, a number
of representatives from both sides of industry, and several well-known
economists. The Council, which meets at frequent intervals, has its own
permanent staff (not members of the Civil Service) under a Director-General.
By mid-1965 it had published a number of reports on factors affecting the
rate of growth of the economy, including the results of inquiries into the
prospects for growth of a cross-section of industry. To assist it in this aspect

of its work a series of economic development committees have been formed.
They are concerned with particular industries and consist of representatives
of management, trade unions, government departments and others with
special experience.
Long-term planning of public expenditure, with regular surveys for periods
of years ahead, has been much developed by consecutive governments in
recent years (see p. 399). In December 1963 the first White Paper was
published giving estimates of total public expenditure for five years ahead
on the basis of policies and programmes then current. In February 1965 the
Government’s decision was announced of relating the growth of public sector
expenditure between 1964-65 and 1969—70 (excluding the nationalised
industries) to the prospective increase in national production. In present
circumstances this means limiting the average increase in public sector
expenditure, taking one year with another, to 4J per cent a year at constant
prices.
In recent years it has become increasingly recognised that a generally stable
price level combined with sustained economic growth can only be achieved
within the framework of an incomes policy, designed to keep the rise in money
incomes broadly in line with the long-term rate of growth in national
production.
The incomes policy of the Labour Government, which took office in
October 1964, has been developed in three stages in consultation with
representatives of management and workers. The Joint Statement of Intent
on Productivity, Prices and Incomes, signed in December 1964, formulated
the lines of action to be taken by the Government and by management and
workers. The Government’s tasks are primarily concerned with the working
out of a general plan for economic development and specific measures to
improve industrial efficiency and raise productivity, as well as to set up
machinery to keep a continuous watch on prices and money incomes. The
trade unions and the four organisations representing management, the
Federation of British Industries, the National Association of British Manu¬
facturers, and the British Employers’ Confederation (now merged into the
Confederation of British Industry, see p. 267), and the Association of British
Chambers of Commerce, for their part have undertaken to work vigorously
for higher standards of efficiency and performance and to co-operate in
practical measures in the operation of an effective prices and incomes
policy.
The next step was the announcement, in February 1965, of the setting up
of a National Board for Prices and Incomes. The Board sits in two divisions:
a Prices Review Division and an Incomes Review Division. The former
division may investigate any price or group of prices of goods and services in
private or nationalised industry. The Incomes Review Division may investigate
claims or settlements throughout the economy relating to wage and salary
increases and changes in conditions of service. The Government retains direct
responsibility for all references to the Board. Reliance is being placed on the
pressure of public opinion to ensure that compliance with recommendations
of the Board is obtained; the Government has made it clear that if the
voluntary method is not successful it will have to consider other methods.
The third stage was the publication of a White Paper, Prices and Incomes
Policy (Cmnd. 2639) setting out considerations which should guide all
concerned with prices and incomes policy. General guidance is given on the
258

cases in which it would be appropriate to raise or reduce prices. It also
indicated a ‘norm’ of 3 to 3! per cent as an average rate of annual increase
of money incomes per head, which is consistent with stability in the general
level of prices. The incomes policy generally is within the framework of the
Government’s plan for economic development (see p. 256).
Prior to the setting up of the National Board for Incomes and Prices, the
National Incomes Commission had been set up in 1962 to give impartial and
authoritative advice on important or difficult pay questions. It issued several
reports on matters referred to it by the Government before it was abolished
in 1965.
Policies for the regions of Britain aim to bring about a more even spread of
economic stability throughout the country; to maintain the individual
character of the regions; and to modernise and improve the environment.
Detailed studies of the regions have therefore been put in hand by successive
governments.
The regional development programmes published in 1963 for central
Scotland and north-east England seek to stimulate industrial diversification
and growth by the modernisation of the regions, including the identification
of ‘growth zones’ in each region, i.e. areas where the factors for rapid and
substantial economic growth are most favourable. Extra public service
investment on housing, roads and other services is being concentrated on
these focal points. A study of south-east England, which concentrated on
housing and land use problems, was published in March 1964. Its proposals
for dealing with the expected population increase there over the next 20
years are under review by the Government.
The Government has established a wider system of regional councils and
boards to provide effective machinery for regional economic planning. The
councils are concerned with the broad strategy of regional development and
the best use of the regional resources. Economic Planning Councils were set
up in February and March 1965 for Scotland, Wales and the northern,
north-west, Yorkshire and Humberside, east Midland, west Midland and
south-west regions of England and two further councils were announced in
August for East Anglia and south-east England. Each council consists of
about 25 part-time members widely representative of experience in the
regions. The councils have no executive powers; they assist in the formulation
of the regional plan.
The Regional Economic Planning Boards consist of civil servants repre¬
senting the main government departments in each region. In the English
regions the chairman is an official of the Department of Economic Affairs.
In the case of the Scottish and Welsh Boards the chairmen are officials of the
Scottish and Welsh Offices. The task of the boards is to prepare draft plans
for the region and to co-ordinate the work of the various government
departments in implementing the final plan.

ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to become highly
industrialised, and today fourteen people work in mining, manufacturing and
building for every one in agriculture. It is the world’s third largest exporter of
manufactured goods and the range of its industrial manufactures reflects its
position as one of the most important workshops of the world.
The factors that have influenced the location of industry in Britain are many
and various. During the rapid industrialisation of the nineteenth century
one of the most important influences was the proximity of coal, the major
source of power, particularly when it was associated with ease of access to
other raw materials such as iron ore in the West Midlands and salt (for
chemicals) in Cheshire, and to the coast, which in turn offered easy access
to imported raw materials and a quick outlet for exports. In the course of
the past hundred years, the pull exercised by coal has been progressively
weakened as improved means of communication and an alternative source of
power in electricity have been developed and have enabled advantage to be
taken of other sites—for example, those near to big consumer markets and
plentiful supplies of labour. The main areas of industrial concentration are
still, with one exception (London), the areas which saw the beginning of
Britain’s industrial greatness and which, with two exceptions (London and
Belfast), are on or near coalfields; but many smaller and more widely dispersed
centres of industry have grown up, notably in southern England.
During the inter-war period there was a tendency for the ‘new’ industries,
such as those manufacturing motor vehicles, electrical goods and rubber
products, to develop rapidly in the south (especially in and around Greater
London) and in the Midlands. On the other hand, this period was one of
acute depression and mass unemployment for the older industrial areas which
specialised in the great staple industries—coalmining, steel, shipbuilding,
marine engineering and cotton manufacture. These conditions prompted
official action aimed at encouraging the development and diversification of
industry in the areas where labour and other unused resources are to be found
and discouraging further industrialisation in congested areas.
A brief description follows of the location of British industry, grouped
according to broad geographical areas.
London, situated at the head of ocean navigation on the Thames estuary,
is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, probably still the world’s
most important financial centre, one of the world’s three largest cities (with
Tokyo and New York) and one of the world’s three largest ports (with New
York and Rotterdam). Greater London (see p. 70), including the urbanised
fringe areas within 50 miles of Charing Cross, has a working population of
over six million, of whom over a third are in manufacturing industry.
London is the main centre in Britain of the clothing and food and drink
industries, of printing, of cinema film production, and of the manufacture
of furniture, materials for the arts, precision instruments and many other
260 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
specialised products. Small firms predominate in many of these industries
and the average size of manufacturing firms (particularly in the County of
London) is well below the national average. London, especially its outer ring,
is also an important area for light engineering, chemicals and consumer
goods and has some heavy engineering plants and a number of important
research establishments. Towards the periphery of the London conurbation
and in the new urban development outside it, industry, particularly the
electronics and a variety of consumer goods industries, has been expanding
rapidly; some of the largest aircraft plants are in these areas, for example at
Weybridge and Hatfield, as well as the factories, at Dagenham, Luton and
Dunstable, of two of the five main motor vehicle manufacturers. Along the
lower Thames and Medway estuaries there are large oil refineries as well as
some smaller shipyards, a variety of engineering works and an important
concentration of the paper and pulp and cement industries.
The South Coast The Channel coast has been much developed for tourist traffic and as a place
for retirement. A great part of the coast eastwards from Bournemouth
(population 65,000) consists of built-up areas, which from Brighton (163,000)
eastwards are partly dormitories for people working in London. Portsmouth
(227,000) is a naval port and has some shipbuilding and general manufactures.
Southampton (207,000) is the largest port in Britain for ocean-going liners
and its industries include ship repairing, oil refining, cable-making, electronics
and synthetic rubber. Dover, Folkestone and Newhaven are packet ports.
South-west England Devon and Cornwall have a considerable tourist trade and some popular
retirement areas. Bristol, the largest city of the south-west (434,000), is a
leading port and commercial centre with aircraft, aero-engines, tobacco, food
processing, paper, printing and other industries and nearby, at Avonmouth,
are important non-ferrous metal and basic chemicals plants. Gloucester
(71,000), originally an inland port and commercial town, Cheltenham (74,000),
originally a resort town, and the area between and adjacent to them produce
a variety of manufactures, including machinery, instruments and accessories
and the well-known West of England cloth. Swindon (95,000), besides its
railway workshops, has important engineering works. Bath (82,000), originally
a resort town and the centre of an agricultural district, has become noted
for engineering and other manufacturing.
East Anglia and Besides being one of the most productive agricultural regions, the eastern
Lincolnshire counties possess some sizeable towns. Ipswich (119,000) and Grantham
(25,000) are noted for agricultural machinery and implements, and Norwich
(120,000) for footwear and food manufacture. Food canning and freezing,
based mainly on locally grown produce, have developed rapidly. Scunthorpe
(69,000) in Lincolnshire, is an important steel-making centre, and the ports
of Great Yarmouth (53,000) and Grimsby (97,000) have extensive fish
processing plants, the latter also having a growing chemicals industry.
Midlands The main industrial area of the Midlands—the West Midlands conurbation
stretches from Birmingham (1,116,000) through the Black Country to
Wolverhampton (150,000) and includes portions of Staffordshire, W orcester¬
shire and Warwickshire. It has an unusually wide variety of industry, including
notably the manufacture of metals, electrical and engineering products of all
kinds, and also jewellery, rubber products, chemicals and domestic metalware.
The largest concentrations of motor vehicle manufacture, including com¬
ponents and accessories, in the United Kingdom are situated in the Midlands,
at Coventry (314,000) and Birmingham and, farther to the south, at Cowley,
Lancashire and
North-west
England
INDUSTRY 25j
near Oxford (107,000). The smaller conurbation of North Staffordshire,
centred on Stoke-on-Trent (266,000), is devoted chiefly to the manufacture of
pottery and china and to coalmining, although other industries are growing
in importance, while Stafford (48,000) has heavy electrical and other engineer¬
ing works.
Industrial cities and towns lying outside the main industrial area include
Leicester (270,000) noted for hosiery and knitwear, boots and shoes and
machinery for making these products; Derby (132,000) for general engineering,
aero-engines and man-made fibres; Nottingham (315,000) for hosiery, cycles
and a variety of other engineering products, lace, pharmaceutical products,
tobacco; Rugby (54,000), electrical engineering; Northampton (105,000),
footwear, engineering; Worcester (67,000), machinery; Burton-on-Trent
(5L°oo), brewing and rubber; Chesterfield (68,000), engineering; and
Kidderminster (43,000), carpets. Corby (41,000), a new town in Northampton¬
shire, has a steel industry originally based on local deposits of iron ore, and
at Peterborough (64,000) there are several large engineering works. The
richest and most highly mechanised coalfield in Britain lies in the north-east
of the area and continues into Yorkshire. Some of the towns on the coalfield,
such as Mansfield (54,000), have important manufacturing industries,
particularly textiles.
Manchester (655,000) is the commercial hub of the cotton and man-made
fibre textiles industries, a very important financial and commercial centre and
a major port. It is also one of the chief centres for electrical and heavy
engineering and the production of machine tools, petro-chemicals, dyestuffs,
and pharmaceutical goods, while it has a wide range of other manufactures.
Most of the cotton and other yarns are spun in Bolton (160,000), Oldham
(114,000), and Rochdale (86,000), and at Stockport (in Cheshire) (143,000);
farther to the north lie the weaving towns of Burnley (80,000), Nelson
(32,000), Blackburn (105,000), Accrington (39,000) and Darwen (29,000);
Preston (112,000) and Bury (62,000) both have spinning and weaving plants.
In the majority of these towns engineering industries, notably the manufacture
of printing, paper making, textile and electrical machinery and heavy
commercial vehicles (especially in the Chorley-Leyland area) are, however,
more important than cotton, which has been declining for some years. The
Lancashire coalfield also lies in the Manchester-Wigan area.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of overseas
trade, links Manchester with Merseyside. It passes through the important
industrial towns of Warrington (76,000) with its metal industries (such as
wire-drawing), Widnes (54,000) with its chemicals, and Ellesmere Port
(47,000) with its oil refinery installations, before reaching the Mersey estuary.
St. Helens (107,000), to the north of the canal, is famous for glass manufacture.
Liverpool (740,000) is the second port of Britain, a great commercial and
insurance centre and, after London, the greatest centre for processing imported
foodstuffs and raw materials, being noted especially for flour milling, soap
manufacture, sugar refining and rubber products. Among its older industries
is ship repairing; shipbuilding is a major industry across the river at Birken¬
head (144,000). Many new industries, including electrical engineering, the
manufacture of other heavy industrial equipment and, more recently, motor
vehicle manufacture, have been established in the Liverpool area. Barrow
(65,000), in the north-west corner of Lancashire, is a well-known ship¬
building and marine engineering area. Blackpool (181,000) is Britain’s most
popular holiday resort.

Most of the county’s industry is located in the West Riding, where about
three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s worsted and woollen industries are
found. Bradford (297,000) is the commercial centre of the wool trade and
important for worsted; Morley (42,000) and Leeds (514,000) have specialised
in cheaper cloths, and Batley (40,000), Dewsbury (54,000) and Spenborough
(37,000) in heavy cloth, but their production is becoming more diversified.
Huddersfield (132,000) has a reputation for fine woollens and worsteds and
Halifax (96,000) for carpets. In most of the larger centres of the wool industry
a variety of engineering products are manufactured. Leeds, the commercial
capital of the area, has a large ready-made clothing industry and important
engineering plants. Farther south is the heavy engineering centre of Sheffield
(495,000), famous for its high quality steels, cutlery and tools. The area’s
extensive coalfields provide nearly a quarter of Britain’s coal; Doncaster
(86,000), also with tractor and nylon manufacturing, and Barnsley (75,000)
are the largest towns on the coalfield. York (104,000), noted for chocolates and
confectionery manufacture and with important railway workshops, and Hull
(301,000), one of the world’s largest fishing ports and with many manu¬
facturing industries, including engineering, vegetable oil processing, paints
and sawmilling, are important industrial towns in the East Riding of Yorkshire.
The greater part of this region (Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland,
Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire) is an area of mountains, lakes and
moors and is relatively thinly populated. Most of its population of 3-2
million is concentrated in the coastal strip about 20 miles deep and 45 miles
long, from the coalfields north of the Tyne to the Tees. Within this area the
main centres are Tyneside (935,000), including Newcastle upon Tyne
(267,000), Gateshead, Tynemouth, South Shields, Wallsend and Jarrow; and
Tees-side (545,000), including Middlesbrough (158,000) and West Hartlepool.
Other large towns are Sunderland (190,000), Darlington (84,000), and
Carlisle (71,000).
The whole region is more dependent than other parts of England on
traditional heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manufacture,
shipbuilding and repairing and chemicals (the complex of chemical plants
on both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in Europe), which
together employ nearly a third of the male workers. This proportion has
been falling steadily as the result of the establishment of industrial estates
and other government measures to attract new types of enterprise and promote
the diversification of industry. A comprehensive plan for north-east England,
to accelerate industrial growth and diversification and the modernisation of
the whole environment, is now being implemented (see p. 258). Other manu¬
facturing industries include mining and other machinery, rolling mill plant,
earth-moving equipment, machine tools, ropes, glass, clothing and scientific
instruments.
Nearly two-thirds of the population of Wales and Monmouthshire (2-65
million) live in the two counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. In this
area are the coal mines which, though long worked and operating at increasing
depths, still produce nearly all Britain’s anthracite and much of its steam and
other specialised coals, and still employ more workers than any branch of
manufacturing industry. Rhondda (106,000) and Merthyr Tydfil (59,000) are
the largest towns in the coalmining area. The steel industry, with some of the
most modern plants in Europe, supplies almost all Britain’s output of tin plate
and a large proportion of its sheet steel. In the past 30 years many new
industries have been established, often located on government industrial

estates; they include plastics, synthetic fibres, clothing, electronics, motor
vehicle components and light engineering.
The main urban centres are also the three major ports—Cardiff (261,000),
Newport (109,000) and Swansea (170,000). Milford Haven, a magnificent
deep-water harbour until recently little developed, has two major oil refineries.
In North Wales a number of light industries, notably man-made fibres,
are located in the seaside resorts and other towns, particularly Wrexham
(36,000).
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population (5-2 million) is concentrated in
the central Lowlands, a belt some 65 miles wide and 15 to 30 miles deep
between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The principal cities in this
area are Glasgow (1 million) and Edinburgh (473,000). Clydeside, which
includes the city of Glasgow, is the United Kingdom’s largest shipbuilding
and marine engineering centre; it also has a great variety of general engineering
enterprises and other industries. The steel industry, sited mainly in north
Lanarkshire, produces a wide range of products. The electronics equipment
industry is represented by a growing number of firms in such widely dispersed
centres as Glasgow, north Lanarkshire, Dundee and central Fife, as well as
in Edinburgh, where this and other modern industries are expanding alongside
the long-established engineering, printing and brewing industries. The new
towns of East Kilbride, Cumbernauld and Glenrothes have growing con¬
centrations of modern industry, while an entirely new motor car industry
has recently been established in Renfrewshire and in West Lothian there has
been a major expansion of commercial vehicle building. A fourth new town,
Livingston, was designated in 1962.
Outside the central Lowland belt there is considerable industrial concen¬
tration in the vicinity of Dundee (185,000) and in Aberdeen (186,000), and
a number of towns outside these areas have been attracting light industries in
recent years. Dundee’s traditional manufacture is jute, but office machinery,
clocks and watches and refrigerators are now also made there, while in
north-east Scotland is the largest concentration of whisky distilleries.
Most of northern Scotland is mountainous and much of southern Scotland
is hilly and rugged. These regions are sparsely populated, but the Scottish
Highlands possess significant resources of hydro-electric power (see p. 289).
There are high-quality tweed and knitwear industries in the valley towns of
the southern uplands and in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland respectively.
Although the area is relatively small and lacking in minerals, there is sub¬
stantial and growing industrialisation, particularly in and around the capital
city of Belfast (410,300). The largest single shipyard in the United Kingdom is
sited in Belfast and other long-established activities include the manufacture
of marine engines, ropes, twine, tobacco and clothing. Northern Ireland has
also long been an important centre for textiles; it is particularly well-known
for linen but the textile industry is now extensively diversified. Northern
Ireland is one of the most important areas in Europe for man-made fibre
production and provides about one-fifth of Britain’s production. There has
also been extensive development in aircraft construction, automobile com¬
ponents, oil-well equipment, electronic instruments, telephone switchgear
equipment, toys, shoes, carpets and synthetic rubber.
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms, and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary
264
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Role of Public
Enterprise
from the many small workshops to vast organisations such as the National
Coal Board, a public corporation with about 575,000 employees; Imperial
Chemical Industries Ltd., a limited liability company which, with its sub¬
sidiaries, employs over 100,000 persons in the United Kingdom; and the
Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd., a co-operative society with about
54,000 employees.
Throughout the first half of the twentieth century the growth of the social
services, especially health, education and housing, led to the progressively
greater influence of the public sector of the economy. There was also an
increase in the State’s direct participation in productive and commercial
activities, particularly in the decade 1940-50. State participation is effected
mainly through special statutory bodies set up to deal with a particular activity.
Such bodies, though not part of a government department, are under a
considerable but varying degree of public control (see p. 272). The most
important of these statutory bodies are the public corporations which operate
major industries and services in the public interest. Altogether over 9 per cent
of the labour force works for these bodies, while another 14 per cent is almost
equally divided between central and local government.
The public corporation today is, generally speaking, a public body having
a clearly defined and specific task. Its managing board and its staff are chosen
for their experience and competence in a particular field; they are not civil
servants, and although they are accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring
departments who are responsible for the management of the corporations.
Certain of the corporations are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer
grants to help them in carrying out the duties with which they have been
charged.
Before the second world war, a number of public corporations were
established1 in those industries and services where it was considered that the
national interest required co-ordination or control by a public authority.
Their constitutions had no standard pattern and their governing bodies
differed in the method of appointment and in composition.
Immediately after the second world war, the nationalisation Acts set up
public corporations to run certain major industries and services, including
coalmining, inland transport, gas supply, electricity generation and supply,
and civil air transport. These post-war corporations are less varied in the
structure of their governing bodies, which are appointed by the responsible
minister.
The following corporations, the organisation and functions of which are
described in later chapters, are now operating or controlling large-scale
industries or services:
1 The principal corporations appointed before the second world war were: (1) the
Central Electricity Board, established by the Electricity Supply Act 1926, to rationalise
electricity generation and build and operate a main transmission system; (2) the
British Broadcasting Corporation, established in 1927 by Royal Charter to provide a
national broadcasting service; (3) the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland, estab¬

Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining.
The coalmining industry of Great Britain (see p. 280) is operated as a single
co-ordinated enterprise under the direction of the National Coal Board.
Nearly all other mining and quarrying (iron ore, sand, gravel, chalk,
limestone, salt, tin, slate, oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private
enterprises, usually owned and operated by limited liability companies.
About 67,000 workers are employed in mining and quarrying, excluding
coalmining.
Most manufanturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Exceptions include
fissile materials and radioactive isotopes made by the Atomic Energy
Authority, locomotives and rolling-stock built in the workshops of the
Railways Board, a considerable quantity of arms and military equipment
made in Royal Ordnance factories and other factories operated by the
Ministry of Defence (Army Department) and the Ministry of Aviation, and
some fighting ships built in naval dockyards operated by the Admiralty
Board. Staff of the Stationery Office do some printing and bookbinding,
while the repair, and to a limited extent the construction, of post office equip¬
ment is carried on in factories run by the Post Office. Certain factories giving
employment to the severely disabled are operated by Remploy Ltd., a non-
profit-making public company financed on the Vote of the Ministry of Labour,
which appoints the directors (see p. 460). The equity of one large iron and
steel company, Richard Thomas and Baldwins, is still held by a government
agency, the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency (see p. 302). The
Government also holds 51 per cent of the equity of a major oil company,
British Petroleum Limited, and has a controlling interest in a few other
companies. It is also prepared in special circumstances to make loans to
private companies when the public interest may require such assistance.
Surveys of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more
than 10 persons are made periodically by the Ministry of Labour; the results
of the most recent of these surveys, based on returns rendered by employers
in June 1961, show that nearly a third of all employees in such establishments
are in those employing from 100 to 499 persons, while slightly over a third
are in establishments employing 1,000 or more persons. A high proportion
of the biggest establishments are in the heavy industries, while the average
size of establishments in industries making consumer goods is smaller than
in manufacturing industries as a whole. Comparisons with results obtained
266
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Building and
Civil Engineering
in earlier surveys on similar lines suggest that there is a slow but significant
trend towards an increase in the average size of manufacturing establishments:
in 1961, establishments with 1,000 or more employees were found to employ
2,821,000 persons, over 25 per cent more than in 1953 and more than 2| times
as many as in 1935. In addition, there are a very large number of manufacturing
establishments with fewer than 11 employees and in these a total of about
750,000 workers are estimated to be employed.
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of
manufacturing enterprises, as a single enterprise may own several establish¬
ments, not all of them necessarily engaged in the same or similar activities.
The most recent analysis of manufacturing enterprises by size (employment)
is provided by the Report of the Census of Production for 1958. An enter¬
prise, as defined in the Census, normally consists of either a single firm or a
holding company together with its subsidiaries. Just over half of all employ¬
ment in British manufacturing industries in 1958 was accounted for by about
950 large private enterprises employing 1,000 or more people, the largest
70 or so accounting roughly for a quarter. A further indication of the size
of companies is the value of net assets. Those of the largest, the Imperial
Chemical Industries group, total over £950 million, while there are nearly
forty companies registered in Britain with net assets of over ^ioo million.
In some industries a small number of big companies and their subsidiaries
are responsible for most of the total production. Examples are oil refining,
steel making, non-ferrous metal smelting, the manufacture of motor vehicles
and components, aircraft and aero-engines, heavy electrical equipment,
bicycles, tobacco, cement, and basic chemicals. Shares in these companies
are usually distributed among a great number of holders and it is rare for a
few large holders to have a controlling interest. For example, five of the
largest public companies each have more than 100,000 shareholders. In recent
years there has been a relatively large number of mergers, leading to larger
units of control; and in some industries, notably brewing, pharmaceuticals,
aircraft, textiles, electrical products and newspaper and magazine publishing,
there have been increases in concentration. There has also been a growth of
large industrial holding companies, controlling a wide range of subsidiary
companies with a diversity of industrial interests.
The way in which the work of production is divided within and between
different firms varies from industry to industry and is determined by the
most economic methods of production and distribution. In the cotton
industry, for example, it is usual for different firms to undertake the various
main processes of production (spinning, weaving, finishing), while in the
woollen section of the wool textile industry all these processes are commonly
undertaken within the same firm. Some of the leading establishments in the
vehicles group of industries are primarily engaged on the assembly of parts,
many of which have been manufactured for them under contract by specialist
firms.
An account of some of the principal manufacturing industries is given on
pp. 300-326.
In building and civil engineering, large-scale work is usually carried out by
private contractors, although the Ministry of Public Building and Works is
the largest single employer of building labour while nearly 45 per cent of
the industry’s output is for public authorities.
Building firms may be divided into those undertaking general building and
civil engineering work and those concerned with highly specialised work,
many of which operate outside as well as inside the building industry.
INDUSTRY
Industrial
Association
267
Building is an industry of small firms; more than three-quarters of the firms
employ fewer than 20 employees. For a fuller account of the building and
civil engineering industries, see p. 297.
From the middle of the nineteenth century, private industrial undertakings
have increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different
purposes. Some of the more important of these purposes may be classified
as follows:
1. The provision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison
with the Government, and representation of their members’ point of view.
2. The regulation of trading practices, sometimes including the regulation
of prices (see p. 276).
3. Negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions of work.
Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover, with varying
completeness, most of British industry, but there are wide sectors of industry
where there are no collective agreements to regulate trading practices.
Employers’ organisations which deal with labour matters usually consist of
firms engaged in the same type of operation or manufacturing process. Trade
associations mainly concerned with representations to the Government,
provision of common services or the regulation of trading practices are built
up round a product or an allied group of products. In an industrial sector
concerned wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may
undertake all the required functions.
There are about 80 national federations and probably altogether about
1,500 employers’ organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or
branches of the national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages
and conditions of work. The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned
with providing common services is not known precisely, but according to a
survey carried out between 1953 and 1956 by Political and Economic Planning
(an independent research organisation) some 1,300 were in existence, varying
greatly in importance, structure and activities.
The central body representing British industry nationally is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI), incorporated by Royal Charter in July 1965.
This was established by the amalgamation of three former bodies, the British
Employers Confederation (BEC) which used to represent employers on labour
questions, the Federation of British Industries (FBI) formerly the chief
spokesman on economic, commercial and production matters, and the
National Association of British Manufacturers (NABM) representing mainly
industrial firms of small or medium size. The CBI is recognised by the
Government as a channel for consultation between government departments
and representatives of private employers as a whole. It acts as an advisory
and consultative body for its members, providing them with information and
statistics, ascertaining their collective views and representing them nationally
to the Government and the public and also internationally, for example in the
Council of European Industrial Federations. CBI representatives sit on a
number of government advisory committees, on other statutory bodies and
on voluntary bodies concerned with matters affecting industry.
The CBI membership consists of approximately 13,000 individual firms
and 280 trade associations and upwards of 50 employers’ organisations.
Nationalised industries are entitled to apply for a form of association. The
CBI has a regional organisation in the United Kingdom and is widely
represented abroad.
268
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Relations with
Government
In matters of common concern the CBI often acts jointly with the Chambers
of Commerce. These bodies are open to all kinds of producers and traders
and exist to promote the interests of local industry and commerce. The
Association of British Chambers of Commerce, founded in i860, is the central
organisation to which 101 local chambers of commerce (together with 22
British Chambers of Commerce operating in foreign countries) are affiliated.
In Scotland there is an additional central organisation, the Council of Scottish
Chambers of Commerce, and in Northern Ireland, the Association of Northern
Ireland Chambers of Commerce.
1 he Government can influence industrial development in a number of ways—
through fiscal and monetary policy, through the level of public expenditure,
through the policies of publicly owned enterprises, by physical controls, by
inducements, by exhortation and by-the provision of services, information and
advice. There are relatively few physical controls over industry: the chief
ones, apart from labour legislation and certain export and import controls
over a small range of products, derive from powers to stop new building or
changes in the use of land and from certain powers to investigate and forbid
monopolies and restrictive practices.
A system has grown up whereby a particular government department acts
as the main point of contact, or ‘production department’, for each major
industry.
The department through which the Government’s relations with trade and
industry are chiefly conducted is the Board of Trade (which has regional
offices in the principal industrial centres) and its responsibilities cover a
wide range of industries and materials. Certain industries and services,
however, are the responsibility of other departments, as production depart¬

junction with the Department of
Economic Affairs, the Board of Trade
and other departments covering the
whole of Great Britain.
The Department of Economic Affairs, set up in 1964, is responsible for
framing plans for economic development, policies affecting the growth of the
economy and regional development (see p. 256). It has close links with industry
through the National Economic Development Council. The DEA works in
close association with the Treasury, which remains responsible for fiscal and
monetary policy, and with the other departments concerned with economic
development. The Ministry of Labour is the channel through which man¬
power policy is conducted. The Department of Education and Science is
responsible for the promotion of education and for civil science, operating
in the main through the research councils. The Ministry of Technology was
set up in 1964 to promote the application of advanced technology and new
processes in industry.
There are separate departments of the Northern Ireland Government for
matters within the competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament. The
Ministry of Commerce deals with industry, especially the encouragement of
industrial development.
The Central Statistical Office, which is attached to the Cabinet Office, was
established in 1940 to provide a comprehensive statistical service to assist the
authorities in framing economic and financial policy. Although departments
themselves compile statistics relating to their particular responsibilities, and
may publish them in their own standard publications, the comprehensive
statistical publications are prepared by the Central Statistical Office, which
collects the main departmental statistics and compiles its own series from
departmental and other information. Statistics relating to industrial and
economic affairs may be found in its regular publications: the Monthly Digest
of Statistics, the monthly Economic Trends which also provides a quarterly
summary of the balance of payments, Financial Statistics (monthly), the
Annual Abstract of Statistics, the Preliminary Estimates of National Income
and Balance of Payments, published annually before the Budget, and the
fuller National Income and Expenditure Blue Book issued later in the year.
A general survey is also provided in the annual Economic Report, also
published shortly before the Budget. Statistics on Incomes, Prices, Employment
and Production, compiled by the Ministry of Labour to provide factual
information for those engaged in wage negotiations, is published quarterly.
The Digest of Scottish Statistics is published half-yearly by the Scottish
Statistical Office, a Digest of Northern Ireland Statistics at half-yearly
intervals by the Economic Section of the Cabinet Offices of the Northern
Ireland Government, and an annual Digest of Welsh Statistics by the Office of
the Secretary of State for Wales.
In the last seven years there have been considerable improvements in the
scope and presentation of official statistics. A much wider range of information
is collected and, additionally, the data are often shown at constant
prices and in the case of important short-term statistics are seasonally
adjusted.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Control and
Stimulations
of Industrial
Expansion
Northern Ireland
While the Government has no power to direct an individual firm to set up a new
factory or plant in any particular area or site, it has sought, on both economic
and social grounds, to control the expansion of industry in some areas and
to encourage it in others.
One object has been to try to limit the expansion of industry in congested
areas, such as Greater London or Birmingham; and the other to induce
movement of expanding industry to areas of high unemployment or, second¬
arily, to new or expanded towns taking population from congested areas.
The negative powers required derive from the Town and Country Planning
Acts in conjunction with the Control of Office and Industrial Development
Act 1965. Under these Acts the consent of the local planning authority is,
in general, necessary for any new building, any extension of a building or any
change in the use of an existing building. Where industrial floor space of
more than 5,000 square feet is to be created (1,000 sq. ft. in the congested
Midlands regions and in south-east England), or more than 2,500 sq. ft. of
office development in the Metropolitan region (extending 40 miles from the
centre of London), such consent cannot be sought without a certificate from
the Board of Trade that the development is consistent with the proper
distribution of industry.
Assistance for areas of high unemployment began to be given in 1934 (when
the inter-war depression was at its worst) and has been given ever since under
successive Acts. The main legislative basis of the Government’s present
positive powers is provided by the Local Employment Acts i960 and 1963.
Under the i960 Act, the Government’s powers of assistance were centred in
one department, the Board of Trade, which can name as ‘development
districts’ places where high and persistent unemployment exists or is expected,
and can offer a number of inducements to industrialists to settle or expand
there. Specifically, the Board can build factories for leasing at favourable rents
or sale on deferred terms; make a capital grant towards the cost of an industria¬
list’s own factory or for unusual initial expenses arising solely from the choice
of a development district; and make loans towards working capital or for
acquiring premises or equipment. The appropriate government departments
can also make grants to local authorities for clearing derelict or neglected sites
and for improving basic services.
Under the Act, the government-controlled industrial estate companies,
which under the Distribution of Industry Acts had run the industrial estates
in the development areas, were replaced by three Industrial Estate Manage¬
ment Corporations, one each for England, Wales and Scotland. These
corporations are controlled and financed by the Board of Trade.
The rise in unemployment during the severe winter of 1962-63 was
particularly marked in Scotland, north-east England and Merseyside. The
Government accordingly increased public expenditure particularly in these
areas, strengthened its powers under the Local Employment Acts and took
certain other measures. To stimulate industrial expansion generally, investment
allowances were increased in November 1962. Under the Finance Act 1963, a
new business in a development district was allowed to write off its investment
in plant and machinery at any rate which it chose (thus postponing tax
liability). The Local Employment Act 1963, enhanced the Board of Trade’s
powers by enabling it to offer standard grants of 25 per cent of building costs
and 10 per cent of plant and machinery costs to businesses setting up or
expanding in development districts.
The Local Employment Acts do not apply to Northern Ireland. The matters
with which the Acts deal are the concern of the Northern Ireland Parliament

but the provision of the Finance Act 1963? which gives an industrial under¬
taking freedom to write off for tax purposes the cost of new fixed plant and
machinery at any rate it chooses (‘free depreciation’), applies to Northern
Ireland as well as to the Development Districts of Great Britain. Under the
Industries Development Acts (Northern Ireland) 1945 to 1953, a comprehen¬
sive and flexible scheme of assistance (which can include the tenancy or
purchase on favourable terms of a government-built factory, together with
a grant towards the cost of plant and machinery and the cost of transferring
equipment from a factory outside Northern Ireland) can be offered to projects
which appear likely to make a desirable contribution to the economy of
Northern Ireland. Grants and loans can also be offered to the appropriate
authorities for the improvement of basic services if these should be considered
inadequate for a given development. Firms which are assisted under the
Industries Development legislation are expected to undertake a specific
development which will employ an agreed number of persons within a given
period. Under the Capital Grants to Industry Acts (Northern Ireland)
I954 t0 I9(>2, manufacturing enterprises in Northern Ireland are entitled to
claim outright grants of 33-J per cent of their annual expenditure on plant
and machinery and industrial building, subject, in the case of firms new to
Northern Ireland, to a maximum grant of .£200,000 in any one year. This
assistance, which is largely unconditional, is intended primarily to encourage
modernisation and capital investment.
Since I945> new firms have been established in Northern Ireland and
150 schemes of expansion carried out with government assistance, develop¬
ments which at present are employing some 55,000 persons. The Ministry
of Commerce is the Northern Ireland government department concerned
with the administration of the Industries Development and Capital Grants
legislation.
Encouragement is given to the development of rural industries. In England
and Wales there is the Rural Industries Bureau, which, on the recommenda¬
tion of Rural Community Councils, provides technical advice and instruction
to craftsmen and small rural businesses; it also provides loans from the Rural
Industries Loan Fund, started in i94°> f°r the acquisition of equipment and
the purchase or improvement of workshops. In Wales the Development
Commission1 has financed small factories to stimulate rural industries and
prevent rural depopulation. In Scotland the Scottish County Industries
Development Trust, founded in 1935, exercises local and national respon¬
sibilities for the development of rural industries, and in Northern Ireland
the Rural Industries Development Committee is run with government assist¬
ance under the auspices of the Northern Ireland Council of Social Service.
In Scotland and Wales there are national organisations devoted to encouraging
the expansion and diversification of industry. The Scottish Council (Develop¬
ment and Industry), with a wide membership including local authorities,
trade associations, trade unions, chambers of commerce, co-operative societies
and banks, is concerned with the economic development of Scotland. It
assists the expansion of existing industry, fosters the growth of new industries,
especially in areas requiring development, encourages exports, organises
1 The Development Commission approves and administers advances by grants or loans
from the Development Fund, established by the Development and Roads Improvements
Fund Acts 1909 and 1910. At the present time the Fund may be used to help and
expand agriculture and rural industries and also to promote the development and
improvement of fisheries.

exhibitions and publicises Scottish trade and industry. The special problems
of the seven crofting counties of Scotland (see p. 343) are the concern of a
public authority, the Highlands and Islands Development Board. This was
set up to formulate programmes of work and execute any approved proposals;
as well as giving advice or financial help, it can acquire land and start
businesses. There are several voluntary associations concerned with the
needs of Welsh industry as a whole, but the most similar in aims and
constitution to the Scottish Council is the Development Corporation for
Wales, founded in 1959. In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Economic
Council was set up in 1965 to assist in furthering economic growth. The
chairman is the Minister of Commerce and the membership includes repre¬
sentatives of industry, commerce and the trade unions.
In England certain regions and cities have established industrial develop¬
ment associations which are concerned with studying local industrial needs
and with trying to attract suitable industry. These associations are sponsored
mainly by local authorities and trade associations, but may also include
firms, financial and commercial interests, and individuals in their membership.
Government The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working
and the of the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
Nationalised fr0m industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
Industries First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members
of each board, and secondly, he has power to give general directions as to
how the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day manage¬
ment. It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister
any information, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In
practice, as the responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy
decisions are reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion
for him to issue a formal directive.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual
statutory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so
that receipts at least balance outgoings taking one year with another. The
responsible minister is usually empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to
say what shall be done with any surplus revenues which may accrue. As
regards finance of capital expenditure, the present system is that such finance
as cannot be met from internal sources is mainly provided, in the form of
interest-earning loans, by the minister from the Exchequer, bank advances
being used only for normal requirements of short-term capital.
The minister responsible for each nationalised industry must take steps to
see that the interests of the industry’s customers are protected. This is usually
done by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider
complaints and suggestions made to them, and to advise the board or the
minister on the changes they think desirable.
Government policy towards these industries is subject to the approval of
Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are afforded by
debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts, and by
answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible only
if concerned with policy rather than details of administration.
In a White Paper (Cmnd. 1337) issued in April 1961 the Government out¬
lined certain general principles which it believed had to be applied for the
administration of the nationalised industries to be efficient. Among them were
a balancing of revenue accounts over a five-year period, a closer definition 01
the financial and economic obligations of the industries, and greater freedom

in price policies. In accordance with these principles, financial objectives for
the nationalised fuel and power industries and for BEA, the Post Office and
the London Transport Board have since been announced.
In order to ensure that parliamentary discussion of the nationalised industries
is informed and effective, a House of Commons Select Committee on the
Nationalised Industries was established in 1957 to examine the reports and
accounts of the nationalised industries and to report to Parliament. Reports
issued by the committee have so far dealt specifically with the two Scottish
electricity boards, the National Coal Board, the airways corporations,
British Railways, the gas industry and the electricity supply industry. These
reports have discussed problems of ministerial control, organisation, finance
and general policies. A report published in February 1962 reviewed the action
taken by the corporations and the Government in the light of the committee’s
recommendations.
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction,
and gas, electricity and water) was in the first half of 1965 some 4 per cent
higher than a year previously, about 32 per cent more than in 1958 and
about double the pre-war level. The course of production and the employment
from 1959 to 1964 is shown in Table 13.

Between 1958 an<3 !9^4 output in the chemical industry rose by 53 per
cent; in engineering and electrical goods by 37 per cent; in metal manufacture
by 28 per cent; in vehicles (including aircraft) by 26 per cent; in paper,
printing and publishing by 39 per cent; in clothing and footwear by 26 per
cent (see diagram on p. 274).
The increases in production since 1958 have been due partly to an increase
in the labour force but mainly to a variety of factors influencing productivity,
including technical advances in products, machinery and processes; the high
and increasing rate of fixed capital formation; more intensive sales promotion
and improvements in the management of particular undertakings.
Gross fixed capital formation at home has continued to increase steadily
even in periods when demand as a whole was slowing down. In 1964 it
amounted to about 20 per cent of the gross domestic product and was estimated
to be about 53 per cent greater than in 1958. Part of this rising investment is
linked with the introduction of new techniques and equipment and in
particular of machines and instruments which lessen the demand for human
skill and supervision though they may require more skill from fewer people.
All of this is part of the process known as automation, which is giving rise to
far-reaching changes in the pattern of industry and in the internal organisation
and labour requirements of business enterprises and has already been

INDEX OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
kind. In the short run, very large increases in output per man are sometimes
achieved by such investment or simply by changes of policy, organisation
or methods.
Productivity Both the long-term and the short-term growth of productivity thus depend
most directly on the decisions of individual undertakings, and the promotion
of productivity is regarded as primarily a matter for industry though govern¬
ment departments and educational and research establishments also have their
contribution to make. Government budgeting and financial policies also have
a strong influence on the extent and direction of demand. These, therefore,
are framed to a large degree on a realistic assessment of the possibilities of
sustained economic growth.
Leading industrialists have been recruited as advisers in the Department
of Economic Affairs to help overcome specific obstacles to efficiency and
industrial expansion. They work principally through the Economic Develop¬
ment Committees (EDCs), which are offshoots of the National Economic
Development Council. The Committees cover particular sectors of industry
and bring together managements, unions and government representatives.
Employers’ associations and trade unions are engaged in activities to raise
industrial productivity. In signing a Joint Statement on Productivity, Prices
and Incomes (see p. 257) representatives of trade unions and employers
organisations undertook ‘to raise productivity and efficiency so that real
national output can increase’. Employers’ organisations often provide technical
assistance, conduct market surveys, and support schemes of vocational
education and training.
The trade unions in many industries organise special schemes for training
young people, and also a variety of courses designed to give trade unionists

an understanding of modern management techniques. Private consultants
specialising in management and work study are available to give advice to
firms on measures to increase their productive efficiency; there are also many
specialist institutions, both public and private, concerned with various aspects
of productivity.
The British Productivity Council (BPC) was established by both sides of
industry to stimulate interest in methods of raising productivity. It was set
up in 1952 to continue and develop the work of the Anglo-American Pro¬
ductivity Council. It is an independent body on which are represented the
Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the
Association of British Chambers of Commerce, and the nationalised industries;
its work is financed by contributions from these bodies and by a government
grant-in-aid. Advisory committees have been set up to promote productivity
in the building trades, in agriculture and in retailing. Much of the BPC’s
work is done through 130 local productivity committees and associations
throughout the country. These local organisations arrange meetings, inter¬
factory visits, courses, conferences, film shows and exhibitions.
The British Standards Institution (BSI), is a voluntary non-profit-making
body incorporated by Royal Charter. It prepares and promulgates standards
in respect of, inter alia, quality, performance, dimensions, testing methods
and codes of practice. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manufac¬
turers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies the
specification of requirements, thus promoting industrial efficiency. The BSI
is governed by a council consisting of representatives of the main organisations
of employers and workers, professional institutions and the larger government
departments.
The Board of Trade is the department responsible for general aspects of
the promotion of productivity and it administers the government grants to
the BPC, the BSI, and the Council of Industrial Design. The Ministry of
Technology, however, is charged with the function of extending the intro¬
duction of automatic control systems and advanced techniques into industry
and provides technical advisory services. It is also concerned directly with
research into such factors as productivity measurement techniques, production
engineering and fatigue among operators.
A number of other departments have responsibilities which bear on pro¬
ductivity. The Ministry of Labour has an Industrial Relations Service, which
advises firms on personnel management and industrial relations. The
Department of Education and Science and the Scottish Education Department
are responsible for the technical colleges, at which courses are available in
such subjects as work study and industrial engineering. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works provides a Technical Information Service for the
building industry; and the Ministry of Power and the British Productivity
Council sponsor the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service. The Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food provides a number of advisory services
which aim at encouraging the efficiency of the farming industry in England
and Wales; similar services are provided by the three Scottish agricultural
colleges.
Management During the present century and particularly during and since the second
world war, the increasing pace of technical organisational and social change
has made the successful conduct of enterprises dependent on knowledge of,
and practice in, a complex of managerial techniques for dealing with technical
and human problems. In Britain, as elsewhere, there is a growing awareness
276 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the importance of management as a subject requiring special skills and
knowledge. This has been reflected both in a change in the general educational
qualifications of recruits to management and in the spread of systematic
education and training for management.
The British Institute of Management (BIM) is the central national
management body for the study and promotion of scientific management
throughout industry, commerce, and public administration. It is entirely
financed from industrial and professional subscriptions. The main objects
of the BIM are to undertake research into, and provide information on,
management practices and techniques, and to encourage the development
of education and training for management on a national scale. Management
studies and education for management are expanding rapidly in Britain and
have become a recognised feature of higher education (see p. 170).
Training courses for higher management are held at a few universities,
notably Bristol; by some firms of management consultants; and at the
Administrative Staff College at Henley-on-Thames (normally of somewhat
longer duration) and Ashridge, Berkhamsted. The larger firms, especially
those with wide-ranging responsibilities, often provide general management
courses for the training of senior executives, and systems of informal training
within an organisation are numerous. There are also various bodies concerned
with specialised branches of management, for example the Institute of
Personnel Management, the Institution of Works Managers, the Institute
of Office Management and, on the sales side, the Institute of Marketing and
Sales Management.
The growing number of professional personnel working as management
consultants—now probably over 2,000—and the use of the services of
independent management selection firms in the appointment of senior staff
are indications of the interest in the science of management in Britain.
Legislation in force in the United Kingdom for dealing with restrictions in
trade and industry, either by agreements (formal or informal) between
suppliers, or by monopolies which dominate the market, is described below.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 provides for the registration
and judicial examination of restrictive agreements. It requires the entry in a
public register of the particulars of a wide range of restrictive agreements
(including those relating to common prices, approved lists of dealers and the
limitation of production) which affect the supply or processing of goods for
the United Kingdom market. The Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agree¬
ments is responsible for keeping the register and for bringing the agreements
before the Restrictive Practices Court set up under the Act. The Court, which
includes laymen but is presided over by one of Her Majesty’s judges, is, in
effect, responsible for deciding whether or not an agreement is in the public
interest. If the parties to an agreement fail to satisfy the Court that any
restriction in their agreement produces one or more of seven beneficial
effects set out in the Act, and that the restriction is not unreasonable, having
regard to the balance between the benefit it confers and any public detriment
likely to result from its operation, that restriction must be found contrary to
the public interest. Agreements are void in respect of restrictions so found.
The Court can make orders preventing the parties from operating their
agreement, or from making new arrangements having the same effect. Agree¬
ments relating exclusively to exports are not subject to this procedure but
have to be notified to the Board of Trade. The first full hearing before the
Court took place in October 1958. By the end of December 1964 the Register
Monopolies and
Restrictive
Practices
INDUSTRY
277
contained particulars of 2,505 agreements. Of these, some 1,650 had been
abandoned, had expired or had had all restrictions removed from them; and
138 agreements had been the subject of decisions of the Court.
Monopolies and kindred arrangements (except those within the scope of
the Restrictive Practices Court) in the circumstances indicated in the Mon¬
opolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act 1948 may be
referred by the Board of Trade to the Monopolies Commission for investiga¬
tion and report. Production departments take appropriate action on the basis of
these reports but no order can be made without the approval of Parliament.
The 1956 Act excluded from the scope of the Commission’s work agreements
which had to be registered under the new legislation. It is now mainly con¬
cerned with the investigation of monopolies. Since 1948 the Commission has
presented some 26 reports.
In a White Paper published in March 1964 the Government announced
proposals for strengthening and extending the legislation on monopolies and
restrictive practices. The Monopolies and Mergers Act, passed in 1965,
reorganises and enlarges the Monopolies Commission; provides for the
investigation of services and of proposed or recently completed mergers at
the reference of the Board of Trade; makes special provision for newspaper
mergers; and improves and extends the Government’s powers for taking
action on the basis of the Monopolies Commission reports including new
powers to prohibit mergers and break up undesirable monopolies and
mergers.
Under the 1956 Act collective enforcement of resale price maintenance
was prohibited, but individual suppliers remained free to enforce resale
prices in the courts. The Resale Prices Act 1964 makes minimum resale price
maintenance unlawful, except in respect of classes of registered goods for
which temporary exemption has been sought under the provisions of the Act.
Where resale price maintenance is prohibited, it is also unlawful to notify
to dealers prices stated or calculated to be understood as the minimum price
which may be charged on the resale of goods in the United Kingdom, or to
seek to maintain such prices by withholding supplies. Suppliers may continue
to practise resale price maintenance on registered goods, pending a decision
by the Restrictive Practices Court as to whether a case for exemption has
been made out against the criteria in the Act.
FUEL AND POWER
The main primary sources of energy currently used in Britain are coal,
petroleum and, to a small extent, water power, nuclear energy and natural
gas; secondary sources produced from these are electricity, gas and coke.
Coal, mined within the country, supplies slightly under two-thirds of
primary energy and it will remain the principal source for many years to come.
For supplies of crude petroleum Britain is virtually dependent on imports.
Water power resources are small. A large-scale programme is in hand for the
construction of nuclear power stations.
The pattern of primary energy consumption has changed appreciably in
recent years, as shown in Table 14 and in the diagram on p. 279. While the
proportion of total energy supplied by coal has tended to fall, that by oil has
risen from under 20 per cent in 1958 to 27 per cent in 1961 and 33 per cent
in 1964. Of the primary fuels consumed in 1964, 62 per cent of the coal and
nearly 16 per cent of the oil were converted into secondary fuels.

The fuel and power industries, with the exception of petroleum, are under
public ownership. General responsibility for ensuring the effective and co¬
ordinated development of fuel and power resources lies with the Minister
of Power, who in 1965 appointed an Energy Advisory Council to assist him;
on the Council are representatives of the fuel and power industries, major

industrial consumers and trade unions. Fuel research is undertaken by the
fuel and fuel-using industries. The Minister of Power also has an Advisory
Council on Research and Development.
In general, fuel and power industries require heavy capital investment in
long-term projects and both internal resources and borrowing are used to
raise the large sums needed. Until 1956 long-term borrowing by the cor¬
porations was mainly through the issue of stock, except in the case of the
coal industry, which borrowed direct from the Exchequer. Under the
Finance Act 1956 all the corporations were given power to raise money by
means of Exchequer advances from the responsible minister with the approval
of the Treasury. These powers were extended and amended by the Finance
Act 1958 and by other Acts. Since 1956 all the corporations have obtained
their long-term capital by loans from the Exchequer and issues of stock have
been suspended.
Investment requirements of the nationalised fuel and power industries in
1965-66 is expected to amount to over £930 million1. In 1964 these industries
accounted for over one-third of public investment and over one-eighth of all
fixed investment.
The responsible ministers—the Minister of Power in England and Wales
and the Secretary of State in Scotland—are required by statute to set up
consultative councils to ensure the protection of the interests of consumers
of fuel. Councils were established for coal in 1947, for electricity in 1948 and
for gas in 1949. The councils each consist of a chairman and from 20 to 30
unpaid members. These are appointed by the minister from nominations
put forward by interested bodies selected by the minister as representing
consumers. In the electricity and gas supply industries councils and com¬
mittees have been formed on an area and district basis; for coal there are
councils at national level only.
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coal¬
mining industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years
longer than in any other country. British coal exports dominated the world
market until about 1910. By 1913—the peak production year—the industry
was producing 287 million tons of coal, exporting 94 million tons and
employing over a million workers.
The very fact that the British industry was developed so early has meant
that many of the best seams of coal are now worked out; every year coal has
to be mined from deeper and thinner seams and productivity can be main¬
tained only by a high level of re-equipment and constant modernisation.
Attempts to secure economies through amalgamation date from the Sankey
Commission of 1919. In 1930 a Coal Mines Act established commissioners to
bring about the formation of larger and more efficient units. The Coal Act of
1938 transferred ownership of mineral coal royalties to the State. During the
second world war the industry was under government control.
The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 brought the industry under
public ownership; by this Act, all its assets—coal mines, mineral rights and
ancillary undertakings—were vested on 1st January, i947> in National
Coal Board (NCB), which became responsible for the industry’s management,
compensation being paid to the former owners. Under the Coal Industry
Act 1949 the Board, which is appointed by the Minister of Power and is
1 Loans from the Consolidated Fund, 1964-65. Cmnd. 2624.
INDUSTRY 28l
responsible through him to Parliament, consists of a chairman and not fewer
than eight or more than 11 other members.
The National Coal Board has the exclusive monopoly to mine coal in
Great Britain, though it may license privately owned undertakings to work
small mines not employing more than 30 underground workers, and also
to work open-cast sites where the total output is not expected to exceed
25,000 tons.
The NCB is responsible for its own regional organisation. The main
collieries, numbering 545 at the beginning of 1965, are grouped into 40 areas
which are the basic units for commercial management; their size varies
according to geological, geographical and other technical considerations. The
areas are grouped into eight divisions which roughly correspond to the main
coal-bearing regions. A divisional board for each division supervises and
co-ordinates the work of the areas (except in the small south-eastern division,
which is administered by a general manager), formulates divisional policy,
and is answerable to the NCB, which is responsible for questions of national
policy, finance and the co-ordinating of major schemes of development. The
day-to-day work of running the collieries is under the direction of colliery
managers. The NCB, however, has no monopoly of sales or distribution. It
makes some direct sales to large consumers and also retail sales in a few areas.
Most retail distribution is in the hands of private firms.
The NCB has made surpluses in some years and deficits in others. In
certain areas, such as Scotland, Lancashire and South Wales, deficits have
been persistent, and profits from areas of high productivity, for instance the
East Midlands, have not been sufficient to cover the losses. The Board’s aim
is to break even, after paying interest and making proper provision for
depreciation. By April 1965 the cumulative deficit amounted to £90-8 million.
The decision by the Government to write down the total capital debt to the
Exchequer (see p. 283) will make an appreciable reduction in the annual
interest charges now borne by the Board.
Production and It has been estimated that Britain’s workable reserves of coal will last for
Manpower about 200 years at current rates of consumption.
The main coal-bearing areas are: (1) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and
Nottinghamshire field, which produces about 48 per cent of the total output,
(2) the Durham and Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and
(4) the Scottish field. Other important coal-bearing areas are those of Lanca¬
shire and the West Midlands (Staffordshire and Warwickshire). Prospecting
for coal continues both inland and off the north-east coast of England.
The main trends in coal production and manpower since 1947 are shown
in Table 15.
In addition to exploration for new workings, forward planning lays emphasis
on the need for further mechanisation and the reorganisation of the haulage
system. With machinery rapidly replacing manpower, productivity rose by
23 per cent between 1961 and 1965. At mechanised faces average output per
manshift is 6-5 tons, compared with 3-75 tons at non-mechanised faces, the
average for all mines being about 5 tons. In 1964 output per manshift at NCB
mines rose by 4-2 per cent to 5-4 tons with 26,000 fewer workers.
Consumption

Coal consumption in Britain increased by an average annual rate of nearly
4 million tons between 1947 and 1956; inland sales fell sharply between 1956
and 1959 and large stocks of coal accumulated at pit heads. Growing competi¬

by the gas and iron and steel industries have largely contributed to the fall in
demand for coal. In 1963 the Board’s stocks at collieries and open-cast sites
were reduced by 5-7 million tons but a marked fall in demand in 1964, partly
attributable to mild weather, led to a further small rise in both distributed and
undistributed stocks.
Over one-third of total output is consumed by the electricity authorities
and over one-quarter by domestic and industrial users together. Coke ovens
and the gas industry are other large users. Consumption by the electricity
industry has increased by nearly 50 per cent since 1958, whereas the
requirements of all the other main classes of consumer have declined. For
domestic users this fall has been slightly offset by increased purchases of
solid smokeless fuels.
Coal exports have fallen heavily in relation to pre-war levels, due, at first,
partly to increased internal consumption and, more recently, to keener
competition. Strenuous efforts have been made to recover overseas markets
and in 1963 exports of coal, coke and briquettes rose to 10 million tons,
falling back in 1964 to 7-4 million tons, valued at £37 million. The principal
markets are the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the
German Federal Republic and the Irish Republic.
Capital
Investment and
Development
The National Coal Board raises capital by borrowing directly from the
Exchequer. At present there is a statutory limit of £750 million on such
borrowing, but borrowing above £700 million must be authorised by Order
in Council. In addition the Board may, with the permission of the Minister of
Power, borrow temporarily (by way of overdraft or otherwise) up to £20
million. The greater proportion of investment, however, is financed from
internal resources.
Capital expenditure by the industry totalled £462 million from 1947 to 1955
and about £790 million in the nine years 1956 to 1964. At the end of 1964-65
financial year the total capital debt to the Exchequer amounted to about
£960 million; but a substantial proportion of this sum (estimated at about
^400 million) represented the undepreciated book value at notional cost of

the mines which had closed or were scheduled for closure during the present
decade. In July 1965 the Government announced that a fresh study was being
made of the NCB’s capital structure as the industry appeared to be considerably
overcapitalised. Legislation is to be introduced before the end of 1965 to effect
a capital reorganisation, including the writing off of about £400 million of the
existing debt.
About three-quarters of coal output will come from new and reconstructed
collieries by 1966; many will have a daily output of up to 6,000 tons while a
few will be capable of up to 8,000 tons. Horizon mining methods are being
extended, lay-outs for pit-bottoms, new designs for loading stations and
mechanical handling methods are being widely introduced. Remotely operated
longwall faces are operating successfully at two collieries and experiments
are being extended to others. The Bevercotes colliery in the East Midlands is
the first in the world to be fully mechanised and automated from the coal face
to the surface; it commenced operations in the second half of 1965. Exploration
of coal reserves is being intensified and boring for coal under the sea has been
completed in the Firth of Forth and is in progress off the Durham coast.
The NCB has three research organisations: a Coal Research Establishment,
at Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, providing facilities for
fundamental research; a Mining Research Establishment, for the investigation
of underground problems, at Isleworth, Middlesex; and a Central Engineering
Establishment for developing new machines and testing equipment, near
Bretby, Derbyshire. In 1959 the Board set up a new department concerned
primarily with the further development of new processes for making smokeless
fuels. In 1947 the NCB took over the Coal Survey, a national organisation
for surveying coal resources within Britain; it has 70 laboratories in the various
coalfields.
A number of autonomous research associations receiving grants from the
NCB and the Ministry of Technology include the British Coal Utilisation
Research Association, the British Coke Research Association and the Coal Tar
Research Association. Much of the work of other bodies, such as the Safety
in Mines Research Establishment (SMRE), is closely related to the Board’s
problems; the SMRE carries out research on explosions and fires, pneumo¬
coniosis, engineering and metallurgy.
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young,
a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish
shale deposits, yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858 and ceased
production in 1962.
Sources of crude oil within Britain meet only 1 ton in every 600 of total
United Kingdom requirements, the remainder being imported from overseas.
Annual production of crude oil from indigenous oilfields now totals nearly
130,000 tons.
Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the establishment of
several small oilfields, notably in Nottinghamshire (Eakring, Egmanton and
Bothamsell), in Leicestershire (Plungar), in Lincolnshire (Gainsborough), in
Lancashire (Formby) and in Dorset (Kimmeridge).
Seismic prospecting in the North Sea has been going on since 1962. Under
the Continental Shelf Act 1964, the Minister of Power, by a system of
licensing for exploration and production, controls those activities in the areas

over the Shelf appertaining to the United Kingdom. Britain’s share of the
North Sea shelf amounts to about 100,000 square miles. In September 1964
production licences covering nearly 32,000 square miles were issued to 23
concerns; in August 1965 a further 36,000 square miles of new areas (in
addition to the areas not previously taken up) were made open to offer. Besides
the North Sea, these new areas are along the south coast of England, around
the Orkney and Shetland Islands, and in the eastern half of the Irish Sea
(including the coastal waters of the Isle of Man). Drilling is now in progress
but positive results are not expected for some time.
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the
Middle East, Far East and Caribbean areas.
Today these companies produce about one-third of all oil entering into
international trade, with a tanker fleet (partly owned by them and partly on
charter) amounting to nearly a quarter of the world’s tanker tonnage. (United
Kingdom registered tanker tonnage is nearly one-seventh of the world’s total.)
In 1964 the United Kingdom imported 59-5 million tons of crude oil
valued at £410 million, the largest single item among imported products;
approximately 30 per cent came from Kuwait, the other largest suppliers
being Iraq, Libya, Venezuela, Iran and Nigeria, in that order.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption in 1964 totalled
slightly over 61 million tons, having risen by one-third in three years. An
outstanding feature has been the continued rapid advance in use of black
oils. Fuel oil consumption has been rising at the rate of over if million tons
a year since i960 and totalled over 24! million tons in 1964. Demand for gas
and diesel oils (excluding that used in road vehicles) rose to 6 million tons in
1964. Sales of motor spirit in recent years, after expanding by half a million
tons annually for some years, rose by nearly 1 million tons in 1964 to 10
million tons.
A more detailed analysis of deliveries of gas and diesel oils for 1964 shows
that their most important uses were for non-industrial central heating, agri¬
cultural tractors and the railways. Electricity generation accounted for about
22 per cent of total fuel oil consumption, excluding that used in oil refineries;
the steel industry accounted for 16 per cent and non-industrial central
heating for a further 11 per cent. Of the remainder, the largest users were
the cement, paper-making, general chemical, glass, non-electrical engineering
and fishing industries. Demand for most other products increased in 1964
but the use of high octane gasolines and certain minor products, notably
kerosene and vaporising oil, showed a further fall.
Before 1939 three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum
products was refined overseas, as it was considered more economical to refine
at the source of production. Since the second world war, however, the
industry has come to favour the siting of refineries in the consuming areas.
By mid-1965 rated refinery capacity in the United Kingdom amounted to
over 69 million tons a year. Of the 19 refineries in operation, five have a
capacity of under 0-2 million tons. The six largest are situated at Fawley,
near Southampton (11-3 million tons); Stanlow, in Cheshire (10-4 million
tons); Isle of Grain (10 million tons) and Shellhaven (9-5 million tons), both
on the Thames Estuary; and two at Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire
(6-3 million tons and 4-6 million tons). Other important refineries are located

at Belfast, in South Wales (Llandarcy), and on the Firth of Forth (Grange¬
mouth). These, and other projects in hand or planned, will bring Britain’s
total capacity to about 99 million tons a year by the end of 1968.
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) has
risen steadily; from 4 million tons in 1948 to 25^ million tons in 1954, 40
million tons in i960 and the record total of 54 million tons in 1964. There is
a substantial external trade in refined products which tends to follow trading
and seasonal requirements and the commercial arrangements of the oil
companies. Exports from Britain, mainly in the form of heavier products
to European countries, were valued at £100 million in 1964; imports of
refined products including liquefied gases amounted to ^174 million.
Three major oil pipelines are at present in operation in Britain. Two of these—
one in Scotland (from Finnart on Loch Long to Grangemouth) and one in
South Wales (from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to Llandarcy)—carry crude
oil from harbours capable of berthing very large tankers to refineries; and one,
from Walton-on-Thames to London Airport, carries aviation fuel. Pipelines
carry refined products from refineries to major marketing areas, where the
volume transported is sufficient to justify the capital cost; for example, one
runs between Stanlow, Cheshire, and Urmston, near Manchester, and
another, 78 miles along, takes petroleum feedstock from Fawley refinery to
the j£ioo million petroleum chemicals project at Severnside, near Bristol; a
third carries refined products from Fawley to west London and London
Airport. Advanced surveys are at present in hand for the construction of a
system of pipelines linking the Midlands with refineries and installations on
the Thames and Mersey and with a connection from the Fawley-west London
pipeline. There are also projects for linking the Tees with the Mersey.
Meanwhile, parts of the system of pipelines laid during the second world
war are being used by the petroleum distributing companies. The Pipelines
Act 1962 is designed to secure the orderly development of privately owned
industrial pipelines.
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(the British Petroleum Company), Thornton, in Cheshire, and Woodstock,
in Kent (Shell), and Abingdon, in Berkshire (Esso). The first of these covers
the full range of petroleum research and development, from geology and
production to product utilisation and petroleum chemicals. In general, the
remainder are concerned with the evolution of new and improved lubricants
and the development of new uses for oil and of new products based on oil,
especially chemicals.
A public supply of electricity was first provided in Britain in 1881, at
Godaiming, Surrey. From its earliest days a measure of public control has
been a feature of the industry and the Electric Lighting Act 1882 authorised
the Board of Trade to grant licences for the establishment of electricity
undertakings by local authorities or by companies (which the local authorities
might compulsorily purchase after a given period of time) to supply consumers
in given areas. By the turn of the century a variety of independent supply
systems had grown up all over the country. In 1919 the Electricity Commis¬
sioners were set up as a supervisory body and to promote reorganisation on a
national scale through voluntary agreement. In 1926 the Central Electricity
286

Board was established to co-ordinate more efficiently the generation of
electricity.
Under the Electricity Act of 1947, a central authority, then known as the
British Electricity Authority, and 14 Area Electricity Boards took over in
April 1948 the assets of former municipal and private electricity supply
undertakings throughout Great Britain, except in the area already served by
the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (see below). Under the Electricity
Reorganisation (Scotland) Act of 1954, the authority’s power stations and
transmission lines in Scotland were taken over in April 1955 by the South of
Scotland Electricity Board (see p. 287). The name of the authority was changed
from British Electricity Authority to Central Electricity Authority.
On 1st January, 1958, under the Electricity Act 1957, the Central
Electricity Authority was dissolved and replaced by two new bodies, the
Electricity Council and the Central Electricity Generating Board.
The present organisation of the electricity supply industry, in which about
242,000 people (including 4,500 in Northern Ireland) are employed, is
described below.
The Electricity Council, the central body of the industry, is composed of a
chairman, two deputy chairmen, not more than three other persons, and the
chairman and two other members of the Central Electricity Generating
Board, and the 12 chairmen of the Area Electricity Boards. The main
functions of the Council are to advise the Minister of Power on matters
relating to the electricity supply industry. The Council is responsible for a
number of common services, including capital financing and research.
The Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) consists of a chairman,
deputy chairman and not fewer than six, nor more than eight, other members.
The Board’s primary functions are to generate or acquire supplies of electricity
and to provide bulk supplies to the area boards.
The Area Boards (of which there are at present 12) are responsible for
the distribution and sale of electricity. Each consists of a full-time chairman
and deputy chairman and five to seven members (mostly part-time).
Area Consultative Councils were set up under the Electricity Act 1947 in
the area of each board to represent the interests of consumers; their chairmen
are ex officio members of their respective Area Boards.
The Minister of Power in England and Wales appoints the chairmen,
deputy chairmen and members of the Electricity Council, the Central
Electricity Generating Board, the Area Boards and the Consultative Councils;
approves each Board’s capital development programmes and the industry’s
research programme; and approves, in consultation with the Treasury, the
boards’ borrowing requirements.
The Central Electricity Authority (and its successors the Electricity Council
and the Central Electricity Generating Board) together with the Area Boards,
have made a surplus on revenue from their operations in each of the years
since they were established. Up to and including the financial year 1964-65,
these balances of revenue amounted in the aggregate to nearly £370 million.
Under the 1957 Act, each electricity board, not merely the industry as a whole,
must pay its way, taking one year with another.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB) was set up in 1943
as a public corporation to develop the water-power resources of the Highlands
and Islands and to distribute electricity in the more sparsely populated parts
of Scotland not covered by existing undertakings. The Board consists of a
INDUSTRY

chairman, and not less than four nor more than eight other members, of
whom one or more may be appointed deputy chairman. Since 1948 the Board
has been solely responsible for all generation and distribution in the area,
which covers that part of Scotland north and west of a line running roughly
from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth of Tay.
On 1st April, 1955, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, answerable to
the Secretary of State for Scotland, took over the then British Electricity
Authority’s functions in Scotland, and also the functions of the two area
boards in the south of Scotland, which were dissolved. The Board consists
of a chairman, and not less than four nor more than eight other members,
of whom one or more may be deputy chairmen.
A consultative council to represent the interests of consumers has been
appointed for the district of each board by the Secretary of State. The
Secretary of State appoints the chairmen, deputy chairmen and members
of the Scottish Electricity Boards; approves their capital development and
research programmes; and, in consultation with the Treasury, their borrowing
requirements.
In Northern Ireland electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast and
Londonderry and at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh. Those in Belfast and
Londonderry are owned and operated by the city corporations and the
remainder by the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland. Generation at these
stations is co-ordinated by the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Committee,
set up by statute in 1948, which purchases their output and resells it to
distributors—the Belfast Corporation, for Belfast and district, the London¬
derry Corporation for the City of Londonderry, and the Electricity Board
for the rest of Northern Ireland.
As Britain has abundant supplies of coal, together with good rail and water
transport for moving it, most of its electricity is produced by coal-fired steam
generating stations. The development of hydro-electricity on any scale is
comparatively recent, water power resources being relatively small and in
remote areas, but nuclear energy is now contributing an increasing volume.
The output capacity of the generating stations of the electricity boards in
Great Britain at the end of 1964 totalled 37,120 megawatts (MW), an increase
of about 25 per cent since i960.
In the years i960 to 1964 an annual average of nearly 2,000 MW of
generating capacity was installed, but it is expected that capacity of over
20,000 MW in England and Wales will be commissioned in the period
1965-68 inclusive. In the north of Scotland it is planned to increase capacity
from 1,221 MW at the end of 1964 to 1,660 MW by 1970. The South of
Scotland Electricity Board’s proposals provide for its total installed capacity
of 2,785 MW at the end of 1964 to be increased to 5,752 MW by 1970.
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where, of the total installed
generating capacity of 737 MW, 180 MW is in oil-fired and the remainder in
coal-fired thermal stations) amounted to 2,050 million kilowatt-hours in 1964.
Generation by the public supply in Great Britain exceeded 162,000 million
kilowatt-hours in 1964: conventional power stations provided 96 per cent
of the total and hydro-electric and nuclear stations about 2 per cent and 3
per cent respectively. The high rate of expansion of output, which has been
a feature of the industry since its earliest years, has been maintained. Total
production increased by nearly 65 per cent between 1958 and 1964; during
the severe winter of 1962-63 peak demand reached 35 million kilowatts, so
far the heaviest load imposed on the system.

In the mid-1950s, when a coal shortage seemed likely, programmes for oil¬
firing at conventional thermal stations and for generating from nuclear energy
were introduced. There are thirteen oil-burning power stations, or parts of
stations, operating in Great Britain. They are mainly situated on river
estuaries and thus able to be fed conveniently from oil refineries.
The electricity authorities are the largest consumers of primary fuel in
Britain and, although most of their electricity generation is based on coal,
oil consumption rose from a negligible quantity in 1955 to over 5-5 million
tons in 1962 falling back to 5-3 million tons in 1964. Average thermal efficiency
of conventional steam stations in England and Wales (i.e. the ratio of power
output to the fuel consumed) rose from 20-75 Per cent in I947 t0 27-67 per
cent in 1964 as new plant was brought into use. The twenty most efficient
stations, containing much of the newest plant, had an average efficiency of
33-19 per cent in that year.
The largest generating sets in operation are the 550 MW set at Thorpe
Marsh, near Doncaster, which came into operation in 1963, and sets of
350 MW capacity at Blyth ‘B’ station in Northumberland and Drakelow ‘C’
at Burton. These large machines show substantial economies in capital cost,
in fuel consumption and in operating costs. Larger sets, of up to 660 MW
capacity, are planned. Station capacities are also increasing: the largest
stations under construction in England and Wales include ten with individual
capacities of 2,000 MW (from four 500 MW generating sets) at West Burton,
Ratcliffe and Cottam in Nottinghamshire; Ferrybridge ‘C’ and Eggborough in
Yorkshire; Fawley in Hampshire; Fiddler’s Ferry in Lancashire; Kingsnorth
in Kent; Pembroke; and Didcot in Berkshire. These stations will come into
service between 1965 and 1968. Ministerial consent has been given for a
station of 3,000 MW (possibly 4,000 MW) capacity at Drax, in Yorkshire,
and for a 1,000 MW station at Rugeley ‘B’, in Staffordshire. In Scotland a
1,200 MW station is under construction at Cockenzie and a 2,400 MW
station at Longannet.

The setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in 1943
marked the beginning of an era of intensive water-power development in the
Highlands of Scotland. A development scheme drawn up by the Board in
1944, showing the water-power resources which it proposed to examine, listed
102 hydro-electric projects with an estimated annual output of 6,274 million
units of electricity. In 1964, 2,550 million units were generated by the
North of Scotland Board from water-power, compared with 322 million in
1949. At the end of 1964 there were 54 main hydro-electric stations in operation
in the north of Scotland with a total installed capacity of 1,047 MW and the
largest—the Loch Sloy station—had a capacity of 130 MW; the Cruachan
pumped storage section of the Awe scheme, with an installed capacity of
400 MW, was nearing completion (it is expected to be ready before the end
of 1965) and a further 1,849 MW, including 1,200 MW of pumped storage,
were under consideration. The Board also had 175 MW of coal and diesel-
fired capacity. In addition, there are stations generating electricity by water¬
power in the south of Scotland (123 MW) and in Wales (472 MW, including
the 360 MW of pumped storage at Ffestiniog).
As an extension of its experimental work and to produce plutonium, the
Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) has two major stations also producing
electricity, of which the output capacity has been raised to over 200 MW each
—Calder Hall, Cumberland, began operating in May 1956 and Chapelcross,
Dumfriesshire, in February 1959. Altogether, the AEA’s nuclear power
stations are supplying some 3,000 million units of electricity annually for the
national grid.
The commercial stations under the Government’s nuclear power pro¬
gramme are being built for the electricity authorities by groups of engineering
firms specially organised for the construction of nuclear power plants. All
the stations are based on the gas-cooled reactors of the Calder Hall type,
fuelled by natural uranium with graphite as a moderator.
Special factors have to be taken into account in the siting of the nuclear
power stations, notably the need for firm foundations to bear the weight
of the reactors and their supporting structure, a location distant from heavily
built-up areas, and plentiful supplies of water for cooling. Great care is
taken to preserve amenity and landscape beauty.
Of the ten commercial stations planned under the current nuclear power
programme, due for completion in 1969, seven were in operation by the end
of 1965. These are situated at Berkeley, in Gloucestershire (276 MW output
capacity) and Bradwell, in Essex (300 MW), both of which were commissioned
in 1962; Hunterston, in Scotland (300 MW), commissioned in 1964; Hinkley
Point ‘A’, in Somerset (500 MW) and Trawsfynydd, in Wales (500 MW),
commissioned in 1965; Dungeness ‘A’, in Kent (550 MW) and Sizewell, in
Suffolk (580 MW), to be in operation by the end of 1965. Oldbury, in
Gloucestershire (600 MW), Wylfa, in Anglesey (1,180 MW), and Dungeness
‘B’ (880 MW) are due to reach completion in 1966, 1968-69 and 1969-70
respectively. Wylfa is at present the most powerful nuclear station under
construction in the world.
The present output of these nuclear stations is double that of the rest of
the world together. Accumulated experience in the design and operation of
these stations has led to a reduction in capital cost in relation to output. The
Berkeley station’s capital costs, for example, were £186 per kilowatt sent out;
those of Wylfa are estimated to amount to only £100.
In the White Paper, The Second Nuclear Power Programme (Cmnd. 2337)
of April 1964, the Government announced that the CEGB was to plan on the
290
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
basis of a nuclear power programme of 5,000 MW for commencing between
1970 and 1975. Following examination by the CEGB, in conjunction with
the AEA, of tenders based on various types of reactors, it was announced in
May 1965 that the Government had accepted their joint recommendations
that an advanced gas-cooled reactor of the kind developed by the AEA should
be used for the first station, Dungeness ‘B’, in the second programme.
Pumped Storage To provide a type of energy storage to even out the variation of demand, the
Generating Board has built a pumped storage scheme which is now in full
operation, and others are contemplated.
In these schemes, electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to pump
water to higher levels from which it descends at peak periods to operate
turbo-generators. The CEGB’s 360 MW pumped storage station at Blaenau
Ffestiniog, near Trawsfynydd in North Wales, started operating in 1961
and was completed in 1963; suitable sites for other schemes are being investi¬
gated. The first large-scale pumped storage works in Scotland, comprising
a 400 MW combined pumping and generating plant, forms part of the
Loch Awe project and came into operation in 1965.
Transmission Main electricity transmission lines—the National Grid—supply most of the
and Distribution country. By 31st March, 1964, those of the Central Electricity Generating
Board totalled some 8,397 route miles (14,301 circuit miles), of which 1,914
miles were operated at 275,000 volts, 6,183 miles were operated at 132,000
volts and the remainder at 66,000 volts and below. In Scotland there were
3,892 circuit miles of main transmission lines at the end of 1964, of which
1,044 circuit miles operated at 275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000 volts.
Energy movements on the grid in England and Wales are controlled through
the seven operational areas, set up for that purpose and distinct from the
regions in which the generating side of the industry is organised; each area has
a separate control, and the operations are co-ordinated by a National Control
in London. The grid in Scotland is operated from the control centres
at Pitlochry (North of Scotland) and at Kirkintilloch (South of Scotland).
Most of the new ‘supergrid’ of main transmission lines now operating at
275,000 volts is to be up-rated to operate at 400,000 volts, starting in 1965.
This is being done to reduce the number of new transmission lines needed to
meet the country’s increasing power demands. The development of the grid
system has made the British system the most closely integrated power network
in the world. Twin cross-Channel cables laid between Dungeness and
Boulogne, costing £4^ million, and capable of transmitting up to 160 MW at
200,000 volts (direct current) have been in operation since 1961; by this means
advantage is taken of the differences between France and Britain in the
timing of peak loads.
In England and Wales the Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers
electricity acquired mainly from the Central Electricity Generating Board,
supplemented from other sources, such as industrial plants and the nuclear
power stations of the AEA. There are nearly 17 million consumers. Industrial
concerns are the biggest users of electricity and their demands are increasing
rapidly. The principal domestic uses of electricity are for lighting, cooking
and for space and water heating, but the demand for numerous other domestic
purposes is rising steadily.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board has also pressed ahead with
the distribution of electricity to consumers in the north of Scotland. At the
end of 1964 it had over 421,000 consumers of electricity, many of them in
remote areas, and well over four-fifths of the farms and crofts had a supply of
INDUSTRY
291
electricity. At the same date the South of Scotland Electricity Board sup¬
plied 1 -4 million consumers, including over 97 per cent of the farmers in the
area.
Capital Nearly 11 per cent of the annual gross fixed capital formation of the United
Investment Kingdom in 1964 was attributable to the electricity supply industry. The
industry has hitherto based its capital needs for five years ahead on an increase
in demand averaging about 7^ per cent; its plans for the future are based on
an average annual growth of 9 per cent.
Capital expenditure of the electricity supply industry has been expanding
very rapidly: from £242 million in 1956 it rose to ^378 million in 1961 and
an estimated ^640 million in 1964. About two-fifths of the industry’s capital
requirements have been financed from internal resources. The aggregate
outstanding borrowing of the industry in Great Britain is limited to £4,980
million. The industry (other than the NSHEB) is required to aim at a gross
return of 12^ per cent on its net assets.
Research The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Minister of Power, is
responsible for drawing up a general programme of research, comprising:
direct research carried out by the Electricity Boards themselves; sponsored
research undertaken for the supply industry by universities and colleges;
and co-operative research with other organisations, in particular the industrial
research associations, such as the British Electrical and Allied Industries
Research Association, to which the supply industries subscribe. The Council
itself is empowered to conduct research. It is advised by the Electricity
Supply Research Council.
The main research establishments of the industry are run by the Central
Electricity Generating Board and comprise the Central Electricity Research
Laboratories at Leatherhead, Surrey, the Berkeley Laboratories in
Gloucestershire, concerned with nuclear problems, and the Engineering
Laboratories at Marchwood on Southampton Water. In 1965 the Electricity
Council decided to establish a laboratory at which intensive research will be
undertaken on distribution problems (to supplement the work undertaken
at the Central Electricity Research Laboratories) and on appliances and
methods of electricity utilisation.
Both Scottish electricity boards are empowered to carry out research and
experimental work either on their own or in co-operation with other electricity
authorities. The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board undertakes a wide
range of research and development work, both independently and in con¬
junction with the British Electrical and Allied Industries Research Association,
colleges of science and technology, universities and manufacturers. The South
of Scotland Electricity Board has recently extended its own research activities
and is associated with those of the Electricity Council and Central Electricity
Generating Board in England.
GAS SUPPLY Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London,
was first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light
and Coke Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London.
In the early years of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting
and was provided by a growing number of company and municipal under¬
takings.
The gas industry in its present form developed in the main during the
period between the two world wars when increasing competition from

electricity had to be met, and by 1939 the industry had become mainly a
supplier of heating rather than lighting.
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain, in which about
125,000 persons are at present employed, under public ownership and control
on 1st May, 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269 belonged to
local authorities, were vested in 12 Area Gas Boards. The central body is
the Gas Council, appointed by the Minister of Power. It is both a co-ordinating
council and, since the enactment of the Gas Act 1965, a trading body,
consisting of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman, the 12 chairmen
of the area boards and up to three other members. Its general duties are to
advise the Minister on questions affecting the industry and promote the
efficient performance of their duties by the area boards. It has also specific
duties relating to finance, labour relations and research.
The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and opera¬
tional responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies
of the other publicly owned corporations, are responsible for manufacturing
gas and distributing it to consumers. Each of the Area Gas Boards, appointed
by the Minister of Power, consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chair¬
man, in some cases one or more full-time members, and usually five or six
part-time members, including the chairman of the Area Consultative Council.
There is no common pattern of organisation; each board is fully independent
and has devised its own subordinate structure. Each is required to pay its
way, taking one year with another. The operations of the area boards have
resulted, in the 15 years up to 31st March, 1964, in an aggregate disposable
surplus of approximately ^44-9 million, before taxation.
When the industry came under public ownership, a link between it and
the consuming public was established by the creation of a Consultative
Council in each board area. These councils consist of not fewer than 20 and
not more than 30 members, of whom between 50 and 75 per cent are chosen
from panels of persons nominated by the local authority associations.
In Northern Ireland the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a
number of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
The chief method of gas production in Britain is still by carbonising coal but
oil-based production is expanding markedly; one-quarter of gas supplied in
1964 was derived from oil, and 1-5 million tons were used, double the amount
in 1963. The gas industry used just over 20 million tons of coal (25 million
tons in 1958) and another 25^ million tons were carbonised in coke ovens
other than those of the gas industry. About one-third of the output of gas
from coke ovens is sold to gas undertakings for general distribution; the
remainder is mainly consumed at the ovens or at steelworks.
There are about 13 million consumers, the total having shown no significant
change since 1955. Manufactured gas and gas acquired from coke ovens and
other sources for distribution exceeds 600,000 million cubic feet annually.
In 1964 the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was about
7,000 million cubic feet, most of it for household use.
Half of all gas is sold by gas boards for household use and the remainder for
industrial and commercial purposes. Total consumption has been rising at an
average rate of over 3 per cent per annum since 1961, after a period when
growth was almost negligible. During the very cold winter of 1962—63 the
rate was even higher. It reached a level of about 3)35° mdlion therms in 1964.

About 50 per cent of the domestic load is used for cooking and about 25 per
cent for space heating, the remaining 25 per cent being spread over water
heating and other installations. Most homes in Britain are supplied with gas,
except in some rural areas where, owing to difficulties in storage and trans¬
mission, gas is not economic. Bottled gas, derived from petroleum, is used
in rural areas.
Gas is used extensively in industries which require the control of temperatures
to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the pottery industry and in
certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products. In 1963-64
sales of gas to industry totalled 861 million therms.
Production of coke at gas works in 1964 was 8-8 million tons, and at coke
ovens 16-9 million tons, reflecting on the one hand the increasing use of oil
and on the other a higher level of activity in the steel industry. The gas
industry and coke ovens jointly produce about 3 million tons of crude coal tar
and over 100 million gallons of crude benzole a year. These latter by-products
yield materials widely employed in the newer branches of the chemical
industry.
Under the Gas Act 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas
Boards was limited to ^250 million. In 1954 industry’s borrowing powers
were increased to £450 million, in i960 to £525 million, in 1963 to £650
million and in 1965 to £1,200 million.
The industry had been spending about £50 million a year on capital invest¬
ment in the period 1955 to 1961 but since 1961-62 expenditure has increased
sharply; in 1964—65 it reached £89 million and £117 million has been approved
for 1965-66. Between vesting day (1st May, 1949) and the end of March 1965,
about £850 million had been invested in fixed assets.
Considerable integration, by the linking of works for the transmission of gas
through gas grids and long-distance mains, has enabled production to be
concentrated in the most efficient units.
To maintain its competitive position, the gas industry has investigated
new and more economic methods of production and new sources of gas
supply. Although two plants which use the Lurgi method for the complete
gasification of inferior grades of coal have been commissioned, their capital
cost is high. More significant have been the developments in the gasification
of oil. In the 1950s these plants were largely to meet peak-load needs, with
the exception of the large installation of the South Eastern Gas Board at the
Isle of Grain, Kent, and they used mainly heavy oils as feedstock. More
recently the introduction of processes using light distillates has permitted even
greater savings to be made in both capital and running costs.
The work done in the Gas Council’s Midlands Research Station led to the
introduction of two new methods of manufacture, the Gas Recycle Hydro-
genator and the Catalytic Rich Gas processes, both of which enable a high
calorific value gas to be manufactured entirely from light distillate feedstock
without the need for enrichment from any outside source. The first plants
incorporating these processes were put on stream in 1965. Gas made from
oil and gas purchased from refineries now amounts to nearly one-third of the
total supply available and the proportion is steadily increasing.
As a result of successful trial shipments of liquid natural gas in 1958 and
1959, the Gas Council in 1961 signed a 15-year contract for the purchase of
natural gas from the Sahara in specially constructed insulated tankers.

Deliveries started in 1964 and during 1965 reached the full rate of 35,000
million cubic feet of gas annually, equivalent to some 10 per cent of total
consumption. A pipeline system distributes the gas from the Canvey Island
terminal.
The Gas Council expects gas consumption to increase by about 7 or 8 per
cent a year up to 1970 and therefore substantial expansion in gas-making
capacity is required. The need to provide additional storage capacity,
particularly in underground reservoirs of porous rock (regulated under the
Gas Act 1965), and the strengthening of the distribution system will also
mean substantial investment.
The Gas Council has a research committee which advises on the initiation
and implementation of research policy. Research organisations comprise three
stations (two in London and one at Solihull) and a ‘basic’ research group,
in addition to Watson House at Fulham, London, for the design, testing
and development of appliances. Research is also carried out on behalf of
the Gas Council at Leeds University and at other universities and colleges.
Efficiency in the use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, has
been assisted by various bodies representing producers and consumers and
by the technical advisory services of the fuel and power industries.
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National
Coal Board, solid fuel distributors and appliance manufacturers and dis¬
tributors. Originally formed in 1932, it informs and advises domestic users
on the best use of solid fuel, including the choice of installation and the
operation of solid fuel appliances.
A non-profit-making company, the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency
Service, was formed in 1954 and sponsored by the fuel and power industries
to promote fuel saving in industry. It provides advice and services to all non¬
domestic fuel users in a variety of forms, from ‘spot’ inspection to full-scale
heat and power surveys and regular visits on a contract basis.
WATER SUPPLY
Britain’s water resources are, with progressive development, sufficient for
domestic and industrial requirements. The sources of water are often distant
from the areas where supplies are needed, however, and water undertakings
are therefore mainly concerned with abstraction, storage, treatment and
distribution. Supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as
mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds and river
intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits and
boreholes. Unlike other public services in Great Britain, such as electricity and
gas, water supply remains in the hands of a large number of undertakings.
On taking up office in October 1964 the Government announced its intention
of reorganising the water supply industry under full public ownership; the
Minister of Land and Natural Resources was made responsible for formu¬
lating long-term plans to give effect to this general policy. Ministerial
responsibility in England and Wales is shared by the Minister of Housing
and Local Government, the Minister of Land and Natural Resources and
the Secretary of State for Wales; in Scotland it lies with the Secretary of
State for Scotland; and in Northern Ireland with the Minister of
Development.

Present
Supplies in
England and
Wales
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies
became a general public service and then only after long and bitter con¬
troversy. It was largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick and his
colleagues, who demonstrated the dangers arising from inadequate water
supply and sanitation, that the Public Health Act 1848 became law in England
and Wales and laid the basis for a long series of statutes dealing with public
health. From the middle of the nineteenth century onwards a number
of water undertakings were set up to provide water to the expanding urban
population, and the water supply system developed rapidly, although in
piecemeal fashion and with some overlapping and waste.
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water
supplies are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this
either by operating water undertakings themselves or by ensuring that other
bodies are providing adequate supplies. Over one-fifth of the water consumed
is supplied by statutory water companies. The householder receives his
domestic water supply at a comparatively small charge, varying in different
areas, which he usually pays by way of a water rate levied, like other rates,
on the value of his house. Industrial users are charged according to con¬
sumption as recorded by meter.
The Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of
State for Wales have a duty to promote the conservation and proper use of
water supplies in England and Wales and to formulate a national water
policy. A statutory Central Advisory Water Committee advises the Minister
on general questions relating to water and organisation of supplies. Since
the passing of the Act, some 790 smaller water authorities in England and
Wales have been absorbed by larger authorities or by the creation of joint
boards in order to improve the efficiency of the water supply industry. In
March 1965 there were in England and Wales 210 local authority water
undertakings, 103 joint water boards (including bulk supply boards) and
6 joint water committees, 45 statutory water companies, 9 non-statutory
water companies, and one private proprietor with statutory powers. A number
of private proprietors without statutory powers also provide small supplies.
The Metropolitan Water Board, which is probably the largest single water
undertaking in the world, supplies over 350 million gallons daily to the
61 million people in the London area. It consists of 88 part-time members
who are the elected representatives of the various local authorities within the
Board’s area of operations, together with one representative each from the
Thames and Lee Conservancies.
Today, piped water reaches over 95 per cent of the total population of England
and Wales and about 90 per cent of the rural population.
Capital expenditure by water undertakers amounts to between £40 million
and ^50 million a year. Interest, together with running costs, is largely met
from annual income.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by
grants under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1961. By
March 1965 schemes costing over £94 million had been completed or were in
progress with the aid of grants under these Acts.
The growth of towns in England and Wales has meant increased demands
for water, the needs of industry having grown so much that in many areas
they now exceed domestic demand. The use of water in irrigation of farm
land is also growing. In order that the country’s water resources should be
developed to meet these growing requirements the Water Resources Act 1963
296
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
provided for a new administrative structure consisting of 27 river authorities
and a central Water Resources Board; the Act came into full operation in
April 1965. The 27 new river authorities, the Thames Conservancy and the
Lee Conservancy Catchment Board have a majority of members appointed
by the county and county borough councils in their areas. The remainder
are appointed by ministers for their knowledge of land drainage, fisheries,
the public water supply, and water in use in industry and in agriculture.
The authorities manage the water resources of river basins, taking over the
functions of the 30 former river boards in respect of land drainage, flood
control, administration of fisheries and prevention of pollution. They are
responsible for assessing water resources and requirements, controlling and
developing resources and securing regulation by a system of licensing.
Special arrangements exist for the Greater London area, where the full range
of river authority control is not necessary. The work of the river authorities
is co-ordinated by the Water Resources Board, an expert advisory body which
reports to the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources. Its duties include
the review of national water resources and requirements, the encouragement
of the transfer of water between areas according to need, the co-ordination
of proposals of river authorities for capital investment and the initiation of
research. Water conservation is to be financially self-supporting after an
initial period of about five years, the cost being met from charges made to
abstractors and users of water.
Water Supply
in Scotland and
Northern
Ireland
In Scotland public water undertakings are carried on entirely by local
authorities, either separately or in combination with each other; they supply
about 97 per cent of the total population. The water problem in Scotland is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales except that there is not the
same need to allocate water between competing interests and less reliance
needs to be placed on underground sources. The Water (Scotland) Acts
1946 and 1949, among other provisions, impose a general duty on the
Secretary of State to promote the conservation of water resources in Scotland;
require local authorities to provide supplies of wholesome water everywhere
in their districts, where this can be done at reasonable cost; and provide for
a uniform system of rating for water throughout the country. The Scottish
Water Advisory Committee advises the Secretary of State on general questions
relating to resources and supplies. The Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage
Act 1944, as amended, makes available to Scottish local authorities grant
assistance up to a maximum of ^45 million towards the cost of water supplies
and sewerage schemes in rural areas. By December 1964 the total value of
work done on new and improved water supplies since 1945 amounted to
£yg-i million, of which ^37-6 million represents works aided by grants under
these Acts.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of water for both domestic and
industrial consumption. The Water Supplies and Sewerage Act (Northern
Ireland) 1945 made it obligatory for water supply authorities to provide a
supply of wholesome water to houses and schools in their areas where this
could be done at reasonable cost, and also empowered the then Ministry of
Health and Local Government to make grants towards the costs of schemes
undertaken by these authorities. Before 1945 only the more densely populated
areas had a piped supply, but progress has been such that even in the thinly
populated rural districts most households have now been, or soon will be,
connected to a piped supply. By 31st March, 1965, about ^28-5 million had
been expended, including grants totalling £13-5 million.

Water Pollution
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation’s surface
water resources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain,
published annually by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office. This publication
contains particulars of the run-off and related rainfall from a large number of
rivers, streams and reservoired areas. The Water Resources Board is responsible
for the gauging, collation and publication of hydrological information: the field
work of surface water measurement is done by river authorities, water
undertakings and other bodies. Detailed studies of the resources and use of
water in specified areas have been published in the series of Hydrological
Surveys which cover approximately half of England and Wales. General
information on rainfall, published annually in British Rainfall, is the res¬
ponsibility of the Meteorological Office, while advice on ground water is the
responsibility of the Water Resources Board. The Hydraulics Research Station
of the Ministry of Technology at Wallingford and the Water Research
Association’s station at Medmenham carry out research into problems of the
design and calibration of gauging weirs and flumes for the measurement of
surface water, and into other hydraulic problems.
Each river authority is responsible for the prevention of pollution of rivers
and certain tidal waters in its area and its approval must be sought before
polluting effluents are discharged. Control of pollution in the tidal Thames
is exercised by the Port of London Authority (see p. 364). In Scotland nine
river purification boards have been set up; north and west of the Caledonian
Canal and in parts of the counties of Angus and Kincardine the county
councils and town councils of large burghs are the river purification authorities.
The Secretary of State receives advice from the Scottish River Purification
Advisory Committee on questions affecting the cleanliness of Scottish rivers,
which he has a duty to promote.
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory of the Ministry of Technology
investigates problems connected with the treatment of polluted waters, the
treatment and disposal of sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects
and prevention of pollution of surface water and underground water. Research
is carried out with general supervision and advice from the Ministry’s Water
Pollution Research Board.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industries include firms engaged on the construction,
alteration, repair and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage
and sewerage systems, waterworks, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence
works, electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, open-cast coal
prospecting and mining, and structural work connected with thermo-electric,
hydro-electric power stations and telecommunications. The industries employ
about if million persons, including all grades. Allowing for new work only,
and excluding work carried out on repairs and maintenance, they provide
nearly 10 per cent of the gross domestic product.
To meet a growing demand for constructional work arising from plans for
large scale expansion and modernisation, it is estimated that the industries
will need to increase output by about 50 per cent over the next decade.
This will have to be achieved, in the main, by improvements in produc¬
tivity as any great increase in labour resources to meet these demands is
unlikely,
298
Structure
Output
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Constructional work is carried out both by private contractors and by-
public authorities who employ their own labour. Nearly five-sixths of the
work is done by private firms, which range from the very large, employing
over 20,000 men, to one-man businesses. Although there are about 90,000
firms in the industry, about 16 per cent of the operatives are employed by
the 80 largest firms, each employing more than 1,000 persons.
Public authorities as a whole employ nearly 370,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these are engaged on repair and maintenance work which
local authorities, for example, carry out with their own labour.
Of the total labour force, nearly a million are skilled operatives who have
been trained under the apprenticeship scheme, taking four to five years to
qualify. About one-third of these skilled men are employed on repair and
maintenance work.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake responsi¬
bility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the smallest
projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either by
architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects,
by consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a
client, embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans
and the supervision of the constructional work by the contractor. There are
over 250 firms of consulting engineers in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Public Building and Works (see p. 58) is responsible for
all the construction programmes undertaken directly by the Government
(except for roads), including work for the armed services, both at home and
overseas. It is also responsible for co-ordinating research and development
throughout the government service and seeks to influence methods and
techniques in the building industry as a whole. In 1963 it set up a Directorate-
General of Research and Development, consisting of four directorates, con¬
cerned respectively with long-term planning, management, research and
development.
The Government set up a National Building Agency in 1964, a limited
company, financed initially from government funds. The Agency offers
advice to clients, contractors, materials producers and the building professions
on the most modern ideas and techniques and brings clients’ demands
together so that industrialised methods can be more widely used.
The value of output of the industry has been rising fairly steadily since 1954,
when building controls ended; by the end of 1964 it was running at an annual
rate about 45 per cent higher than ten years earlier. The value of work done
in 1964 amounted to £3,614 million, of which £522 million represented work
carried out by the men employed directly by public authorities. Private
contractors carried out the remaining £3,092 million (£2,467 million on new
work and £625 million on repair work).
During the period 1954 to the end of 1964 the number of operatives
employed increased by about 9 per cent and average output per operative
increased by about 35 per cent. (If new work alone is considered, the increase
was about 50 per cent.)
Some 5 million houses have been built in Great Britain since 1945; about
3 million on behalf of public authorities, mainly for renting, and about
2 million for private owners, mainly for sale. About 426,000 houses were
started in 1964 and some £995 million of housing work was carried out by

private firms, a record for the total volume of housing work. Of this, about
^571 million, or 57 per cent, was for private owners and the remaining
£424 million for public authorities.
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale
modern industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment
to carry out major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent
figures in the early development of civil engineering included John McAdam,
pioneer in road construction; Thomas Telford, builder of roads, canals,
docks and railways; George and Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom
Brunei, pioneers of railway building.
Among important construction projects in hand in the United Kingdom in
1965 were a drainage and sewerage scheme in Glasgow, costing £3 *5 million,
and another at Davyhulme, costing ^6-4 million; the Loch Awe hydro¬
electric and pumped storage scheme in Scotland, costing ^7 million; eight
major conventional power stations and several nuclear power stations (see
p. 288); the ^5 million river Trent tidal reach improvement scheme; the
10-mile Victoria Tube line in London, costing £57 million; and the Great
Ouse water supply scheme, costing £52 million. Projects for road construction,
bridges and tunnels included a further 129 miles of motorways under con¬
struction (see p. 373), major road bridges over the river Severn and the Firth
of Tay, and the £12-6 million tunnel under the river Tyne.
British constructional firms have been as active overseas as in the United
Kingdom. British consulting engineers, in particular, have built up a tradition
of knowledge and integrity which has caused their standards to become
international practice and their services to be in world-wide demand.
Among important construction projects by British contractors in hand in
overseas countries during 1965 were: a new township for the Government of
Bahrein, costing £6 million; the £10 million restoration of the Hejaz railway
in the Middle East; electrification projects on the Indian railways (£6 million);
and a £2 million ocean terminal at Hong Kong. British consulting engineers
were engaged on a number of projects where British contractors were not
commissioned for the construction work. Notable examples were an airport
at Baghdad, costing £12-5 million; a ^6-5 million main drainage scheme for
Benghazi; construction of two water barrages in West Pakistan (£27 million);
water supply schemes for Hong Kong (£19 million) and Libya (£6-3 million);
2 £16 million iron and steelworks in Tunisia; and construction of a dam and
tunnel for the Tehran water board (-£14 million). On certain projects both
the consulting engineers and the contractors were British, examples being
the second stage in the port of Tema construction in Ghana (^n million);
and the 12-mile Accra-Tema motorway (^3-3 million).
It has been estimated that the total value of work carried out during the
year ending in March 1965 by over 60 British contractors, operating in 81
countries, was £160 million, compared with £123 million in the previous
year, and that the value of new contracts obtained was £198 million, com¬
pared with j£ii8 million in the previous year. Consulting engineers had
projects worth about £1,060 million in hand on 1st January, 1965.
The Directorate-General of Research and Development in the Ministry of
Public Building and Works is responsible for co-ordinating research and
information services to increase efficiency in the building industry.
Some of the research establishments of the Ministry of Technology (see
Research
300
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
p. 59) deal with subjects relating to the construction industries. The Building
Research Station which was set up in 1921, thus making Britain the pioneer
of organised building research, is concerned with research into all aspects of
building. The Hydraulics Research Station studies such subjects as hydraulic
structures for hydro-electric projects and research on timber is undertaken
at the Forest Products Research Laboratory. The Road Research Laboratory
of the Ministry of Transport carries out research on road construction and
traffic problems.
The Heating and Ventilating Research Association, an industrial organisa¬
tion, deals with problems of heating and ventilation of large buildings. Large
manufacturing firms have laboratories, some of the work of which is concerned
with construction, and the major construction firms have research departments
working on plant, materials and methods. Other bodies concerned with
research include the universities and colleges of technology. Most of the
producers of primary building materials have trade associations which main¬
tain research institutions chiefly devoted to seeking new and more efficient uses
for their materials: the Timber Research and Development Association and
the Cement and Concrete Association are examples.
In i960 a Civil Engineering Research Association was set up on the initiative
of associations of civil engineering contractors and consulting and civil
engineers in consultation with representatives of private firms in the industry.
The Association is financed by grants from the Ministry of Technology and
contributions from the industry; its function is to promote the carrying out
of research on appropriate problems in civil engineering, making use of existing
research facilities of all types.
A working party set up jointly by the Minister of Public Building and Works
and the building industry recommended in 1964 that research on construction
should be organised by a body representative of the industries, the Govern¬
ment and academic experts and should be carried out in future at an annual
rate starting at ^0-5 million in the first year, rising in two or three years to
£5 million, and should be financed mainly by a levy on the industries.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
Britain’s manufacturing industries supply a wide , range of products, many
of which are of major importance in world trade. Output has increased by
over 29 per cent since 1958, and in 1964 was nearly 8 per cent higher than
the previous year. In 1964 this sector spent ^1,236 million on fixed capital
equipment, including £349 million on building work and £805 million on
plant and machinery. The number of employees in manufacturing industry
(including the unemployed and those absent from work through sickness
and other causes, but excluding employers and the self-employed) was nearly
9 million in June 1964, 38 per cent of the total number of employees.
The employment and sales figures listed in Table 17 give an indication
of the relative importance of broad sectors of manufacturing industry.
Expansion has been particularly rapid in electronics, in the newer branches of
mechanical engineering, most branches of the chemical industry and man¬
made fibres. The diagram on p. 274 shows the changes in production between
1958 and 1964 in the major groups of industry.
In the subsequent sections, statistics relating to firms are those of enter¬
prises given in the Censuses of Production for 1958 and 1962, statistics of
employees refer to numbers at June 1964, and export statistics are taken from
the Accounts Relating to Trade and Navigation in the United Kingdom.

The metal manufacturing industries employed 627,000 persons in June 1964.
Of these, 357,000 were in the iron and steel industry, 125,000 in the manu¬
facture of iron castings, 57,000 in the manufacture of light metals, and 87,000
in the copper, brass and other base metal industries. Exports of iron and steel
products and non-ferrous metals in 1964 had an aggregate value of £356
million.
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards and British inventors were responsible for the
discovery of the processes which led to the great expansion of steelmaking
in the second half of the nineteenth century. Today Britain is the world’s
fifth largest steel producing nation. Output of crude steel in 1964 (a 53-week
year) totalled 26-2 million ingot tons, 14-7 per cent above the comparable
1963 total and well above the previous record level of 24-3 million tons in
i960. Capacity utilisation in 1964 was 88 per cent compared with 79 per cent
in 1963. Between i960 and 1964 total capacity increased by about 4 million
tons. Pig iron production in 1964 amounted to 17-3 million tons.
Net deliveries of finished steel amounted to 20-3 million tons in 1964 and
the 3-8 million tons of iron and steel products which were exported had a value
of ^217-7 million; the United States (£15 million), Sweden (^12-9 million),
3°2

Iron Castings
Canada (^11-3 million) and India (^10-5 million) were the main overseas
buyers; exports to Europe totalled ^95-4 million.
The main producing districts are: South Wales (24 per cent of total crude
steel output); the north-east of England (18 per cent); Lincolnshire (12 per
cent); Sheffield and district (12 per cent); Scotland (11 per cent); and
Lancashire (10 per cent). Other important areas are Staffordshire, North¬
amptonshire, and the north-west coast of England. South Wales concentrates
mainly on the manufacture of flat products, especially sheet steel and tinplate;
the output of the north-east coast and Scotland is predominantly of heavy
steel products (plates, sections and rails); Sheffield is responsible for two-
thirds of Britain’s alloy steel production.
During the period 1950-64 about £1,320 million was spent on major
development schemes. The industry now has sufficient capacity available to
meet all foreseeable demands, and the emphasis in its development plans is
on improving efficiency; capital expenditure is therefore expected to be less
heavy in the next few years. Britain has some of the most modern plant in
Europe and it is estimated that by 1965 steel produced in the new converter
processes had increased from 8 per cent of total output in i960 to about
24 per cent; the proportion of steel from electric furnaces had increased
from 7 per cent to 13 per cent; and the share of the older open hearth process
had fallen from 85 per cent to about 63 per cent.
Larger and more efficient blast furnaces have been installed and coke
consumption has been reduced by improvements in the preparation of raw
materials and by the practice of fuel injection, i.e. oil and powdered coal.
Fundamental research is carried out by the British Iron and Steel Research
Association and the industry as a whole now spends some £10 million a year
on research.
Many companies have developments to improve the quality and range of
finished products. Outstanding recent projects include wide strip mills at
new integrated works at Newport (Monmouthshire) and at an existing works
in Scotland; a new plant at Stoke-on-Trent, which is based entirely on
continuous casting for supplies of semi-finished steel; an advanced unit for
the mass production of alloy and special carbon steels and the world’s largest
electric furnace plant for the bulk production of carbon and low alloy steels,
both at Sheffield.
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public
supervision since 1932. In February 1951 the greater part of the industry
came under public ownership, but the Iron and Steel Act 1953 established
an Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency, with the duty of returning
the companies to private ownership. Only one company remains under the
control of the Agency.
In a White Paper, published in April 1965 by the new Government,
proposals for bringing 13 major steel companies into public ownership were
outlined. Their shares and securities would be vested in a National Steel
Corporation and the Iron and Steel Board, set up under the 1953 Act to
exercise a general supervision over the iron and steel industry, would be
dissolved. Members of this Board are appointed by the Government and it is
financed by levies which it has power to make on firms in the industry. The
major trade association in the iron and steel industry, excluding iron and steel
founding, is the British Iron and Steel Federation.
Output of iron castings was 4-1 million tons in 1964, compared with 3-7
million tons in 1963 and 2-54 million tons in 1946. The main users of iron

castings are the general engineering industry, the motor vehicle industry, the
building and associated industries, manufacturers of pressure pipes and
fittings, and the steel industry. An important part of total output consists of
grey and malleable iron castings for use in motor vehicles, tractors, machine
tools, engines and all kinds of power units.
There are about 1,300 firms in the iron founding industry and the number
of employees is about 125,000. Exports are included in the total of steel
exports in the previous section.
The non-ferrous metals industry is the largest in Europe and as a consumer
of aluminium, copper and lead Britain is second only to the United States
among western countries. Output in 1964 included: aluminium, 32,000 tons
of virgin metal and 169,000 tons of secondary metal; refined copper, 110,000
tons of virgin copper and 131,000 tons of secondary metal; lead, 57,000 tons
of virgin metal and 121,000 tons of secondary metal; zinc, 109,000 tons of
slab metal; and tin, 18,000 tons. Mining in Britain is confined to the working
of lead and tin ores on a small scale, although detailed investigation is taking
place into the possibilities of a considerable expansion of tin mining.
In 1964 exports of non-ferrous base metals were valued at ^108*1 million.
The main products exported, including semi-finished products, were copper
and copper alloys (^40-4 million), aluminium and its alloys (j£i7‘5 million),
nickel and its alloys (^24-2 million), and tin and its alloys (^10-5 million).
The German Federal Republic (£15-4 million), France (£8-i million), the
Netherlands (£7-7 million), the United States (^7-1 million) and Sweden
(£7 million) were the largest purchasing countries. There were also sub¬
stantial exports of finished products incorporating non-ferrous semi-finished
products and non-ferrous metals in many finished forms.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the Midlands; other centres include
South Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth. It consists of over 900
firms engaged in smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and
drawing. The techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure diecasting are
also employed. Some non-ferrous metals, such as nickel, molybdenum,
tungsten and vanadium, are largely used in the making of high speed and
other special steels. New uses for non-ferrous metals with special properties
have emerged with the growth of new industries having particular requirements,
as, for example, production of nuclear energy (uranium, zirconium), jet
aircraft (niobium, magnesium, titanium) and electronic apparatus (selenium,
silicon, germanium, tantalum).
Mechanical engineering comprises a wide range of industries, including all
types of machinery, machine tools, engineers’ small tools, mechanical handling
equipment, construction equipment, industrial plant, watches and clocks,
and scientific instruments. Vehicle engines are included in the section on
vehicles (p. 310). The volume of production from these industries rose by
33 per cent between 1958 and 1964, in which latter year £1,891 million was
the aggregate value of the main products of all sections other than small arms,
scientific instruments and watches and clocks. Exports of non-electric
machinery were valued at £858 million in 1964. The number of employees
was about 1-34 million.
There are over 300 firms, employing 37,000 people, in the agricultural
machinery industry but three enterprises employing over a thousand workers
account for over half the net output of firms with more than 25 employees.

In 1964 output, excluding tractors, was valued at £62-2 million and exports
were worth £29-3 million; the main overseas markets were France, the Irish
Republic, Australia, the German Federal Republic, and Italy. The number of
self-propelled combine harvesters, forage harvesters, pick-up balers and
grain driers in use has increased in Britain in recent years and exports of dairy
machinery are expanding. Deliveries in 1964 included 5,300 combine harvesters
(the highest number since 1958), 5,100 milking machines, 15,300 pick-up
balers and 1,700 grain and grass driers.
The bulk of British tractor output and exports consists of agricultural tractors.
Some 207,000 agricultural and industrial wheeled tractors were delivered in
1964, about 164,000 (79 per cent) for export. Deliveries also included 36,000
small market garden tractors of less than 10 belt-horse-power. Exports of
agricultural and track-laying tractors had a value of £105-6 million in 1964.
Agricultural tractor production is dominated by five large organisations, two
of them producing about 80 per cent of output. Tractors are exhibited at the
annual Royal Smithfield Show and Agricultural Machinery Exhibition in
London.
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry, and by the
early 1830s had developed to an advanced stage the boring machine and
screw-cutting lathe, as well as other machine tools. The industry’s output
today ranges from watchmakers’ lathes weighing a few pounds to machines
weighing hundreds of tons, including transfer lines for motor vehicle manu¬
facture and electronically controlled machine tools giving accuracies of one
ten-thousandth part of an inch.
The value of deliveries of metal-working machine tools rose by 6 per cent
in 1964 to £121 million, compared with £114 million in 1963 and the peak
total of £127 million in 1962. Exports in 1964 had a value of £46-1 million;
and of the orders on hand at the end of December 1964 (£87 million),
34 per cent were for export. India (£6-2 million), Australia (£4-6 million)
and South Africa (£3-3 million) were the main overseas markets in 1964.
There are about 350 separate firms making machine tools (including
welding machinery), but over 40 per cent of net output is produced by 11
enterprises, each employing over 1,000 persons. The high degree of
specialisation makes it possible for the small firm to flourish. The industry is
centred mainly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire, and to a lesser
extent near London and Glasgow. About 88,000 persons are employed.
The Machine Tool Trades Association of Great Britain is the representative
body of most manufacturers and importers, and is responsible for the Inter¬
national Machine Tool Exhibitions held in Britain every four years, the next
being due in 1968. The industry is served by its own research body, the
Machine Tool Industry Research Association.
Britain manufactures a wide range of industrial engines other than those for
the vehicle construction industries (see p. 310). Deliveries of engines (including
parts) had a value of £109-5 milkon in 1964 and exports (including marine and
rail traction engines) were worth £24-5 million; in addition, parts exported
were valued at £19-4 million. The total brake horse-power of the 374,000
internal combustion engines delivered was 10-6 million.
There are about 70 firms for whom industrial engines are their chief product.
Production is concentrated among the large firms, and 10 of these, each
employing over 1,500 persons, account for about five-sixths of the net output
of larger firms. About 43,000 employees work in the industry.

One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries, the textile
machinery industry, developed rapidly after the introduction of mechanical
spinning and weaving towards the end of the eighteenth century. Its range of
output embraces all stages in textile manufacturing processes. Deliveries in
1964 were valued at £99-8 million and exports (including products of some
associated industries) at £67-i million. Principal markets were India (£4-9
million), Pakistan (^4-7 million), the United States (^4-5 million), the
Soviet Union and the German Federal Republic.
The industry, which has about 58,000 employees, comprises over 600 firms
situated mainly in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Dundee,
Leicester and Nottingham, making a wide range of machines and accessories
for the manufacture and processing of yarns and fabrics from all types of
natural and man-made fibres. In the case of bast and leaf fibre machinery the
United Kingdom is still by far the world’s largest supplier. Five enterprises,
each with over 2,000 employees, produce over half of the output.
Almost every industry makes use of mechanical handling equipment; the
products of the industry range from individual units and accessories to
complete operating systems. The value of deliveries in 1964 was ^110-3
million, the main constituents being: cranes and bridge transporters, lifts,
escalators, conveyors, elevators and hoists. In addition, British firms produced
12,400 powered industrial trucks, including 8,600 fork-lift trucks. Exports of
mechanical handling equipment (including industrial and works trucks) in
1964 were valued at £32-5 million. There are about 270 firms in the industry
but only 170 of these employ over 25 persons; in all, about 57,000 people are
employed.
Production of equipment extends to almost the whole range of plant required
by the construction industry, including crawler tractors, motor graders,
scrapers, trenchers, dozer equipment, dumpers, excavators and loading shovels
and crushing, pulverising and screening plant.
The value of deliveries from the industry was about £142-7 million in 1964;
by far the most important single item was earth-moving machinery with a
value of £95-1 million. Exports of excavating and earth-moving machinery
and road-rollers in 1964 totalled £51-2 million; France, Sweden, South Africa,
Spain and the German Federal Republic were important markets.
Contractors’ plant and quarrying machinery is manufactured by over 120
firms, and of the larger enterprises, 8 with over 1,000 employees account for
about half of net output. The labour force numbers about 29,000.
The office machinery industry has been expanding rapidly and is now second
in size only to that of the United States. In 1964 the value of deliveries of
office machinery (such as accounting machinery, punched-card machinery,
typewriters, dictating machines, and duplicating machinery) was £96 million.
Deliveries in 1964 included 105,000 standard typewriters and 155,000
portable typewriters. The value of deliveries of accounting and similar
machinery was £40-8 million, of which £21-6 million was for export, and of
other office machinery £43-5 million, of which £io-8 million was for export.
Exports of all office machinery were valued at £40-1 million and the most
important overseas purchasers were Australia, France, the United States and
the German Federal Republic. British subsidiaries or associates of United
States firms are prominent in the office machinery industry, in which there
are about 80 firms. About 59,000 persons are employed.

The manufacture of engineers’ small tools and gauges is an expanding
industry and is the main branch of production for over 1,100 firms, of which
4 have over 1,000 employees. Deliveries increased in value from £55-i million
I959 t0 a peak of jTSi million in 1964. The industry has a labour force of
about 62,000 persons.
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial plant and
steelwork, and about 147,000 are employed in this branch. Of particular
importance are steam-raising boilers, lime and cement kilns, gas and coke
oven plant, sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, chemical and
mineral oil refining plant, nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment
plant, and steelwork for bridges, buildings, etc. The industry is composed
of over 800 firms, including several large-scale enterprises. Almost 60 per
cent of the net output of larger firms comes from 29 firms with over 1,000
employees, and nearly one-third is accounted for by 7 firms with a labour
force of over 3,000. In 1964 the aggregate value of deliveries was ^357-3
million.
British companies delivered water tube boilers to the value of £63-1 million
in 1964; shell boilers and other boilerhouse plant accounted for a further
^32*6 million. Water tube boilers of advanced design and of large steam¬
raising capacity are produced for power stations, whereas shell boilers are
used for steam-raising and heating in factories and buildings. Exports of
vapour generating boilers in 1964 amounted to £13-9 million.
The modernisation and expansion of the British steel industry gave rise to the
rapid development of the steelworks plant industry, which now provides,
in association with firms producing rolling mills, almost all Britain’s require¬
ments as well as plant for export. The value of deliveries in 1964 was ^37-6
million; rolling mills and ancillary equipment accounted for an additional
5^23-8 million. Exports of steelworks and non-ferrous machinery and similar
equipment (including rolling mills) were worth j£i6-8 million in 1964.
This industry consists of a small number of firms, most of which are
business associates or members of a consortium. Besides supplying the plant
and equipment for steel and non-ferrous metal works, they undertake the
planning, erection and supply of complete plants in any part of the world.
Finland, India, Colombia and Australia are a few of the countries in which
British firms are undertaking large-scale steelworks plant projects.
The manufacture of specialised equipment for the chemical and oil refining
industries has expanded rapidly in the last 15 years. Deliveries of chemical
plant had a value of £53-7 million in 1964 compared with a peak of £63-8
million in 1961. Exports of mineral oil refining machinery came to fz million
in 1964. If the whole range of equipment manufactured by British firms for
the petroleum industry is aggregated, Britain ranks second to the United
States as a supplier. The range of chemical plant produced includes distillation
columns, heat exchangers, high vacuum drying equipment, and plant for the
manufacture of chemicals from all feedstocks including petroleum.
Three major groups of firms, consisting of leading firms in the heavy electrical
engineering, civil engineering, boiler, instrument, and associated industries,
build nuclear power stations for the United Kingdom electricity authorities,
and have built stations in Italy and Japan. The Atomic Energy Authority
grants them non-exclusive manufacturing licences and is working in close
collaboration with them in research and development.

In addition to the mechanical engineering firms described in preceding
sections, there are about 1,750 enterprises whose principal product is a type of
machinery not so far mentioned; about 900 of these firms have over 25 em¬
ployees and some 60 have more than 1,000. Four firms have a labour force
of over 4,000. The main products include: mining machinery, printing and
book-binding machinery, refrigeration appliances, space heating, ventilation
and air conditioning equipment, pumps and pumping machinery, industrial
valves and cocks, compressors, scales and weighing machinery, portable
power tools, food preparing machinery and many other types of equipment.
The total value of deliveries in 1964 was some £665 million. About 354,000
workers are employed in these industries.
This industry makes a wide range of equipment and appliances, extending
from refrigerators of varying sizes suitable for domestic and commercial use
to industrial refrigeration equipment for cold stores, manufacture of chemicals
and other products, ice-making plant and refrigeration plant for ships.
Important advances have recently been made in the development of acceler¬
ated freeze-drying equipment for the food industry and of refrigerated
transport vehicles. Production of commercial and industrial refrigeration
machinery was well established before the second world war, but the present
large production of domestic refrigerators has been built up since 1946.
Deliveries of refrigerating machinery in 1964 had a value of ^51-5 million.
The value of deliveries of space heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
equipment has been rising in recent years and in 1964 reached £66-5 million.
Exports of air conditioning and refrigerating equipment in 1964 had a value
of £7-7 million.
Industrial valves controlling the movement of liquids and gases are a vital
component in many industrial processes, particularly in the chemicals, oil
and electric power industries. The value of deliveries of pumps and valves
in 1964 was estimated at £112-9 million and that of air and gas compressors
and exhausters at £36-2 million. Exports of pumps and centrifuges were
valued at £45 million and exports of industrial valves at £15-4 million.
The value of deliveries of other major products in 1964 was: mining machinery,
£55’2 million; food and drink machinery, £47-7 million; packaging machinery,
£24-3 million; and other machinery, £270-7 million. Exports of food and
drink preparation and sterilising machinery were valued at £15-9 million.
The industry comprises about 1,300 enterprises engaged in the manufacture
of photographic, scientific, surgical and industrial instruments. It has a
labour force of 132,000 persons. A rapidly expanding sector is that making
industrial process measuring and control instruments—an essential element
of automation in industry—deliveries of which amounted to £64 million in
1964, compared to £41-3 million in i960. The value of deliveries of other
broad categories was: optical instruments £10-4 million; electric, electronic,
and nucleonic instruments £17-4 million; and nautical and aeronautical
instruments £21-7 million. The total deliveries for 1964 amounted to
£164-5 million.
Export deliveries of scientific instruments have been rising markedly,
amounting to £44-7 million in 1964, compared with £27-9 million in i960.
Britain was at one time the world’s leading producer of clocks and watches
but by the end of the nineteenth century production had virtually died out.
The present industry is largely a post-war development. It employs about

15,000 people, the great majority skilled craftsmen, and many of its factories
are located on new industrial estates in the older industrial areas, particularly
in Scotland. Sales in 1964 included clocks to a value of £7-4 million and
watches worth ^4-9 million; exports were valued at £4-3 million.
Behind the firms manufacturing the major products outlined in this section
are nearly 4,000 enterprises, employing about 229,000, whose main functions
are to supply parts and components, to conduct research and development
work, and to undertake general sub-contracting and repair work. (Some enter¬
prises are included because the mixed character of their work makes it
impossible to classify them under any single industry.) They include several
very large undertakings: 23 have over 1,000 employees each and 7 have over
5,000 employees. Ball and roller bearings, and chains, are particularly im¬
portant products; exports of the former were valued at £10 million in 1964,
and exports of chains at £6-7 million.
The electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufacture and
installation of a wide variety of electrical equipment, including all types of
generating, transmission and distribution equipment; motors; telecommunica¬
tions apparatus; domestic appliances; and specialised laboratory and electronic
equipment. Exports (other than record players, etc.) in 1964 were valued at
£315 million. Products are exported to all parts of the world; in 1964,
Australia (£22-2 million), South Africa (£21-2 million), India (£17-9 million),
the United States (£15-1 million) and New Zealand (£15-1 million) were
the main markets.
Altogether the industry employs a labour force of about 887,000. The
leading organisation of the industry is the British Electrical and Allied
Manufacturers’ Association.
Basic research on behalf of the industry is carried out by the Electrical
Research Association.
British scientists and engineers have been responsible for many of the basic
advances in the generation and transmission of electric power. The experi¬
ments of Michael Faraday pointed the way to the production of electricity
as a source of cheap and abundant power; Sir Charles Parsons produced and
patented the first turbo-dynamo, the forerunner of the giant turbo-generating
sets of today. The industry is providing the plant required for the large-
scale expansion programme of the electricity authorities in Britain and has
built all types of equipment for overseas countries.
In 1964 the output of electrical machinery was valued at £384 million,
comprising ^138-5 million worth of rotating electrical machinery (motors,
generators and rotary converters), ^64-5 million worth of transformers for
lighting, heating and power, £154-3 million worth of switchgear and control
gear and £26-7 million worth of other electrical machinery.
Exports of electrical machinery in 1964 had a value of £73-7 million;
Australia (£8-3 million) South Africa (£6-6 million) and India (£6-2 million)
were the main markets. Generators, motors, converters, transformers and
rectifiers accounted for £42-2 million and switchgear, starting and control
gear for £23-7 million.
About 670 firms manufacture electrical machinery, including 27 with over
1,000 employees and five with over 7,500. The total labour force numbers
224,000. Manufacture takes place in many areas; among the most important
are Manchester, Rugby, Tyneside, Stafford and Larne (Northern Ireland).

Production of electronic equipment is one of the most rapidly expanding of
British industries. United Kingdom scientists and inventors have made many
basic contributions to electronics—the thermionic valve, the development of
radar (a British firm has fitted over half the world’s radar-equipped ocean¬
going ships), the first public transmission television service, and the ‘printed
circuit’, which has led to far-reaching changes in methods of production in
the radio industry.
There are about 450 manufacturers of electronic equipment of all types,
including some 250 firms engaged in the production of valves, transistors
and specialised components and accessories. The industry employs about
297,000 people and its output in 1964 was valued at £395 million, an increase
of 14 per cent over the previous year. The value of recorded exports in 1964
was £89 million. Indirect exports of equipment incorporated in other products,
such as ships, aircraft and machinery, are also considerable.
The consumer goods sector of the industry is concerned with the manufacture
of radio, television sets and radiograms. More than nine-tenths of total output
comes from the six largest firms. Output of television sets in 1964, stimulated
by the opening in April 1964 of the second BBC transmitting channel, was
the highest since 1959 at 2-18 million sets, while the total value of sales was
£80 million, almost all of which was in the home market. Sales of radios,
together with radiograms, totalled 2-51 million in 1964 and were worth £27
million (including £1 million for export).
About four-fifths of the output of electronic capital equipment comes from
some 30 companies. The total value of deliveries in 1964 was £220 million.
The largest sectors of the industry, by value of deliveries, in 1964 were radar
and navigational aid equipment (of which nearly one-third of the 1964
deliveries of £65-4 million was for export) and electronic computers (£42-6
million). Other important sectors include radio communications equipment
G^S1 million in 1964), electronic measuring and testing equipment (£15
million), electronic control equipment (£14 million) and broadcasting equip¬
ment (£9 million).
There are about 70 firms whose main products are cables and wires for the
distribution of electric power, for telegraph and telephone networks and for
many other purposes; they include submarine cables and those insulated by
a great variety of materials. The value of deliveries in 1964 was £183-8 million
and exports of electric cables, wires, etc., were worth ^32-3 million.
The industry has a labour force of about 65,000 persons. Three firms with
over 5,000 employees account for about 60 per cent of net output of larger
firms.
Britain is the largest exporter of telegraph and telephone equipment. Shipment
overseas (including signalling apparatus and parts) had a value of £27-5
million in 1964. Research and development work is done by firms in the
industry in co-operation with the Post Office (see p. 391). The industry,
employing 76,000 persons, is organised for large-scale operations. Three
enterprises have over 10,000 employees and ten firms, each with over 1,000
employees, produce over 75 per cent of the output of the larger firms.
Deliveries of electrical goods in 1964 included: domestic electrical appliances,
£164-6 million; electrical equipment for motor vehicles, cycles and aircraft,
£85 million; batteries and accumulators, £53-5 million; electric lamps,
£30-2 million; and other electrical goods, £111-2 million. By number,

deliveries included: i-6 million electric blankets, i•'] million vacuum cleaners,
i-2 million domestic washing machines and 2-5 million electric irons. In
1964 exports of domestic electrical equipment were valued at £34-9 million,
including washing machines and parts (^12*1 million) and refrigerators
(£4.5 million); the main markets were France (£3-2 million), the German
Federal Republic (^2-7 million), Australia and the Irish Republic. The
industry has a labour force of 223,500.
The industries which manufacture vehicles and aircraft provide a significant
contribution to exports; exports of transport equipment in 1964 had a value of
£653 million, accounting for 15 per cent of total exports. The labour force
numbers 1 • 11 million and includes: 483,000 in motor vehicle manufacture,
268,000 in aircraft construction and repairing, 227,000 in shipbuilding and
marine engineering, 99*000 in the manufacture of locomotives and railway
wagons and carriages, 26,000 in cycle and motor cycle manufacturing, and
6,500 in the making of perambulators and hand trucks.
In both size and value the largest section of the vehicle industry comprises
the manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles. In the last few years
development schemes costing over £200 million have been completed and,
whereas the industry had previously been located mainly in the Midlands
and London areas, manufacturing and assembly plants are now in full
operation on Merseyside, in Wales and in Scotland.
Car and commercial vehicle output is dominated by the five largest firms
(British Motor Corporation, Ford, Rootes, Leyland Motor Corporation and
Vauxhall) who account for about 90 per cent of complete vehicle production;
the balance is in the hands of specialist producers of heavy commercial
vehicles, omnibuses, coaches, limousines and sports cars. The principal trade
association is the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT),
which holds a motor show annually in London and a Commercial Motor
Exhibition every two years.
Car output in 1964 at 1-87 million units was a record, well above the previous
peak of i-6 million in 1963. Exports in 1964, also a record, amounted to
672,000 cars with a value of ^255-6 million. The United States (^43 million)
was again the largest single purchaser; South Africa (£21-8 million), New
Zealand, Australia and Canada were the other largest markets.
Production of commercial vehicles, including chassis, increased from 146,000
in 1946 to the record total of 465,000 in 1964. Exports in 1964 of commercial
vehicles and chassis—168,000 units valued at £126-5 million—were the
highest ever recorded. Australia (^i5-8 million), South Africa (£i5'6 million),
Denmark, Belgium and New Zealand were the main markets for goods
vehicles. Since 1961 Britain has been the world’s largest exporter of com¬
mercial vehicles.
It has been estimated that in some cases up to 70 per cent of the final cost of
a car is represented by bought-out components. Exports of parts and access¬
ories for cars and commercial vehicles in 1964 had a value of 13-2 million,
engines and parts were valued at a further ^43-2 million. Caravan and trailer
exports were valued at ^7-3 million.
Deliveries of bicycles have declined steadily from the post-war peak of over
4 million in 1951, the total in 1964 amounting to only 1-7 million. Over
80 per cent of British manufacturing capacity is in the hands of a single group

of companies, and output is concentrated in the Nottingham area. Over
i million cycles worth £9-5 million were sent overseas in 1964; the United
States (£3 -4 million) was much the largest single market. Parts and accessories
exported amounted to a further ^4 million.
Deliveries of all types of motor cycle were 112,000 in 1964, slightly higher than
the 1963 total but well below the 1959 peak of 249,000. Output was increasingly
diversified during the 1950s, and the 1964 total of deliveries included 36,600
mopeds, 7,800 motor scooters and 12,100 three-wheeled vehicles. Manufacture
of motor cycles is dominated by two large groups. Exports were valued at
£5-9 million in 1964; parts and accessories came to an additional ^1-4 million.
Britain was the first country to build railways and British engineers pioneered
railway development in most parts of the world. The industry is equipped
to meet the conditions resulting from the replacement of steam locomotives
by other forms of traction on most of the world’s railways.
Deliveries in 1964 included 71 electric locomotives, of which all but six
were for export, 626 diesel and diesel-electric locomotives, 297 coaching
vehicles and 4,067 wagons. Deliveries of locomotives by private firms in
1964 were valued at ^13-1 million. The total value of exports of railway
vehicles in 1964 was ^18-4 million; South Africa (£3-1 million) and Kenya
(£2-6 million) were the largest purchasers.
There are over 50 establishments making locomotives and railway track
equipment in Britain. British Railways Board has its own workshops which
supply British Railways and certain other users in Britain; private firms build
locomotives, carriages and wagons for the British Railways Board, for industrial
users and for export.
Almost all the aircraft produced by the British industry today are based on
civil and military applications of the gas-turbine aero-engine, first developed
by Sir Frank Whittle. This form of propulsion was first used in scheduled
airline services by the turbo-jet Comet and the turbo-prop Viscount, the
latter one of the most successful post-war civil aircraft. Turbo-prop aircraft
in current production and operation include the Argosy, the Herald, and the
Hawker Siddeley J48. Two of a second generation of jet airliners, the medium-
haul Trident and the longer-haul Vickers VC 10, entered airline service in
1964, followed in 1965 by a third, the BAC One-Eleven, the world’s first
jet transport designed to operate economically on short-haul routes. Other
civil aircraft in production include the Skyvan light transport aircraft, the
HS 125 executive jet, and the Beagle range of light aircraft, using piston and
turbo-prop engines. The Concord, the world’s first supersonic airliner,
designed to fly at speeds of up to 1,450 miles per hour, is being developed
jointly by Britain and France.
The industry produces a wide range of military aircraft. It is also engaged
on work on rockets, earth satellites and other aero-space requirements,
including the Blue Streak satellite launcher. The industry employs about
268,000 people but this number is likely to decline as a result of reductions in
orders for military aircraft.
Exports of aircraft and parts in 1964 had a value of ^43-3 million. Leading
buyers (who vary considerably from year to year) included India (^4-4
million), the United States (^3-9 million), the German Federal Republic
(^3‘3 million), Canada, Iraq and South Africa. In addition, exports of
instruments were worth ^2-2 million, and tyres ^i-2 million. Aero exports
are expected to rise sharply in 1965.

As a result of a series of mergers in 1959 and i960, the construction of
aircraft is dominated by two large airframe manufacturers and one helicopter
concern, though there are a few important smaller companies outside these
groups. Main centres of the industry are the Home Counties (i.e. counties
around London), Coventry, Bristol and the west of England, Lancashire,
Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Besides extensive research work by the industry, research on a substantial
scale on problems of aircraft and their engines is carried out by the Ministry
of Aviation, chiefly at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National
Gas Turbine Establishment, both at Farnborough, and the Royal Aircraft
Establishment at Bedford. This work is done in collaboration with the
industry and results are made known to manufacturers. In addition, the
National Physical Laboratory undertakes research on aerodynamics.
Aero-engines provided some £615 million in export earnings from 1946 to
1964; in 1961 exports reached the record total of £83 million, including parts
worth ^26 million. In 1964 the figures were ^44 million and £22 million
respectively. Ten different British engines power nineteen types of aircraft
currently in production overseas. In 1965 nearly half of the world total of jet
and turbo-prop airliners on order or in service had British power plants.
Famous engines in production include the economical Dart and Tyne turbo¬
props, the Avon, Conway, Viper and Spey turbo-jets and the revolutionary
Pegasus lift-thrust engine for vertical take off and landing (VTOL) aircraft.
The power plant for the Concord will be a further development of the Olympus.
Two companies are responsible for almost all aero-engine production.
The shipbuilding industry is concentrated in four main areas: the river Clyde
in Scotland, the north-east coast of England, the north-west coast of England,
and Belfast in Northern Ireland. Ships are also built in the Southampton
area, in the Isle of Wight, and along the estuaries of the rivers Forth and
Tay, in Scotland, while numerous yards along the coast build fishing vessels,
yachts, harbour craft and barges. Repair yards and dry docks are situated in
all the large ports. The shipbuilding, ship repairing and marine engineering
industries give direct employment to nearly 150,000 workers.
Co-operative research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is under¬
taken by the British Ship Research Association with its headquarters in
London and a research station on the river Tyne. Pametrada, a commercial
organisation grouping turbine manufacturers, carries out design, development
and production liaison work.
Although tonnage launched has decreased from a peak of 1-5 million gross
tons in 1955, the 1964 total of 1-04 million tons was nearly 115,000 tons above
the 1963 level. In 1964 Britain launched (after Japan) the largest quantity
of shipping, accounting for 10 per cent of the world total, compared with
11 per cent in 1963. At the end of 1964 orders on hand of merchant vessels
of 100 gross tons and over were 306, totalling 2-5 million gross tons and valued
at ^316 million. Of these vessels, 60 were for export. Completions in 1964
numbered 193 (o-8 million tons), 39 of which were for export. The 1964 total
of completions included oil tankers amounting to 403,000 gross tons. The
oil tankers launched in 1964 included seven of over 30,000 gross tons, two
of which (both over 87,000 deadweight tons) were then the largest vessels
built in Britain, but the first 100,000 deadweight-ton tanker was launched in
1965 and even larger vessels are under construction.
Modernisation in British shipyards over the last few years has involved
INDUSTRY
313
the replanning of yards, the erection of large prefabrication shops for welding
massive sections under cover, the installation of heavy-lift travelling cranes,
and much other reconstruction.
Although there are many specialist ship-repairing establishments, most of
the largest shipbuilding firms also carry on repair work; about one-quarter
of ship-repairing activity is concentrated in the north-east coast of England
area.
Marine Engineering Most of the larger shipbuilding yards maintain their own engine building
works; often they manufacture several types of diesel engine under licence.
Steam turbines of the highest powers are available, many designed by
Pametrada.
MISCELLANEOUS The group of industries manufacturing metal products not described above
PRODUCTS consists of a large number of companies, with a total labour force of 575,000
in 1964; the main groups were tools and implements (23,000 persons),
cutlery (15,000), bolts, nuts and screws (46,000), wire and wire manufactures
(44,000), cans and metal boxes (38,000), jewellery, plate, and refining of
precious metals (27,000), and other metal industries (382,000). The total value
of exports in 1964 was about £144 million.
Cutlery and The production of cutlery and flatware is centred mainly in the city of
Flatware Sheffield and the industry’s reputation has been built up on the skill of its
craftsmen. Mass production methods are, however, now extensively used
except in the case of some of the highest quality wares. Firms remain mainly
small and of some 290 enterprises manufacturing cutlery over 225 still employ
fewer than 25 persons.
The value of sales of cutlery and flatware in 1964 was £15-2 million,
including export sales of £4 million.
This industry, located mainly in the Midlands, Lancashire, Yorkshire, South
Wales and London, produces a wide range of domestic utensils, such as
saucepans, buckets and dustbins, mainly from wrought steel and aluminium.
Increasing quantities of plastic hollow-ware are being produced, though
aluminium manufactures comprise the largest single group, both in the
value of total production and in exports. The value of sales (including some
industrial hollow-ware) in 1964 was £33-6 million, of which £4-1 million
were sales for export.
The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest British industries. Some
680 firms manufacture tools such as files, saws, hammers, axes and spades;
Sheffield, Birmingham and other Midland towns are the most important
centres.
The value of sales of implements and tools, other than machine tools and
portable power tools, was £37-9 million in 1964, of which £12-4 million worth
were exported, the totals included sales of hand tools, at home and for export,
valued at ^21-3 million and j£ii‘7 million respectively.
.Jewellery, Gold The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious
and silver Ware metals is an industry in which British craftsmen are heirs to a long tradition.
Some 625 of the 885 firms in the industry have fewer than 25 employees.
The law requires that gold and silver plate shall not be sold until it has been
hall-marked at one of the Assay Offices situated in London, Birmingham,
Sheffield and Edinburgh. The Birmingham office, located in the main centre

of the jewellery industry, probably hall-marks as much gold and silver as
the rest together.
The total value of sales of jewellery, goldsmiths’ and silversmiths’ wares
and electro-plated nickel silver wares in 1964 was ^23-5 million, of which
^3-2 million was for export.
CHEMICALS The chemicals industry, with a labour force of about 461,000, comprises the
manufacture of: chemicals and dyes (225,000 employees), pharmaceutical
and toilet preparations (74,000 employees), explosives and fireworks (26,000
employees), paint and printing ink (48,000 employees), oils, fats, soap and
detergents (43,000 employees), synthetic resins and plastics (31,000 em¬
ployees) and polishes and gelatine (14,000 employees). The industry is capital
intensive: the fixed capital expenditure of the industry, excluding mineral
oil refining, amounted to some £925 million during the six years 1958-63
and totalled £192 million in 1964. The value of exports in 1964 was ^412
million, or 9-7 per cent of total British exports. Production in the chemicals
and allied industries rose by 51 per cent between 1958 and 1964.
Organic and
Inorganic
Chemicals and
Dyestuffs
The inorganic chemicals industry dates back to the middle of the nineteenth
century, when sulphuric acid and alkali were in increasing demand for the
growing heavy industries. Over half of the output of this sector consists of
a limited number of relatively simple chemicals, such as sulphuric acid,
caustic soda, chlorine and ammonia, produced in very large quantities and
serving as basic materials for industry. Sulphuric acid has the largest
production of any chemical and over 3-1 million tons were produced in 1964.
The remaining output of this sector consists of a very wide range of chemicals
of varying complexity. Almost all inorganic chemicals are consumed in other
manufacturing processes. Substantial quantities of inorganic chemicals are
used in the production of plastics materials, while other major outlets include
man-made fibres, detergents, paint, glass and metals. Exports are important;
about one-quarter of output is estimated to be exported directly.
Production of organic chemicals (which include coal-tar chemicals) rose
by 120 per cent between 1958 and 1964. To an increasing extent petroleum is
the raw material used in the manufacture of organic chemicals although the
by-products of the carbonisation of coal, such as benzene, phenol and
naphthalene, are still important. It is estimated that in 1965 petroleum-based
chemicals accounted for 70 per cent of the total output of organic chemicals;
deliveries of feedstock for the petroleum chemical plants totalled 3 • 1 million
tons in 1964 compared with i-i million tons in 1959. The main outlets for
organic chemicals are plastics materials, solvents, synthetic rubber, man-made
fibres and detergents.
Consumption of dyestuffs is geared to demand by the textile industry;
38,700 tons of dyestuffs were produced in 1964.
Exports of chemical elements and compounds amounted to ^103-5 million
in 1964. Exports go to a large number of countries including, in 1964, the
Netherlands (^10-3 million), Australia (^6-4 million), the United States
(^6 million), France (£5-5 million) and Canada (£4-5 million).
Plastics The first plastic, Parkesine (later called Celluloid), was produced and
patented in Britain in 1865 by Alexander Parkes; other British discoveries
include polyethylene. Manufacture of plastics is one of the most rapidly
growing sections of the economy. Output of synthetic resins has doubled
since 1958 and total production in 1964 was 870,000 tons (an increase of

315
17 per cent over 1963), of which 581,000 tons consisted of thermoplastic
resins.
Expansion in recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of
which the most important are polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—
notably for foodstuffs), polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC and used for a
wide range of industrial purposes and consumer goods) and polystyrene
(a cheap non-inflammable material used for toys, light mouldings and many
consumer goods). One of the newer thermoplastic materials is polypropylene,
a versatile material for use mainly in electrical components, mouldings, and
domestic appliances. Rapid expansion of capacity for all the main types of
plastics materials is planned. Exports of plastics materials amounted to
330,000 tons in 1964, valued at nearly £75 million.
The first general purpose synthetic rubber to be manufactured on a com¬
mercial scale in the United Kingdom was marketed in 1958. Since then
capacity for production of this and other rubbers has increased rapidly.
High styrene rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use
where oil resistance is required, are in large-scale production, and neoprene
rubber is manufactured at Londonderry, in Northern Ireland. Production in
1964 amounted to 153,100 tons, by far the greater part of which came from the
styrene-butadiene plant at Hythe, near Southampton. Exports of synthetic
rubber were valued at £7-8 million in 1964, with France as the largest market.
The development of artificial fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
the British scientists, Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert. The research
now carried on at Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, and at the Macaulay Institute,
Aberdeen, is of world-wide importance. Two firms predominate in the
production of fertilisers and there are about one hundred firms marketing
compound fertilisers from the principal constituents—nitrogen, phosphorus
and potassium. To encourage use, sales on the home market are assisted by
government subsidies paid to the farmer (see p. 341). Output of nitrogenous
fertilisers (in terms of nitrogen content) in 1963-64 totalled 553,000 tons, and
421,000 tons (in terms of phosphate content) of phosphatic fertilisers were
produced; production of compound fertilisers is increasing and amounted to
2-9 million tons in 1964. The use of ammonium nitrate (35 per cent nitrogen),
ammonium phosphate, and, to a limited extent, urea (mostly 45 per cent
nitrogen) is resulting in more concentrated fertilisers.
The value of exports of manufactured fertilisers, almost all nitrogenous,
totalled £S'9 million in 1964.
Sales of paint and varnish during 1964 by manufacturers employing 25 or
more persons amounted to some 91 million gallons, 7 per cent more than in
1963. Exports of pigments, paints, varnishes and related materials in 1964
amounted to £31-4 million; about a quarter were in the form of ready-mixed
paints. The industry’s indirect contribution to exports in the form of surface
coatings for finished goods is also considerable.
In recent years the application of improved techniques has resulted in
rapid development, in particular the use of important new ranges of synthetic
resins and pigments; thixatropic, or jelly-like, paints and emulsions are
growing in popularity.
The value of the pharmaceutical industry’s annual output is estimated to have
risen by over a third since 1959 nearly ^247 million. The whole range of
3i6

drugs is produced in the United Kingdom, including sulphonamides, anti-
malarial drugs, anti-histamine products, anaesthetics, vaccines, sera, and
naturally occurring drugs. About ^8-5 million per annum is currently being
spent on research.
Notable British contributions to the development of new products include:
the discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming and its evaluation by Sir
Howard Florey and E. B. Chain; the evaluation of sulphapyridine (M & B 693)
by Sir Lionel Whitby; the introduction of the anti-malarial drug proguanil;
the discovery of griseofulvin; and, more recently, the isolation of the penicillin
nucleus. A promising development is the Medical Research Council’s
discovery of ‘interferon’ for the treatment of virus diseases. Several of
the larger pharmaceutical companies in Britain are subsidiaries of overseas
firms.
In 1964 exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products were valued
at j£59-2 million, of which ^10-7 million worth were antibiotics. The largest
purchasers were Australia (^3-7 million), Nigeria (^3-7 million), New Zealand,
the Irish Republic and France.
Notable discoveries by the British crop protection industry include the
insecticidal activity of BHC (benzene hexachloride), the first selective weed¬
killer, MCPA, and more recently Gramoxone, a non-residual general herbicide
based on paraquat. Sales of pesticides and allied products by larger manu¬
facturers were valued at ^19-4 million in 1964, 11 per cent higher than in
1963; herbicides (^9-3 million) were the largest single category. Exports of
insecticides, fungicides and weedkillers in 1964 totalled j£io-6 million.
Toilet
Preparations,
Soap and
Cleaning
Preparations
Sales of toilet preparations were valued at £79-6 million in 1964, including
export sales of j£io-i million. Petroleum is the source of the principal raw
material used in the manufacture of organic surface-active agents in detergents;
the other main constituent, polyphosphates, is derived from inorganic sources.
Sales of synthetic detergents amounted to 349,000 tons in 1964. Production
of soap was some 400,000 tons. Exports of essential oils, perfumery and toilet
preparations, soap and cleansing and polishing preparations were valued at
^36-6 million in 1964.
TEXTILES The textile industries in 1964 had a labour force of about 841,000 persons,
including employees engaged in the production of man-made fibres. Some
119,000 were in the spinning and doubling of cotton, flax and man-made
fibres, 109,000 in the weaving of cotton, linen and man-made fibres, 189,000
in the woollen and worsted trades, about 129,000 in hosiery and knitted goods,
76,000 in textile finishing and 41,000 in carpets. Over half the employees
are women. The total value of textile exports in 1964 was £275 million,
8 per cent higher than in 1963. Production of textiles rose by 16 per cent
between 1958 and 1964. Considerable re-organisation is taking place within
the textile industry, connected with the increasing use of man-made fibres.
This has given rise to several mergers and the formation of some large
vertically integrated groups. •
Cotton The invention of mechanical spinning and weaving in the second half of the
eighteenth century led to cotton becoming Britain’s chief consumer goods
industry and cotton piece-goods its largest export during the nineteenth
century. Increasing foreign competition and the tendency of many countries
to set up their own textile industry have cut progressively into British markets,
INDUSTRY

especially since 1952. Agreements have been negotiated with certain countries
to fix temporary ceilings on their exports to the United Kingdom.
Output in 1964 consisted of: 508 million lb. of single cotton yarn, 146 million
lb. of spun man-made fibre and mixture single yarn, 256 million lb. of
doubled yarn, 1,034 million linear yards of woven cotton cloth, and 610 million
linear yards of man-made fibres and mixture cloth. In 1964 exports of cotton
yarn and woven fabrics (excluding man-made fibres) amounted in value to
^44-1 million, including woven fabrics worth ^31 million. Australia, South
Africa, the Irish Republic and New Zealand were the most important markets.
Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the county
being mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning.
Manchester is the commercial centre. Liverpool is the chief port of entry
for raw cotton and the Liverpool Cotton Exchange is the main market for
raw cotton dealings.
Legislation to assist the reorganisation of the industry was introduced in
I959- Exchequer funds have paid for two-thirds of the cost of removing
surplus capacity, and also provided grants of about one-quarter towards the
cost of approved re-equipment and modernisation. The reorganisation schemes
are administered by the Cotton Board, a development council, i.e. a statutory
body with constitution and powers laid down under the authority of an Act
of Parliament.
Scientific and technical research for the industry is carried out by the
Cotton, Silk and Man-made Fibres Research Association.
The wool textile industry, the largest in the world, is the most ancient of
Britain’s staple industries and has been important since medieval times.There
are two main branches—woollen and worsted. While about 70 per cent of
woollens and 95 per cent of worsteds are made in the West Riding of
Yorkshire, Scotland and the West of England have retained their importance
as specialised producers of high quality woollen cloth. In recent years an
increasing amount of man-made fibres has been blended with wool.
In 1964 output included 265 million lb. of wool and hair tops and 326
million lb. of woollen yarn. Production of worsted yarn amounted to 233
million lb. and of woven fabrics to 325 million square yards. In addition,
large quantities of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain. Consumption
of raw wool in 1964 was 418 million lb., compared with 518 million lb. in 1959.
Exports of wool yarns and woven fabrics in 1964 were valued at £89 million.
Raw wool (cleaned or scoured in Britain) and other animal hair and tops
exported had a value of ^71 million. The United States, Canada, Japan and
the German Federal Republic were the chief buyers of fabrics. Research is
carried on mainly by the Wool Industries Research Association. The National
Wool Textile Export Corporation is responsible for assistance to exporters
and the development of new markets.
There are about 2,000 firms in the industry. The small or medium-sized
business predominates and there are only a few large firms. In recent years
on the worsted side there has been a tendency towards the formation of holding
companies controlling a number of subsidiaries which combine all the worsted
processes within one organisation. Firms on the woollen side are normally
organised to include the full process of manufacture from raw material to
finished article.
Man-made

of viscose rayon and acetate took place in Britain. Large quantities of chemicals
are consumed in their production, which is spread throughout the country;
Northern Ireland is of growing importance. Nine enterprises manufacture
man-made fibres in Britain; three of these, each with over 3,000 employees,
account for over 90 per cent of net output. There has been a rapid expansion of
output in recent years, the 1964 record total of 825 million lb. being about
15 per cent higher than in 1963. The total was made up of 447 million lb.
of staple fibre and 378 million lb. of filament yarn. Of the staple fibre, 113
million lb., and of the continuous filament, 166 million lb., were of fully
synthetic materials.
The output of a variety of fully synthetic fibres, derived predominantly
from mineral rather than vegetable sources, has been expanding over the last
decade at a rate previously unattained in a major chemical product. Production
of nylon, the first fully synthetic fibre, in the form of nylon 66, started in
Britain in 1941. Another type of nylon (nylon 6) has been manufactured since
1963 at Antrim, Northern Ireland; other new plants and extensions of
capacity for improved types of nylon are in hand and total productive capacity
is planned to reach about 390 million lb. a year by the end of 1967 compared
with about 160 million lb. in 1964. Nylon is used extensively in the manu¬
facture of clothing, fabrics and stockings, and has many industrial uses.
Terylene, a polyester fibre, was invented in the United Kingdom during
the second world war. It is resistant to fading and is particularly suited to
blending with wool. Annual manufacturing capacity is planned to reach
100 million lb. by the end of 1965. Firms in several overseas countries under¬
take its manufacture under licence, marketing it under a number of trade
names.
A group of fibres of growing importance are known as acrylic or poly¬
acrylonitrile fibres: Courtelle (a British discovery) and Acrilan are examples.
Polypropylene fibre was introduced in 1962. These fibres are soft and warm
and have particular applications in the wool textile industry. Synthetic
elastomerics or spandex fibres, which are man-made textile fibres having
inherent properties of stretch and recovery, are now produced commercially
by British manufacturers.
Polyethylene fibres, such as Courlene, have been developed for industrial
uses and polymethane fibres have recently come into use: protein fibres, such
as Fibrolane, are used for blending with other man-made fibres. British textile
manufacturers have developed a number of methods of blending man-made
with natural fibres and with each other in order to produce fabrics with new
combinations of texture, colour and finish, and with moisture-absorbent,
hard-wearing, drip-dry and crease-resisting properties.
Exports of man-made fibre yarns and woven fabrics had a value of £58-5
million in 1964. Sweden (^5-1 million), the Republic of South Africa
(j£4-8 million), Australia (£4-5 million), the Irish Republic and Switzerland
were the most important purchasers.
The hosiery and knitwear industry is predominantly one of small scale
enterprises. Over 60 per cent of the 1,100 firms in the industry employ fewer
than 50 workers, and only 4 enterprises have more than 2,000 employees. The
industry is widely distributed, with Scotland and the east Midlands as the
two most important centres. Sales of knitted goods were valued at £297-7
million in 1964 including £118-9 million worth of outerwear and £73 million
worth of socks and stockings. Exports of knitted clothing and accessories
were valued at £15-7 million in 1964; the largest buyers were the United

States, Switzerland, Canada and Sweden. Exports of knitted fabrics amounted
to ^4-6 million.
The Hosiery and Allied Trades Research Association, with laboratories at
Nottingham, undertakes collective research.
Linen has been made in Britain for more than a thousand years and it is
believed that the art of linen weaving was being practised during the seventh
century. Today the industry is concentrated in Northern Ireland (the greatest
linen manufacturing region in the world), with most of the remainder in
Scotland. Broadly speaking, the Northern Ireland industry concentrates on
yarns and the lighter types of fabrics, while in Scotland production is largely,
but not exclusively, of coarse linens and canvas. Northern Ireland manu¬
facturers produced 51-1 million linear yards of cloth in 1964. Deliveries of
cloth by weavers in Great Britain totalled 23-3 million square yards, including
14-6 million square yards of sailcloth and canvas. Exports in 1964 included
^8-8 million worth of linen fabrics and £3-9 million worth of flax yarns and
linen thread. Technical problems are investigated by the Research Institute
of the Linen Industry Research Association, formed in 1919.
Jute is manufactured on a large scale in Dundee—the centre of the world’s
oldest jute industry. About 40 per cent of jute yarn production is utilised in
the manufacture of carpets, cordage, ropes and other products. The balance
is woven into fabrics for a wide range of uses in the carpet, upholstery,
building and motor car industries, as well as its traditional use as a packaging
material. Production of jute cloth in 1964 came to about 77,000 tons. The
value of exports of jute fabrics in that year was £2-7 million. Research facilities
are concentrated at the laboratories of the British Jute Trade Research
Association. Over £14 million has been spent on a modernisation programme.
Sales of finished lace goods amounted to ^19-3 million in 1964. The most
important lace product is from the warp knitting machines, with sales valued
at j^io-i million. Deliveries of lace products for export were worth ^5 million
in 1964.
In addition to the products mentioned specifically in this section, British
textile firms manufacture a wide range of other goods, including many special
yarns and fabrics, net, household textiles such as blankets, tablecloths and
curtains, and floor coverings other than carpets. Sales of such floor coverings
were valued at ^39-1 million in 1964; just over one-fifth were for export.
In 1964 manufacturers’ total sales of all types of carpet and rugs amounted to
105-1 million square yards, valued at £146-6 million. Exports in 1964 had
a value of j£io-6 million; Australia (^2-7 million) was the largest single market.
There are about 130 enterprises engaged in the manufacture of carpets,
though only 71 have over 25 employees and 9 firms each employing over
1,000 persons account for 58 per cent of net output of larger firms. In addition
to the manufacture of woven carpets such as Axminster and Wilton, nearly
one-third of total sales by quantity in 1964 were of tufted carpets, a form of
carpeting in which the pile, usually containing a high proportion of artificial
fibres, is inserted into a pre-woven backing. Axminster-type carpets account
for nearly one-half of exports. There are about 41,000 employees, and the
principal manufacturing centres include Kidderminster (in Worcestershire),
Halifax and Dewsbury (in the West Riding of Yorkshire), Durham (in
north-east England), Glasgow and Kilmarnock (in Scotland) and several towns

in Northern Ireland. Under half the carpets produced by quantity are made
predominantly of wool and a growing proportion of traditional-type carpets
contain some man-made fibre.
There are about 632,000 employees in the clothing, leather and footwear
industries. Some 453,000 are in the clothing industry, 116,000 in the foot¬
wear trade and 64,000 in leather, leather goods and fur manufacture. The
aggregate value of their exports in 1964 was ^87-5 million.
The British clothing industry is the largest in Europe and total production
of made-up clothing has increased by 28 per cent since 1958. Exports in 1964,
including knitted goods, were valued at £43-8 million and, in addition,
substantial quantities are sent by parcel post.
Although there are some large firms employing mass production methods
on an increasing scale, the typical firm is small. Unofficial estimates suggest
that five-sixths of the concerns in the industry employ fewer than 100 workers.
The principal manufacturing centres are London, Leeds and Manchester,
but several firms are also situated on industrial trading estates.
Fashion is important in the production of haute couture models and through¬
out the ready-to-wear industry.
Leather tanning is one of Britain’s oldest industries. In 1964, 17,000 tons of
sole and other heavy leather and 466 million square feet of upper, lining and
other light leathers were produced. Britain is the world’s leading exporter
in terms of quantity, with exports in 1964 valued at £21 -2 million. The United
States is the largest single market (^4-1 million in 1964), followed by Canada
(£2 million), Italy and Sweden.
Tanneries are situated in most parts of Britain, but there are important
concentrations in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, the north Midlands and
the London area. Many different types of leather are produced, ranging
from the heavy types for industrial uses, such as machinery belting and car
upholstery, to high quality leather for footwear and for leather goods, and to
gloving and clothing leather.
Research into tanning processes and the improvement of the quality of
finished leather is undertaken by the British Leather Manufacturers’ Research
Association, the foremost association of this type in the world.
The British footwear industry is the third largest in the world. In 1964
manufacturers’ sales of footwear totalled 202 million pairs, the highest
volume recorded in any year. Exports of all types had a value of ^14-2 million;
the United States (£3 -4 million) and Canada were the largest markets.
Factories are located throughout Britain. Some areas concentrate on
production of particular types; for example, the Rossendale Valley region
of Lancashire on slippers, and Leicester and Norwich on v/omen’s and girls’
shoes. There are about 800 firms in the industry, producing footwear of all
types. The Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association enjoys a world-wide
reputation in all matters connected with shoemaking.
The food, drink and tobacco industries employ about 842,000 persons in the
production of a great variety of goods. The value of their combined exports
in 1964 was £274-2 million; a record. Exports of alcoholic and other beverages
accounted for £106-9 million; sugar, sugar preparations and honey for £43-5
million; cereal and cereal preparations for £19 million; and coffee (including
INDUSTRY

soluble), cocoa (including paste, powder and butter), tea and spices for
j£i5-8 million.
Bread and Flour The average weekly household consumption of bread per head of population
Confectionery in Great Britain, which has been falling, was about 2 lb. 10 oz. in 1964. In
and Biscuits England and Wales particularly, the small ‘family’ type of baker, producing
bread with some mechanical aids, is still found, but the trend towards
concentrating production in large mechanical bakeries has become more
pronounced; at least two-thirds of the bread is made in these bakeries, which
specialise in sliced and wrapped loaves; 4 groups have a dominant position.
In the smaller bakeries production of cake and other flour confectionery is
usually allied to bread production. There are about 2,000 firms and 158,000
employees in the bread and flour confectionery industry; a further 540 firms
and about 44,000 employees are employed in grain-milling.
There are over 100 manufacturers, with some 52,000 employees, producing
biscuits, and annual output has been well over half a million tons in recent
years. Weekly consumption of cakes and biscuits per head in Britain was
nearly 12j oz. in 1964. British biscuits have gained a world-wide reputation,
and despite the problem of import restrictions in several overseas markets,
exports in 1964 were valued at ^7 million.
Cocoa, The chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, which has some 96,000
Chocolate and employees, is composed of a small number of very large manufacturers and
. many hundreds of medium-sized and small manufacturers. Though there are
oniectionery some 66o firms in the industry, about half the output is produced by 8 firms
with over 2,000 employees.
The main ingredients used by the industry are sugar, cocoa beans, glucose,
milk, nuts and fats. Production of chocolate and sugar confectionery was
633>000 t°ns in 1964- Consumption of chocolate and sugar confectionery in
the United Kingdom is far higher than in any other country, being equivalent
to about 7-4 oz. per head per week.
The value of exports in 1964 of cocoa preparations (including chocolate)
was j£io-i million and of sugar confectionery, ^11-3 million. Canada and the
United States were the main markets for cocoa preparations.
Fruit and
Vegetable
Products
Fruit and vegetable products are manufactured in Britain by about 375
enterprises, including 11 with over 1,000 employees who account for 65 per
cent of net output. Among the products manufactured are jam, marmalade,
sauces and vinegar. The labour force numbers about 77,000.
The three largest manufacturers account for nearly half the total output
of jams and marmalade, which fell from 329,000 tons in 1949 to about 215,000
tons in 1956 and then remained static until it fell to 198,000 tons in 1964.
Strawberry, raspberry and blackcurrant jams are the most popular. Exports
of jams and marmalade in 1964 were valued at £1-8 million.
In 1964, 686,000 tons of canned vegetables were produced. The British
Navy was using canned foods in 1813, but rapid development in the industry
did not take place until after 1935. Processed peas (177,000 tons) and beans
in tomato sauce (259,000 tons) are the vegetables most in demand as canned
products. In addition, output in 1964 included 98,000 tons of canned and
bottled fruit, and 262,000 tons of canned soup. Rhubarb is the most important
single fruit used for canning, followed by strawberries and apples.
The quick freezing of foods has been expanding rapidly in Britain since
I954- Some 85,800 tons of vegetables and 1,000 tons of fruit were preserved

by this method in 1964; peas accounted for over three-fifths of all quick-frozen
vegetables.
Sales of dehydrated products, including accelerated freeze dried foods,
which retain their appearance, taste and smell indefinitely, are increasing
steadily.
There are some 980 enterprises, whose principal activities are: the curing
of bacon and ham, the canning and preserving of meat and fish, the manu¬
facture of sausages and pies or the preparation of extracts and pastes. The
labour force numbers 83,000. Output in 1964 included 80,000 tons of
canned meat and meat products and 219,000 tons of bacon and ham. There
has been a rapid expansion of frozen fish output, and some 63,000 tons were
produced in 1964; small quantities (6,700 tons in 1964) are also canned.
Exports of fish and fish preparations had a value of £8-2 million in 1964 and
those of meat and meat products were worth ^10-9 million.
The industries which manufacture beer, spirits, wines, cider and soft drinks
have a labour force of about 164,000. Exports were valued at £106-9 million
in 1964.
Exports of whisky (almost all of it Scotch whisky) reached the record level
of 32 million proof gallons with a value of £92-3 million in 1964; almost
exactly half went to the United States (£46-4 million or 18-1 million proof
gallons). Scotch whisky was first distilled in the fifteenth century. It is
blended from 20 or more different types, some from malted barley and some
from other grains. Whisky requires several years to mature, and the 108 million
proof gallons (a record) of Scotch whisky produced in the 1964 distilling
year will not be on sale for some years. Stocks of whisky amount to over
400 million proof gallons, of which one-third has been in stock for more
than three years. About three-quarters of annual sales are to overseas buyers.
Production of gin in Britain has risen steadily since the early 1950s. The
main distillers are in London and one company accounts for about half the
total output. Although the larger manufacturers also own distilleries abroad,
exports (4 million proof gallons) had a value of £7-1 million in 1964.
There are 300 enterprises in the brewing and malting industry, with a labour
force of about 99,000. In recent years there has been a strong tendency
towards the creation of larger brewery units, partly to secure wide distributive
outlets for the products of the large brewing groups, many of which market
beer throughout the country. Bottled beer consumption, after increasing
to nearly two-fifths of total consumption, has since dropped to about
one-third; draught beer, in which is included keg beer (about 7 or 8 per cent
of total output), accounts for the remainder, apart from a small output in
canned form. In 1964, 29-6 million bulk barrels of beer were produced, the
highest total since 1947, and consumers’ expenditure on beer amounted to
£760 million. Exports in 1964 of all types of beer were 381,000 bulk barrels,
worth £3-3 million. Firms are experimenting with new methods, including
continuous brewing processes.
The main raw materials used in brewing are malt, hops and some sugar.
Malt is made almost entirely from home-grown barley. Some brewers make all
or part of their own malt, others purchase it from independent maltsters who
also supply distillers, vinegar brewers, and malt extract manufacturers.
British malt is used by brewers throughout the world, and exports in 1964
amounted to 47,000 tons, worth £2-2 million.
INDUSTRY
323
Soft Drinks The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly since 1954, although
weather conditions can cause a marked drop in demand in some years.
Output in 1964 included 50 million gallons of concentrated liquid, 8 million
gallons more than in 1963, and 238 million gallons of unconcentrated drinks.
Though there has been some amalgamation in recent years, there are still
several hundred firms supplying regional markets. There are three very large
firms among the twenty producing widely advertised brands which are
marketed on a national scale. There is also some degree of specialisation by
firms in the production of various types, such as carbonated drinks, cola-based
drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters and ‘mixers’, and comminuted
drinks (in which the whole fruit is used).
Tobacco The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and other
tobacco goods sold in Britain. In 1964 consumers’ expenditure on these
goods amounted to £1,344 million (of which about 70 per cent was tax revenue)
and, in addition, exports worth £16-9 million (87 per cent of which were
cigarettes) were shipped to a large number of overseas markets, of which
Malaysia and Aden were the most important. The main centres of production
are in and around Bristol, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle,
Nottingham, Glasgow and Belfast. The two biggest manufacturing groups
account for a large proportion of total output. The industry has about
48,000 employees.
The tobacco industry used 308 million lb. of unmanufactured tobacco
in 1964 (17 per cent less than in 1963), all of which was imported. The main
sources are the United States, Rhodesia, Canada and India. Total consump¬
tion of tobacco in Britain in 1964 amounted to 267-8 million lb., including
230-8 million lb. consumed in cigarettes, 32-5 million lb. in pipe tobacco and
2-7 million lb. in cigars. In 1964, ii4>40° million cigarettes were consumed,
800 million fewer than in the previous year; 42 per cent of the total were
tipped compared with 16 per cent in i960.
POTTERY GLASS ThiS Sr0UP comPrises the manufacture of bricks, fireclay, refractory goods,
AND CEMENT pottery, glass, cement, abrasives, asbestos and other building materials. The
industries have a combined labour force of 359,000, which includes 76,000
in the bricks, fireclay and refractory goods trades, 79,000 in the glass industry
and 67,000 in the pottery industry.
Brickmaking About 700 firms manufacture items such as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
and Refractory pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products including furnace and kiln
l,00ds linings. Brickmaking, one of Britain’s oldest industries, was introduced by
the Romans, and manufacturing methods vary from traditional hand fabri¬
cation to highly mechanised systems. In 1964 about 7,960 million building
bricks were produced in Great Britain (the highest number ever) 40 per cent
of which were of the Fletton type, made mainly in the Bedford and
Peterborough areas. Capacity is being expanded and it is hoped to produce
8,400 million bricks in 1965. Refractory goods (firebricks, silica bricks,
magnesite bricks and chrome-magnesite bricks) are manufactured mainly for
home use. Exports of refractory construction materials in 1964 were worth
£4-9 million.
Pottery
The pottery industry is a long-established and complex industry, largely
located in the Stoke-on-Trent area of Staffordshire. Much of its raw material
is indigenous, such as china clay, ball clay and china stone from Devon

AND PUBLISHING
and Cornwall. It supplies nearly all home needs for domestic and industrial
pottery and its exports have recently been at an annual rate of about £20
million. Canada and the United States are important markets.
The largest section of the industry, about half, makes domestic pottery,
sub-divided into china, earthenware, stoneware, jet and Rockingham; the
other main divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical ware, but
other specialised industrial products such as acid-proof stoneware, porous
ceramics and laboratory porcelain are also manufactured. Among famous
makes of British pottery are Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal
Doulton, Minton, Coalport and Royal Crown Derby. Total sales of domestic
pottery were valued at ^38-6 million in 1964, including export sales of
^15-2 million.
The 350 firms in the industry employ about 67,000 people, of whom some
40,000 are women. There has been considerable re-equipment; gas or
electrically fired kilns have replaced almost all the coal-fired kilns and new
decorating techniques and automatic and semi-automatic machinery have
been introduced.
Britain’s glass industry is the third largest in the world. The section of the
industry devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in their various
forms is organised for quantity production, much of it in the form of the
‘float’ glass process, which was developed in Britain. Its use for internal
decoration and as a finish for internal and external walls has greatly increased
in recent years. Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor
industry. Other products include glass bricks, tubular glass (produced on a
large scale), mirrors, lamp and bulb glass, scientific and medical glassware,
glass fibres, and all types of glass container (often made by fully automatic
machinery). A traditional product is hand-made lead crystal glassware of very
high quality, much of which is exported.
Direct exports of glass and glassware reached the record value of £2$-2
million in 1964. Those of glass were worth £16 million, the most important
markets being Australia, South Africa, the United States and Canada. The
figures included ^4-2 million of float glass.
Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research
Association, and much research work is also carried on by the Department
of Glass Technology at Sheffield University.
The cement industry of the United Kingdom is chiefly concerned with the
manufacture of Portland cement. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented
in 1824, ^is material and the methods of its production have been the subject
of continuous technical improvement and intensive research. The capacity
of the industry, which has some 18,000 employees, has increased substantially
since the war to meet the growing demands of the building industry and
further expansion is planned. About one-third of production comes from
plants situated in the Dartford-Gravesend district of Kent. Annual output,
which reached 7-7 million tons in 1938, had risen to the record level of
16-7 million tons in 1964. One group of companies is responsible for about
two-thirds of total output. In 1964 direct exports of cement, which have been
tending to fall, were worth £2-7 million.
The paper, printing and publishing industries have a labour force of over
632,000 including 97,000 in the manufacture of paper and board, 70,000 in
the production of cardboard boxes and packing cases, 141,000 in the publishing
INDUSTRY
325
of newspapers and periodicals and 253,000 in other types of printing and
publishing.
The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until
1678, but records show that some paper was produced as far back as the year
1492. The British paper and board industry is the largest of its kind in Europe.
Total production in 1964 of all types of paper and board amounted to 4-4
million tons, the highest ever. Of this, newsprint accounted for 750,000 tons,
board for 1-3 million tons and other paper for the remainder. Exports of
paper, board and manufactured paper items were valued at £48-3 million
in 1964. A substantial proportion of the export trade is to sterling area
countries, mainly Australia, the Irish Republic and South Africa.
Wood pulp, almost all of which is imported, is the main raw material, but
large and increasing quantities of waste paper are also used.
The industry comprises over 200 enterprises engaged in the manufacture
of paper and board. There are a few very large groups and a large number
of medium-sized and small firms. The large groups hold considerable interests
abroad, including pulp and paper producing mills in the United States,
Canada and other parts of the Commonwealth and Europe. In addition, there
are nearly 500 enterprises which make cardboard boxes, cartons and packing
cases and some 600 firms which manufacture miscellaneous items such as
wallpaper and paper bags.
Printing and The printing industry produces an immense range of goods from national
Publishing newspapers and periodicals to books, catalogues and greetings cards. The
industry includes many very small enterprises. Mergers in recent years have
led to the formation of large groups in the newspaper, magazine and book
publishing sections. Of the 630 enterprises in the printing and publishing of
newspapers and periodicals, about half have over 25 employees and 22 of
these over 1,000 employees; 4 large firms employ more than 7,500 persons.
General printing, publishing, engraving and bookbinding remains essentially
an industry of small firms with over 75 per cent of the 6,500 firms having
fewer than 25 employees.
Publishers’ turnover in 1964 amounted to £98-5 million, of which export
sales accounted for £43-2 million. Consumers’ expenditure on books, news¬
papers and magazines totalled £281 million in 1963. Popularity of paper-backed
books has increased rapidly in recent years and they account for about a
third of total sales in Britain. According to the overseas trade returns, exports
of printed matter, manuscripts and typescripts were valued at £46-5 million
in 1964, including books (^22-8 million), and newspapers and periodicals
(£8-4 million), but these figures do not include parcel post shipments which
are considerable, possibly as large again as the recorded totals. The Book
Development Council was formed in 1965 to promote the supply and use of
British books overseas. The United States and Australia are the most
important overseas markets. A shortage of skilled workers has led firms to
introduce the latest developments in high-speed printing equipment, including
electronic engraving machines and advanced processes of photographic
reproduction, and to experiments with typesetting by computer.
Other manufacturing industries include the timber and furniture group, with
about 296,000 employees, rubber manufacture, with 131,000 employees, and
a group of miscellaneous manufactures which together embrace some 195,000
employees.

Britain’s rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the world, dating
from 1819. Hancock, who developed the vulcanisation process in Britain,
afterwards collaborated with Macintosh, the inventor of waterproof garments,
and Dunlop in 1888 devised the pneumatic tyre. Tyres and tubes represent
more than half the total output of the industry. British firms also make a great
variety of other rubber manufactures, the most important being rubber
footwear, conveyor belting, cables, hose, and latex foam products.
The British industry is one of the largest in the world. There are 470 firms
located throughout the country, and the industry has a labour force of 131,000.
In 1964 its consumption of rubber totalled 377,000 tons, including 180,000
tons of natural rubber, 161,000 tons of synthetic rubber and 37,000 tons of
reclaimed rubber; the proportion of synthetic rubber used is increasing. There
are 14 tyre manufacturers, including several subsidiaries of United States
and other overseas companies. In 1964, 195,000 tons of rubber were used in
the production of tyres and tyre products. Tyres and tubes exported were
valued at ^25-8 million; this figure excludes large indirect exports on vehicles.
Direct exports of all rubber manufactures in 1964 were worth £48-5 million,
with Australia, Sweden and Denmark as the main markets.
London is the largest centre for furniture manufacturing, but High Wycombe,
in Buckinghamshire, is an important centre for domestic furniture.
Deliveries of domestic furniture had a value of ^145 million in 1964
and exports of furniture £12-6 million. There are some 2,400 enterprises
engaged in the manufacture of furniture in Britain (including domestic,
upholstered, office, school and other furniture) with a total labour force
of about 103,000. Many firms are small and of the 600 larger enterprises,
8 with over 1,000 employees account for 25 per cent of net output. In recent
years there has been a tendency towards increased concentration.
A Furniture Development Council was established in 1949; it undertakes
research, training and study in technical and artistic subjects and design,
provides a technical information service and publishes statistics.
There are over 500 enterprises manufacturing toys and sports equipment in
Britain, though three large firms with over 1,500 employees account for
nearly a third of net output. The total number of persons employed is about
35,000. Deliveries of toys in 1964 were worth £42-8 million and exports had a
value of j^n-S million. Australia, the United States, the German Federal
Republic and Canada were the main overseas markets. The industry estimates
that current annual expenditure in Britain on toys amounts to about £7 or £8
per child; current trends are towards increased production of small-scale
precision models of vehicles and equipment and greater use of plastics
materials; interest in construction kits is also growing.
The value of manufacturers’ sales of games was £3-8 million and
that of sports equipment ^14-4 million, of which ^4-5 million was for export.

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and
most important industries. It occupies about 825,000 people in Great Britain
or just under 3^ per cent of those in civil employment, provides about 3^ per
cent of the gross national product, and uses 49 million of the 60 million acres
of land.
In Northern Ireland 2-8 million of the 3-4 million acres of land are in
agricultural use, and the corresponding proportion for employment and
gross output are 14 per cent and 17 per cent.
nrsEUSESD AND Land USed f°r farming is conventionally divided into improved land suitable
for cultivation (crops and grass) and rough grazing, nearly all of which is
hill or mountain land with a native herbage of coarse grasses, rushes, bracken,
heather or scrub trees. Rough grazing has a low potential output—usually
assessed at about one-sixth of that of agricultural land—but is valuable for
sheep. In England and Wales only about one-sixth of the 29-2 million acres
of farming land is classified as rough grazing. In Northern Ireland the propor¬
tion is about one-quarter of a total of 2-8 million acres but in Scotland it is
about three-quarters (12-4 million out of 167 million acres). In the United
Kingdom as a whole there are 307 million acres under crops and grass.
Improved land and rough grazing together represent 82 per cent of the land
area. The rest is mountain and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses.
The area available for farming is gradually decreasing to meet the needs of
housing and industry; however, the loss is more than outweighed by the
increase in output from what remains.
The soils of the country are extremely varied. Many of those in the west
and north, overlying hard rocks, are poor and thin. The lowlands and river
valleys are usually fertile, varying in texture from clay to sandy loam, silt
and peat. Clay soils everywhere necessitate under-drainage, and as all are
constantly leached by rainwater, lime has to be applied at regular intervals.
In hill country the area of improved land is often small, but is usually supple¬
mented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
For many centuries the bulk of land in Britain lay in estates ranging in size
from a few hundred acres upwards, comprising farms of varying sizes let to
tenants. At all times the tenanted holdings were interspersed with some owned
by the farmers who occupied them, and with some peasant or cottage holdings.
Social changes of the past half-century have completely changed the pattern
of rural life in England and Scotland. Estate duties have been a principal
factor in the breaking up of estates. Most surviving estates are still owned by
private individuals or family trusts, but the Crown, the Church Commissioners,
local authorities, the National Coal Board, and other corporate bodies hold
considerable areas. Of the farms sold, many have been bought by the tenants

already in occupation. About half the farms in Great Britain today are
owner-occupied.
Although the average size of all agricultural holdings is about 70 acres of
crops and grass, many of them are smallholdings which do not provide a
full livelihood for their occupiers. It is estimated that the bulk of Britain’s
home-produced food supply comes from about one-quarter of the holdings.
In England and Wales, for instance, about half the 330,000 holdings are
part-time holdings, the occupiers generally having another source of
livelihood in addition to farming. Taking full-time holdings only, the average
size of holding in England and Wales is about 130 acres of crops and grass.
In Scotland the crops and grass area of the 31,000 farms worked on a part or
spare-time basis averages only 11 acres, but for the 27,000 full-time farms the
average is 144 acres.
Scotland has two distinct farming zones: most of the good land lies in the
east and south of the country, while in the Highlands and Western Islands
agriculture is quite distinct from that of the rest of Britain, there being an
exceptionally high proportion of rough grazing to improved land. Numerous
small occupiers are grouped in scattered villages, each with a tiny area of
enclosed land and rights of grazing on an adjoining hill. The Highlands are
thus divided between a few large holdings and a great many very small crofts.
In Northern Ireland there are only a few large estates. Almost all the land
is divided into about 68,000 holdings varying from a few acres to 300-400
acres. Most of these holdings are occupied by the owner. Some 20,000 are
either re-let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops or grazing) or owned by
people who do practically no farming. Of the remaining 48,000 farms, with
an average size of 40 acres of crops and grass, about half can be said to provide
a full-time occupation for the owner.
Most British farms produce a variety of products; the pattern varies from
farm to farm. In many districts the mosaic of farms is dominated by one type
and the bias towards one product or group of products is so marked that the
whole area takes on a distinctive character. In England the farms devoted
primarily to arable crops for sale are in the eastern part of the country, in
East Anglia, Kent, Lincolnshire, and the East Riding of Yorkshire. Potato
and vegetable growing on a substantial scale marks the farming of the Fens
(south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire), the alluvial areas around the
rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in south Lancashire. Else¬
where, horticultural crops are widely dispersed amongst agricultural crops.
In Scotland the rich lowlands of the east coast, the Lothians and a fringe of
land around the Moray Firth are also primarily arable.
Interspersed between these arable areas, and also in the Midlands and the
south-east of England, there are large tracts where, although much of the
land is kept under the plough, the rearing and fattening of cattle is an im¬
portant enterprise. In the south-west of Scotland dairying is extensively
practised, but most of the north-west is devoted to rearing sheep on rough
hill land. The parts of England bordering the Pennine hills and most of
Wales are also sheep-rearing areas, though a good deal of dairying, based on
purchased feedingstuffs, is also done there. Dairy farming is widely practised
throughout much of the rest of Britain. In Northern Ireland mixed farming
is practised, the most important products being milk, fat and store cattle,
pigs and eggs, with sheep and stock raising in the hill areas. Oats and barley
are widely grown, mainly for livestock feeding, and the only important cash
crop is potatoes, both ware and seed.

Traditionally, in England and Wales old grass is regarded as the property of
the landlord; many leases still specify the fields which may not be ploughed,
except under penalty. But the tenant is free to sow other fields to grass if he
wishes and to plough them out whenever he wishes; so two types of grass
came into existence—old or permanent grass, the property of the owner, and
temporary grass or ley, a rotational crop of the tenant, its lease of life de¬
pending on the system of farming. The ley farming system had its origin
in the use of grass in the cereal rotation to restore soil fertility and structure.
In Scotland, which has never had the same tradition, the tenant is free to
plough as he chooses, although in practice very high-lying fields are ploughed
with the main object of renewal of the grass. The area under temporary
grass has always been high.
The situation during the 1939-45 war called for a widespread ploughing
out of grass. Since the end of the war, in all parts of the United Kingdom
there has been a slow return to permanent grass; but not all of the gain in
tillage has been lost and there has been an increase of nearly 3 million acres in
the area of temporary grass, so that the total arable area remains about
5 million acres more than it was pre-war. On the table land of England and
Wales the old-style rotations have been abandoned, and a cropping system
has been adopted which allows a high proportion of cereals, sugar beet and
potatoes, with short or medium term leys. The western counties show a heavy
bias towards cereal crops with longer leys, and over the country as a whole
there has been a tendency for leys to lengthen with improved management
of grass. In Northern Ireland, while the greater proportion of the grassland
is under permanent grass, medium length leys are a common feature. Scotland,
with its choice of crops restricted by soil and climate, has returned to its
pre-war pattern of rotational cropping, in which leys occupy more than half
the arable ground. Thus, in England and Wales nearly one-half of the 24
million acres of arable and grassland is under permanent grass, about one-
quarter under cereals and one-sixth under temporary grass; of the 4-3 million
acres in Scotland, only one-fifth is in grass seven years old or over, against
more than two-fifths in grass under seven years old; while in Northern Ireland
over a half is permanent grass and about one-quarter temporary grass.
Farmers everywhere are exposed to the vagaries of the weather, of pests and
diseases, and of the market; but over the past 30 years much has been done
in Britain to mitigate these risks. In part this has been effected through the
advance of science, in part through self-help by farmers’ organisations,
but probably in greatest measure by government action. The role of the
Government, successively as financial supporter, as wartime controller, and
as guarantor and provider of technical and advisory services, is described on
P- 337-
Between the two world wars British agriculture suffered a long depression
which reached its lowest point about 1930. Yet already the industry was
becoming organised: separate National Farmers’ Unions had been set up in
England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to give farmers a collective
voice; breed societies had been established to watch over the interests of
stock breeders; young farmers’ clubs were becoming numerous; a chain
of research stations had been constituted; and a comprehensive system of
university, college and farm institute education was in being.
During the second world war 7 million acres of the permanent grass were
ploughed, the area under potatoes and barley was doubled, and that under
wheat increased by about 30 per cent. The total number of cattle increased

slightly, chiefly owing to larger dairy herds; sheep and poultry stocks
declined; and the number of pigs fell by more than half.
The steady expansion in productivity which has taken place over the last 25
years is summarised in Table 19. Cattle and sheep stocks increased between
1953 and 1961, but numbers are now tending to remain stable. The number
of pigs and poultry has shown a sharp increase. Output of wheat has shown
only small variations, although the trend has been upward; but that of barley
doubled between 1947 and i960 and has since almost doubled again to 7-4
million tons. There has been a marked fall in the acreage under oats while
a smaller but significant drop in that under potatoes appears to have become
stabilised. Between 1954 and 1964, output of pigmeat and eggs increased by
49 and 51 per cent respectively; this, together with the increase in the sales
of milk off farms, is in part attributable to the increased import of feedingstuffs
in recent years. It is estimated that about 5^ million tons of concentrates
were imported in 1964-65, about double the imports of twelve years earlier,
and a further i-8 million tons were available as by-products of imported
grain and oil-seeds.
The index of agricultural output at constant prices has risen steadily. By
I953-54 ^ was about 56 per cent above the immediate pre-war average.
Using the average of 1954-55 to 1956-57=100 as basis, it reached 112 in
1959-60, 125 in 1962-63 and 127 in 1963-64; 137 is forecast for 1964-65.
Since 1939 the population of the United Kingdom has increased by 6 million,
or about one-eighth. In spite of this growth Britain now produces about half
of its total food requirements or two-thirds of all that can be grown in temper¬
ate climates; this latter figure comparing with about one-half before the
second world war. The percentages by weight of total supplies of the
principal foods provided by home production in relation to the pre-war
average are shown in Table 18.

that of high-protein foods, such as meat and eggs, has increased with greater
availability and rising living standards.
The possibilities of wheat growing, which is mainly confined to England,
have been changed out of all recognition by the advent of new strong strawed
and heavy yielding varieties, mainly from the continent of Europe but some
home-bred. These permit the liberal use of fertilisers, and spring dressings
of nitrogen have become accepted practice. Crop yields of 2 tons per acre
are no longer unusual. Over 3-6 million tons were harvested in 1964, with
yields averaging 33 cwt. per acre.
There are two distinct markets for barley—for malting and for feeding to
stock. Malting barley has in the past commanded a much higher price than
feeding grain, but the disparity has now decreased. New varieties have
greatly enlarged yields. Since i960 the acreage under barley increased by
nearly 50 per cent and production has almost doubled.
The total area under oats has halved since 1958; even in Scotland oats
are now less widely grown than barley.
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also widely
used on a co-operative basis.
In England the turnip crop is giving way to kale and cabbage. The total
acreage of fodder crops (except kale) has, however, been declining steadily
because in many cases farmers can provide winter feed more economically
by increased grass production and improved methods of conservation. In
Scotland the decline in turnips and swedes has been less rapid and the
acreage under these crops is now greater than in England. The area under
mangolds (grown almost entirely in England) has been falling sharply—by

nearly 50 per cent since 1958—while fodder beet is grown on only a small
scale. Rape retains a modest place as sheep fodder.
Beet is grown mainly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire where most of the beet
sugar factories are situated. The crop is grown under contract to the British
Sugar Corporation, which takes the entire output at guaranteed prices and
also provides technical advice and assistance. Precision drilling is the usual
method of sowing and more than three-quarters of the crop is mechanically
harvested.
Early potatoes are grown in England and Wales in numerous, widely scattered
districts with favourable soils and climate. The crop is marketed during the
summer months and reaches the consumer within a few days of lifting. Main
crop varieties, which are normally stored before sale, are grown chiefly in the
Fen counties, Essex, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. In Scotland early potatoes
are grown in coastal areas of Ayrshire and Wigtownshire, main crop
potatoes being grown mostly on the eastern side of the country; a substantial
part of the industry is concerned with supplying seed potatoes to English
and foreign growers. In Northern Ireland both main crop and seed potatoes
are produced, and a large part of the crop is shipped to Great Britain and
abroad. In recent years the area planted with potatoes in the United Kingdom
has been about 775,000 acres, and the average yield has varied between
8^ and 9 tons per acre. Although cultivation and harvesting is largely done
mechanically, a good deal of hand labour is still necessary for planting
and grading.
Dairy Farming Milk is much more valuable when sold on the liquid milk market than when
converted into cheese, butter or other milk products. In Great Britain milk
is produced primarily for liquid consumption, but in Northern Ireland the
greater part of the milk is used for manufactured products. Production and
liquid sales are now much greater than before the war. Sales promotion by
the industry is helping to maintain these higher liquid sales. The average
consumption per head is now about 5 pints per week.
Average yields per dairy cow are still rising steadily; in England and Wales
they have increased during the last decade by about 15 per cent and now
average almost 800 gallons a year. Freedom from tuberculosis has reduced
herd wastage, and through the artificial insemination (AI) centres, operated
by the Milk Marketing Boards and other organisations, the influence of a
small number of high-potential bulls is widely disseminated. It is estimated
that about two-thirds of Britain’s total cattle are bred by AI. The Friesian
breed now dominates both AI centres and farms on which bulls are main¬
tained in England and Wales; the Ayrshire breed is by far the most in demand
in Scotland; and in Northern Ireland the Dairy Shorthorn still predomin¬
ates although Friesians are on the increase. Milk production has also been
stimulated by advances in grassland management, intensive grazing tech¬
niques and new methods of making high quality hay; new methods of
conversion into silage are being exploited. Most dairy farmers practise
some degree of intensive grass management, but hay of the traditional type
remains the basic winter feedingstuff; it is supplemented with purchased
concentrates.
Clean dairy farming methods and hygienic standards for equipment and
buildings used in milk production are enforced by regulations. The Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s Milk Service has a general responsibility
for enforcing the regulations and for advising farmers in England and Wales
334
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on clean milk production. In Scotland these functions are performed by local
authorities but central supervision is exercised by the Scottish Home and
Health Department. In Northern Ireland all farmers producing milk for sale
must hold a Ministry of Agriculture licence.
Livestock A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. It has been found that they meet the needs of breeders
in most countries and substantial export sales are made to buyers seeking
to replenish and improve their herds with British animals.
Beef Cattle Although home production of beef is considerably greater than it was before
the war, imports are lower and consumption per head has not yet overtaken
the pre-war level. Taste is changing and the majority of buyers no longer
want joints from fully fattened beasts. The average age of slaughter is below
two years and systems of semi-intensive or intensive beef production, such as
that involving large daily quantities of cereals and correspondingly little
roughage, are being increasingly adopted. In the hill regions hardy herds of
beef cattle are kept, especially of the Galloway breed and its crosses; in
marginal land and lower areas the sires used are predominantly of the
Aberdeen Angus, Beef Shorthorn and Hereford breeds. Such beef stock are
kept on ‘natural’ lines, the cows calving in early spring and grazing with their
calves through the summer. Usually the calves are sold at weaning to farmers
with arable fodder and good grazing for fattening. Nowadays much beef
derives from the dairy herds, some females being mated to beef sires, the
majority by AI. The cross-bred calves make useful beef animals; so too do
the pure-bred male calves from Friesian, Shorthorn and some other types of
herds. There is a large and complex trade in store cattle (increased by animals
imported from the Irish Republic) whose general movement is from the
upland west to grazing areas in the Midlands and arable areas in the
east.
Sheep Britain has outstandingly good pastures for sheep. Moreover, veterinary
researches have provided vaccine and sera protection against nearly all the
epidemic diseases to which sheep are subject. More than thirty breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in Britain, each breed having originated
within a circumscribed area. The basic stocks are everywhere maintained by
local selection.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, winter conditions are usually
severe. Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas every autumn
to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages: firstly, to farms at inter¬
mediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a larger and more
rapidly maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on in due course
to the more genial lowland conditions and especially to the Midlands and the
south and east of England, where they become crossed again with Down
rams for fat lamb production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness and the
lowland sires fecundity and early maturity.
Wool is now of increasing importance to the sheep farmer and research
into breeding for wool is being undertaken. But the prime purpose of British
sheep farming today is the production of fat lambs, in response to the change
in the preference of consumers away from mature sheep. Leys are largely
relied on for fodder, although in Scotland the turnip crop is still of con¬
siderable importance.
Pigs Pig production is a complex enterprise, owing to the varying uses to which
the carcase is put. In Britain the carcase has always been used in three different
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
Poultry

Crops
335
ways: for curing as bacon, for sale in fresh condition as pork, and for sausages
or other processed forms. Consumption per head, as pork and in processed
form, is now more than double the pre-war level. For the several trades, pigs
of three different weight ranges seem to be called for but leanness is desirable
in all three.
Breeders, in the main, aim at the long type required by bacon curers, for
which there is a grading system based on weight, carcase measurements of
length and back-fat. The Large White and Landrace breeds yield carcases
which meet the requirements of both the bacon and the pork trades.
Apart from type, breeders’ attention is now focused on utility qualities,
such as size and weight of litters, and on food consumed per pound of
liveweight gain. Litter recording and the performance and progeny testing
schemes for boars operated by the Pig Industry Development Authority are
providing basic data. This authority, set up under the Agriculture Act 1957,
promotes improvements in the production of pigs and in the processing
and distribution of pigmeat.
The organisation of the poultry industry has changed very considerably since
the pre-war period. Specialist techniques and intensive husbandry have been
introduced over a large part of the industry and considerable concentration has
occurred. There are now several flocks of over 100,000 birds and only a com¬
paratively small proportion of total production is in the hands of the smallest
producers. By 1964 about half the laying birds on farms were in flocks of
1,000 or more. With the rise in the poultry population and in the yield of eggs
per bird (now averaging over 200 eggs a year), the estimated production of
eggs has more than doubled the 1938 level and for several years nearly all eggs
consumed in Britain have been home-produced.
Within the industry the trend is towards specialisation in the breeding and
supply of stock and in the production of eggs and table poultry. The mass
production of special table chickens, or ‘broilers’, has become a major
industry; it is estimated that about 150 million birds were produced in 1964.
Horticultural crops occupy only a tiny fraction of the cultivated land of the
country—less than 2^ per cent of the area under crops and grass—but their
value in terms of output per acre is very high. The total value of horticultural
crops sold in 1964-65 is estimated at about £175 million, compared with some
;£334 million for farm crops. About 400,000 acres are under vegetables and
about 250,000 acres under fruit.
Market gardening has grown up around all the large centres of population,
and in the Lea Valley, near London, for example, some very large capital
investments have been made. It has also flourished in more rural areas with
favourable soil or climatic conditions—in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire,
Hampshire and Kent, and in a concentration of smallholdings around
Evesham, in the Avon valley. Districts with mild climates, such as the
Penzance region of Cornwall, have been favoured for the production of
selected early crops. More recently, selected vegetable crops have been grown
in increasing quantities by farmers as an alternative to potatoes: this applies
particularly to cabbages and brussels sprouts and to peas for canning, drying
and quick-freezing.
Specialised horticultural holdings range from a few acres up to about
300 acres, and many have glasshouses, frames or forcing houses. Use of
fertilisers, particularly of an organic nature, is very heavy, and much of the
field work is mechanised. The larger holdings normally have specialised
packing sheds, with washing and grading machinery, and irrigation plants.

More and more growers, however, are coming together in co-operatives for
marketing their produce and many of these co-operatives provide grading
and packing facilities for members.
Britain has about 4,500 acres of glasshouses, about half of the area being
used primarily for the cultivation of tomatoes, the main centres of which
are the Lea Valley in Essex and Hertfordshire, and the Worthing district
in Sussex. In the Lea Valley, on a narrow belt of gravel and brick earth,
about 700 acres are covered with glass. Total production of tomatoes in the
country is estimated at about 75,000-80,000 tons annually and the value of
all glasshouse crops at about £30 million per year.
Hard fruits grow well in many parts of England and Wales, the chief risk
associated with their culture being late frosts. The main centres are in the
south, south-west and east of England, and Kent in particular. Production
of apples has been about equally divided between cooking and dessert varieties,
with Cox’s orange pippin heading the latter group, but production of cooking
apples is now declining. About 25,000 acres of varieties of cider apple are
grown mainly in Devon, Herefordshire and Somerset for the cider-making
industry. In Northern Ireland there are 8,000 acres of cooking apples—
Bramley Seedlings—mostly concentrated in County Armagh. Plums and soft
fruits are grown in many counties; concentrations of plums are found in
Kent and Worcestershire, of blackcurrants in Norfolk, Kent and Hereford,
of cherries in Kent and of strawberries in Norfolk, Kent and Hampshire.
Raspberries are exceptional in that of some 9,000 acres grown in Britain nearly
three-quarters are in Scotland, mainly in the Blairgowrie district of Perthshire
and in Angus.
Hop-growing for the brewing industry is confined to two main areas, in
Kent and Sussex and in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Capital outlay
and cultivation costs are very high, but crops per acre average about 12 cwt.,
worth some ^380. The total annual value of the crop is about £8 million.
Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agri¬
cultural producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments.
The estimates show that Britain’s farming is based on livestock; fully
two-thirds of farmers’ income in Britain is derived from the sale of animals or
their products. The aggregate net income of farmers, after fluctuating around
£350 million for some years, now exceeds £450 million. The annual cost of
government support to the industry has averaged about £300 million in
recent years.
Growing items of farm outlay are machinery and equipment, amounting
currently to about one-sixth of total expenses. Feedingstuffs amount to more
than one-quarter but show signs of decreasing slightly. Since 1955 wages have
risen by 60 per cent, offsetting the lower costs arising from the reduction in
manpower made possible by mechanisation.
Until 1958 rents tended to lag behind other costs. This was due partly to
the reluctance of landlords to put up the rents of satisfactory tenants, and
partly to the terms of reference given to arbitrators. These terms were
modified in the 1958 Agriculture Act and since 1959-60 rents in England and
Wales have gone up by about half. Average rents now being negotiated are
£2 t?8- an acre for all types of tenancy.
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer,
if he is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant.
Each year ‘fixed capital’ totalling some £60 million is added to the value of

land and buildings. (Annual gross investment in fixed assets exceeds £160
million.) The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the farms is
provided by the occupiers. Bank advances are an increasingly important
source of outside capital, both fixed and working; about half the total bank
advances to agriculture are believed to be for short-term purposes. Agricultural
merchants are also an important source of short-term credit.
Accounts of some 2,200 farms in England and Wales, analysed by university
agricultural economists, show average valuations of occupiers’ capital ranging
from £20 to £50 per acre. In Scotland a similar sample of 850 accounts shows
a wide range in tenants’ capital per acre, from about ^4 on hill sheep farms
with extensive rough grazings to around £60 per acre on lower ground farms.
In Northern Ireland, on the small intensive farms, occupiers’ capital ranges
from £50 to £70 an acre. Dairy farms are usually more heavily capitalised
than other types of stock farms. On all types of farms machinery is a heavy
item; on dairy farms it is often ^15 per acre and on arable farms up to ^20
per acre; even on stock rearing farms it may amount to £6 per acre.
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with half a million
tractors in 1965, or one to every 36 acres of arable land. Power-take-off
implements now characterise arable farming; and some 60,000 combine
harvesters were in use in 1965- A wide variety of machines for harvesting and
preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are installed on all
except the smallest farms, many with mechanical means of handling milk.
About 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply
and accompanying equipment. There are about 700 farmers’ machinery
syndicates through which farmers have the use of expensive equipment
without tying up their own capital.
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out at
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering in Bedfordshire. This
Institute developed the first farm tractor in the world employing hydrostatic
transmission and also one of the most effective complete potato-harvesters
now in production.
1 he range of profits between individual farms is very wide, varying with the
type and size of farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the occupier.
The average profit for farms of different types varies from about £5 to £10
per acre and there is a marked tendency for small farms to show higher
profits per acre than large ones, owing principally to the higher proportion
of profit represented by personal work on the small farm.
Profits per acre on arable farms have, with occasional seasonal exceptions,
been maintained at a higher level than on other types; dairy farming has
shown consistent but moderate profits, while those on stock-raising farms
have usually been low.
During the last hundred years the Government has played an ever-increasing
part in British agriculture. Since the opening up of the great primary-
producing countries of the New World and the Antipodes in the latter part
of the nineteenth century, producers of food had been at a disadvantage
because supplies tended to exceed effective demand. By the beginning of the
1930s the need for some form of state assistance to agriculture had become
pressing; during the following decade and subsequently, the main object of
the Government’s agricultural policy was to find methods of supporting
domestic agriculture without prejudice to Britain’s position as a world trading
338
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Government
Policy
nation; thus during the 1930s the Government initiated various forms of
protection and financial assistance for agriculture.
During the second world war and the immediate post-war years, agri¬
cultural production was closely controlled by the State, with County War
Agricultural Executive Committees, composed of landowners, farmers and
farm workers, acting as the Government’s local agents. To ensure a reasonable
standard of living for farmers and farm workers, while at the same time
keeping the cost of living steady, most of the basic farm products were
purchased at fixed prices on government account and sold at controlled
prices, often below the cost of procurement; the difference in price was
borne by public funds. This practice continued as long as rationing lasted.
Government policy today is founded on the Agriculture Act of 1947. The
main objective, as set out in Section 1 of the Act, continues to be ‘a stable
and efficient agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the
nation’s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interest it is
desirable to produce in the United Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum
prices consistent with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers
and workers in agriculture and an adequate return on capital invested in
the industry’. To this end, the Government is empowered to provide, for
the main agricultural products, guaranteed prices determined in the light of
annual reviews (see p. 339).
Post-war policy falls broadly into two periods, with the dividing line about
1954. During the first, the chief aim was to encourage expansion and a return
to something like the traditional pattern of British farming. ‘Production
objectives’ were set for each of the main commodities, as they had been
during the war, though the Government gradually ceased to direct farmers
what to grow.
As world supplies of food and Britain’s own agricultural production and
trading position improved, the Government gradually restored to private
business both the importing of food and domestic trading in food. Since the
ending of the period of scarcity, policy objectives have changed: stress has
been laid on more economic production of food of the kinds and qualities
demanded by the market, rather than on indiscriminate expansion of pro¬
duction. The Agriculture Act of 1957 assured farmers that the prices
guaranteed under the Act of 1947 would not be steeply reduced, and at the same
time provided grants towards the cost of bringing fixed equipment up to date.
In recent years increasing pressure and poor phasing of supplies (at home
and from abroad) brought depressed prices and unstable conditions in the
British market for meat and cereals. The Government accordingly decided to
introduce new arrangements to secure a greater degree of stability in the
market and to ensure that the support system would not be undermined by
excessively low market prices, which in turn would increase the cost to the
Exchequer of agricultural support.
The Agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964 gave the Government power
to introduce minimum import prices for agricultural and horticultural
products. In the same year an understanding with overseas suppliers on the
sharing of the bacon market became effective and agreed minimum import
prices for cereals were introduced. Home production of pigs was already
regulated by arrangements which reduce the guaranteed price if the quantity
produced is likely to exceed a certain figure and in 1964 the ‘standard quantity’
concept (see p. 340) was extended to guarantee arrangements for wheat and
barley.

Annual Review
339
The functions of government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised
by the agricultural ministers, that is to say, for England and Wales the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for Scotland the Secretary of State for
Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the Home Secretary, who is the minister
responsible for United Kingdom aspects of Northern Ireland agriculture,
local aspects being the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Minister of
Agriculture. The agricultural ministers are assisted by a number of advisory
committees composed of general agriculturists and specialists.
The headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is
divided functionally, each division being responsible for a particular subject
or service. Its relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly through
its local offices, grouped in England in regions, each administered by a
regional controller working in close collaboration with the regional heads of
the technical services. Local offices in Wales are grouped under a Welsh
Secretary with similar functions and with special responsibility for Welsh
affairs. County Agricultural Executive Committees have a number of duties,
including those of promoting technical development and advising the minister
on local aspects of policy.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, which has
its headquarters in Edinburgh, with the help and advice of n Agricultural
Executive Committees.
The Secretary of State also appoints the members of the Crofters Com¬
mission, which has powers to deal with the unique and difficult circumstances
of crofting in the Highlands and Islands, and the Red Deer Commission,
which deals with the conservation and control of red deer.
In England and Wales the Minister is advised by a panel of independent
scientists on the scientific aspect of any questions affecting the activities of
his department. In addition, two councils, the Agricultural Advisory Council
and the Horticultural Advisory Council, advise the Minister on the problems
of the industry that require research and on the dissemination of research
results to working farmers. In Scotland this function is exercised by the
Agricultural Improvement Council.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for imple¬
menting agricultural policy inaugurated by the Northern Ireland Government.
It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, for which it acts as agent in the administration in Northern Ireland
of United Kingdom agricultural schemes. Its administrative headquarters
are in Belfast and each of the six counties has an Agricultural Executive
Officer.
In February each year, in accordance with the Act of 1947, the agricultural
ministers review the economic condition and prospects of the industry.
Between annual reviews, a special review may be held if the ministers consider
it warranted, but this has seldom been necessary. In holding reviews, the
ministers are required to consult with representatives of agricultural pro¬
ducers—in practice, the three farmers’ unions in the United Kingdom. The
ministers consider such factors as production trends and market requirements,
world market prospects, the cost of subsidies, the trend of profits in the
industry as a whole, the increasing efficiency of the industry and changes in
production costs, trading relations (especially with the Commonwealth) and
the national economic situation. In the light of their conclusions, they
determine guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep, fat pigs, eggs, wool,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
milk, cereals, potatoes and sugar beet. These guarantees apply to livestock
and livestock products for the ensuing twelve months, and to crops to be
harvested in the current year. Various grants in aid of particular kinds of
production or farming practice (known as ‘production grants’) are also
considered. Any changes in ‘relevant’ production grants (broadly, those
payable to occupiers rather than landowners) are taken into account. The
Government’s conclusions and its decisions on changes in guaranteed prices
and relevant production grants are published as a White Paper.
The long-term assurances provided for in the 1957 Act require the total
value of the guaranteed prices and relevant production grants in any year to be
maintained at not less than 97! per cent of their value in the preceding year,
after allowing for changes in costs. In addition, the guaranteed price (adjusted
for any change in the basis of the guarantee) for each commodity must be
not less than 96 per cent of that of the previous year. For livestock and live¬
stock products—where farmers’ decisions need time to take effect—there is
a further provision that reductions in the guaranteed price for any product
must not total more than 9 per cent in a period of three years. The cost of
government support to the industry in 1964-65 was about £265 million; the
estimate for 1965-66, adjusted for the effect of the 1965 review decisions,
forecast an increase to about ^293 million.
The general policy of the Government is to use methods of agricultural
support that allow the ordinary channels of trade to flow freely. The form of
guarantee most generally used is the deficiency payment, which means that
the Government makes payments to producers, related to the differences
between the average market price realised and the guaranteed price, for
output eligible for the guarantee.
The deficiency payments schemes for cereals and fatstock are administered
directly by the agricultural departments. Payments for wheat and rye are
made on the quantity of millable grain and, in the case of wheat, potentially
millable grain sold and delivered by the grower. For barley and oats, much
of which is consumed on farms, payments are made on the acreage grown.
New arrangements, first introduced for the 1961-62 season, provided growers
with an incentive to hold barley until later in the season. ‘Standard quantity’1
arrangements for wheat and barley were introduced for the 1964 crop.
Deficiency payments for fatstock are made weekly to individual producers on
certified sales on a liveweight or deadweight basis but under new arrangements
introduced for 1964-65 there may also be a second payment at the end of the
year for cattle and sheep. The weekly standard prices for fat cattle and
fat sheep vary on a seasonal scale; for pigs there is no seasonal scale but the
weekly prices are adjusted for changes in feed costs and, under a flexible
guarantee arrangement designed to stabilise pigmeat production, adjustments
may also be made quarterly by reference to a forecast of the number of pigs
likely to receive the guarantee payment during a period of 12 months. In
Northern Ireland guarantee payments are administered through the prices
paid to producers by the Pig Marketing Board.
1 The Agriculture Act 1947 postulates that the guarantees should be related to the
volume of agricultural produce which, in the national interest, it is desirable to produce
domestically (see p. 338). This is effected by including ‘standard quantities’ in the
guarantee arrangements for milk, pigs, barley, wheat, potatoes and sugar beet.
‘Standard quantity’ agreements vary in form but, in general, the basic guaranteed price
determined in the Annual Review is related to a specific quantity of produce marketed
annually on a national basis; if this quantity is exceeded the producers’ average unit
return falls.

Grants
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY ^
For most of the remaining commodities the Government operates the
guarantee through the appropriate marketing board, which takes account of
any payments from or to the Government in deciding what to pay producers
for their produce. In the case of milk there are five such boards, and the full
guaranteed price is paid only on a ‘standard quantity’ which relates to the
volume of liquid milk sales plus a substantial reserve. Milk produced in
excess of the standard quantity is sold for manufacturing considerably below
the full guaranteed price. The retail price of liquid milk is determined by
the Government so as to cover the full cost of the guarantee and, taking one
year with another, there is no Exchequer subsidy. For eggs, a subsidy is paid
to the British Egg Marketing Board on all first quality eggs sold to the Board
through packing stations. A deficiency payment is made for potatoes in years
in which the British growers’ average price for potatoes for human consump¬
tion (excluding new potatoes) is less than the guaranteed price; payment is
made to the Potato Marketing Board for the benefit of growers in Great Britain
and to the Ministry of Agriculture, Northern Ireland, for the benefit of
growers there.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board
for every pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to
fix in advance a schedule of producers’ prices, based on types and quality,
after making allowance for its marketing costs.
Under the Sugar Act 1956 and the Agriculture Act 1957 the British
Sugar Corporation contracts to buy the whole of the sugar beet crop produced
from a specified acreage (at present 443,000 acres) at a scale of fixed prices,
determined as a result of the annual review and related to sugar content.
Refined sugar produced by the corporation is sold, under market-sharing
agreements with the refiners, at a price based on the world price.
The Sugar Board buys Commonwealth sugar under the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement and sells it commercially. The deficits or surpluses which
result from the transactions of both the Corporation and the Board are
ultimately reflected in the Board’s accounts. When these accounts show a
deficit a levy is charged on all sugar, imported or home-produced, entering
the United Kingdom market, including the sugar content of composite sugar
imports, and when there is a surplus a distribution payment is made corre¬
spondingly, so that taking one year with another the board balances its account.
The price supports outlined above relate only to current production. To
increase productivity, however, the Government offers to farmers a wide
range of inducements, known as production grants, for improvements to land,
crops, livestock and equipment. In 1964-65 the Exchequer’s contribution in
the form of production grants was j£io8 million. The form taken by these
schemes varies considerably but they fall into three main categories. Firstly,
improvement to land fertility, which is covered by a subsidy on fertilisers and
hme, by grants for drainage and water supply, and by grants for ploughing
and grassland renovation to improve pasturage; the Exchequer cost of these
currently runs at nearly £55 million a year. The second type of inducement
is aimed at maintaining and improving breeding herds of cattle and sheep
(particularly in upland areas) and includes a calf subsidy on animals destined
for the beef herds; the total cost is about ^32 million a year. The third type
consists of a contribution towards farm improvements generally but with
particular reference to farm buildings, silage, roads, drainage, fences and other
equipment. A special scheme exists within this category to assist farmers on
small and uneconomic holdings; payments are based on the implementation
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of schemes submitted by the farmers and approved by the Agricultural
Departments and are limited per farm to £1,000 spread out over three years.
This scheme at present affects some 80,000 holdings. In August 1965 the
Government announced special measures to facilitate and speed up the
voluntary amalgamation of small farms which, because of their scale and
situation, could not expect to become financially viable.
One-third capital grants are made under the Agriculture (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1963, towards expenditure incurred by landowners or
syndicates of farmers in erecting buildings to house machinery or grain
drying and storage facilities for use by farmers’ machinery syndicates (see
P- 337)-
Horticulture Horticultural produce, because it is perishable and liable to seasonal variation
in quantity and quality, does not lend itself to a system of guaranteed prices.
Hitherto the principal means of support has been tariffs on imports, but
greater emphasis is now being placed on the need to strengthen the com¬
petitive efficiency of the industry so as to reduce its dependence upon the
tariffs.

Land Use
It is an integral part of the Government’s planning policy (which is adminis¬

ment, and in Scotland by the Scottish Development Department) that the
better agricultural land should not be taken for other use if there is less
valuable land that would serve the purpose. The Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food assists in carrying out this policy in England and Wales by
providing expert advice to planning authorities and other departments on the
implications, from the standpoint of the public agricultural interest, of all
substantial proposals to take agricultural land for other purposes. Appropriate
arrangements exist for the Ministry to be consulted about such proposals. In
Scotland similar arrangements exist for the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries to give advice.
Agricultural
Credit
The Government has never pursued a general policy of making credit
available to agriculture on easy terms. Nevertheless, a number of facilities
for specific purposes enjoy government encouragement and support.
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agri¬
cultural property is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Ltd. (see p. 415) and takes the form of a loan on the security of a first mortgage
on freehold agricultural land and buildings or of an improvement loan against
the security of a terminable rent charge created on the land improved. The
corporation’s funds are derived mainly from public issues of stock, but it
receives a measure of government support. In Scotland, loans for agricultural
purposes secured on agricultural land in Scotland are granted by the Scottish
Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd.; this corporation also receives
support from the Government.
Improvement loans for carrying out improvements to agricultural land and
buildings are also available to landowners from the Lands Improvement
Company, whose funds are provided privately. The amount of such loans is
charged on the land and buildings in the form of a terminable rent charge.
Improvement loans require the sanction of the agricultural ministers.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and financed out

of public funds. The bulk of the loans issued are short-term for agricultural
machinery, but loans for other purposes are for medium terms, usually up to
ten years and occasionally for longer periods.
A recently introduced scheme enables the Government to assist farmers
to raise capital by guaranteeing loans made by banks. These guarantees may
extend to a maximum of 12 years and will be available (within prescribed
annual limits) for the provision of fixed and semi-permanent machinery and
equipment, and also for the supply of working capital.
Since 1892 county councils and county borough councils in England and
Wales have had powers to provide land for smallholdings. The aim was, at
first, to foster a peasant economy and later some preference was given to the
provision of holdings for ex-Servicemen of the 1914-18 war. Under the Agri¬
culture Act 1947, the policy was changed so as to relate the provision of
smallholdings to agricultural rather than social considerations and the object
is now to give opportunities to people with agricultural experience, particularly
agricultural workers, to become farmers on their own account. Present legisla¬
tion imposes on county councils an obligation to provide smallholdings and
enables the Minister of Agriculture to contribute towards their losses. In
England and Wales, about 15,000 smallholdings are provided by local
authorities and about 1,300 by the Ministry. Of the smallholdings provided
by the Ministry, approximately 1,000, situated on 18 different estates, are
managed by the Land Settlement Association Limited, which was originally
formed in 1934 for the purpose of developing smallholdings for unemployed
men from industrial areas. The association provides centrally on each estate
various services for the tenants’ use, including the supply of agricultural
stores and requisites, the operation of a machinery pool, and facilities for
the packing and marketing of produce.
The Minister has power under the 1947 Act to make loans for working
capital to tenants of statutory smallholdings. In this way they can be helped
to obtain livestock, machinery, implements and other necessary items; tenants
must, however, have available at least 25 per cent of the capital required.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which now owns and maintains about 430,000 acres of land
settlement estates, with some 4,000 holdings, mainly in the Highlands.
In the seven Scottish counties known as crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness,
Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, and Shetland—much
of the land is farmed by crofters, tenant farmers whose holdings are generally
either rented at a cost of not more than £50 a year or have an area not exceeding
75 acres.
In these counties there are about 20,000 crofts, which produce about
one-quarter of the total agricultural output of the area. The special problems
of the crofting counties, which had for some time been suffering from a
declining population, led to the setting up, in 1955, of a Crofters Commission
whose functions are to reorganise, develop and regulate crofting in the crofting
counties, to promote the interests of crofters and to keep under review matters
relating to crofting. The Commission’s powers, embodied in the Crofters
(Scotland) Acts of 1955 and 1961, include that of carrying out reorganisation
schemes in ‘townships’ (crofting communities) if a majority of the crofters
agree, by reallocating the land in a way which, in the Commission’s opinion,
would lead to the proper and efficient use of the land and the general benefit
of the township. The Commission has also powers over the letting and

sub-letting of crofts and it is responsible for approving regulations governing the
use of common grazings. It acts as agent for the Secretary of State for Scotland
in the administration of schemes of loans and grants for the development of
agricultural production on crofts, and collaborates with other bodies in
carrying out measures for economic development and social improvement in
crofting areas.
Land drainage in England and Wales is administered (since April 1965) by
27 river authorities (see p. 296), two catchment and 400 internal drainage '
boards. Each river authority area comprises one or more major river systems.
They cover the whole of England and Wales, apart from the London area.
There are no comparable authorities in Scotland, where drainage is the
responsibility of owners and occupiers of land. River authorities have powers
to maintain and improve watercourses scheduled as main rivers. Their work
is concerned with the improvement of land drainage by increasing the capacity
of rivers and erecting pumping stations, the prevention of inland flooding—
both urban and agricultural—and the erection of defences to protect low-lying
areas from coastal flooding. River authorities also have powers relating to
water resources generally, freshwater fisheries and river pollution.
Internal drainage boards are concerned with very much smaller areas and
their work is chiefly in low-lying agricultural districts. Their main function is
to keep the land drained in their area by improving the main drains and,
where necessary, by pumping from low-lying land.
The authorities derive their income directly or indirectly from rate-payers.
The Government pays grants towards the cost of the improvement schemes ;
carried out by both types of organisation. Grants to river authorities vary
from 20 per cent to 80 per cent according to the financial position of the
authority. Internal drainage boards receive grants at a flat rate of 50 per cent.
The gross capital expenditure of drainage authorities on new and improved
works amounts to about j£8 million a year. Government grants, including
grants towards the repayment of loans raised in previous years, amount to
nearly £5 million. Drainage authorities’ expenditure on maintenance is ?
estimated at over ^4 million a year and is rising steadily.
In Northern Ireland the Minister of Agriculture is the drainage authority
in respect of watercourses designated by the Drainage Council as main or
minor watercourses. The cost of these works is met in the first place by the
Exchequer and offset later by contributions from the county and county
borough councils. Urban drainage schemes may be promoted by local
sanitary authorities and are eligible in appropriate cases for Exchequer
grants-in-aid.
In Great Britain about half, and in Northern Ireland all, farms are owner-
occupied. The traditional form of tenancy in England and Wales runs from
year to year; in Scotland leases for terms of 10 to 14 years are more common.
The tenancy agreement may be either written or verbal and may (but need
not) include provisions about such matters as rights of cropping, liability for
repair and maintenance, and compensation for tenant’s improvements.
In order to protect the respective interests of landlords and tenants and to
eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and liabilities, a code of landlord and
tenant relationships has been written into legislation. The Agriculture Acts
of 1947 and, for Scotland, 1948, lay down the basic rules of good estate
management and good husbandry for owners and occupiers respectively.
The Agricultural Holdings Acts of 1948 and 1949 contain more detailed
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
MARKETING
345
provisions, some of which apply to all tenancy agreements (i.e. the parties
may not contract out of them) and some of which apply only in the absence
of specific provision in the tenancy agreement.
Among the compulsory provisions are those relating to security of tenure.
The Acts provide for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception
of certain short-term lettings to which exemption can be given by the Minister
or Secretary of State, to continue in force from year to year until determined
by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions, such as where the notice
to quit is given on account of a breach of contract by the tenant (for instance,
failure to pay rent or carry out repairs), the tenant can contest it by serving
a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes inoperative unless the
landlord can satisfy an independent body (in England and Wales the Agri¬
cultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land Court) that his
claim for possession is in the interests of sound estate management or good
husbandry or that the land is required for certain purposes specified in the Acts.
The Acts lay down a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled
on termination of the tenancy. Compensation is normally payable both for
disturbance (between one and two years’ rent) and for improvements which
the tenant has carried out during the tenancy. The landlord is normally
entitled to counter-claim for dilapidations, and machinery is provided for
the settlement of claims by arbitration in default of agreement between the
parties. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and tenant and
may be varied by agreement at any time or, failing agreement, by arbitration
at intervals of not less than three years in England and Wales and five years
in Scotland. A landlord is entitled to claim additional rent for improvements
carried out at his expense. The Acts also forbid provisions in tenancy agree¬
ments which would unduly restrict the tenant’s farming operations.
Agricultural products are now marketed mainly through private trade channels
such as corn merchants, livestock auctions and markets, and bacon factories;
or through producers’ co-operative organisations. For certain commodities’
however, marketing arrangements are influenced by boards operating under
the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 (which consolidated earlier legislation).
These marketing boards are producers’ organisations with statutory powers
to regulate the marketing of particular products. The schemes under which
they are constituted and operate must be approved by Parliament and
confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most of the members of the boards are
elected by the producers but a minority are appointed by the minister or
ministers concerned. Further safeguards serve to protect consumers and other
interests affected by schemes and the public interest generally.
Marketing boards fall into two broad categories: first, those which have
powers to trade as the first selling agency for all producers not specially
exempted or, alternatively, to exercise a comparable influence by controlling
all contracts between producers and first buyers; and secondly, boards
which maintain only a broad control over marketing conditions leaving
producers free otherwise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for
eggs, hops, milk and wool fall into the first category and the potato board
into the second.
A Home-Grown Cereals Authority was set up in June 1965 under the
Cereals Marketing Act 1965. Its purpose is to improve the marketing of
home-grown cereals and its activities will include the provision of financial
inducements to growers to make forward contracts for the sale of their grain
and the improvement of market information. The Authority also has certain
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
reserve trading powers. A Covent Garden Market Authority was established
in 1961 to reorganise and modernise the largest of London’s wholesale
agricultural markets. Plans are in hand to move this market to a new site,
south of the Thames, by the early 1970s.
Market
Development
Scheme
To assist the financing of research and development in the marketing of
agricultural and horticultural produce, £1^ million was earmarked in 1962
by the Government, a similar sum being set aside by the industry. By spring
I9^5> grants totalling about £70,000 had been approved, and Parliament
extended the life of the scheme by a further three years to 1968. The majority
of applications have come from producer groups and more than half of the
projects relate to livestock or meat.
CONTROL OF
DISEASES AND
PESTS
Animals
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
veterinary profession in private practice. The State veterinary service,
inaugurated in 1865 and covering Great Britain, deals with situations beyond
the control of the individual veterinary surgeon. Centred on London and
Edinburgh, it is able, at any hour, to deal promptly with outbreaks of
infectious diseases. Northern Ireland has its own veterinary service.
For many years Britain has been free from eight serious animal diseases,
including rinderpest, sheep scab, glanders and rabies.
On 1 st October, i960, the whole of Great Britain became a bovine tubercu¬
losis attested area and Northern Ireland followed a month later. Bovine
tuberculosis is now a disease of extreme rarity: all cattle are tuberculin tested
at regular intervals and reactors to the test are slaughtered, compensation
being paid to the owners.
The work of the service is backed by the extensive facilities of the Central
Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, and those of its subsidiary
laboratory at Lasswade, near Edinburgh. In addition, there are 19 investiga¬
tion centres with well-equipped laboratories in England and Wales. These
centres perform work requiring specialist knowledge and give advice on
disease problems to private practitioners. In Scotland a similar service is
provided by investigation centres attached to agricultural colleges. The
veterinary laboratory for Northern Ireland is situated at Stormont, Belfast.
Plants Advice to growers on the general control of plant pests and diseases is given
by the advisory services. In addition, the State plant health service is res¬
ponsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones
from abroad. It also issues the health certificates required by other countries
to accompany plant material imported from Britain.
Voluntary certification schemes are operated to encourage the development
of healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks, particularly of crops
subject to degenerative diseases.
Agricultural Although the increasing use of pesticides has contributed appreciably to
Chemicals the expansion of agricultural output in Britain, it has been recognised that
effective safeguards are needed against the dangers arising from their
uncontrolled use. The Regulations made under the Agriculture (Poisonous
Substances) Act 1952 provides protection for workers using the more toxic
chemicals. The voluntary Pesticides Society Precautions Scheme, operated
by the Government with the full backing of the industy, ensures that new
pesticides for use in agriculture and food storage, or new methods of using

existing pesticides, are not introduced until enough experimental work has
been done on their attendant hazards (including contamination of food and
harm to wild life) to allow the Government to make recommendations for their
safe use. There is also a voluntary Veterinary Products Safety Precautions
Scheme on similar lines, designed initially to cover veterinary products on
sale to farmers.
A key role in the administration of both these schemes is played by the
Government s Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals.
Reports of this Committee, published in March and October 1964, concluded
that there was no evidence that the use of the persistent organochlorine
pesticides presented any immediate hazard to human beings and animals,
apart from certain species of predatory birds; but the Committee also
recommended that the cumulative contamination of the environment should
be curtailed by restricting certain uses of aldrin and dieldrin and making
some minor restrictions on the use of endosulfan and endrin. Effect is being
given to these recommendations.
In England and Wales free technical advice on all agricultural and horti¬
cultural matters is available to every farmer and grower through the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s National Agricultural Advisory Service
(NAAS) which is organised on a regional and county basis. Every county has
a county advisory officer in charge of advisory work and is divided into
districts, in each of which there is a district advisory officer who can call on an
extensive system of specialist advisers. In Northern Ireland advisory work is
organised by the Ministry of Agriculture, with a county organisation similar
to the NAAS. In Scotland the advisory services, likewise similar in scope to
the NAAS, are based on the three agricultural colleges.
Facilities are provided at the NAAS experimental farms and horticultural
stations in England and Wales and at agricultural college centres in Scotland
and Northern Ireland for field-scale extensions of research work and investi¬
gations of local problems.
The main functions of the Agricultural Land Service, which operates in
England and Wales, are:
(1) to advise owners and occupiers of agricultural land on estate management
matters including farm buildings;
(2) to provide professional advice and services to the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and his agents on all matters relating to farm land
and buildings;
(3) to provide expert professional advice to the Minister and department
on the agricultural land use implications of planning proposals, including
the possibilities of reclaiming to agriculture, land worked for minerals
by open-cast methods; and
(4) liaison with other departments and planning authorities about such
proposals.
In Scotland similar duties are carried out by officers of the Department
of Agriculture and Fisheries but advisory work regarding farm buildings is
undertaken by the agricultural colleges. In Northern Ireland advice on matters
relating to farm land and buildings falls within the scope of the Ministry’s
advisory service.
The work of the advisory and veterinary services is supplemented by
numerous technical publications.

Education
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Basic agricultural research in Britain is described on p. 214. In England and
Wales, research and advice on farm economics are combined in the Provincial
Agricultural Economics Service, which comprises ten university Departments
of Agricultural Economics and which is co-ordinated by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In Scotland, agricultural economists are on
the staff of the three agricultural colleges. The agricultural departments in
both England and Wales and Scotland have economics and statistics units.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture also has an Economics and
Statistics Division and has, in addition, its own research divisions investigating
problems of animal and crop production. The staff of these divisions are
also responsible for lectures in the Faculty of Agriculture of Queen’s University,
Belfast, and for specialist advice to the county advisory staffs.
Industrial concerns manufacturing weed-killers, insecticides, fertilisers,
feedingstuffs and agricultural tractors and implements undertake research on
a considerable scale and in most cases maintain experimental farms and estates.
There are four types of institution which provide full-time education in
agricultural subjects: universities and agricultural colleges; in England and
Wales, county farm institutes, and in Scotland, farm schools. Twelve univer¬
sities in the United Kingdom provide degree and postgraduate training in
agriculture, and one other university offers postgraduate diploma courses. A
National College of Agricultural Engineering was established in i960 at
Silsoe, Bedfordshire. This is one of the national colleges (see p. 162)
established to train people for highly specialised industries, the needs of
which cannot be met at local technical colleges.
Two-year diploma courses and some specialised courses are given at five
agricultural colleges and at two of the county farm institutes in England and
Wales; three agricultural colleges in Scotland give two-year to three-year
diploma courses and also offer two- or three-term certificate courses. In
Northern Ireland there are two agricultural colleges and two more are planned.
There are 31 county farm institutes in England and five in Wales run by
local education authorities. They provide residential courses in general
agriculture, dairying, horticulture, poultry husbandry and rural domestic
economy. Local education authorities also provide a wide range of short
courses and classes for farmers, farm workers, horticulturists and domestic
producers.
There are eight farm schools in Scotland, run by local education authorities,
providing courses—mainly residential—of from one to three years’ duration
for boys and girls of from 12 to 16 years. There is one residential agricultural
school in Northern Ireland, which provides short courses for boys and girls
over 15 years of age.
Courses in land management are available at the Universities of Cambridge
and London and at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.
In 1964 the Secretary of State for Education and Science’s National
Advisory Council on Education for Industry and Commerce was invited to
consider the provision of further education for agriculture at institutions
other than universities. Its first report is expected late in 1965.
FISHERIES
Although the sea fishing industry contributes only about J per cent of the
United Kingdom’s gross national product, it is of greater importance to the
economy of Scotland. It is also by far the most important single source of

employment in some of the major fishing ports. The industry falls into three
main divisions, concerned respectively with white fish, herring and shellfish.
The major element of the catch is white fish: the catches of herring and
shellfish are relatively small. White fish are demersal fish (such as cod, haddock,
plaice, turbot and sole) which live on or near the sea bed, and also pelagic fish
(such as pilchard, mackerel and sprats) which live mainly in intermediate
waters or near the surface. Herring is a pelagic species and constitutes a
separate fishery. Shellfish include Crustacea (such as lobsters, nephrops and
crabs) and molluscs (such as escallops, mussels, cockles and oysters).
The white fish section of the industry is made up of three main groups:
the distant water, the near and middle water, and the inshore fisheries. The
distant waters are those round Iceland and in the west Atlantic, Greenland,
Bear Island and the north coast of Norway, and the Barents Sea; the middle
water grounds lie around the Faroe Islands; and the near water grounds are
those in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and in the coastal areas around Britain.
The herring fishing grounds are mainly within 60 miles of land. The inshore
waters also yield considerable quantities of shellfish.
-*
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, Milford Haven and Lowestoft for white fish, and Great Yarmouth
and Lowestoft for herring. In Scotland the chief centres for white fish are
Aberdeen, Granton, Fraserburgh, the Moray Firth, the West Coast and
Shetland; herring landings are made mainly at the east coast ports of Aberdeen,
Fraserburgh and Peterhead, the west coast ports of Ullapool, Mallaig, Oban
and Portpatrick, and in Shetland. In Northern Ireland the herring fishing
ports are Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel.
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, lining, and ring
and drift netting. Trawling is carried out throughout the year in the distant
and near waters for all species of demersal fish. Seining is also used for
catching demersal fish all the year round, mainly in the North Sea, the
Minches, the Firth of Clyde, and the Irish Sea. There are about 600 Scottish
and Northern Ireland seiners, and about 200 operating from English ports.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is summer fishing for herring
based on the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland, and the north-east
coast ports of England, and autumn fishing off East Anglia based on Lowestoft
and Yarmouth. Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of
Scotland, in the Isle of Man area and off Southern Ireland.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and
methods of capture; in addition, there are extensive fisheries for crabs,
lobsters, shrimps, mussels, escallops, cockles and oysters, and, off Scotland,
north-east England and in the Irish Sea there are substantial catches of
‘Norway lobsters’ (nephrops).
Distant water vessels, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and
Fleetwood, numbered 203 at the end of 1964. They are over 140 feet in length
and 194 of them make voyages of 17 to 23 days to fishing grounds in the
Arctic Circle. Recently, partly due to the introduction of freezer trawlers and
factory vessels, there has been an increasing tendency to fish the waters
bordering Newfoundland, Labrador and Greenland. These vessels spend
from one to three months at sea and fillet and freeze much or all of their
catch immediately it is taken. At the same date, near and middle water vessels
numbered 434; they are under 140 feet long and most of them work nearer

home, making voyages of from a few days up to more than two weeks,
although some of the larger vessels fish regularly off the Faroes and seasonally
as far afield as Iceland. Included in the near water group are vessels engaged
in drift net fishing for herring; these vessels usually make daily voyages. The
inshore group consists mainly of vessels of under 80 feet which are seldom at
sea for longer than two or three days and more usually make daily landings,
often fishing within sight of land.
In the British fishing industry in 1964 there were about 21,600 fishermen
in regular employment and some 5,900 occasionally employed; 8,200 of the
former and 2,100 of the latter were from Scottish ports. In Northern Ireland
there were about 460 regular fishermen.
In 1964 landings of fish, both demersal and pelagic, by British fishing vessels
totalled 817,000 tons (677,000 tons of demersal fish and 140,000 tons of
pelagic), valued at about £54 million. Landings at British ports by foreign
vessels totalled about 131,000 tons of fresh and frozen fish (including 51,000
tons brought direct from the fishing grounds), valued at about £21 million.
British landings of shellfish yielded £2-9 million. Cod accounted for 43 per
cent of the total value of wet fish (i.e. fish other than shellfish) landed by
British vessels; haddock (19 per cent) and plaice (10 per cent) were the other
most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Net imports of all types of fish (fresh, frozen, salted or canned) in 1964
amounted to about 225,000 tons valued at £67 million, including 45,000 tons
of canned salmon to the value of £29 million and other canned fish worth
£11-2 million.
Weekly consumption of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish
and imported canned fish) in Britain averaged 15,250 tons landed weight in
1964. Consumption has been declining slightly; on an edible (fillet) weight
basis, it was estimated provisionally at 17-6 lb. per head in 1964, com¬
pared with 18-8 lb. in 1958, a peak total of 28-7 lb. in 1948 and an annual
average of 21-8 lb. from 1934-38.
Processing and packaging of fish—curing, kippering, canning and quick-
freezing for consumer packs—are the subject of continuing research and
development. The production of quick-frozen fish has been increasing steadily
since 1952. With the increase in quick-freezing (which now processes over 15
per cent of all white fish landings), new export outlets have opened up for
white fish, which in 1964 accounted for nearly half the total British exports
of fish and fish products, valued at £8-2 million. Markets abroad for quick-
frozen fish, mainly in Europe, have been expanding; exports of herrings have
continued to decline.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal food and to a much lesser extent for fertilisers. Home production of
white fish meal and herring meal in 1964 was 78,000 tons.
Whaling is regulated by the International Whaling Commission (of which
Britain is a member) set up under the International Whaling Convention of
1946. Its headquarters are in London. The last remaining British whaling
expedition has been disposed of to foreign interests.
The main commercial freshwater catches are salmon, sea-trout and eels. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland, fixed nets along the coast and sweep or
draught nets in rivers and estuaries are used; in England, drift nets are used

for catching salmon in the sea, and draught nets and fixed traps in estuaries.
In England and Wales the value of the salmon catch is approximately
£200,000 a year, in Scotland it amounts to nearly £1 - 5 million, and in Northern
Ireland to some £250,000. In Northern Ireland, eels worth about £200,000
a year are captured by long lines and by eel nets placed in river weirs.
The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate
Market in London, which handles about 300 tons a day, but other large
cities also have central fish markets. The principal method of distribution is
through wholesalers, located at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell
to inland wholesalers; the port wholesalers prepare the fish for onward ship¬
ment. Special express fish trains transport the catch daily from the ports to
inland centres, and increasing use is being made of road transport. Retail
sales are handled by some 25,000 to 30,000 fishmongers and fish friers; the
latter use about a third of the landings of white fish.
Recent developments include the entry of trawler-owning companies into
the system of distribution. This process is being speeded by the growing
popularity of quick-frozen consumer packs, which are sold by other retail
outlets as well as by fishmongers.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland; the Ministry of Health
and the Scottish Home and Health Department are concerned with questions
of nutrition and hygiene affecting fish and fish products. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels are provided for under the Merchant
Shipping Acts, which are administered by the Board of Trade.
The Herring Industry Board was set up under the Herring Industry Act of
1935 to reorganise, develop and regulate the herring industry; subsequent
amending Acts have also been passed. The Board consists of a chairman and
three other members, all part-time and independent of the industry, who are
appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the
Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary. The Board, whose
activities are financed partly by levies and licence fees and partly by govern¬
ment grants and loans is advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council,
consisting of 33 members representing all sections of the industry and
consumers.
The functions of the Board include the promotion of sales of herring, both
at home and abroad, and the application of the benefits of technical progress
to the industry, including the adoption of new methods of catching, processing
and distributing herring. The Board administers the government grant and
loan schemes which provide for assistance towards the purchase of new fishing
vessels, and new engines for existing vessels. Fishermen may also obtain
loans from the Board towards the purchase of second-hand vessels under 80
feet in length and towards the cost of new nets and gear. Up to 31st March,
!965, £1,502,600 in loans and £476,014 in grants had been advanced.
The White Fish Authority and the Committee for Scotland and Northern
Ireland of the Authority were set up under the Sea Fish Industry Act 1951.
The function of the Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate the white
fish industry, and that of the Committee to advise the Authority about the
exercise and performance of its functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
 I
352 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Authority is composed of six independent members, and the Scottish
Committee of five, under the chairmanship of a member of the Authority.
They are appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
the Secretary^ of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary. The White
Fish Industry Advisory Council was also set up under the Sea Fish Industry
Act 1951 to advise the Authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions. It consists of 48 members representing the various interests of the
fishing industry.
The White Fish Authority administers government grant and loan
schemes for the purchase of new fishing vessels and engines and the improve¬
ment of existing vessels. It also administers loans for the purchase of nets
and gear and processing plants. Up to 31st March, 1965, £31-6 million in
loans and million in grants were approved for these purposes by the
Authority. Its other activities are financed by a levy on first-hand sales of
fish.
Subsidies Since 195° a government subsidy has been paid towards inshore, near and
and Grants middle water vessels fishing for white fish. This subsidy, now paid under
the White Fish and Herring Industries Act 1953, varies according to the
class of vessel concerned and is paid at the rate of so much per day at sea for
the larger vessels and at so much per stone of fish landed from the smaller
boats. In 1964-65 the amount paid in this way was £400 million. The White
Fish and Herring Industries Act 1957 extended the subsidy to vessels
fishing for herring, the conditions being broadly the same as for white fish
vessels. In 1964-65 the herring subsidy totalled £372,000. In addition to
the rate per day at sea or stonage rate, subsidy is payable, subject to certain
conditions, on herring sold for reduction to oil and meal. Grants and loans
are also available under these Acts for vessels and engines for the fishing
fleets. No subsidy is paid for shellfish but vessels fishing for them are eligible
for grants and loans.
The Sea Fish Industry Act 1959, which came into operation in December
I959> provided for further funds for subsidies and grants, and the White
Fish and Herring Industries Act 1961 extended the white fish subsidy
to vessels over 140 feet in length and to other vessels fishing distant waters.
The Sea Fish Industry Act 1962, passed in consequence of the report
of a Committee of Inquiry into the Fishing Industry, extended the scope of
these forms of aid and made provision for their continuance until the end of
1972. The Act, however, has special provisions for annual reductions in the
rates of white fish subsidy payable to vessels of 80 feet or over in length.
FORESTRY
The total area of productive woodland in Great Britain is 3^ million acres,
or less than 6 per cent of the total land area. If account is taken of areas of
scrub and old felled areas, including those cut down in the 1939-45 war> the
total rises to 4J million acres, or 7^ per cent of the land area. The high
proportion of unproductive woodland is largely a legacy of two wars and,
while rehabilitation of these areas continues to proceed, it is unlikely that all
areas (because of remoteness and poor site conditions) will be replanted. A
measure of the extent of rehabilitation, combined with a small amount of
deforestation through conversion to agricultural land or other use, is provided
by the fact that the area of unproductive woodland has been reduced by
300,000 acres since 1945.
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 353
On 30th September, 1964, the area of all woodland in blocks of one acre
or more was estimated at 4-29 million acres, of which half were in England,
two-fifths in Scotland and the rest in Wales. The classification of forest area,
showing type and ownership in 1964, is given in Table 21.

a Includes forest area owned by certain bodies such as local authorities and water
supply undertakings.
The area of productive forest managed by the Forestry Commission, at
1,525,000 acres, represents 47 per cent of the total. Currently the rate of
forest extension is 45,000 acres by the Commission and nearly 20,000 acres
per year by private woodland owners. The Commission’s programme is
concentrated in upland areas, especially of Scotland, and consists mainly of
conifers because of the difficult site conditions encountered. The major
species used are Sitka spruce, Lodgepole pine, Scots pine and Norway spruce.
In private planting the dependence on conifers is high, though larches are
more widely used and only a very small number of Lodgepole pine. In older
woodlands and taking the country as a whole the commonest coniferous
trees are Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and the larches, while the
commonest broadleaved trees are oak and beech.
Except for the period of the two world wars, when much over-felling took
place, home woodlands have made only a limited contribution to the nation’s
total requirements of wood and wood products. At present the country imports
90 per cent of its needs by volume, and a higher proportion still by value, the
total import bill for wood and wood products averaging £455 million over the
years i960 to 1964. The proportion of conifers in total home production is
rising, largely owing to the increasing contribution of Forestry Commission
woodlands planted between the wars.
The Forestry
Commission
and Forestry
Policy
In 1919 the Forestry Act was passed establishing the Forestry Commission
as the national forest authority, with the general duty of promoting the
interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the production
and supply of timber in Great Britain. The Commission was formerly required
to comply with directions given by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland, but in 1964 the Minister of
Land and Natural Resources assumed responsibility for forestry, sharing this
function with the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. Because of the
354

broadening of the Commission’s functions, particularly where production
and marketing of timber is concerned, it was decided in 1965 to reconstitute
the Commission to comprise a part-time chairman, four full-time executive
commissioners and five part-time commissioners. The Commission’s planting
programmes are to be reviewed.
The Commission manages some 500 forests, which together embrace more
than 1,800,000 acres of forest land, of which nearly 1,600,000 are under trees.
They are distributed over England, Scotland and Wales. All these forests are
covered by management plans, which provide for such work as planting, road
construction, thinning, fire protection, and timber production.
As already stated, a substantial amount of the Forestry Commission’s new
planting is carried out in Scotland, much of it in the Highland counties. The
poorer types of land are being used, such as sour, peaty soil which is unsuitable
for other agricultural purposes, and has become suitable for forestry as a
result of advances in the technique of deep ploughing. Sand dunes are used
to a limited extent: on the southern shore of the Moray Firth, Culbin Forest
now includes nearly 7,500 acres of plantations formed on dunes which
had been unstable for centuries. Similarly, in Wales, about 3,000 acres of
sand dunes at Mon, Anglesey, and more than 2,000 acres at Pembrey,
Carmarthenshire, have been successfully planted.
Production of coniferous timber from Commission woodlands, mainly in
the way of thinnings, is expected to rise from some 900,000 tons in 1965 to
about 2,400,000 tons by 1980. Much of this kind of produce is meeting
traditional requirements of the coal mines but a great deal is also taken up by
the paper pulp industry and by the new factories established to make chipboard.
The Forestry Fund was established by the Forestry Act 1919; from it is
paid all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid
their receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other sources, together with
the amounts voted annually by Parliament. The net cost of managing the
Commission’s forestry enterprise in the year ended 30th September, 1964,
was ^19-3 million. Expenditure on grants and services to private forestry was
£1-5 million.
Privately owned woods comprise about two-thirds of the total forest area in
Great Britain (as shown in Table 21), and contain most of the mature and
semi-mature timber. The size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges
from a few acres to several thousand acres, and a high proportion of private
woodland area is in small ownership (i.e. owners of up to about 250 acres).
Impetus has been given to the effective management of private woodlands
by the introduction of the Dedication of Woodlands Scheme under the
Forestry Act 1947. Under this scheme, owners are invited to put their land
permanently to timber production and to manage their woods in accordance
with a plan agreed with the Forestry Commission, in return for the provision
of planting and management grants and technical advice. By September
1964 the total area dedicated was nearly 800,000 acres. In addition, there are
the woodlands covered by the Approved Woodlands Scheme in which a
planting grant, but no management grant, is made; and these bring the total
area managed under agreed plans to over 960,000 acres. Woodland owners are
represented, in their relations with the Forestry Commission, by the Forestry
Committee of Great Britain, which co-ordinates the work of two associations
of woodland owners, the Timber Growers’ Organisation (for owners in
England and Wales) and the Scottish Woodland Owners’ Association.

The Forestry Commissioners have encouraged the development of co¬
operative forestry schemes. The co-operative societies provide for landowners
and farmers the services of skilled staff, centralised purchasing facilities, and
a central agency for the disposal of forest produce. The Commission also
co-operates with the principal forestry societies, such as the Royal Forestry
Society of England and Wales and the Royal Scottish Forestry Society, in
disseminating technical knowledge.
In 1959 the Home Grown Timber Marketing Corporation was established
by timber merchants to promote the use of home grown timber.
The Forestry Act 1945 established national committees for England,
Scotland and Wales, composed partly of Forestry Commissioners and partly of
persons outside the Commission. These committees keep under review certain
aspects of the Commission’s work and matters concerning the development
of private forestry.
Other bodies have been set up to provide for consultation on the marketing
and utilisation of home grown timber. The Home Grown Timber Advisory
Committee, established by the Forestry Commissioners in 1939, includes
representatives of associations of landowners and timber merchants, under
an independent chairman. In 1949 the Forestry Commissioners set up the
Advisory Committee on Utilisation of Home Grown Timber to advise on
measures designed to promote the sale and utilisation of produce from
British woodlands. A voluntary scheme was agreed upon in 1961 for consulta¬
tion on proposals for afforestation of land within National Parks (see p. 183)
that has not previously been planted with trees. The Forestry Commission
agreed, and the Timber Growers’ Organisation and the Country Landowners’
Association undertook to advise their members, to submit such proposals to
the park planning authorities.
The Forestry Commission maintains three forester training schools: in
England, at Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire; in Wales, near
Betws-y-Coed in Caernarvonshire; and in Scotland at Faskally, near Pitlochry
in Perthshire. Northerwood House in the New Forest, Hampshire, is the
Commission’s educational centre, and is used for practical courses for
university students, landowners and agents, planning officers, school teachers
and others connected with, or interested in, forestry.
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities; a
proportion of suitable graduates is recruited by the Commission as forest
officers.
The Commission’s Forest Research Station at Alice Holt Lodge, near
Farnham, Surrey, was opened in 1946. Expenditure on research work at this
station and in experimental areas in many forests in Great Britain amounted
£486,Goo in 1964. This sum included grants for special forestry research
work to various institutions and to university departments including the
Commonwealth Forestry Institute at Oxford, which is also financed by the
University, the Colonial Office and overseas Governments. Research into the
qualities of home grown timber is carried out by the Forest Products Research
Laboratory at Princes Risborough, Bucks, and also by grant-aided research
associations.
When the Government of Northern Ireland was formed in 1922, the new
Ministry of Agriculture became the forest authority working with similar
powers and duties to those conferred on the Forestry Commission by the
356
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Forestry Act 1919. At that time the Ministry took over some 4,000 acres
for afforestation, of which 700 acres had been planted.
Forest policy in Northern Ireland is implemented by the Forestry Act
(Northern Ireland) 1953, which replaced earlier legislation. This Act pro¬
vides the Ministry with powers to acquire and manage land, and to give
financial and technical assistance for private planting. It introduced measures
for the protection of all woodlands, whether owned by the State or privately
owned, against destruction by over-cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
The State forest area has grown steadily and at a greatly accelerated pace
since the end of the second world war. By 1964 nearly 130,000 acres had been
acquired, of which about 75,000 acres had been planted. The present
afforestation programme provides for the creation, as soon as possible, of an
area of 150,000 acres of productive State forest. To reach this objective, a
minimum annual planting rate of 5,000 acres has been set.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and
from receipts from forest produce and other sources. About 1,200 people are
employed in field labour and ancillary work. The area of exploitable private
woodlands is at present about 33,000 acres, and private planting, which is
gaining impetus, is assisted by schemes for the supply at a low cost of young
trees from the Ministry’s nurseries, by grants towards the cost of the estab¬
lishment of new plantations, and by free technical advice.
Pomeroy Forestry School at Pomeroy House, Co. Tyrone, provides
training and refresher courses for forestry workers, school teachers and
others interested in trees and forestry.

TRANSPORT AND

357
Inland and overseas transport and communications employed 7-3 per cent
of the total labour force in the United Kingdom in June 1964. Of the 1-7
million persons so occupied, 28 per cent were engaged in road passenger
transport and road haulage contracting, 23-1 per cent in railways and 24-3 per
cent in postal services and telecommunications; sea and air transport absorbed
respectively 8-2 per cent and 2-9 per cent; port and inland water transport
and miscellaneous transport services and storage absorbed 3-5 per cent.
Transport and communications contribute about 8 per cent to the gross
national product and are responsible for 9 per cent of the nation’s gross fixed
capital formation.
SHIPPING
Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over, 14 per
cent is registered in the United Kingdom. Although the British merchant
fleet is still the largest in active employment, British shipowners have been
subject to increasing competition from the growing fleets of other nations.
Between 1954 and 1964 the British merchant fleet increased by 13 per cent
from 19 million to 21-5 million gross tons, while the total tonnage of all other
countries increased by 68 per cent, from 78-4 million to 131-5 million gross
tons. The balance of payments for shipping services was positive until about
I959 was nainus £27 million in 1964). Shipping, however, still makes one
of the largest contributions to Britain’s total earnings of foreign exchange and
in 1964 freights, charter receipts and passage money amounted to ^678 million,
or about one-quarter of the total value of invisible exports. In recent years
freight earnings in cross-trade have amounted to about 60 per cent of total
shipping earnings. The proportion of the United Kingdom’s own sea-borne
trade carried in British ships is not known exactly, but is believed to amount
to about half.
Of the 21-5 million gross tons of merchant shipping of 100 gross tons and
over registered (though not all owned) in the United Kingdom on 30th June,
1964, tankers constituted 8 million gross tons; this was 16 per cent of the
world’s sea-going tanker tonnage.
Recent trends in the composition of the merchant fleet have been the
reduction of tramp tonnage other than specially built bulk carrier tonnage,
the growth of tanker tonnage, the increasing size of tankers, and the com¬
missioning of vessels specially built to carry ore, sugar, and other commodities
in bulk.
1 One gross ton (g.t.) = 100 cubic feet. One deadweight ton (d.w.t.) = 1 long ton
(2,240 lb.). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed spaces on a ship.
Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which a vessel can carry before
sinking to the load line.

As a result of replacements built in recent years, 60 per cent of the total
gross tonnage in 1964 was less than ten years old. The corresponding figure
for tankers was 75 per cent. There has been a tendency for replacements to be
larger because big ships are more economical to run.
In 1965 there were four liners from British shipyards of 30,000 gross tons
and over operating on transatlantic passenger services: namely, the Queen
Elizabeth (83,673 g.t.), the Queen Mary (81,237 g.t.), the Mauretania (35,673
g.t.), and the Caronia (34,173 g.t.). The two largest liners to be built in Britain
in recent years, the Oriana (42,000 g.t.) and the Canberra (45,000 g.t.), came
into service in i960 and 1961 respectively on the services from Britain to
Australia and across the Pacific to North America. A new liner, of about
58,000 g.t., is to be built for the Cunard Company with financial aid from the
Government. In June 1964, 22 tankers of 50,000 d.w.t. and over were owned
and registered in Britain and of these, 4 were of 80,000 to 90,000 d.w.t.;
there were a further 29 tankers under construction, totalling 702,630 gross
tons, for registration in Britain.
The first British-built tanker of 100,000 d.w.t., the British Admiral, was
launched in March 1965.
Steam has continued to give place to the diesel engine, 51 per cent of all
tonnage being diesel-driven in 1964. The virtual disappearance of coal-fired
tonnage from the foreign-going fleet has been accompanied by a continued
fall in the amount of coal-fired tonnage in the coasting and home trade tramp
fleet.
In June 1964, 16-9 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons
and over were both owned and registered in Britain.1 The usual employment
of this fleet has been analysed by the United Kingdom Chamber of Shipping
as follows: 7-4 million gross tons were employed as ocean-going passenger
and cargo liners; 2-9 million gross tons as ocean-going tramps; 5-7 million
gross tons as ocean-going tankers; and 0-9 million gross tons in coasting and
trade with ports between the Elbe and Brest (home trades).
About half of British-owned shipping registered in the United Kingdom
consists of ocean-going passenger-cargo and cargo liners, mostly the latter.
Practically all these ships are owned by large liner companies or groups of
liner companies. Many of them operate wide networks of scheduled freight
and passenger services which, between them, cover every ocean. The 3 million
gross tons of ocean-going tramp ships are operated by a large number of
private owners, some of them having only a small number of ships and some
only one ship.
According to a survey published in 1959, the British shipping industry was
composed of some 270 companies, over half the tonnage being owned by
nine or ten main groups controlling about 50 companies. The many world-
famous British shipping lines operating services on international routes
include: the Cunard, to North America; the Royal Mail, to South America;
the Blue Funnel, to Australia and the Far East; the Peninsular and Oriental
(P. and 0.)-0rient and the British India lines, to India, Australia and the
Far East; the Union Castle, to South and East Africa; Elder Dempster, to
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft,
Admiralty vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries
(including over 1 million gross tons of tankers).

Over two-thirds of the total tanker fleet belong to the oil companies,
although there are a few important independent United Kingdom tanker¬
owning companies. A new type of specialised bulk carrier—the ore-carrier 
is in use on a substantial scale; some of the ore-carriers are partly owned by
companies in the steel industry, but are managed and operated by shipping
companies.
Since the end of the second world war shipowners have received no direct
financial assistance from the Government. For some years, however, the
Government has recognised that the shipping industry is faced with severe
competition from foreign shipping, some of which is operated with consider¬
able tax advantages. The investment allowance for capital expenditure on
the construction of new ships was raised to 40 per cent in 1957. (In other
industries there has been since 1962 an investment allowance of 30 per cent
plus an initial allowance of 10 per cent on plant and machinery.) To assist the
shipbuilding industry the Government introduced in 1963 a Shipbuilding
Credit Scheme, whereby £75 million has been made available to British ship-
owners, at government lending rates, for financing the building of ships in
British yards. Of this sum, a maximum of £17-6 million was allocated for the
new Cunard liner due to come into service on the transatlantic route in 1967.
The total of £75 million had been fully allocated by the end of 1963.

Organisations
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation (distinct from the Society of Lloyd’s, see
p. 417) which surveys and classifies ships with particular regard to their
safety and operational efficiency. It will accept responsibility for surveying
and giving technical advice on vessels of all flags from the initial stages of
building, at regular intervals during their service, and after casualties. A
satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an underwriter that he may
accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between the Register
and the Society of Lloyd’s.
The representative body speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for
the most part, owners of fishing vessels) is the Chamber of Shipping.
There are a number of local associations of shipowners centred around the
main port areas: for example, the Liverpool Steamship Owners' Association, the
Bristol Steamship Owners' Association, the London General Shipowners' Society,
and the North of England Shipowners' Association. Others represent companies
specialising in a particular trade or type of cargo.
The British Shippers' Council was formed in 1955 to represent the shipping
interests of exporters and importers in matters of both national and inter¬
national concern.
The Shipping Federation and the Employers' Association of the Port of Liverpool
are the employers’ organisations concerned with labour relations and the
regulation of employment throughout the Merchant Navy. They are res¬
ponsible for the administration of the Merchant Navy Established Service
Scheme, under which shipowners engaging crews for ships of 200 gross tons
and above engage them through the Merchant Navy Establishment Adminis¬
tration unless they are prepared to offer two-year Company Service contracts.
The Shipping Federation is also responsible for the day-to-day operation of

and as firemen.
Shipmasters are represented by the Mercantile Marine Service Association;
navigating officers, engineer officers, apprentices, cadets, pursers and ships’
surgeons by the Merchant Navy and Airline Officers' Association; and radio
officers by the Radio Officers' Union. Some uncertificated engineer officers are
represented by the Amalgamated Engineering Union. The interests of the deck,
engine-room and catering ratings are represented by the National Union of
Seamen.
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representa¬
tives of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations
of wages and conditions of service in the Merchant Navy, although, except
by special arrangement, National Maritime Board agreements do not apply
to vessels of under 200 gross tons, or to certain other ships, including tugs
and salvage vessels. Detailed working of the board is carried on by a number
of ‘panels’ representing the various interests of those forming the seafarers’
part of the board.
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in
a series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of
rates, and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential
principle of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight
rates or passenger fares from each port of departure. Each conference meets
from time to time to review and revise existing rates, or to compile new ones.
Some of the conferences are connected by rate agreements, or have joined
together to form wider groupings. There are over 60 conferences dealing
with trade to and from the United Kingdom.
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of
London’s seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest market
for the chartering of ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’
representatives meet here to arrange the chartering of dry-cargo tramp ships
for the carriage of goods to and from all parts of the world.
The Board of Trade is now the government department responsible for
most matters connected with merchant shipping; it took over this responsibility
from the Ministry of Transport in February 1965. Under the Merchant
Shipping Act of 1894 and subsequent legislation, it administers many
regulations for marine safety and welfare, for instance: certifying the load-
line (or Plimsoll line) that ensures that a ship is not overloaded; ensuring that
standards of safety are observed in ship construction; ensuring the provision
of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment; and dealing with
the discipline, professional standards, health and accommodation of seamen.
Most of the work which these responsibilities entail is carried out by the
officers of the Marine Survey and Mercantile Marine at the ports. There is
also a Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen in whose office at Cardiff
a complete record of all British ships and seamen is kept. The Board of Trade
is represented on the Merchant Navy Welfare Board and on the Merchant
Navy Training Board (see p. 362).
The Board of Trade fosters the development and use of modern naviga¬
tional aids. It arranges for the provision of space in merchant ships to meet
the sea transport needs of the armed forces and looks after ships that it owns

or has chartered. It is concerned with general shipping policy and the
strategic implications of the Merchant Navy; and it is also the sponsoring
department for the shipbuilding, ship repairing and marine engineering
industries.
Abroad, certain parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts, in particular those
provisions dealing with the engagement and discharge of crews outside the
United Kingdom, are administered by H.M. Consuls and by officers of
Commonwealth and Colonial Governments.
A Shipping Advisory Panel advises the President of the Board of Trade
on commercial and economic matters affecting the prosperity of British
shipping.
Britain is a party to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention
of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil which came into force in 1958. The nations
which have ratified this convention agree to prohibit their national fleets
from persistent discharging of oil within 50 miles of any coast and also in
extensive areas of the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and around Australia.
Amendments to the Convention were agreed at an international conference
held in London in 1962. British ships registered in the United Kingdom were
already prohibited from discharging oil within a wide zone of the sea around
the United Kingdom under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act 1955 (the
discharge of oil from any source into United Kingdom territorial waters and
harbours was first prohibited in 1922); a further Act was passed in 1963 giving
effect to the amendments agreed at the 1962 conference.
The Board of Trade administers the Coastguard Service. This is primarily a
life-saving organisation which keeps watch at danger points around the coast
for vessels in distress and renders assistance either by rocket life-saving
apparatus or by informing other authorities who may be able to give help.
There is close liaison between the Coastguard Service and the Royal National
Life-boat Institution. The latter maintains lifeboats and fast inshore rescue
boats around the coast of the United Kingdom; it is supported entirely by
voluntary contributions, and depends largely for its operation on voluntary
workers. From its foundation in 1824 t0 the end of 1964 the Royal National
Life-boat Institution saved 85,502 lives. Lifeboats and inshore rescue boats
were launched 1,167 times in 1964, and rescued 847 people.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel
Islands and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its
first Royal Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a Board
often Elder Brethren, elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.
Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of
the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses and the Commissioners of Irish
Lights.
Trinity House is also the chief pilotage authority, licensing some 750 pilots
in 41 districts in England and Wales, including London. In some cases the
harbour authority or local council is the pilotage authority. The Board of
Trade also has certain responsibilities in connection with lighthouses and
pilotage.
The number of masters, officers and men serving in December 1964 in
British ships on articles of agreement opened or closed in the United Kingdom
was 123,000. Masters and deck and engineer officers numbered 39,000 and
deck and engine-room ratings 37,000. There were 35,000 catering personnel,
nearly 6,000 apprentices and cadets and 3,000 radio officers.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies at
sea of apprentices and cadets who are preparing for their examinations for
certificates of competency as second mate.
The Board of Trade holds examinations for, and issues certificates of
competency to, ships’ officers as master, first mate and second mate of
foreign-going ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first-class
engineer and second-class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on
board ships in these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a higher,
certificate.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio¬
telegraphy issued by the Postmaster General on the results of an open
examination.
A seamen may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom
registered ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B., granted
by the Board of Trade, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain this certificate
a seaman must, among other qualifications, have served three years at sea on
deck, have obtained a certificate of efficiency as lifeboatman and have passed
a qualifying examination.
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of petty officer.
Service as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examina¬
tion for a second mate’s certificate.
Wages and conditions of employment are negotiated by the National Maritime
Board. Minimum wages and holidays with pay are guaranteed for both officers
and ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme,
introduced by the Board in 1947, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take
two-year contracts, not only with individual shipping companies but with
the industry as a whole, and get special benefits, in addition to the normal
unemployment insurance benefit, when they are ashore between voyages.
The Merchant Navy Welfare Board, on which are represented officers’ and
seamen’s unions and associations, shipowners, voluntary societies, the Board of
Trade, the Ministries of Labour, and Pensions and National Insurance, and
the Colonial Office, has been responsible since 1948 for the control and
co-ordination of the welfare services for merchant seamen in the United
Kingdom and of British merchant seamen abroad.
There are over 300 ports in Britain. It is estimated that 144 million tons of
imports, including 76 million tons of petroleum and petroleum products,
passed through the ports in 1964, and 37 million tons of exports and
re-exports, including 7 million tons of coal.
Under the provisions of the Harbours Act 1964, the National Ports Council
was set up as a statutory body (it had originally been established in the previous
year as a non-statutory body). The functions of the Council are primarily
advisory, and the executive powers needed to enforce its recommendations
are vested in the Minister of Transport. The Council’s main task is to
formulate comprehensive plans for the modernisation of harbour facilities
in Great Britain, but any harbour development schemes of a substantial
nature have first to be authorised by the Minister. The intention is that ports
should operate as commercial undertakings and be self-sufficient but the Act
does provide, however, for government financial assistance, mainly in the
form of loans at market rates, though grants may be given in exceptional
circumstances.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
363
The Minister of Transport may confirm schemes, whether suggested to
him by the National Ports Council or by individual harbour authorities, for
placing under one authority functions which are at present discharged by a
number of authorities (and possibly other bodies and persons) in a group of
harbours.
The Port of London, with 92 miles of waterway and over 4,000 acres of
dock estate, including 42 miles of quayage, is the largest port in the Common¬
wealth and, with New York and Rotterdam, is one of the three largest ports
in the world. Goods of every kind, from meat to marble, from plywood to
perfume, pass through the docks; over 61 million tons of cargo were handled
in the year ending in March 1964. Imports are distributed all over the United
Kingdom, though the port supplies, primarily, Greater London and the home
counties. The Thames Navigation Service, operating from Gravesend,
provides navigational surveillance and information, by means of radar and
radio telephone and other methods, for vessels between the estuary and
London Bridge.
Liverpool is the second largest port and the major export cargo outlet of
the Lnited Kingdom. The port handles one-sixth of Britain’s grain imports
and has one of the largest grain-handling plants in Europe. There are tobacco
warehouses with a capacity of 200,000 casks and, for wool imports, a warehouse
with a capacity of 60,000 bales. In 1964, 9 million tons of imports (excluding
petroleum and cattle) passed through the port. Full use of the new terminal
at Tranmere raised imports of oil from under a million tons in i960 to 7-8
million tons in 1964) aud crude oil is now the major commodity entering the
port of Liverpool. In 1948 the Harbour Board was the first in the world to
install radar to cover its sea channels.
Manchester is an inland port, access to which is by the Manchester Ship
Canal. Petroleum is both the main import and export. At Eastham is the
largest oil dock in the United Kingdom, covering 19 acres.
Southampton is the chief port for ocean passenger traffic, and the principal
port for imports of deciduous and citrus fruits. Southampton’s value as a
port is enhanced by its deep water, double tides and its easy access to London.
A considerable volume of oil for the refinery at Fawley (see p. 284) is handled.
Newcastle upon Tyne and the other Tyne ports serve the industrial north¬
east of England and comprise the most important coal-shipping and largest
ship repairing centre in the country.
Hull, on the Humber estuary, serves particularly the industrial centres of
Yorkshire and the Midlands, and is one of the largest white fish ports in
the world. Other imports are grain, timber and oil.
Tees ports are one of the largest centres for importing iron ore and for
exporting steel and engineering products.
Swansea has the largest trade of the group of ports serving South Wales.
As well as coal, Swansea exports the steel and tinplate manufactured in its
immediate neighbourhood. It is also an important oil port.
Newport (Monmouthshire) is one of Britain’s principal ore-importing
centres.
Bristol and nearby Avonmouth serve the industrial Midlands as well as the
city of Bristol itself, and also have a large coastal trade. About 7|- million tons
of cargo are handled annually, including a quarter of Britain’s banana imports
and one-fifth of its tobacco imports. There are also extensive oil installations.
Glasgow, the principal Scottish port, serves as an entrepot centre for the
industrial area of central Scotland, and is the principal outlet for exports of
Scotch whisky.

Ownership
Grangemouth, Scotland’s second port, is associated particularly with oil
and timber.
Leith is the port of the city of Edinburgh. The chief import is grain and
the main export coal from the Lothian coalfields.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and handles the main
traffic across the Irish Sea.
Other major ports are Imrningham, with an important trade in chemicals,
coal and petroleum, Cardiff, for iron ore, petroleum and general traffics,
and Milford Haven for oil.
The National Ports Council’s first studies have been concerned with harbour
facilities in the Firth of Forth, South Wales and at Bristol. In July 1965 the
Council recommended to the Minister of Transport an interim development
plan costing about £150 million for the urgent development and improvement
of 14 ports. It advised that 70 new berths should be built and about 46 existing
berths be renovated. This would raise annual capital expenditure by 1968 to
^40 million. (It has averaged about £23 million in recent years.) Among the
most important projects in 1964 were a new dry dock, quay and tanker-cleaning
installation at Greenock, Firth of Clyde (^4 million); improvements
to the oil basin in Avonmouth Docks at Bristol (nearly ffl million); and
reconstruction of the St. Katharine Dock House in London (£1 million). A
new dry dock at Glasgow and improvements to the Tilbury Docks in London,
including two new deep-water berths, were completed in 1965 at a cost of
jTi-3 million and ff> million respectively. A £5 million improvement scheme
for Hull Docks and a £6 million scheme for Leith are in hand, as is a £1-5
million scheme for a new cargo and passenger terminal at Southampton Docks.
Since 1948 about a third of the total port capacity has been in public owner¬
ship; the British Transport Docks Board (see p. 368) owns the majority,
which includes Southampton, Hull, Immingham, Cardiff and Swansea.
Certain ports and docks used largely for the cross-channel services of the
railways are administered by the British Railways Board: examples of these are
Folkestone, Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and Parkeston Quay (at Harwich).
In 1964 shipping arrivals and departures at British Transport docks, at
which 11,500 were employed at the end of that year, totalled 91 million net
registered tons (including fishing vessels), and the total cargo handled was
about 55 million tons.
Other ports are controlled by public trusts on which are represented users
of the port (such as shippers, importers and shipping companies) and other
bodies, such as local authorities. Examples are London (controlled by the
Port of London Authority), Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour Board),
and Belfast (Belfast Harbour Commissioners).
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the main,
set down in private Acts of Parliament. A model set of clauses dealing with
many of the details is set out in the Harbours, Docks and Piers Act 1847.
Most ports are represented on the Dock and Harbour Authorities' Associa¬
tion, formed in 1917 to represent the common interests of port authorities
in their relations with government, shipowners and traders.
There are about 120,000 people employed in the operation of ports in the
United Kingdom. Just under half of these are administrative, clerical and
technical staff, and pilots, lightermen and customs officials. Over half are the
dock workers (popularly called ‘dockers’) who do the physical handling of cargo.

Shipping arrivals and departures do not all conform to a regular schedule,
with the result that there is sometimes too much work for the dock workers
available, sometimes too little. Dock labour was therefore largely casual
labour until 1941, when war-time schemes were introduced to control the
port registers of employers and workers. The war-time arrangements were
superseded in 1947 by a permanent scheme administered by the National
Dock Labour Board, which consists of a chairman, vice-chairman, and eight
members appointed by the Minister of Labour, four to represent employers
and four to represent employees. Workers on the Board’s registers now
receive a guaranteed minimum wage for attendance, even when there is no
work available. A committee of inquiry was set up by the Government in
October 1964 to inquire into labour relations in the docks; its report (the
Devlin report) recommended complete ‘decasualisation’ and a reduction in
the number of port employers.
Most of the oil tankers coming to the United Kingdom to discharge crude
oil are berthed at special tanker terminals which are near the oil refineries
and are owned and operated by the oil companies. The maximum deadweight
tonnage of tankers that some of the most important terminals can accommodate
at present is: Finnart (West of Scotland) 100,000; Isle of Grain (Thames
estuary) 42,000; Coryton (London) 45,000; Tilbury Reach (London) 47,000;
Thames Haven (London) 60,000; Tranmere (Liverpool) 65,000; Milford
Haven (Pembroke) 100,000; and Fawley (Southampton) 90,000. Long
pipelines connect Finnart with the refinery at Grangemouth on the Firth of
Forth, and Angle Bay (Milford Haven) with the refinery at Llandarcy (near
Swansea).
New terminals for crude oil are being built at Milford Haven, at the Isle of
Grain and on the river Tees, whilst the capacity of existing terminals on the
Tyne and the Thames is being increased by dredging.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The dense passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain1 is carried mainly
by road and rail, although coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, inland
waterways are important in carrying certain types of freight, particularlv
bulk cargoes.
Part of the inland transport system of Great Britain is nationalised; namely,
the railways, passenger transport in the London area, certain road haulage
and road passenger services, most of the inland waterways and some of the
vessels on them. Many local authorities and private firms run road passenger
services, while road haulage is largely, and coastal shipping entirely, in the
hands of private enterprise.
Table 22 gives comparative figures relating to the carrying activities of the
nationalised transport undertakings in Great Britain. At the end of 1964 the
nationalised sector owned 14 per cent of the 97,000 public road passenger
vehicles and over 2 per cent of the 1,635,000 road goods vehicles in use.
British Railways and Road Services and London Transport were responsible
f°r 43 Per cent of the 13,737 million passenger journeys made in public
passenger vehicles in 1964. In the same year there were 8-25 million motor
cars and i-8 million motor cycles, scooters and mopeds licensed for use on the
roads.

1947-56
A sample survey of goods transport by road was made by the Ministry
of Transport in 1962. It showed that 81 per cent of the total tonnage carried
in that year (estimated at 1,540 million tons) went by road, while in terms of
ton-mileage1 the proportion was 55 per cent. The railways accounted for
15 per cent of all tonnage carried and 26^ per cent of the ton-mileage. The
proportions for coastal shipping were per cent and 18 per cent, and for
inland waterways slightly less than 1 per cent of the total tonnage. A previous
survey in 1958 had already shown that road transport had become the major
means of inland carriage of goods whatever unit of measurement was used.
In terms of ton-mileage, transport by road exceeded that by rail for the
first time in 1955; three years later it was responsible for 47 per cent of the
total ton-mileage (against 35 per cent for rail) and a further expansion resulted
in it accounting for over half the total in 1959.
The rapid growth of private and commercial motor traffic, causing congestion
problems of increasing severity, especially in cities and towns, and the changing
pattern of demand for transport services have led the Government to under¬
take a series of long-term studies of probable trends in transport and problems
which may arise therefrom. A survey of needs for inland transport facilities
over the next 20 years (the Hall report, published in March 1963) envisaged
an annual rate of increase in total traffic of 4 to 5 per cent; a large rise in
ownership of private cars by 1980; and a further switch of goods traffic from
rail to road. A systematic assessment of the future of the railway system was
also published in the same month (the Beeching report) and supplemented by
a further report in February 1965. Early in 1965 an inquiry was instituted by
the Minister of Transport into the best means of co-ordinating and develop¬
ing, in the national interest, the public transport of goods and passengers in
Britain.
The study group set up to make an independent report on the long-term
problems of traffic in urban areas issued its report (the Buchanan report) in
November 1963. It estimated that Britain would have 40 million vehicles on
its roads by a.d. 2010 and proposed radical measures to rebuild and adapt
cities and roads to handle the growth of traffic. The Minister of Transport
appointed a small transport advisory council in 1965 to assist him on policy
matters generally, including the implementation of the Buchanan report and
the many problems connected with transport in the large conurbations.
Comprehensive transport surveys of the large conurbations are being made
or will be made by the Government.
The present role and structure of the nationalised transport undertakings are
the result of a series of legislative measures passed over the last 18 years.
On 1st January, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the Transport
Act of 1947, the British Transport Commission (BTC) came into being and
assumed control of Britain’s railways, all railway-owned steamships, docks,
hotel and road transport interests, most of the country’s canals (including all
those owned by the railways), certain rivers (as navigation authority) and the
whole of the London passenger transport system. In addition, the BTC
was to arrange for the gradual acquisition of privately owned long-distance
road haulage firms. Road passenger transport outside London was not taken

over, but the BTC was given powers to prepare area schemes for co-ordinating
passenger services by road and rail, including power to acquire road passenger
undertakings for this purpose. A considerable amount of road haulage,
several waterways and many docks were left outside the Commission’s scope.
The Conservative Government which took office in 1951 announced a new
policy for the operation of public transport, including decentralisation of the
railway administration, greater freedom to adopt normal commercial practice
(particularly in charging), the partial return of long-distance road haulage to
private enterprise, and the revocation of the Commission’s power to make
schemes for the co-ordination of road and rail passenger services. The policy
was put into effect by the Transport Act of 1953, and the actual reorganisation
of the BTC was completed by 1st January, 1955. A further Act, the Transport
(Disposal of Road Haulage Property) Act 1956, provided for the completion
of the denationalisation of road haulage.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The British Transport Commission (whose members were appointed by and
responsible to the Minister of Transport) was a policy-making and not a
managing body. Management functions were carried out by seven divisions,
corresponding to various activities, namely: British Railways, British Road
Services, the Tilling Bus Group, the Scottish Omnibus Group, British
Transport Docks, British Waterways, and British Transport Hotels and
Catering Services.
The London Transport Executive was established by the Transport Act,
1947, as an agent of the BTC to operate road passenger transport and the
underground railways in the London area.
The BTC was required to submit an annual report and statement of
accounts to the Minister, who laid it before Parliament. The Commission
was under obligation to cover its outgoings, taking one year with another,
but during the period of railway modernisation it was permitted to carry
forward the deficits arising on British Railways. Meanwhile, in order to meet
financial needs during the critical years of reconstruction, the Government,
under the Transport (Railway Finances) Act 1957, and the Transport
(Borrowing Powers) Act 1959, was empowered to make repayable advances
to the Commission of up to £400 million to meet the annual revenue deficits
until 1962. From the financial year 1960-61 these deficits were met by the
Exchequer from revenue and are not repayable advances. The Commission’s
ordinary borrowing powers (i.e. excluding those to meet deficits) had been
limited to £1,200 million.
The Transport Act 1962 gave effect to the Government’s policy, set out
in the White Paper on the Reorganisation of the Nationalised Transport
Undertakings. The Government concluded that the activities of the British
Transport Commission were so large and diverse that they could not be run
effectively as a single undertaking. The commercial capacity of the railways
was circumscribed by outmoded statutory obligations and restrictions on
their trading operations. Mounting deficits, the size of the capital debt in
relation to the earning capacity of the assets and the increasing burden of
interest as modernisation proceeded, were detrimental to the morale of
railwaymen, to financial control, and to hopes of recovery. The Government
therefore proposed that each of the main activities of the Commission should
be managed by a separate board, holding its own assets and responsible for
its own capital debt.
The Transport Act 1962 dissolved the BTC1 and set up four boards for
British Railways, London Transport, British Transport Docks and British
Waterways, each of which is responsible directly to the Minister of Transport,
who appoints the members. Road passenger and haulage undertakings, such
as British Road Services, the Tilling Bus Group, the Scottish Omnibus
Group, Road Freight Shipping Services, Thomas Cook and Son and other
holdings, are operated as companies incorporated under the Companies Act,
with their own boards; they are grouped under a Transport Holding Company,
responsible to the Minister of Transport, who appoints its directors. The hotel
property of the BTC was transferred to British Transport Hotels Ltd., a wholly
owned subsidiary, first of the BTC and later of the British Railways Board.
The cross-channel shipping services operated by British Railways and
certain ports and docks used for them passed to the British Railways Board.
1 The BTC remained in existence until 1st January, 1964, to facilitate the transfer of
its foreign assets to the new boards.

Each board is required to conduct its business so as to pay its way, taking
one year with another, and to set up general reserves. The Railways Board
and the British Waterways Board may receive financial assistance from the
Exchequer for five years from vesting date. All the boards may borrow up to
specified limits from the Minister with the approval of the Treasury. The
Act facilitates operations on a commercial basis by conferring on the boards
powers to sell or develop their land and to construct and operate pipelines,
and by freeing them from controlled charges schemes. Except for railway
passenger fares in the London Passenger Transport area, certain harbour
charges and road passenger fares in an area including London, the boards
are free to fix the rates charged for their services. The boards are also released
from common carrier obligations as regards carriage by rail or inland waterway.
The Treasury assumed responsibility for outstanding British Transport
stock (amounting to about ^1,450 million), so that interest on this debt is
now met out of taxation instead of the BTC’s receipts. The Treasury
also became responsible for Exchequer advances for capital purposes, which
amounted to about ^690 million by the end of 1962, and for about £300
million lent to the BTC since 1957 to meet revenue deficits. Altogether, the
community as a whole took over liabilities for debt amounting to about
£2,440 million.
A Nationalised Transport Advisory Council of up to twelve members advises
the Minister on questions relating to the co-ordination, or any other aspect,
of the nationalised transport undertakings. At present the Minister presides
over the council.
The Transport Tribunal, set up under the 1947 Act, had jurisdiction over
the charges schemes governing maximum charges which the British Transport
Commission could make in respect of all its activities save road services. It
could also hear appeals arising from applications for road haulage (goods
vehicles) licences. Under the 1962 Act, the tribunal sits in two divisions, one
having jurisdiction over London rail and road fares and the other continuing
to hear appeals relating to road carriers’ licences.
The 1947 Ac* set UP a structure of Area Transport Users’ Consultative Com¬
mittees which could consider criticisms of nationalised transport services and
suggestions made for improving them. The Area Committees sent their
findings to the Central Transport Consultative Committee which could make
formal recommendations. Where it did so, the Minister had power to give
directions to the BTC. The committees continue under the 1962 Act, with
some changes in functions and membership. In particular, they have been
given a principal role in a new statutory procedure which the Railways Board
and the London 1 ransport Board have to follow when they want to close a
railway passenger service. When a closure is proposed, the area committee
concerned considers objections from users and reports to the Minister on any
hardship which is likely to arise. The Minister considers the area committee’s
report and decides whether, bearing in mind all the issues involved, he should
consent to the closure.
The main features of the previous safeguards for coastal shipping were that a
complaint might be made on behalf of coastal shipping to the Transport
Tribunal if charges made or proposed by the railways in competition with
coastal shipping placed coastal carriers at an unfair disadvantage, or were in¬
adequate in relation to the cost of the service provided. The 1962 Act provides
that complaints of this kind can be made to the Minister.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain was the pioneer of railways. The opening of the Stockton to Darlington
Railway in 1825, and of the Liverpool and Manchester line in 1830, when
George Stephenson’s famous ‘Rocket’ locomotive was used, began a century
of widespread railway development. The great period of railway building
was from 1840 to 1875, with a short lull following the collapse of the specula¬
tive railway boom in 1846.
During the first world war, the railways came under centralised govern¬
ment direction through a Railway Executive Committee. This experience
emphasised the need for concentration and a reorganisation of the whole
rail system. The Railways Act of 1921 amalgamated some 130 private
companies into four large regional groups: the London, Midland and Scottish;
London and North Eastern; Great Western; and Southern. In the 1920s and
193 os the railways suffered from the prolonged industrial depression and the
growing competition from road transport. The causes of road competition were
twofold: first, motor transport often offered cheaper and better facilities;
secondly, the statutory regulation of the railways’ charging system resulted in
the loss of some lucrative traffic and the forced retention of unprofitable traffic.
In 1938 the railways made proposals for relief from statutory regulation of
charges, but the outbreak of war in 1939 postponed action and the railways
again became controlled by the Government; at the end of the war the
railways were returned to the control of the regional groups for a brief period.
The Transport Act of 1947 brought the railways under public ownership as
a single enterprise, British Railways. It was grouped in six regional sub¬
divisions and operated under the overall management of a Railway Executive
established as the agent of the BTC.
The 1953 Transport Act abolished the Railway Executive and provided
for decentralisation of the administration. The operation of British Railways
was placed in the hands of six area boards (the areas corresponding with the
former regions). The general manager of each board was responsible for
day-to-day management but matters affecting general policy were reserved
to the Transport Commission.
It became clear, however, that even under this arrangement the organ¬
isation of the Commission, with responsibility for diverse transport
undertakings, was too unwieldy. The Transport Act 1962 therefore set up
a new board—the British Railways Board—with sole responsibility for
managing railway affairs. Under the Act the railways were also relieved of
much of their burden of accumulated debt and were given freedom to alter
their charges at will, except for passenger fares in the London area. The
Board came into existence on 1st January, 1963. Its responsibilities for the
operation of the various parts of the system are delegated to six regional
boards.
Statistics relating to the operations and traffic revenue of British Railways are
given in Table 22. The process of rationalisation arising from changing public
transport requirements is reflected in the reduction of over 2,300 miles of
standard-gauge route since 1961. A total of 928 million passenger journeys was
made and 240 million tons of freight traffic conveyed on British Railways in
1964. Traffic revenue increased, partly owing to increases in fares and freight
charges.
At the end of 1964 British Transport Hotels Ltd. (which provides all
catering facilities on British Railways’ trains) managed 35 hotels and refresh¬
ment rooms at 235 stations. In addition, fwo hotels and refreshment rooms
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 371
at 68 stations were operated by tenants. Gross receipts for 1964 were £25-5
million.
Development Because of the economic difficulties of the early 1930s, the strain of the war
Capital Expenditure years, and the numerous post-war claims on national resources, for many
years it had not been possible for the railways to carry out any large modern¬
isation schemes or to maintain an adequate replacement programme. However,
in I955> the BTC produced a modernisation plan which was designed to trans¬
form virtually all the services offered by the railways. Since then the plan has
been modified in the light of ensuing economic and technical developments.
Some £1,100 million was invested in British Railways and their associated
activities in the eight years 1955-63, and capital expenditure is still substantial,
amounting to £108 million in 1964.
Progress in On main lines in 1955 there were about 18,000 steam, 7 main line diesel
Modernisation and 71 electric locomotives. At the end of 1964 the corresponding figures
were 4>97° steam, 2,458 diesel and 198 electric locomotives. In addition,
there were 4>I07 diesel and 6,980 electric passenger-carrying multiple units.
The phase of railway modernisation represented by the diesel multiple unit
was completed by 1961; no more are expected to be needed.
Passenger services have continued to improve as steam is replaced by
electric or diesel traction. The replacement of out-of-date passenger coaches
by new stock, with improved amenities, continues and diesel electric de luxe
trains are in operation on routes from London to Manchester and elsewhere.
The efficiency of freight services is being improved as new and modern
type freight vehicles come into service and as facilities become available for
concentrating freight traffic at fewer and better equipped and better sited
marshalling yards and terminals. For example, a new £6 million marshalling
yard has been opened at Sheffield. This yard is capable of sorting wagons
quickly for the 130 different destinations for which traffic passing through the
area requires to be marshalled. Many other new freight facilities, such as the
marshalling yard at Lamesley and the new central goods depot on Tyneside,
which together cost over £5 million, are in use.
The installation of modern colour-light signalling, coupled with the
installation of either electro-mechanical or power-operated signal boxes and
the rapid extension of the automatic warning system, is enabling faster and
more frequent trains to be run with a greater degree of safety. Schemes are in
hand, costing about £% million, for the complete modernisation of signalling
on the main line between London and Didcot (an important junction in
Berkshire) and on the South Wales main line between Cardiff and Port Talbot.
Electric and Diesel One of the most important suburban electrification schemes carried out is
Traction that of the Glasgow central lines (‘Blue Train service’) at a cost of nearly
£13 million. The extension of the Southern Region’s electrification of the line
to the Kent coast at a cost of over £20 million has been completed.
Electrification of the London Midland Region’s lines from London (Euston)
via Crewe to Liverpool, costing about £175 million (including the cost of
rolling-stock and works such as overhead equipment, signalling improvements
and station modernisation), will be completed by the end of 1965.
Reorganisation In spite of the considerable injection of new capital over the period 1955-62
British Railways incurred a steadily increasing overall deficit (including
interest charges), which rose to a peak of more than £150 million in 1962.
The new Railways Board was given the task of preparing a scheme for re¬
organising the railways in such a way that they could be run as a commercially
372
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

ROADS
viable undertaking. In March 1963 a Report on the Reshaping of British Railways
(‘Beeching Report’) was published and was accepted in principle by the
Government. Its proposals include the withdrawal of passenger services from
about a third of the country’s railway system. (These little-used lines carry
only 1 per cent of the total passenger traffic.) Before any passenger service is
withdrawn there must be provision for any objectors to state their case against
closure and a final decision must be given by the Minister of Transport.
Other important proposals are for the improvement of inter-city passenger
services, with the emphasis on speed, reliability and comfort; the introduction
of express freight services (‘liner trains’) to link all the main industrial areas,
increased mechanisation in the carrying of coal (the railways’ most profitable
traffic); and the continuing replacement of steam by diesel and electric
traction. A further report, The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes,
was published in February 1965.
Although many of the changes foreshadowed in the plan have not yet had
time to have any significant effect on the railways’ financial results, there was
a reduction in 1964 by £15 million to ^67 million in the railway operating
deficit, the result mainly of economies and increases in efficiency.
Early in 1964 the British and French Governments agreed in principle to the
construction of a rail Channel Tunnel (either a bored tunnel or an immersed
tube). The cost is estimated at £160 million (at 1962 prices) and the time for
completion six years from the start of work. The preliminary geological
survey to determine the line of the tunnel is expected to be completed at the
end of 1965.
The advent of the motor vehicle made it necessary for the Government to
set up a central road authority; accordingly, the Road Board was established
by the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act of 1909. In 1919
the Board’s responsibilities were taken over by the newly established Ministry
of Transport.
In April 1964 Great Britain had 199,740 miles of public highway. There
were 285 miles of motorway, 8,342 miles of trunk roads, 19,822 miles of
Class I roads, 17,626 miles of Class II roads, 48,982 miles of Class III roads
and 104,678 miles of unclassified roads. Roads are classified according to
their traffic value, those of purely local traffic importance remaining un¬
classified. On maps and signposts the trunk and Class I roads can usually
be identified by the letter ‘A’ in front of a route number, and Class II roads
by a letter ‘B’. Trunk roads are the main arteries of national traffic and the
whole cost of their upkeep is met from Exchequer funds. The Minister of
Transport is the highway authority for trunk roads in England and Wales
and on these roads he administers expenditure, which is provided wholly
from central government sources, although for many purposes he employs
local authorities as his agents. The highway authority for Class I, Class II
and Class III roads is, in general, the council of the county or county borough
in whose area the roads lie. The Minister makes grants towards approved
expenditure on construction and major improvement of these roads at the rate
of 75, 60 or 50 per cent accounting to the class of road. (Classified roads include
nearly all the main streets of the large cities.) The Secretary of State for
Scotland has corresponding responsibilities for roads in Scotland. Unclassified
roads are entirely the responsibility of the local authority in whose area they lie.
Development While it was impossible for several years immediately following the second
world war to spend much more on the roads than was required for their
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
373
essential maintenance, a large and steadily expanding road-building pro¬
gramme has now been in progress since 1955. Annual outlay on motorways,
trunk roads and classified roads is expected nearly to double during the
period 1965-70. Public investment on new construction and major improve¬
ments is planned to amount to some £1,000 million during the next five years,
including about £150 million from resources of the local authorities. A
substantial part of central government expenditure will be in the form of
grants to local authorities for work on classified roads, mainly in urban areas.
The current programme includes Britain s first motorways, constructed for
the use of limited classes of traffic under the powers granted to the ministers
by the Special Roads Act 1949 (consolidated in the Highways Act 1959).
The motorways form part of a programme designed to provide a national
network of modern through routes. At the same time, work done under this
programme will eliminate the worst bottlenecks in urban areas and thus give
free outlets from the big cities and from other main sources of traffic to the
trunk routes.
It is planned that 1,000 miles of motorways should be completed by the
early 1970s. At the end of July 1965, 358^ miles had been opened for traffic and
construction had started, or tenders had been invited, for a further 140 miles.
The lines of a further 218 miles had been fixed and draft schemes been
published for a further 138 miles. It is probable that 600 miles of motorway will
be in use by 1968-69 and the map on p. 374 shows the planned motorway
system. Among the motorways in Great Britain open to traffic or under
construction in July 1965 were:
Mi—London to Yorkshire (Leeds). The projected length of this motorway
is about 190 miles, of which 100 miles, providing a link between London,
Birmingham and Leicestershire, have been opened to traffic in the last
six years. Construction of the 12-mile section from Markfield (Leicester¬
shire) to the river Trent is due to be completed by the end of 1965. Work
was under way in 1965 on a further 47! miles north of the river Trent and
on an 8|-mile extension southwards into London.
M2—Medway motorway, London to Dover. The 26 miles of this motorway
came into use in 1963.
M4—London to South Wales. The projected length of this road, which
will link London with Newport, is 140 miles. In the east, 24! miles are in
use from Chiswick to Maidenhead, including a one-mile spur to London
Airport. Under construction in the west are 20 miles of road from Newport
(Monmouthshire) to Tormarton (Gloucestershire) and a £9 million bridge
over the Severn.
M5 Birmingham to Bristol. Of this 117-mile motorway reaching to East
Brent (20 miles beyond Bristol), the first 26 miles running south from
Birmingham were opened in July 1962. There will be a connection with the
M4 north of Bristol. The 21^-mile Ross Spur (M50), opened in i960, links
the M5 with the existing road system leading from Ross-on-Wye
(Herefordshire) to South Wales.
M6—Birmingham to Carlisle. The projected length of this road is 172
miles, of which no miles, linking Dunston (north of Birmingham) with
Lancaster, are open to traffic. It includes the 8|-mile Preston bypass, the
first section of motorway, opened in 1958. A system of motorway links will
connect this road at its southern end with the Mi and M5; the first stage
of work on the latter link should be ready by the end of 1965.

In Scotland about 73 miles of motonvays are planned over five years. They
include motorways between Glasgow and Edinburgh, Edinburgh and Stirling,
and a 16-mile section southwards on the Glasgow-Carlisle route. The first
section of the Glasgow to Edinburgh motorway was completed in 1965.
Other Roads Notable schemes for improving existing trunk roads include those for the
Great North Road (Ai) between London and Newcastle, of which 175 miles
of dual carriageway, several sections built to motorway standards, are already
open, including a ten-mile bypass of Darlington opened in 1965. Improvements
on the A40 route, linking London with Gloucester and South Wales via
Oxford, include a 13^-mile bypass around High Wycombe, in Buckingham¬
shire, built to motorway standards.
In Scotland the trunk roads in the central belt and to Carlisle, where
industrial traffic is greatest, are to be improved to provide dual carriage¬
ways. Over 50 miles of the Glasgow-Carlisle route have so far been
reconstructed.
Bridges and Tunnels The largest bridge building programme in Britain for over a century is in
progress. The £2-3 million Medway Bridge, which is part of M2 and one of
the largest prestressed concrete structures of its kind in the world, was com¬
pleted in 1963 and the new suspension bridge across the Firth of Forth, the
main span of which is the largest of its kind in Europe, was opened in 1964.
The Severn Bridge, whose main span is nearly as long as that of the Forth
Bridge, is due for completion in 1966 to be followed in 1967 by a 7,000 ft.
bridge across the Firth of Tay.
The second Blackwall Tunnel (under the Thames), which is expected to
cost £6-5 million, is nearing completion and the £12-6 million Tyne Tunnel
between Wallsend (Northumberland) and Jarrow (Durham) is planned to be
in use by early 1967. The first Whiteinch Tunnel (under the Clyde) was
completed in 1963 and the second in 1964. The £ii million Dartford-Purfleet
tunnel (under the Thames) has been open to traffic since the end of 1963.
Research Research on roads is carried out at the Road Research Laboratory (see p. 205).
Its aims are to find more economical ways of designing, constructing and
maintaining roads and of facilitating the flow of traffic on them and to reduce
road accidents. The layout of roads, their traffic, the safety features of road
vehicles and the behaviour of road users are investigated, and new methods,
materials and processes are developed for building roads and providing them
with a smooth, safe and durable surface. The Laboratory has a Tropical
Section, which undertakes research and advice on road problems overseas.
At the end of 1964 there were 12-25 million motor vehicles licensed to use
Great Britain’s roads. Of these, 1 • 5 million were goods vehicles and 1 million
were public road passenger vehicles (i.e. buses and taxicabs).
The first world war greatly stimulated the development of motor vehicles
and road transport began to make itself felt as a serious competitor of the
railways. The first step towards government regulation of public road
transport was the passing of the London Traffic Act of 1924, which gave the
Minister of Transport power to control the number of buses and their
journeys in London; this was followed, in 1933, by the setting up of the
London Passenger Transport Board (see p. 381).
The Road Traffic Act 1930 ended the licensing of public service vehicles
(i.e. buses and coaches) by local authorities and set up instead traffic areas,
of which there are now eleven, covering the whole country and each under

the control of three traffic commissioners (except for the London metropolitan
area, which has one) appointed by the Minister. The commissioners regulate,
by means of a licensing system, all public road passenger transport services,
and they sanction routes and time-tables in order to secure proper co-ordina¬
tion of services and eliminate unnecessary competition; they may also control
fares. Competing operators and local authorities are entitled to raise objections
concerning applications to the commissioners for new licences or the renewal
of existing licences and to appeal to the Minister of Transport against the
commissioners’ decisions.
The Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933, based upon the recommendations of
the Royal Commission and of an experts’ report (the Salter report) of 1932,
established a system of licensing for road haulage vehicles, which is still in
operation, designed to restrict vehicle operations to proved needs and to
eliminate wasteful competition. A licence has to be secured from the licensing
authority (the chairman of the appropriate body of traffic commissioners)
before a goods vehicle can be used on the road. There are three types of
licence: the ‘A’ licence for general public haulage; the ‘B’ licence for public
haulage limited to certain goods or certain areas and covering also the
carriage of the licensee’s own goods; and the ‘C’ licence for the carriage by
traders solely of their own goods. Applications for ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences are
examined by the licensing authorities to see if they are necessary in view of
existing transport services, and competitors may raise objections. There is
a right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal against the decision of the
licensing authorities. The ‘C’ licence is granted on application, as of right.
All goods vehicle operators are bound by regulations concerning the fitness and
loading of vehicles, the movements of large vehicles likely to obstruct traffic,
the keeping of records, and driving hours and rest periods of their employees.
The main licensing provisions contained in the Road Traffic Act 1930, and
the Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933, as subsequently amended, were con¬
solidated in the Road Traffic Act i960.
Under the Transport Act 1947, the BTC took over ‘A’ and ‘B’ hauliers
predominantly engaged on long-distance haulage; vehicles operating under
‘C’ licences and those used for carrying certain specialised traffic were not
affected. After the change of Government in 1951, the Transport Act of
1953 required the BTC to dispose of the bulk of its road haulage undertaking.
In 1956 this process was halted by the Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage
Property) Act, which enabled the Commission to retain under its control
more vehicles than were permitted under the 1953 Act. Altogether, the
Commission disposed of 20,000 vehicles.
From September 1956 British Road Services (BRS) were a division of the
Commission and conducted their business through the medium of five
companies, which together owned about 16,000 vehicles: British Road Services
Ltd. (general haulage); BRS (Pickfords) Ltd. (special traffic and some
contracts); BRS (Contracts) Ltd.; BRS (Parcels) Ltd.; and BRS (Meat
Haulage) Ltd. All the companies’ vehicles are subject to the licensing system.
Under the Transport Act 1962, these organisations have been operating
(since January 1963) as companies incorporated under the Companies Act,
with their own boards. They are grouped together under the Transport
Holding Company, responsible to the Minister of Transport.
The number of licensed vehicles in the road goods transport industry rose
from 1 million in 1954 to i-6 million in 1964. The percentages with ‘C’
licences were 84 in 1954 and 87 in 1964 (1,312,000 vehicles). Of the

other 208,000 vehicles, with ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences, about 16,000 are operated
by British Road Services and the rest are operated by some 46,000 hauliers.
There are only a few operators with large fleets of vehicles in any of the
licence categories. ‘C licence vehicles include a large number of small
vehicles used locally in the delivery of groceries and other goods. Other vehicles
in this class are engaged in long-distance carriage of traders’ own goods. A
sample survey made by the Traders Road Transport Association in 1958
indicated that ‘C’ licence operators with fleets of over 100 vehicles were
probably fewer than 3 per cent of the total number of operators, but accounted
for over half the ‘C’ licence vehicles in use in the country.
In October 1963 the Minister of Transport appointed an independent
committee of inquiry (the Geddes Committee) to examine the licensing system
for road haulage and to make recommendations. It reported (Report of
the Committee on Carriers' Licensing) in June 1965 and recommended the
abolition of the present licensing system. The Committee proposed instead a
system of permits to ply as a carrier of goods, whether for hire or for the
carriage of a trader’s own goods. These permits would be available on
demand, without restriction, but subject to withdrawal if prescribed safety
standards for goods vehicles were not observed.
With the exception of the London transport system which is operated by the
London Transport Board, road passenger transport in Great Britain is run
by about 5>000 operators, 95 of them being local authorities owning and
operating urban bus and trolleybus services. About 4,700 are independent
operators of coaches and, of these, 3,600 have not more than 5 vehicles. Most
of the remainder operate both bus and coach services and belong to three main
groups—Tilling, Scottish Omnibuses and British Electric Traction. The
British Electric Traction Group is a private concern but substantial share¬
holdings in many of its companies, without any controlling interest, are held
by the Transport Holding Company, who own the Tilling and Scottish
Omnibus groups outright. The Tilling bus companies are grouped into six
regions covering England and Wales, with a total vehicle strength of about
9,600. The Scottish group, with a vehicle strength of 4,700, covers most of
Scotland, with the exception of the major municipalities of Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen and services in the Highlands and Islands.
At the beginning of 1965 there were 257 concerns operating fleets of over 24
vehicles, 88 of which were local authorities, the largest being the Birmingham
Corporation.
Britain has the highest density of road traffic in the world. In 1964,7,820 people
were killed on the roads and over 377,000 injured. This compares with over
7,000 persons killed and 230,000 injured in 1934, when there was one-quarter
of the present number of motor vehicles on the roads—an indication that the
problems have, to some extent, been held in check by road safety measures
introduced since 1930. Since 1946 the volume of traffic has at least trebled:
but road accident casualties have only doubled. The fatal accident rate in
Britain is better than that in most other European countries, but slightly
worse than in the United States and Canada. Road accident statistics are
compiled and published by the Ministry of Transport and Scottish Develop¬
ment Department from reports made by the police.
Modern roads, designed for present day traffic and segregating pedestrians
from vehicles, are safer than the roads they replace and surveys have shown
they result in a marked fall in casualties. The more important measures
378
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Relief of Congestion
directed primarily towards road safety include speed limits of 30 and 40 m.p.h.
in and around built-up areas and 50 m.p.h. on certain trunk roads in rural
areas; the provision of pedestrian crossings—some illuminated by flashing
beacons and marked with conspicuous white stripes (‘zebra’ crossings); and
the system of road markings and traffic signs (which are being replaced by
greatly improved signs over the next few years).
The safety of vehicles, both in design and use, is controlled by regulations;
a system of vehicle testing, which applies at present to vehicles five or more
years old, is being gradually extended. Heavy goods vehicles are at present
subject to a separate procedure of spot checks but the Government intends to
introduce legislation to establish a system of annual tests.
All drivers of motor vehicles, including motor cycles, motor scooters and
powered pedal cycles, unless they have either held a full British licence or
passed the driving test in the last ten years are required to pass the test before
being granted a full licence to drive1. Until they pass the test they must obtain a
‘provisional’ licence which necessitates their displaying ‘L’ (Learner) plates
on their vehicle, and in all cases where vehicles are constructed to carry
passengers, other than pillion passengers, learner drivers must be accompanied
by a qualified driver (a person who holds a current driving licence for the same
type of vehicle as that driven by the learner). A learner driver of a motorcycle is
restricted, until he passes the driving test, to a machine not exceeding 250 c.c.
The Road Traffic Acts, which embody the law relating to road users, are
enforced by the police and the courts. A person convicted of any of the 26 most
serious offences is liable to be disqualified from driving for a period. The
standard of conduct for all road users—pedestrians and drivers—and a sum¬
mary of the requirements of the law is set out in easily understandable form
in the Highway Code. A failure to observe the code does not of itself render a
person liable to criminal proceedings but may be taken into account in any
such proceedings. Free copies of the code are issued to all learner drivers and
to motorists visiting Britain from abroad.
A National Road Safety Advisory Council was set up by the Minister of
Transport in 1965 to keep under review the road accident situation in Great
Britain and methods of accident prevention, and to report on other matters
affecting road safety.
The Government intends to introduce legislation making it an offence to
drive with more than a prescribed level of alcohol in the blood.
National campaigns to persuade people to take greater care on the roads
are conducted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, acting
as the Government’s agent and with the participation of the local authorities.
The police and education authorities also help by arranging courses of
instruction, especially courses for children.
The Road Traffic and Roads Improvement Act i960 permits the employment
of traffic wardens (with strictly limited powers), and provides for fixed
penalties (the ‘ticket’ system) for parking offences. Other measures in the
Act, designed to reduce traffic congestion, include the granting of greater
powers of action to local traffic authorities. In 1965 the Greater London
Council became the traffic authority (formerly the responsibility of the
Minister of Transport) for the whole of Greater London. Several extensive
schemes for the improvement of road safety and the relief of traffic congestion
are being undertaken: these include ‘fly-overs’ at road junctions; new outlet
roads from cities; and the designation of certain stretches of trunk roads as

‘clearways’, on which waiting on the carriageway is (with certain exceptions)
prohibited. In London and many other large towns, such as Manchester
and Newcastle upon Tyne, street parking in certain areas is permitted only
for limited periods and on payment at parking meters, and increased off-street
parking facilities are being provided.
Increasing use is being made of traffic management to promote the smoother
and more rapid flow of traffic. In i960 a Traffic Management Unit was set
up in London by the Minister of Transport. This was superseded in 1965 by
a Traffic Advisory Unit, with the object of making available to all traffic
authorities the experience gained in London and elsewhere since i960. The
main measures introduced are comprehensive control of street parking and
comprehensive one-way working systems. Others include the banning of turns,
particularly right turns, peak hour clearways and ‘tidal flow’ arrangements.
In June 1964 the Smeed Committee, appointed by the then Minister of
Transport in 1962 to study the technical possibilities of road pricing, reported
that it considered it was possible, by means of various mechanical devices, to
charge road-vehicles according to the extent to which they use congested areas.
In June, also, the Minister announced the setting up of a group which would
study how the design of vehicles (size, power, fumes and manoeuvrability)
could make them more suitable for use in towns.
In 1761 James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from
the collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester.
This marked the beginning of canal building in modern Britain, with which
the names of Brindley, Telford, Rennie, Jessop and other great engineers are
associated. Canals played an important part in promoting industrial and
commercial expansion in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The whole canal system was practically complete by 1830. As a result of
developing competition from the railways, however, about one-third of the
canal mileage had passed to the control of the railway companies by the middle
of the nineteenth century. During the first world war government control of
railways included railway-owned canals and, under the Transport Act 1947,
most of the country’s canals passed from government control, which had
been re-established in the second world war, to that of the British Transport
Commission in January 1948. From 1955 the canals were managed separately
by the waterways division of the Commission, known as British Waterways;
under the Transport Act 1962, control has been vested in the British Water¬
ways Board since 1st January, 1963.
There are about 2,500 miles of navigable inland waterways in Great Britain1,
some 2,000 miles of which belong to the British Waterways Board; the
remainder are mainly still in the hands of local authorities or private companies.
Many of the Board’s canals are narrow waterways which can generally be
used only by boats not exceeding 7 feet in width, capable of carrying a load
varying from 25 to 30 tons; the remainder are broad waterways and canalised
rivers which can be used by craft of up to 400 tons capacity. The canals in
Scotland are all broad waterways. Of the 2,000 miles of inland waterways
under the control of the British Waterways Board about 320 miles are
closed to navigation or abandoned and some further 800 miles (in 1963) were
no longer used for commercial navigation. Of these ‘disused’ canals some
are unnavigable, either wholly or in part.
1 In Northern Ireland, the only inland waterway which is still used for commercial
transport purposes is the Lower Bann Navigation.

For certain operational purposes, such as maintenance engineering and
estates work, the canals of England and Wales are administered from two
regional centres, one at Gloucester and the other at Leeds. Sales promotion
is, in the main, centrally and nationally directed by the Board’s headquarters
in London. In Scotland the canals (other than the Caledonian, which is run
by a manager) are, for engineering purposes, under the control of an area
engineer; estates work is supervised centrally.
In 1964 total traffic on British Waterways amounted to 9 million tons, of
which 3-8 million tons were coal, 2-2 million tons liquids in bulk and 3 million
tons general cargo. The total traffic is stated in ton-miles in Table 22. Some
90 per cent of the total traffic is carried on about 400 miles of broad water¬
ways, which are mainly canalised rivers.
Although the British Waterways Board is the largest single carrying
operator, most of the traffic is handled by independent carriers or by traders
in their own craft. The Board at the end of 1964 owned 13 tugs and 860
carrying craft, with a carrying capacity of 36,700 tons, including 93 power-
driven craft with a carrying capacity of 5,450 tons.
Under the control of the BTC, the commercial organisation was strengthened;
it concentrated on dredging methods and equipment, brought different types
of craft into service, established a research organisation and undertook
various development works. Following the report, issued in 1955, by a
specially appointed Board of Survey, a comprehensive development plan was
begun in 1956. Under this plan, nearly £6 million was invested in the improve¬
ment of navigation and the provision of modern equipment on the major
waterways that carry most of the traffic—the Aire and Calder Navigation,
the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, the Trent Navigation, the
Lee Navigation (below Enfield Lock), part of the river Severn, including the
Gloucester & Sharpness Canal, the Weaver Navigation and the Grand Union
Canal (below Uxbridge). As a result the British Waterways Board now
controls about 300 miles of first-class waterways linking important industrial
districts with ports; further investments in improved facilities are being made.
The total revenue of the British Waterways Board in 1964 amounted to
^4-5 million, of which only ^0-7 million arose from carrying activities. The
sale of water is an important source of revenue and has more than trebled
since 1948. British Waterways encourages pleasure boating and receipts from
this source are rising but as yet constitute less than 2 per cent of total revenue.
British Waterways does not usually own fishing rights and income from this
source is very small. In 1963 the Board issued an interim report, The Future
of the Waterways, on its examination of the future use of the inland waterways
under its control.
London is, with Tokyo and New York, one of the world’s three largest cities.
The area known as Greater London, within a radius of about 15 miles from
Charing Cross, contains over 8 million people.
London’s passenger transport system, in its modern sense, began in 1829
when the first omnibus, horse-drawn, appeared on the London streets. The
first regular tram service, also horse-drawn, began in 1870. In 1863 the first
underground steam railway, the Metropolitan, was built by digging a great
trench for the line and roofing it over. In 1870 the world’s first tube railway,
the Tower Subway, was constructed under the river Thames; it was cable-
operated and ran for only a few months. The first electric tube railway in the
world, the City and South London line, was opened in 1890, and this was

followed in 1900 by the opening of the Central London Railway. Shortly
afterwards the steam-operated underground lines were electrified. Meanwhile,
horse-drawn buses and trams were being replaced by motor buses and
electric trams.
Until 1933 there were many separate undertakings providing passenger
transport facilities in London, but in that year they were all vested in a single
public corporation, the London Passenger Transport Board. In 1948, with
the establishment of the British Transport Commission, the London Trans¬
port Executive took over control as an agency of the Commission.
Under the Transport Act 1962, as in the case of the other BTC under¬
takings, the London Transport Executive has been replaced by a financially
independent board, known as the London Transport Board.
The London Transport undertaking operates all road and rail passenger
transport services in the London area with the exception of the London lines
of British Railways and the taxicabs. (Some 6,000 taxicabs that ply for hire
in the streets are privately operated by companies or owner-drivers and are
licensed annually by the metropolitan police.) London Transport’s operations
extend beyond Greater London to cover an area of 2,000 square miles (known
as the London Passenger Transport Area) with a radius of about 25 miles
from Charing Cross and with a population of io| million. Between 1955
and 1964 the number of passenger journeys made annually on the London
Transport system fell from 4,079 million to 2,926 million, largely owing to
increased private motoring and changes in leisure-time habits and also to
some shifting of population away from the centre of London.
London Transport’s railway network stretches 18 miles from north to south
and 32 miles from east to west. The total length of the railway over which
London Transport trains operate is 244 miles, of which 88 miles are under¬
ground, including the longest tube tunnel in the world, 17J miles long.
London Transport trains serve 273 stations. London Transport’s buses and
coaches travel over 3,200 miles of roads. To carry traffic over all this area,
in December 1964 London Transport owned 4,174 railway cars and 8,347
buses and coaches. The total staff employed was 74,000.
Improvements carried out by London Transport since the war have
included complete renewal of the bus and coach fleet, replacement of trams
and trolleybuses by diesel buses, and extension and modernisation of parts of
the Underground system. Since 1959 £30 million has been spent on renewal
of the railway rolling stock fleet. In 1962 work started on the building of
a new io|-mile tube railway between Victoria Station and Walthamstow,
in north-east London. It is estimated that the work will cost at least £56
million and it is hoped to open the line, in sections, starting at the end of
1968.
Public transport in Northern Ireland is in a transitional stage. Under the law
as it stands at present, road passenger transport in Belfast is provided by the
Belfast Corporation and private hauliers are engaged in road freight transport
in the cities of Belfast and Londonderry. All other public road passenger and
freight services and all rail services in Northern Ireland are provided by the
Ulster Transport Authority, a public body which was established under the
Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1948. The authority also owns and
operates a chain of hotels.
In the year ended 30th September, 1964, nearly 90 million passengers,
over 2-5 million tons of merchandise and 895,000 head of livestock were
382

Roads
carried by road and rail services run by the Ulster Transport Authority.
There were 297 miles of permanent way, 56 locomotives and 159 diesel rail
cars and trailers. The route mileage of regular omnibus services was 2,733
miles and there were 1,156 omnibuses and coaches and 2,468 goods motor
vehicles in use. The gross revenue of the authority was £11 million.
The Government of Northern Ireland announced a policy for the reorganis¬
ation of public transport which involves (a) a planned run-down of railways;
(b) the introduction of a licensing system for road freight which would allow
private hauliers, under licence, to provide freight services throughout
Northern Ireland; (c) the establishment of a Northern Ireland Transport
Commission to take over the assets of the Ulster Transport Authority and to
operate the Authority’s railways, workshops and hotels; and (d) the establish¬
ment of publicly owned undertakings to provide public road passenger and
road freight services. Pending the introduction of legislation, the Ulster
Transport Authority has divested itself of its road freight operations. A new
company (Northern Ireland Carriers Ltd.), in which the Authority holds a
50 per cent interest, has been established to provide road freight services and,
where necessary, temporary consents under the Transport Act (Northern
Ireland) 1948 are being issued by the Authority which allow private operators
to carry road freight for hire or reward.
In February 1965, following an Order of the Northern Ireland Transport
Tribunal, certain passenger rail services and all freight rail services were
withdrawn by the Authority and road transport services substituted.
On 31st March, 1965, there were 13,901 miles of public roads in Northern
Ireland, comprising 385 miles of trunk roads, 958 miles of Class I roads,
1,735 miles Class II roads, 2,864 miles of Class III roads and 7,959 miles
of unclassified roads.
The Ministry of Development is directly responsible for the trunk road
system and bears the entire cost of maintenance and reconstruction work on
these roads. In addition to major reconstruction schemes on trunk roads, a
total of about 100 miles of motorway are planned by the early 1970s.
The Ministry of Development administers the Road Fund (the proceeds
of motor vehicle taxation, driving licence fees, etc.), from which grants are
paid to the local authorities (county, county borough, borough and urban
district councils) who are responsible for the other roads. The rates of grant
range from 90 per cent for major improvement works on Class I roads to
25 per cent for maintenance work on unclassified roads.
Gross expenditure on all roads in the financial year to 31st March, 1965,
was ^13-1 million. Expenditure in the five-year period 1965-70 is expected
to be about £100 million, compared with about £52 million in the five-year
period to 1964.
CIVIL AVIATION
British airmen were among the first to carry mails (at the time of the
Coronation of King George V in 1911) and among the first to operate regular
mail and passenger services, which were inaugurated on 25th August, 1919,
when a daily passenger service was opened between London (Hounslow)
and Paris (Le Bourget). The year 1919 was also marked by notable pioneer
flights, including the crossing of the Atlantic by John Alcock and Arthur
Whitten Brown in June (both were later knighted for their achievement) and

the first flight between England and Australia by Captain (later Sir) Ross
Smith and his crew.
In April 1924 four small British companies merged to form Imperial Airways
Limited, which received a government grant of £1 million spread over the
next ten years. As a substantial shareholder the Government was represented
on the board of directors.
Imperial Airways Limited pioneered the commercial development of
intercontinental air routes (including the organisation of ground services),
following up, in many cases, the exploratory work of the Royal Air Force.
By 1929 there was a through service from England to India. In 1931 the first
service was established to Central Africa. The first mail service to Australia
started in December 1934, followed by a passenger service in 1935. During
a part of 1939 Imperial Airways operated an experimental transatlantic
service for mail.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation, a public corporation, was
established by the British Overseas Airways Act 1939, and took over the
undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways Limited
in 1940. British European Airways was established under the Civil Aviation
Act 1946 as a separate public corporation to cover the United Kingdom
and Europe. In addition to the two nationalised corporations, there were in
June 1965 over 30 independent air transport operators, some of them being
grouped, so forming 12 principal companies in all.
General responsibility for the development of United Kingdom civil aviation
is vested in the Ministry of Aviation. The Ministry supervises the development
and production of civil aircraft and undertakes an extensive programme of
research and development to meet civil as well as Service needs. It is also
responsible for air safety and in this capacity is advised by the Air Registration
Board (see p. 389).
Under the post-war nationalisation legislation the corporations had a statutory
monopoly of scheduled services and independent operators were broadly
confined to charter work. From 1949 independent operators were permitted to
operate certain scheduled services as ‘associates’ of the corporations. From
1952 the independent companies became eligible to develop new routes and
new types of scheduled services. The Air Transport Advisory Council
(ATAC), set up by the Civil Aviation Act 1946, advised the Minister whether
permission for these services could be given without materially diverting
traffic from existing services. Under the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act i960,
the corporations’ statutory monopoly was abolished and an Air Transport
Licensing Board was set up in place of the ATAC; and from 30th March,
1961, the independent operators became entitled to apply for permission to
operate scheduled or charter services on an equal basis with the corporations.
In a statement in February 1965, however, the Government announced
restrictions in the granting of new licences to British operators of scheduled
services on both international and domestic routes.
The ATLB consists of six to ten members appointed by the Minister of
Aviation. The Board is responsible for considering all applications for licences
(or their revocation or variation) and in reaching its decisions must take into
account an operator’s experience, financial resources, equipment, organisation
and staffing arrangements, the adequacy of existing services and any objections
from other interested parties. There is provision for appeals to the Minister
384

from decisions of the Board and the Minister appoints an independent
commissioner to advise him upon every appeal. In the period from its
inception to 31st March, 1965, the Board received over 5,400 applications
for licences for air services of various kinds, including charters and holiday
tours, of which nearly 4,000 were granted.
The existing powers and constitutions of BOAC and BEA are laid down by
the Air Corporations Act 1949 (though the Corporations’ monopoly of
scheduled services was repealed by the i960 Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act
as noted above). Each corporation consists of 5 to 11 members, including
the chairman. The merging of the two corporations has been considered on
several occasions but the conclusion has been that, at any rate at present,
the balance of advantage lies in keeping them as separate entities. However,
to promote greater collaboration, the chairman of each board is now also a
part-time member of the other.
Under the Air Corporations Act 1962, each corporation may, with the
consent of the Minister of Aviation and the approval of the Treasury, borrow
by raising temporary loans or by means of interest-bearing, redeemable
loans from the Exchequer. The borrowing limits under the Act are £300
million for BOAC and £125 million for BEA, these sums being intended to
provide for the corporations’ capital requirements. In addition, the Act
enabled them within these overall limits to finance from borrowings losses
on revenue account of up to £100 million (BOAC) and £10 million (BEA)
accruing before 31st March, 1964; under a further Act of 1964, BOAC’s
limit was raised to £125 million and the time limit for both corporations
was extended to 31st March, 1966. However, in 1965 the Government
decided to write off BOAC’s accumulated deficit on operating account at 31st
March, 1965 (see p. 385).
Although the Minister of Aviation has certain statutory powers of direction
over the corporations, including power to give general directions as to the
exercise of their functions on matters affecting the national interest, these
powers are very seldom used. The corporations function as commercial
undertakings with autonomy in matters of day-to-day management. However,
as their activities may have an impact on matters of national policy or inter¬
national relations, and as the Minister is responsible for answering for the
corporations in Parliament, there is in practice close co-operation, consultation
and exchange of information between them and the Ministry. It is also the
practice of the corporations to seek the approval of the Minister and the
Treasury for orders of aircraft, which account for the bulk of their capital
expenditure, and for investments in foreign airlines, which commonly involve
foreign currency and may have political implications. Under the 1949 Act
the corporations are also required to render annual reports of their activities
and statements of account, and the Minister lays these before Parliament.
A selection of operating and financial statistics for the two corporations
(including their associates) and the independent companies is shown in
Table 23. Total capacity ton-miles offered on all services more than doubled
between March 1956 and March 1961 and a further increase took place in the
following three years. In 1955, 2-5 million passengers entered or left the United
Kingdom by air, compared with 5-7 million who arrived or departed by sea; in
1962 there were for the first time more air than sea passengers, while in 1964
the corresponding figures had risen to 9-8 million by air and 8 million by sea.

BOAC is engaged on long-haul airline operations. Its scheduled services link
Britain with Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australasia, Africa and
North and South America, and it also provides a complete round the world
service. It works in close co-operation with airlines of several other Common¬
wealth countries; it also has financial interests in five companies operating
local and regional services in the Far and Middle East, in areas adjacent to
BOAC’s main routes. BOAC-Cunard Ltd., a joint venture formed by BOAC
and the Cunard Steamship Company in 1962, operates services between
Britain and parts of North and South America and the Caribbean.
Table 23 shows that the capacity offered on its own scheduled services by
BOAC reached 1,057 million capacity-ton-miles at the end of March 1965,
having risen by 83-2 per cent in the last four years. Nearly three-fifths was
on the western routes to North and South America. The overall load factor in
1964-65 was 49-3 per cent: the break-even load factor (the figures at which
operating costs are covered) was again lower. The Corporation’s passenger
fleet, made up entirely of pure jets, consists (May 1965) of Super VC 10s
(5, with a further 12 on order), VC 10s (12), Boeing 707s (20) and Comet 4s
(17). The VC 10, introduced into service in 1964, operates on African, Middle
East and Far East routes and has gradually replaced the Comet 4, which was
withdrawn from scheduled services towards the end of 1965. The Super VC 10
(a larger and more powerful version) went into service in April 1965 on trans¬
atlantic routes. BOAC plans to build its own ^7 million passenger terminal
at Kennedy International Airport, New York, to be opened in 1968.
Despite increasing revenue from operations, BOAC’s annual accounts have
shown deficits since 1957-58. In 1963 a White Paper1 attributed these losses
to additional amortisation provisions, interest payments on capital and past
losses of associated companies. The accumulated deficit on the profit and loss
account of the Corporation at the end of the financial year 1963-64 amounted
to £90-5 million. In 1965, the Government decided to write off the accumu¬
lated deficit at 31st March, 1965, and to establish a reserve fund against
contingencies. Measures were taken in 1964 to strengthen the management
of the Corporation and plans have been worked out which are already
producing better financial results. In 1964-65 BOAC had a record operating
profit of £7-6 million. Of its gross revenue (£114 million) £78 million was
earned in foreign currencies, of which £35 million came from the sterling
area and £29 million from the dollar area.
BEA operates a network of services to some 80 places in Britain, Europe,
North Africa and the Middle East. Its services in Britain include a number
which cannot be operated on a commercial basis but which meet a vital
social need; these include services to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
BEA maintains a close working relationship with BOAC, whose aircraft, by
agreement, use a number of European stopping points. BEA also co-operates
with other airlines in order to create ‘through travel’ facilities. It has a
financial interest in several associated companies, most of which collaborate
with BEA in providing a network of services.
Table 23 shows that between 1956 and 1965 BEA’s capacity offered, and
passenger-miles and freight ton-miles flown, trebled. For the year ended
31st March, 1965, the respective increases were 15 per cent, 9 per cent

and 25 per cent. In the same year some 6-i million passengers were carried,
an increase of 9 per cent over the previous year; but the load factor fell by
three per cent to 58-4 per cent. In only one other year has the overall load
factor fallen to this level (57-8 per cent in 1950-51).
In 1965 BEA’s passenger fleet consisted of Comets, Vanguards, Viscount 800s
and Tridents. The Trident, introduced in 1964, is a three-engine 600 mph
jet designed for medium-haul routes: delivery of 24 of these aircraft was com¬
pleted in 1965. A 25-passenger Sikorsky helicopter has operated a service
from Penzance to the Isles of Scilly since 1964.
In 1963 BEA disposed of the last of its fleet of Viscount 701s, which in 1953
had inaugurated the world’s first gas-turbine airline service.
From 1954-55 t0 1960-61 BEA earned a net profit. In the next two years,
during which it introduced four new types of aircraft at an additional cost of
£6 million, it incurred overall loses of £1-4 million. In the following year,
i.e. to 31st March, 1964, the corporation made a record profit of £3 million.
The costs of introducing the Trident into service (about £() million between
1964 and 1968) has contributed to a temporary reduction in profits, which
amounted to £1-3 million in 1964-65.
Of the 30 or so independent air transport companies, eight are members of the
British Independent Air Transport Association (BIATA). Among the largest
companies are British United Airways Ltd. (not in BIATA) and British
Eagle International Airlines Ltd. In addition, there are over 30 operators
engaged in miscellaneous activities, such as crop spraying and air photography
and survey work. Table 23 shows that the capacity offered by the independent
transport companies on non-scheduled services (comprising inclusive holiday
tours and charter and contract services) has greatly exceeded that offered on
scheduled services. Until 1961 the development of scheduled services by
independent firms was restricted by the corporations’ statutory monopoly
(see p. 383) and the scheduled service activities of these companies were
concentrated mainly on secondary routes and the provision of special types
of service, such as vehicle ferry services from the United Kingdom to Europe,
and low-fare services to Africa. Since 1961 the independent companies and
the corporations have been able to apply to the Air Transport Licensing
Board for licences for the development of their networks of scheduled or
charter services. (For the Government’s policy towards the granting of future
licences see p. 383.)
Much charter business is arranged through the air section of the Baltic
Exchange, the London market for shipping space (see p. 360). The Air-
brokers’ Association, formed in 1949, operates in London a world market for
chartering aircraft to carry cargo and passengers.
The proportion of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air is steadily increasing.
In 1956, 1-7 per cent of imports and 2-9 per cent of exports (by value) were
carried by air. In 1964 these percentages were 5-8 per cent and 7-1 per cent
respectively, and the total value of exports, imports and re-exports by air was
£668 million. The chief export items were expensive machinery and parts,
aircraft and vehicle parts, and electrical and electronic products; furs and
skins accounted for about a third of the total value of re-exports by air.
At the end of 1964 the estimated number of aircraft on the United Kingdom
register used for business and private purposes was about 640, while approxi-

mately 475 were owned by clubs, groups and training schools. Private pilot’s
licences were held by about 8,400 people.
The Minister of Aviation is authorised to establish and maintain civil aero¬
dromes; local authorities may do so subject to his approval; there are also
privately owned aerodromes. Virtually all aerodromes not operated by the
Government which are used for passenger operations or flying instruction
are subject to the Minister’s licensing, inspection and regulation.
There are approximately 120 civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom and,
in addition, 55 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under
civil control include 19 directly controlled by the Ministry, 3 in the Channel
Islands and 1 in the Isle of Man administered by the local island governments,
and 34 aerodromes licensed for public use, of which 25 are owned by
municipalities. Nine of the Ministry’s aerodromes and 19 others are desig¬
nated Customs airports; limited customs facilities are available at a further
eight aerodromes.
The main airports used by international scheduled services in 1965 were:
for European services: London (Heathrow and Gatwick);
for North Atlantic services: London (Heathrow);
for Middle East, African and Far East services: London (Heathrow and
Gatwick).
In June 1965 the Government set up the British Airports Authority, which
will take over ownership and management of London’s three airports
(Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted) and Prestwick airport on 1st April, 1966.
Aircraft and passenger movements at the principal aerodromes continue
to increase. In 1964 all United Kingdom civil aerodromes handled 18-3
million passengers. Of this total, London (Heathrow) Airport dealt with
9-5 million, and London (Gatwick), i-i million. Outside the London area,
two airports, Manchester (Ringway) and Glasgow (Renfrew), each handled
over a million passengers. Other airports handling a substantial number of
passengers were Belfast (Aldergrove), Southend, Birmingham, Edinburgh
(Turnhouse), Liverpool and Prestwick. The three airports in the Channel
Islands together handled 1*3 million passengers. The number of movements
of aircraft engaged on commercial transport operations in 1964 was 480,000
for all aerodromes.
London (Heathrow) Airport, already the largest and busiest airport in
Western Europe, is being strained to capacity owing both to the increasing
number of passengers and of large new jet aircraft; in recent years the annual
increase in the number of passengers handled has totalled about one million.
Domestic and European short-haul services are handled at the passenger
building in the central terminal opened in 1955. An additional building for
short-haul services is expected to be ready in 1966. A £3 million terminal was
completed in 1962 for long-distance passengers. Travelling time from Central
London to Heathrow has been appreciably shortened by the opening of a
section of the M4 motorway (see p. 373) in March 1965. Freight traffic is
expected to increase considerably during the next few years, and plans are
being prepared for a new freight terminal in the south-west corner of the air¬
port. The airport at Gatwick, 25 miles south of London, was opened in June
1958 as the second airport for the London area and further development is
being undertaken by enlarging the terminal buildings and aprons and adding a
second and third passenger pier. The second pier was completed in the summer
of 1963. A £2-$ million extension, which has more than doubled the size of the

terminal buildings and added a third passenger pier, was completed in 1965.
Plans have been made to extend the 7,000-ft. runway to enable it to handle the
larger aircraft likely to come into use for short and medium-haul services as well
as the largest jet airliners diverted from Heathrow. A second runway proposed
for Gatwick will not add greatly to the airport’s capacity, owing to lack of
air space for an extra approach area, but is required as a reserve for both
Heathrow and Gatwick. The two airports are becoming increasingly inter¬
dependent. Built alongside the main London to Brighton railway, London
(Gatwick) Airport is the first in the world to contain road, rail and air trans¬
port in one unit. A privately owned helicopter terminal (or ‘heliport’) was
opened in London, on the south bank of the Thames, in April 1959.
The Government has designated Stansted Aerodrome, 33 miles north-east
of London, as the site of the third London airport. It will come into service
by the early 1970s, when it is expected that Heathrow and Gatwick will have
reached capacity as a result of the growth of traffic.
Prestwick, in Scotland, has been developed to accommodate large jet
aircraft and a new passenger terminal and freight area were brought into use
in 1964. The runways at Ringway Airport, Manchester, have been lengthened
and a new terminal building was completed in 1962. Work started during
1963 at Abbotsinch, Glasgow, on a new airport which should be complete
and ready for the transfer of services from Renfrew in 1966.
In the autumn of 1963 Belfast’s services were transferred from Nutt’s Corner
to a new civil terminal built on the former RAF aerodrome at Aldergrove.
The role of the Government in promoting air safety lies in research and in
setting up and supervising standards for both aircraft and personnel.
Research on aircraft design and construction is done at the Royal Aircraft
Establishments at Farnborough and Bedford, which belong to the Ministry
of Aviation and are exceptionally well equipped with testing facilities.
The Ministry of Aviation also determines the policy and legislative require¬
ments for the safe operation of civil aircraft, analyses accidents and incidents
and initiates preventive measures and research in the field of flight safety.
All aircraft registered in the United Kingdom must have a valid certificate
of airworthiness issued (or rendered valid) by the Ministry of Aviation on
the recommendation of the Air Registration Board. This Board was set up
in 1937 and consists of 18 members, six of whom are independent, the others
being representatives of constructors, operators and insurers of aircraft.
No aircraft built in Britain is granted a certificate of airworthiness unless it
has been constructed in accordance with British Civil Airworthiness Require¬
ments, a code compiled and frequently reviewed by the Board. Continued
airworthiness is ensured by regular inspection and by requiring aircraft to be
maintained in accordance with a schedule approved by the Board.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain size used for public transport must
possess an Air Operator’s Certificate issued by the Director of Aviation
Safety (who is appointed by the Minister of Aviation) when satisfied by
inspectors that all safety precautions are constantly taken by the operator.
Each member of a flight crew must hold the appropriate licence granted or
rendered valid by the Minister. Operators are required to ensure that pilots
employed by them have adequate knowledge of routes, and Ministry inspectors
check the standards maintained by the operators, which must be adequate
for purposes of the Air Operator’s Certificate.

In order to replace the supply of well-trained pilots for civil airlines from the
Royal Air Force, which has declined in recent years, the College of Air
Training was set up at Ramble in i960. It is sponsored and financed by the
Government and the two Airways Corporations. Over 130 cadets had graduated
through the two-year course by October 1964. (Ultimately over 100 trained
pilots a year will graduate from the College.) As it can supply only about half
the pilots needed, the Government may approve independent colleges, whose
standards are adequate for the training of professional pilots. So far only
Airwork Services Training, Perth, has been approved.
Responsibility for policy, planning and execution of both civil and military
air traffic control over the United Kingdom and the surrounding seas rests
with the national Air Traffic Control Services Organisation, under the joint
control of the Minister of Aviation and the Secretary of State for Defence.
This organisation has an integrated policy and planning staff drawn from both
ministries.
In 1950 the then Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation introduced a
system of airways covering the main traffic routes with controlled zones
around the major airports. During 1957 and 1958 a revised and extended
airways system was brought into use. There are three main air traffic control
centres: at London (Heathrow) Airport for southern England, at Preston for
the north of England and Wales, and at Prestwick for Scotland and the
Atlantic Ocean to 30° WT.
A variety of radar installations and equipment provide the means by which
the system can accept the increasingly heavy load of air traffic. Britain
was the first country to use radar for the control of civil air traffic. The
radar approach system known as Ground Controlled Approach (GCA)
is now in use at all major airports in the United Kingdom, in addition
to the Instrument Landing System (ILS). During the next few years
virtually the whole of the airspace ever the United Kingdom above 5,000
feet will be brought under surveillance by the latest types of radar equipment,
which will provide data to be used in two new Air Traffic Control Centres,
located at West Drayton (near London) and Preston, Lancashire. A subsidiary
centre will be located at Prestwick, to deal with traffic over Scotland. Extensive
use will be made in these centres of automatic data-processing and other
advanced electronic techniques.
The Ministry of Aviation has provided a number of radio navigational aids
to help aircraft to remain safely within the controlled airspace and to make
accurate estimates of their time of arrival. In addition, the Ministry supports
the Decca Air and Marine Navigator System now operating over a wide area
of the United Kingdom and northern Europe, which can be used, by arrange¬
ment with the Decca Company, by any aircraft fitted with the appropriate
receiving equipment.
Research is in progress into automatic landing systems. A unit of the Royal
Aircraft Establishment, at Bedford, in co-operation with industry, has
successfully developed an instrument system which was used for the first
time in a passenger-carrying aircraft in June 1965, on a scheduled flight
operated byBEA, to achieve an automatic landing. This makes Britain the
pioneer in all-weather landing systems. The fully automatic landing, under
blind conditions, is expected to be achieved by 1968.
To cope with the new problems caused by high-flying, high-speed jet aircraft,

Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, provides air traffic

operating according to civil procedures.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides the postal and public tele¬
communications services of the United Kingdom. Although formally a
government department it is in effect a nationalised industry.
The political head of the Post Office is the Postmaster General (see p. 57).
Immediately under him is the General Directorate consisting of the Director
General, three Deputy Directors General and the Engineer-in-Chief. They
are supported by a considerable staff, organised functionally, in the task of
framing plans for the Post Office as a whole and supervising its affairs generally.
For most operational purposes Britain is divided into nine geographical
regions, each under a Director (two in London) with his own supporting
staff. Responsible to them, and forming the third tier of the organisation, are
450 head postmasters and 57 telephone managers who directly control
operations in the field. In March 1965 the Post Office had 384,000 employees
and 25,000 post offices.
Among the means by which the Post Office keeps in touch with public
opinion are a central Advisory Council and 195 local advisory committees.
The Post Office Act 1961 recognised the commercial character of the Post
Office by separating its finances from the Exchequer and giving the Postmaster
General sole responsibility for them. Post Office expenditure is generally
subject neither to Parliamentary control by Estimate nor to Treasury control.
Income is determined by tariffs which the Postmaster General fixes, subject
only to negative resolution of Parliament. The Post Office makes its own
investment plans, subject only to the same need for broad government
approval as applies to other nationalised industries. Like them, it is expected
to aim at an adequate return on its capital and to contribute suitably to the
financing of its investment. Its present financial target is an average return on
net assets of 8 per cent over the period 1963-64 to 1967-68.
Table 24 gives recent figures of income, profit and capital. Nearly all the
capital is invested in telecommunications, which are drawing rapidly ahead
of the postal services in size and profitability. Among nationalised industries,
in size of income the Post Office as a whole ranks after coal and electricity
supply, and in rate of growth it is second only to the latter.
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from
the time when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern
airmail transport. There was a great expansion in the postal services in the
eighteenth century with the introduction of mail-coaches in 1784. In the first
half of the nineteenth century the Post Office was quick to take advantage
of Britain’s early lead in engineering and railway development and the
fiist dispatch of mails by train was made in 1830 between Liverpool and
Manchester.
The inauguration of the penny post (the uniform charge for any inland
distance being prepaid by means of postage stamps, which originated in
Britain) in 1840 was followed by a rapid extension of the scope of the postal
services. The registered post, ensuring additional safety for valuable mail,

was introduced in 1841. The money order system, which had operated as a
private venture from 1792 to 1838, was supplemented in 1881 by the issue
of postal orders for fixed amounts. Letterboxes had been instituted in London
in 1855 to facilitate the increased postal traffic, and in 1883 the parcel post
was introduced. By the end of the nineteenth century a regular delivery of
letters was assured to every house in Britain. In 1919 the Post Office inaugura¬
ted its own motor transport fleet (now 47,000 vehicles) and the first mail was
carried by air in Britain in 1911. A National Postal Museum is to be opened in
London in 1968: it will house the Post Office collection of registration sheets
of virtually every British postage stamp issued, as well as the R. M. Phillips
collection of British postage stamps, the most comprehensive of its kind in
the world.

Out of the 497 million items of overseas mail carried in 1964-65, 62 per cent
were carried by air, compared with 51 per cent in 1955-56. The air parcel
service now operates to all countries in Europe and to over 180 countries
outside Europe.
The Joint Research and Development Group of the Post Office and the
Ministry of Public Building and Works has evolved a range of standard
designs for sorting offices and ancillary accommodation which will reduce
planning time and allow the use of industrialised methods of construction.
In mechanisation and automation a simple, efficient and economic parcel
sorting machine has been developed and successfully tested under working
conditions. Machines are being installed which will separate mail into various
classes, arrange the letters with the stamp in a common position and then
automatically obliterate the stamps. In the future letters will be coded with
phosphorescent dots and thereafter sorted automatically by high-speed
sorting machines.
A fundamental investigation into ways of raising the level of productivity
and profitability of the postal services has been commissioned from a firm
of consultants.
At the post office counter, besides making use of its postal and telegraph
facilities, the citizen can draw his pension and his family allowance, buy a
licence for his gun, dog, sound radio or television receiving set, renew his
car licence and buy national insurance stamps. Post offices also offer a wide
range of facilities for savings and investments (see p. 413). In much of the
work at its counters the Post Office acts as agent for other government
departments or local authorities. Largely as a result of the widening scope of
the social services and the increase in personal incomes, the volume of work
at post office counters has been increasing. The total value of transactions and
the value of some important items are shown in Table 24.
All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to the control of
the Postmaster General in 1870. Teleprinter-working for the transmission
of inland telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the
present automatic switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now
one of the most up-to-date systems in the world and gives direct connection
between any of the 450 larger telegraph offices. The overseas telegraph
services were shared until 1950 between the Post Office and Cable and
Wireless Ltd. This company was brought into public ownership in 1947.
The Post Office, which acquired the British services, operates all overseas
telegraph services from the United Kingdom, except those offered by foreign
telegraph companies. Cable and Wireless Ltd. continues to operate its cable
and wireless services in many dependencies and foreign countries.
Telegraph services to overseas countries are operated from Electra House in
London, the world’s largest overseas telegraph office, and from nine other
London and provincial area telegraph offices. Direct connection via the Gentex
system between these British offices and the larger towns in Belgium, France,
Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, Italy and Norway minimises delivery delay.
In addition, the Post Office is well to the fore in the development of telegraph
message relay techniques for services beyond Europe.
The Telex Service (opened in England in 1932) combines the speed of the
telephone with the accuracy of the printed word. Calls may be made direct
between the rapidly increasing number of telex users in the United Kingdom
(over 17,000 by the end of 19^5) and also to some 250,000 subscribers
394
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Telephone
Services
throughout the world. The United Kingdom telex service is fully automatic
and immediate connection to most subscribers in Europe and to many
subscribers in the United States is made by direct dialling. Other overseas calls
are connected by operators at the International Telex Exchange in London.
Once a call is established the subscriber types his message on the keyboard
of his teleprinter: it is then reproduced simultaneously on both the sending
and receiving subscribers’ installations. For call charging purposes Britain is
divided into 50 charging areas, each with its own telex centre. The Inter¬
national Telex Exchange (first opened in London in 1936) provides a
teleprinter service to over 100 countries abroad. The service is available day
and night except for a few routes outside Europe, and messages may be
transmitted to a subscriber even though his teleprinter is unattended, for
attention when his office reopens. Some 7 per cent of overseas telex calls
originating in Britain are still handled by operators but a new British-designed
switchboard enables them to be connected on request instead of having to be
booked in advance. The inland telex traffic is growing annually by about
25 per cent and overseas traffic by about 30 per cent; the Post Office is
planning for a system of about 35,000 United Kingdom subscribers by 1970.
When the Post Office bought the property of the National Telephone Com¬
pany in 1912 it became the owner of almost the whole telephone service in
the country. Hull Corporation was the only municipality to exercise its option
of operating its own service under licence from the Postmaster General; this
service (and the service in the Channel Islands, also operated under licence)
is connected to the Post Office trunk network. At the end of March 1965
there were 6,019 local telephone exchanges and about 10 million telephones
in Britain.
In March 1965, 92 per cent of the 6 million telephones (exchange con¬
nections) in the United Kingdom were connected with automatic exchanges
and less than a tenth of the exchanges remained to be changed to automatic
working. Trunk dialling by subscribers began in Bristol in December 1958;
by March 1965 the facility had been extended to 912 exchanges, serving 55 per
cent of all subscribers; by 1970 it will be available on over 90 per cent of all
telephones. The introduction of the new group routing and charging equip¬
ment brings the advantages of quicker service, automatic accounting and
cheap long distance calls of short duration, and constitutes the most radical
reform of the telephone service since the Post Office assumed national
responsibility for it.
Telephones transmitting messages through loudspeakers instead of through
instruments held by hand were made available to the public in 1961. An
electronic telephone exchange, the first of its kind in the world, was brought
into experimental use in 1962 at Highgate Wood, in London. Two electronic
exchange units of a different type were opened for trial with public traffic in
1965 and two more will follow in 1966.
International subscriber dialling between London and Paris was inaugurated
in March 1963, and extended to the rest of France, Belgium, Switzerland, the
German Federal Republic and the Netherlands in 1964. Some of the larger
towns in Britain were also brought into the network in 1964. Further inland
and international connections to the system are planned.
Operator-connected calls are handled at the London Continental Exchange,
from which over 1,260 direct telephone circuits give service to European
countries. These circuits are also used to send and receive pictures, and
special circuits are used for broadcast transmissions.

A radio tower, 580 feet high, has been erected in London to provide more
microwave radio links for carrying long-distance telephone and television
circuits; the first microwave link was brought into use in 1965.
There are several specialised services available by telephone, including the
‘999’ emergency dialling service (used for some 489,000 calls in 1964) enabling
subscribers to be connected as quickly as possible, and free of charge, to the
police, ambulance or fire brigade services; the speaking clock; and a telephone
weather forecast service available in 17 centres. In London a telephone
information service provides details in English, French, Spanish and German
of important events being held in and around the capital on the day of the
call and a similar service (in English) in Edinburgh exists during the summer
months. A recorded daily cooking recipe is provided at several centres. A
test match cricket score service operates at more than 30 centres during the
cricket season and a road weather service is provided in collaboration with the
Automobile Association at 11 centres from 1st October to Toth April each
year.
A public radiotelephone service, introduced in 1959, enables the users of
vehicles fitted with suitable radio equipment to make calls to, or receive them
from, any telephone in the United Kingdom network. The area of this service
was initially restricted to South Lancashire and parts of Cheshire but a service
to cover the Greater London area was opened in 1965.
In March 1965 there were 97,000 private circuit stations not connected with
the public exchange networks. These are associated with circuits rented for
private use for telephone conversations, teleprinter connections, photo¬
telegraphy, television, music, or for the transmission of signals which
represent data for computers or operate other devices.
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post
Office has 11 coast radio stations in the United Kingdom. These stations
provide radiotelegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea
at ranges of up to some 500 and 300 miles respectively. There is also the
long-distance radiotelegraph station, Portishead-Radio, which communicates
with ships in all parts of the wTorld.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with
safety of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radio¬
telegraph and radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or
aircraft and take immediate action to obtain assistance for any vessel in
distress. During 1964-65 the stations handled 695 urgent and SOS calls
from ships and aircraft.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange
radiotelegrams with ships and connect radiotelephone calls between telephone
subscribers ashore and suitably equipped ships; they also broadcast naviga¬
tional warnings and weather bulletins.
The stations also operate a free medical advice service whereby the Master
of a ship of any nationality may obtain advice from appropriate medical
authorities on the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury aboard
ship. During 1964-65 the stations dealt with 423 medical inquiries in this
service.
The first transatlantic telephone cable, to the United States and Canada, was

and Wireless Ltd., is taking part in the extension of the Commonwealth
submarine cable links. The first of these (Cantai), which links Britain with
Canada, was laid and opened in 1961; the second link, between Australia and
New Zealand, started working in 1962 and the trans-Pacific link between
Canada and New Zealand (Compac) towards the end of 1963; these links
provide a 16,000-mile all-Commonwealth connection between London and
Sydney. A second cable to the United States from Britain came into use in
1963. A further route to Canada was established by the linking of the Scotice
cable (Scotland-Iceland) with the Icecan cable (Iceland-Canada) towards the
end of 1962 but at present this transatlantic routing is used only for special
services. The transatlantic cables supply 96 public telephone circuits from
Britain to the United States, 34 to Canada, 79 circuits linking the United
States and Canada with Europe, and a number of telegraph channels. The
first two sections of the Commonwealth South-East Asia cable (Seacom)
linking Singapore, Sabah and Hong Kong were opened in 1965. The complete
Seacom system, linking Singapore and Malaysia with Hong Kong and
Australia, is expected to be finished by the end of 1966.
Many more circuits between Britain and Europe have been provided by
four new cables laid across the North Sea since 1964. Two further cables will
be laid by 1967.

Research on the use for long distance communications of satellites, with a
probable capacity of 1,000 circuits, is being done in co-operation with the
United States and in consultation with Commonwealth countries.
In 1962 a satellite communications earth station was brought into operation
at Goonhilly Downs, in Cornwall, and it participated in the first television
transmissions via the Telstar satellite; it subsequently worked writh the Relay
satellite. Experiments and demonstrations were carried out over these two
satellites until September 1964 when the 85 ft. diameter fully steerable
parabolic aerial was taken out of service to modify it for the Early Bird
project. Early Bird was launched in April 1965 and the Goonhilly earth
station took part, from the outset, in the first tests with this synchronous
satellite in preparation for the operational transmission of telecommunications
traffic via a satellite across the Atlantic.

FINANCE
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities (i.e. the central
Government and local authorities) finance their activities—how their expendi¬
ture is decided upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Money administered by public authorities1 can be roughly divided into
two categories:
1. The funds of the central Government, raised mainly by taxation, but
also in part by borrowing, and paid into and out of the Exchequer2 in
accordance with the proposals of the Government, as approved by
Parliament (principally the House of Commons).
There are also funds administered for special purposes by central
government departments and wholly or partially maintained by receipts
which do not pass through the Exchequer. The most important one is
the National Insurance Fund, administered by the Minister of Pensions
and National Insurance and used for the payment of benefits under the
National Insurance Scheme.
2. The funds of local authorities, obtained partly from rates (local taxes
on dwelling houses and other real estate) and income from property
and trading receipts, partly from grants and loans from the Exchequer,
and partly from loans raised in the open market (see p. 74).
The following broad account of government finance is concerned mainly
with the Exchequer and only incidentally with local government and other
public funds.
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law,
parliamentary rights and custom.
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the
principle that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was
gradually evolved. The principle was established, at the end of the constitu¬
tional struggles of the Stuart period, by the Bill of Rights 1689.
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once
the King was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, he was free
to spend it as he chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the House
of Commons gradually developed the modern system of controlling expendi¬
ture through the device of Appropriation which was embodied in the
Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866.
From the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such
financial control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of
Commons. This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seven¬
teenth century, but as regards expenditure it was not effective until the
nineteenth century. The controlling power of the House of Commons is
1/<?r ^ account of public finance in Northern Ireland and its relationship to that
of the United Kingdom, see p. 406.
The term Exchequer took its name from the ‘chess-board’, or table with chequered
cloth, round which the King’s financial officials sat for accounting purposes in the
twelfth century.

acknowledged today in the Speech from the Throne at the opening of a new
session of Parliament, which is addressed to both Houses but contains a
special paragraph on expenditure addressed to the Commons alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power
to modify financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions; thus,
to minimise the chance of rejection, the practice was started in 1861 of
embodying the main financial provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill.
Since the passing of the Parliament Act 1911, however, a Bill certified by the
Speaker to be a Money Bill may be presented to the Queen for the Royal
Assent and become law without the consent of the House of Lords if it has
not been passed by them within one month (see p. 39).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all
expenditure by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue
by taxation or borrowing. All government revenue, other than sums received
by government departments in the course of their normal activities (known
as appropriations-in-aid), is paid into the government account with the
Bank of England—known as the Exchequer Account or the Consolidated
Fund. With certain exceptions (the main one, as previously stated, being
National Insurance benefits), all payments by the Government come out of
this account.
The following sections outline the machinery by which expenditure and
revenue are authorised and controlled, the purposes on which public money
is spent and the sources from which revenue is obtained.
Central government expenditure falls into two main groups:
1. Expenditure which is specifically authorised by Acts of Parliament other
than annual Appropriation Acts. This expenditure includes the loans
made by the Government to nationalised industries, local authorities
and other public and private concerns for which the Treasury has
specific statutory authority to borrow. It also includes the Consolidated
Fund Standing Services which represent a permanent charge on the
Consolidated Fund, covering the interest on and cost of management of
the National Debt, the financial provision made for members of the
royal family, and salaries and pensions of judges and certain high
officers whose independence of the Government is thought to be better
guaranteed by permanent grant than by annual vote.
2. All other government expenditure is authorised by annual Appro¬
priation Acts and includes expenditure on defence, on the social services
and on the general administration of the country. These are called Supply
Services because the House of Commons, when voting money, is
granting to the Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are required to satisfy . . .
the pecuniary necessities of the Government’. It should be noted that
some of this expenditure may also depend on legislation, such as the
National Health Sendee Acts, which relates to a specific object of
expenditure.
The Estimates for these Supply Sendees are considered by the House of
Commons in Committee of Supply (that is, in Committee of the whole House
with the Chairman of Ways and Means, instead of the Speaker, in the Chair).
The committee usually discusses general questions of policy relevant to the
Estimates, though any Estimate may be examined in detail if members wish
and if time allows (see p. 41).
FINANCE 299
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on ist April
are submitted to the Treasury by each department in the preceding December.
Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called ‘Votes’ which
are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House of Commons
approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later confirmed
in the Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the money to specific Votes.
Within each Vote, ‘virement’, that is, the spending of money on one subhead
instead of on another, is permissible so far as Parliament is concerned, but
only with Treasury consent. The Service departments may spend money on
one Vote instead of another, but only with Treasury sanction which, in turn,
requires the retrospective authorisation of Parliament. Departments are free
to distribute expenditure within subheads as they please subject to Treasury
approval of the type of expenditure involved.
An insufficient Estimate, or a new service not covered by the Vote, or
virement of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should
be brought to the attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate.
The Treasury exercises the same power of scrutiny over this as over the
ordinary Estimates.
Scrutiny of Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller
Expenditure and Auditor General, and by the Public Accounts and Estimates Committees
of the House of Commons.
The Treasury The power of the Treasury to control expenditure derives from the res¬
ponsibility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the financial policy of the
Government.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the
House of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by departments,
the Treasury has to look at the proposals for expenditure in relation to
prospective national resources and to weigh the advantages of administrative
proposals against the monetary and economic cost, taking into account
current government policy; to decide the relative merits of expenditure
proposed by different departments; and to eliminate any overlapping,
uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where this has escaped the net of depart¬
mental financial control. Quite apart from the scrutiny of Estimates, through¬
out the year the Treasury keeps a close control over such matters as rates
of pay and the aggregate size of the staff in all government departments, in
addition to exercising a general supervision over all departmental expenditure.
The Treasury also lays down general rules of financial and accounting
procedure for departments and prescribes the principles on which depart¬
mental contracts shall be made and the limits within which losses may be
written off.
In 1961 the Plowden Committee on the Control of Public Expenditure
recommended in their Report {Cmnd. 1432) that regular surveys should be
made of public expenditure as a whole over a period of years ahead and in
relation to prospective resources, and that decisions involving future expendi¬
ture should be taken in the light of these surveys. Surveys, therefore, are now
made annually and hav.e become an established part of the Government’s
machinery for the appraisal and control of expenditure. Expenditure in the
public sector, excluding the nationalised industries, is currently being related
to the prospective increase in national production.

appointment with the status of an officer of the House of Commons. Since
1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller of the Exchequer he controls
receipts and issues of public money to and from the Exchequer Account;
and as Auditor General he audits departmental accounts and submits his
report on the Appropriation Accounts and other accounts, as required by
statute, to Parliament. His statutory function is to ensure that all expenditure
is properly incurred, e.g., that no payments are made which go beyond any
relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury sanction has been obtained
wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has been encouraged by
successive Committees of Public Accounts (see the next paragraph) to
examine departmental expenditure with a view to drawing attention to any
cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The accounts of each department and the reports on the accounts made by
the Comptroller and Auditor General are considered by a select committee
called the Public Accounts Committee. This was first set up in 1861, on the
motion of Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of ensuring that expenditure was
properly incurred in accordance with the purpose for which it was voted and
with any relevant Acts of Parliament. The terms of reference of the committee
are to examine the accounts and these terms have been widely interpreted by
successive committees which have investigated whether full value has been
obtained for the sums spent by departments and have examined cases in which
the administration appears to have been faulty or negligent. The committee
has therefore become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste and
inefficiency. It embodies its findings in reports which may be debated in
the House of Commons. Its recommendations are considered by the Treasury
in consultation with departments and put into effect, so far as they are
accepted, according to Treasury instructions. A reply to each report is
submitted by the Treasury to the committee of the following session and
where the recommendations have been unacceptable to the Treasury the
committee may either accept the objections or return to the charge in sub¬
sequent reports.
This committee was originally set up in 1912 and has been reappointed
annually except during the war years. In i960 it was made a select committee
set up each session under standing orders. The committee’s functions are
to examine the Estimates, to report how, if at all, the policy implied in the
Estimates can be carried out more economically and to consider the principal
variations between the Estimates of the current year and those of the previous
year and the form in which the Estimates should be presented. Usually,
the committee selects each year a few Votes for review.
Through the medium of seven sub-committees, the committee carries out
extensive investigations into the departments under consideration. In practice
the Estimates for the current year are not affected, but the committee’s
recommendations produce changes in future Estimates and strengthen
Treasury control. In i960 a sub-committee was set up to examine the spring
supplementary estimates and the principal variations between the estimates
presented and those of the previous year. Additional parliamentary time has
been allocated for discussion of the reports of the Estimates and the Public
Accounts Committees.
‘Budget’ is an old word meaning a bag containing papers or accounts. The
use of the word in public finance originated in the expression ‘The Chancellor
of the Exchequer opened his Budget’, which was applied in Parliament to
Budget Policy
Kr^

the annual speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining his proposals
for balancing revenue and expenditure.
The Budget speech is normally the main occasion of the year for reviewing
the Exchequer finances and the economic state of the nation, and its formal
basis is the Chancellor’s proposals for raising money by taxation. By the
time the Budget is introduced (usually in April) the Estimates of expenditure
under various headings will have been presented to Parliament and published,
and the expected total of government expenditure for the year will be known.
The Chancellor estimates the yield of the revenue on the basis of existing
taxation and proposes such changes in taxation as he considers desirable on
economic grounds. These proposals are later embodied in detail in a Finance
Bill. The interval between the Budget Statement and the Royal Assent to
the Finance Bill (usually given in July) is covered by the Provisional Collection
of Taxes Act 1913, whereby changes in income tax and customs and excise
duties have immediate statutory effect if adopted by Resolution of the House
of Commons. In 1957 the Act was extended to include purchase tax.
The Budget speech also gives figures relating to loans from the Consolidated
Fund for which the Government has statutory power to borrow. In 1964-65
over half the net issues from this fund were loans to nationalised industries;
about a quarter were loans to other public bodies, largely the local authorities;
the remainder were loans to overseas governments, private industry, housing
associations, and other bodies. Since 1961 they have been set out in a White
Paper1 issued immediately before the Budget.
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money
for government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated
that taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and the
level of expenditure on particular goods and services. At a later period it was
realised that taxation also affected the nation’s total expenditure and
therefore the general level of economic activity. Since the second world war,
Budgets have been consciously designed in greater or lesser degree to bring
the total demand for goods and services into balance with the supplies which
could be made available.
Direct taxation on income and property affects the distribution of wealth
because the rates vary according to the size of income and property, the
proportion of a high income taken in tax being much greater than the propor¬
tion of a small one; at the same time, the services provided by the Government
(whether in cash or kind) are generally available to all, irrespective of wealth,
but in some cases they are specially designed to benefit people with lower
incomes. Indirect taxes, or taxes on expenditure (see p. 403), do not affect
the distribution of income; their main purpose has always been the raising
of revenue, but by discouraging or encouraging consumption of particular
goods they can be used to influence the allocation of resources and the
pattern of trade.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure and, therefore, the
total demand for goods and services in the following way: if there is an
increase in government expenditure without an increase in taxation then
total demand for goods and services will tend to rise; the same thing will
1 In 1965 the title of this White Paper was altered to Loans from the Consolidated
Fund 1965-66 (formerly it was known as Government Expenditure Below the Line).
This follows from changes in the presentation of the Exchequer Accounts, giving
less prominence to the concept of ‘the Line’, which distinguished between expenditure
which can be met from borrowing and all other expenditure.

happen if there is a decrease in taxation without a decrease in government
spending. In this way the Budget can be used to counter unemployment.
On the other hand, if there is an increase in taxation without an increase
in government expenditure or a decrease in government expenditure without
a decrease in taxation then the total demand for goods and services will
tend to fall. In this way the Budget can be used to counter inflation or deflation.
For example, the aim of the Budget of April 1959, which provided for some
important reductions in taxation, was to give a further stimulus to economic
activity. The i960 Budget was designed to consolidate and fortify the progress
of the economy, and that of 1961 to counter inflation and encourage exports.
The 1962 Budget’s aim was to keep the economic position in balance. The
purpose of the 1963 and 1964 Budgets was to contribute towards achieving
the target of a 4 per cent growth rate in the national economy: in 1963 by
giving a stimulus to demand and in 1964 by restraining consumption. A
second Budget was introduced in the autumn of 1964 to give effect to the
Government’s proposals to improve the balance of payments (see p. 434) and
to adjust the level of demand. The 1965 Budget aimed at reducing the net
outflow of long-term capital and decreasing the pressure on domestic
resources.
Money to meet ‘Ordinary’ (mainly current) Budget expenditure of the
central Government is in normal years derived from taxation. Taxes can be
divided into two groups, direct and indirect, which correspond roughly to
the duties collected by the Board of Inland Revenue and by the Board of
Customs and Excise. The most important inland revenue duties—income tax
(including surtax), profits tax and estate duty (death duty)—are levied directly
on the income or property of those who, in general, have to bear them.
Income tax on individual (though not on corporate) incomes and estate duty
are progressive taxes, that is, larger incomes and estates bear a proportionately
higher rate of tax. A capital gains tax was introduced in 1965 on gains
accruing after 6th April, 1965 on the disposal of most assets. A corporation
tax will come into operation in April 1966, replacing the profits tax and the
income tax levied on companies. Stamp duties, although not a direct tax, are
also collected by the Board of Inland Revenue.
Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April. The standard rate was increased for the year 1965-66 from
7s. 9d. in the £ to 8s. 3d. in the £ (41-25 per cent). The tax imposed on an
individual is graduated by means of personal allowances and reliefs, by
reduced rates of tax on the first sections of taxable income1 and by the surtax.2
In the case of a married couple the incomes of husband and wife are aggregated
and are treated as one income, but higher allowances are given than for a
single person. Earned income bears less tax than other income as certain
fractional deductions (‘earned income relief’) are allowable.
1 The balance of income remaining after deduction of the personal allowances and
reliefs is taxable income. For 1965-66 the reduced rates are: 4s. od. in the £ on the
first £100; and 6s. od. in the £ on the next £200. The remainder is charged at the
standard rate.
2 The surtax, which is essentially an income tax at higher rates, is charged on personal
incomes exceeding £2,000 a year after deducting certain personal allowances in excess
of the single person’s basic allowance. In addition, the same earned income relief as
for income tax and a special earnings allowance (not exceeding £2,006) are deductible
from earned income only. Surtax is imposed at rates which increase progressively
until for a single person (for 1964-65) on investment income above £100,000 a year,
income tax and surtax combined amount to 17s. ijd. in the £.

Indirect Taxes
A single person earning £ 1,000 a year pays j£i86 in income tax, while a
married couple with the same earned income pay ^137; if the couple have
two children under the age of 11, their tax falls to ^52; when the children
are between the ages of 11 and 16, the tax is only £37; if the children are
over 16 and receiving full-time education, only £22 is paid. The range of
tax payable by a single person varies from, for example, £41 on an earned
income of £500 a year to £1,515 on an earned income of £5,000; if the income
is unearned, tax liability on £500 will be £54, and on £5,000 will be
£2,433-
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay-as-
you-earn’) scheme, under which tax is deducted at source, thus enabling
them to keep up to date on tax payments.
Companies are liable to income tax at the standard rate of tax on their total
income irrespective of its amount and to a profits tax at the rate of 15 per cent.
The rate at which the corporation tax (see p. 402) will apply will be fixed in
the 1966 Budget.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons (including
companies) resident in the United Kingdom. The main exceptions are that
interest on certain United Kingdom government securities belonging to
persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is exempt; and
income from certain classes of possessions abroad is chargeable not on the
amount of income arising but on the amount of income remitted to the United
Kingdom. The United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many
countries providing for relief from double taxation; where such agreements
are not in force unilateral relief is allowed.1
Estate duty is chargeable on the value of property (whether legally settled or
not) which passes or is deemed to pass at death. Thus, it is not limited to
property owned by the deceased. It may, for example, extend to trust funds
to the income of which the deceased was entitled during his lifetime, and to
gifts made by the deceased within five years of his death (one year in the case
of a gift for public or charitable purposes). Estates with a net capital value of
£5,000 or less are exempt from duty, but on estates of a higher value there
is a progressive duty ranging from 1 per cent to 80 per cent.
Indirect taxes or taxes on expenditure are levied on commodities or services.
They are called indirect because the importer, manufacturer, wholesaler, or
provider of commodities or services pays them first and then adjusts his
prices to his customers accordingly.
Customs and excise duties form the largest group of indirect taxes. Customs
duties are levied on imported goods, and excise duties on goods produced,
and services provided, at home. The purchase tax, which is also collected
by the Board of Customs and Excise, applies equally, and at the same rate,
to home-produced and to imported goods.
The system of customs duties is twofold in its purpose: it has the function
of providing a measure of protection for British industries or preference for
products imported from Commonwealth countries overseas and it has also
the function, in association with the excise system, of providing revenue.
The major part of the revenue collected by the Board of Customs and Excise
accrues from the duties on tobacco, hydrocarbon oils and alcoholic drinks

and from the purchase tax. There are other smaller revenue duties, for instance,
on betting and matches. The protective customs duties cover a wide range of
goods but the revenue from them accounts for about 5 per cent only of the
total yield of indirect taxation.
Purchase tax is charged on a wide range of goods, nearly all of them con¬
sumer goods, at three rates, 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 25 per cent of the
wholesale value. Articles subject to revenue duties of customs and excise are
in general exempt from this tax; other goods free of purchase tax include
food (other than confectionery, soft drinks and ice cream), fuel, books and
newspapers, young children’s clothing and footwear, certain non-proprietary
drugs and medicines, some household appliances and textiles. Since 1961
the Chancellor of the Exchequer has had power to vary by order the rate of
purchase tax and of the other main customs and excise duties (except the
protective duties) by up to 10 per cent in either direction. In the 1964 Finance
Act this power was amended so as to allow one or more of the five groups of
indirect taxes, that is, tobacco, alcohol, oil, purchase tax and the minor
revenue duties, to be excluded from its use. Provision was also made for the
surcharges or rebates to be applied at different percentages for different
groups. This power is intended to be a regulator of the economy and requires
annual renewal.
Taxes on motor vehicles, which are also treated as indirect taxes, are
collected by the local taxation authorities (the county or county borough
councils in England and Wales and the corresponding councils in Scotland);
the proceeds are paid by the local authorities into the Exchequer.
In the Budget of April 1965-66 total expenditure for the financial year
ending 31st March, 1966, was estimated to reach .£8,482 million, including
£1,348 million for Consolidated Fund Standing Services and £7,134 million
for Supply Services. The estimate for total revenue (after allowing for the
Budget changes) was £9,026 million of which £8,199 million was receipts
from taxation. There was therefore a surplus of £544 million. Loans from
the Consolidated Fund (see p. 401) to industry were estimated to reach £743
million and for other purposes £525 million. After allowing for the surplus
of revenue over expenditure, there was an estimated deficit of £724 million
to be met by Exchequer borrowing and special transactions.
Table 25 shows the Budget estimates for 1965-66 in comparison with the
outturn (Exchequer receipts and issues) for the previous year and Table 26
gives a general functional analysis of the Estimates.
Capital expenditure dealt with in the Budget statement consists chiefly of
loans from the Consolidated Fund to the nationalised industries, the local
authorities and other public bodies, such as the New Towns Development
Corporations; it also includes loans under the Export Guarantees Acts and
loans for overseas assistance. If, on balance, there is a deficit on capital
expenditure, it is met from the proceeds of government borrowing and
special transactions, for instance, borrowing from the Exchange Equalisation
Account, from extra-budgetary funds such as the National Insurance Fund,
or from the surplus, if any, in revenue and expenditure; while if there is a
surplus it goes to reduce the National Debt.
Exchequer borrowing may be in the form of direct borrowing from the
public either through the National Savings Movement (see p. 412) or by
borrowing on the market by means of new issues of securities. New issues of
government securities are made from time to time for the purpose of

refinancing maturing issues (conversion issues) or to raise new money (issues
for cash). Since 1956 capital requirements of the nationalised industries have
been met in full by the Exchequer, while those of the local authorities are met
partly by the Exchequer through the Public Works Loan Board (see p. 76)
and partly by the local authorities borrowing direct from the public in the
form of mortgages or stock issues.

So far, borrowing on a large scale has been undertaken only to finance deficits
during or immediately after a war. The National Debt rose from ^651 million
in 1914 to ^7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7,131
million in 1939 to £23,637 million in 1946. On the 31st March, 1965, the
total National Debt was £30,438 million, of which £1,806 million was
repayable in currencies other than sterling, mainly to the United States and
Canadian Governments. Of the £27,699 million of internal debt, £5,016
million was short-term debt, mainly in the form of 91-day Treasury bills,
while the long-term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds, loans, and
certificates carrying fixed rates of interest (ranging from to 6 per cent)
and with fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole, under
which public revenues, with a few minor exceptions, are paid into the
Exchequer, from which no money can be withdrawn except on the authority
of Parliament. That authority is expressed in the case of Consolidated Fund
charges in permanent legislative form, and in the case of Supply Services by
annual Appropriation Acts based on estimates prepared by departments and
sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major portion of taxation (customs duties and most excise duties,
purchase tax, income tax, surtax and profits tax) is imposed by the United
Kingdom Parliament over the whole country, and is paid, in the first instance,
into the United Kingdom Exchequer. From the amount attributable to
Northern Ireland, known as ‘Reserved’ Revenue, there is deducted and
retained by the United Kingdom Treasury, under the Government of Ireland
Act 1920, the sum contributed by Northern Ireland towards Imperial
Services (called the ‘Imperial Contribution’), the cost of the administration
of the Supreme Court, and other Reserved Services, and the cost of collecting
Reserved Revenue. The balance, termed the ‘Residuary Share of Reserved
Taxes’ is paid over to the Exchequer of Northern Ireland and joins with the
proceeds of taxes levied and collected by the Government of Northern Ireland,

amount of the Imperial Contribution, and such other questions affecting
the financial relations of the two Governments as may be referred to it.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Bank of
England
In the Northern Ireland Budget for 1965-66 (year ending 31st March), total
revenues were forecast at £177 million and expenditure at £173 million.
After allowing for the Imperial Contribution, provisionally estimated at
^3*5 million, there was a Budget surplus of £57,960.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £140 million on 31st
March, 1965, is fully covered by repayable advances and investments held
by the Ministry of Finance.
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland, various funds have
been established, in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for
specific purposes. In general, these funds follow the United Kingdom pattern,
the principal funds being those relating to National Insurance and govern¬
ment loans. The latter constitutes a pool of capital money available mainly
for local and public authority borrowings; on 31st March, 1965, a sum of
approximately £123 million was outstanding against such borrowers.
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It
comprises a central bank; commercial banks which carry on the usual main
banking services; the United Kingdom offices of various banks whose main
business is in other countries; and various specialised banks and similar
financial institutions.1
The Bank of England is the central bank and its principal business is to act
as banker to the Government and to the other banks, as the agent of the
Government for important financial operations and as the central note¬
issuing authority; it also maintains relations with central banks overseas. It
was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a corporate
body, and its entire capital stock was acquired by the Government under
the Bank of England Act 1946.
As the central bank, the Bank of England is responsible for co-ordinating
the application of the Government’s monetary policy. One of the main instru¬
ments for this purpose is the Bank Rate—the minimum rate at which the
Bank of England will discount approved bills of exchange and a key factor in
the general pattern of interest rates.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England holds the main
government accounts and it acts as the Government’s agent for the issue and
registration of government loans. It also operates, as agent for the Treasury,
the administration of exchange control which has been in force since 1939.
The commercial banks maintain large balances with the Bank of England
and these balances form part of the banks’ cash reserves. In addition, under
an arrangement made with the London clearing banks and Scottish banks in
1958, the Bank of England might call on these banks for ‘special deposits’
which, not being freely disposable, do not rank as part of their liquid assets.
Deposits under this scheme, designed to restrict the liquidity of the banking
system should the need arise, were made with the Bank of England between
June i960 and December 1962 and again in May 1965. The Bank of England
has also given guidance on a number of occasions to the main banking and
financial organisations on the advances policy the authorities wish them
to adopt.
1 For a detailed description of the British financial system see the Report of the
[Radcliffe] Committee on the Working of the Monetary System (Cmnd. 827), published
in August 1959.
FINANCE
409
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. Notes thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold and securities,
together with a limited amount of coin, the part covered by securities and
coin being the Fiduciary Issue’, the level of which is subject to parliamentary
control. In practice very little gold is now held by the Issue Department of
the Bank of England, the bulk of the United Kingdom gold (and foreign
exchange) reserves being in a separate government fund, known as the
Exchange Equalisation Account; this account was originally established in
1932 for the purpose of checking undue fluctuations in the exchange value of
sterling, and is operated by the Bank of England as agent for the Treasury.
The provision of coin for circulation is the responsibility of a government
department, the Royal Mint.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The
Commercial
Banks
The banks handling the major part of the domestic banking business in the
United Kingdom are limited liability companies which, in the main, are
subject to the ordinary law relating to such companies.
Some of the main features of the United Kingdom commercial banks
are:
1. A relatively small number of banks control a large number of branches.
United Kingdom members of the British Bankers’ Association include
ii London clearing banks,1 5 banks in Scotland and 3 in Northern
Ireland; they control some 13,000 branches and had total net deposits of
over £9,250 million at the end of 1964.
2. The volume of cheques handled is very large and, in spite of a stamp
duty of 2d. on each cheque, many payments—and even relatively small
payments—are made by cheque. The average monthly value of cheques,
drafts, bills and bankers’ effects cleared in 1964 through the London
and Provincial Clearing Houses was £29,889 million; and many cheques
do not, for various reasons, pass through clearing houses. In addition,
a growing volume of payments is effected through the credit transfer
scheme introduced in i960: the average monthly value of the credit
clearing through the London Clearing House in 1964 was £657
million.
3. It is the practice of the London clearing banks to maintain a ratio of
about 8 per cent between cash reserves and total deposits2 (of which
rather more than a half are repayable on demand, the remainder being
mainly deposits at interest and subject to notice).
The banks make advances to customers partly in the form of overdrafts
and partly in the form of loans (with or without collateral security); in
either case, the advance is normally for a short term only unless renewed.
The ratio of London clearing bank advances to total deposits declined
from about 43 per cent in 1938 to about 17 per cent at the end of the
war, but gradually climbed back to settle down to a level of 26 to 30 per
cent for a number of years from 1951. After the withdrawal in 1958 of
official requests to the banks to restrict the level of their advances, the
percentage again moved up, and by July 1961, when the banks were
again asked to restrain their lending, was over 47 per cent. In May 1965
the ratio of advances to total deposits was 53-5 per cent, well above
the 1938 level. The diagram on p. 409 shows the relative size of bank
advances outstanding in recent years to different sectors of the economy.
The increase in the volume of advances since 1958 has been accom¬
panied by innovations in bank lending practice, including the
introduction of schemes for personal loans repayable by fixed monthly
instalments over periods up to two years, and facilities for limited service
accounts at low cost. Another development was the acquisition by many
banks of share capital in hire-purchase finance companies.
4. Certain banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland have retained limited
rights to issue notes; these issues, apart from an amount specified by
legislation for each bank, must be fully covered by Bank of England
notes and by coin.
1 Three of these banks are members of the London Clearing House but have head¬
quarters outside London (at Liverpool and Manchester).
2 Until 1963 it was a convention that at least 30 per cent of deposits should be covered
by cash and other liquid securities; but since then this ratio has been varied, and now
stands at 28 per cent.
FINANCE 4H
The importance of London as a financial and trading centre and as the largest
city of the British Commonwealth has encouraged many banks whose main
business is in other Commonwealth countries and foreign countries to
maintain London offices1; in some cases, indeed, the institutions concerned
are United Kingdom companies and the London office is the head office.
These London offices form part of the complex structure engaged in the
financing of trade not only between Britain and other countries but also in
connection with trade between third countries.
The Merchant The merchant banks have helped to give London an international reputation
Banks as a world financial centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. They
are of two kinds, and are known as accepting houses and issuing houses,
according to whether they specialise predominantly in the work of acceptance
credit2 or in transactions involving the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf
of their customers. They participate in the issue of long and short-term loans
to governments of, or concerns in, overseas countries in sterling (where
permitted by exchange control regulations) or in other currencies which have
been deposited with them; this latter type of transaction has increased con¬
siderably in recent years. They are also engaged in the work of the gold and
foreign exchange markets, and they have many other functions in connection
with the financing of trade, investment management, and the insurance
world.
United
Kingdom
Offices of Banks

Overseas
The Discount The main business of the discount market consists of trading in and holding
Market commercial bills of exchange, United Kingdom Government Treasury bills
and other short-term securities. In recent years holdings of commercial bills
have increased considerably. In 1964 they accounted for about one-quarter
of the assets of the discount market, the remainder of its assets being short¬
term bonds and Treasury bills in roughly the same proportions. Tenders
for Treasury bills are invited by the Government each week and the firms
which comprise the discount market acquire the bulk of their Treasury bills
in this way. They finance the purchase of the bills and securities they hold,
chiefly by loans from the banks; about half of these loans come from the
London clearing banks, and most of the remainder from other United
Kingdom and overseas banks. In the main these loans and deposits may be
called in at any time.
The commercial banks do not, in the ordinary way, buy Treasury bills
at the weekly tenders except on behalf of customers, but they purchase, from
the discount market, bills which have been taken up by the market and held
until they become of a maturity required by the banks.
The Bank of England acts as lender of last resort to the twelve members of
the London discount market. The clearing banks do not borrow money
directly from the Bank of England; if they need to add to their cash resources
they call in part of their loans to the discount market. If, as a result, any
particular discount house is unable to cover its needs for cash elsewhere, it is
obliged to borrow from the Bank of England, normally at bank rate. Since the
beginning of 1963 the Bank of England has reaffirmed its right to charge a

2 Acceptance credit has been defined as fundamentally a three-month operation
financing exports from and imports to Britain and to other markets. The expression
is derived from the method of financing trade by which commercial bills are ‘accepted’
or guaranteed by a merchant bank against documents, after which they may be
discounted for cash by a discount house.

rate higher than bank rate, in order to allow more flexibility in its control of
short-term interest rates.
Savings Banks
and the
National
Savings
Movement
The function of Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank is
to provide readily available facilities for the investment of small savings. Both
these types of banks were already well established during the nineteenth
century. The growth of their business was, however, encouraged in the first
world war when the War Savings Committee was set up under government
auspices to promote an official savings drive. A new type of long-term security
for the small investor was inaugurated at that time. This was the National
Savings Certificate, encashable at par at any time, with interest payable only
on encashment, but free of income tax. From this war-time drive originated
the present National Savings Movement, which encourages the widespread
investment of savings in Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings
Bank and in National Savings securities. The movement is led by the National
Savings Committee for England and Wales and similar committees for Scot¬
land and Northern Ireland.1 The committees are bodies of independent
persons representing regional savings organisations and various national
institutions connected with such matters as finance, industry and education.
They are assisted by a salaried staff of civil servants. Voluntary local savings
committees, often assisted or promoted by local authorities, co-ordinate the
work of voluntary local savings groups.
Three National Savings securities are now on sale: the National Savings
Certificate, the National Development Bond, and the Premium Savings Bond.
The National Development Bond was first issued in May 1964 (when it
replaced the Defence Bond). National Development Bonds are repayable at
par on one month’s notice; interest is half-yearly and is taxable. Premium
Savings Bonds, which were first issued in 1956, give investors (after an initial
period of three months and thereafter monthly) a chance to win prizes ranging
from £25 to £5,000 instead of receiving interest. At the end of June 1965,
£502-4 million was invested in this form of savings. Nearly all British govern¬
ment securities are held on the Post Office Register and can also be bought or
sold at most post offices in the United Kingdom.
Trustee Savings Banks are managed by boards of honorary trustees and
managers; the greater part of the funds deposited with them are ordinary
deposits which are withdrawable on demand or at short notice. These
deposits are invested with the National Debt Commissioners, and the
Government is responsible to the trustees for the repayment of the money so
invested, with accrued interest, as and when required. In certain circum¬
stances, Trustee Savings Banks also accept deposits of up to £3,000 for
special investment. These deposits, which may receive a higher rate of
interest than ordinary deposits, are invested by the trustees under the
supervision of the National Debt Commissioners, but the Government is not
responsible to the trustees for the repayment of these investments. There
are about 1,350 Trustee Offices controlled by 80 independent banks and
depositors number over million. At the end of June 1965 deposits in
the Ordinary Departments of the Trustee Savings Banks totalled £1,037-5
million and deposits of the Special Investment Departments totalled £951,2
million.
1 The Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance is responsible for the administration
of Ulster Savings, but the furtherance and organisation of the savings movement in
Northern Ireland is the concern of a central voluntary committee, which is assisted
by county and local committees and district groups, all of a voluntary nature.

Ihe Post Office Savings Bank, which celebrated its centenary in 1961, is
the largest organisation of its kind in the world. It has over 22 million
active accounts; in June 1965 total balances, which carry a government
guarantee, amounted to £1,838-4 million, roughly £83 per depositor. Through
a centralised system of accounting, a depositor can pay in money or make a
withdrawal at any one of some 20,000 post offices throughout the country.
The Post Office Savings Bank pays only a low rate of interest (2^ per cent) on
its ordinary deposits but in April 1965 the intention was announced to introduce
‘Investment Accounts’ which would pay a higher rate of interest if a minimum
balance is maintained and one month’s notice of withdrawal is given.
A person may have deposits in only one Trustee Savings Bank and his
holdings in the ordinary department is limited to .£5,000. He may also hold
UP to j£5>000 in Post Office Savings Bank. The maximum amount of
National Savings Certificates which may be held by any one person is at
present £600 worth of the current (eleventh) issue, introduced in May 1963,
in addition to holdings of previous issues, and £1,000 worth of Premium
Savings Bonds. The limit on individual holdings of the current issue of
National Development Bonds is £2,500. By June 1965 National Savings had
reached a total of £8,414 million, about a quarter of the National Debt.

The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed a deposit and loan department
about the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to engage in
banking was legally defined in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of
1876. The primary purpose of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank was
to serve the co-operative movement, whose financial centre it has become,
but the clients of the bank now include trade unions and other mutual societies,
local authorities and individual depositors. The bank’s headquarters are in
Manchester. The Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society, which has its
headquarters in Glasgow, has similarly engaged in banking since 1948.
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of
many special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which are supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are
mainly provided through the savings banks, finance corporations, hire-
purchase finance companies, the Stock Exchange, investment trusts, building
societies and the insurance market. The firms engaged in such activities are
in the main highly specialised, e.g., discount and other finance houses,
stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers.

Industry Limited
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited and the
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited, were set up in
1945 to assist in dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction and
development. Although the Government displayed considerable interest in
their formation, the corporations themselves are ordinary limited companies
with no official representation on their boards and having no recourse to
public funds. Another finance corporation, the Commonwealth Development
Finance Company Limited, was established in 1953 to assist development
projects in the Commonwealth. Among other financial corporations of note
are the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited, and the Scottish Agri¬
cultural Securities Corporation Limited.
The FCI was formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of
£200,000 and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of major
industries in the national interest with a view to promoting efficiency and
thereby assisting in the maintenance and increase of employment.
The FCI has an authorised and issued capital of £25 million and may
borrow up to four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of
£125 million. The share capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance
companies, 30 per cent by investment trust companies and 30 per cent by the
Bank of England. At 31st March, 1965, the capital called and paid up was
2 per cent (£500,000); the Bank of England paid £5 million in advance of call
in 1958-59. The liability of the shareholders in respect of the uncalled capital
represents security to the banks providing loans for the corporation’s working
capital.
The enterprises assisted by the FCI are concerned with a variety of products,
such as steel, oil, chemicals, shipping, diesel engines, and electrical components.
Industrial and The ICFC has a smaller issued capital than that of the FCI and has as its
Commercial Finance main object the provision of credit and finance by means of loan and share
Corporation Limited capital for industrial and commercial concerns in Great Britain, particularly
in cases where the existing facilities provided by banking institutions and the
Stock Exchange are not readily or easily available.
The authorised and issued share capital of the ICFC at 31st March, 1965
was £22-5 million paid up fully and a line of credit of £8-25 million, both
provided principally by the London clearing banks and the Scottish banks in
proportion to their size, with a token participation by the Bank of England.
In addition, public debenture issues have been made to a total of £30 million.
The current resources of the ICFC, including reserves shown in the balance
sheet, therefore total more than £72 million.
The corporation’s function is to provide finance in sums ranging between
£5,000 and £300,000 or more for small and medium-sized concerns. It has
13 branches established in large industrial cities through which it provides
services covering the whole of the country. By March 1965 the total amount
advanced by the corporation since its inception had exceeded £116 million. At
the same date its loans and investment holdings outstanding to 1,068
customers were over £66 million.

The Commonwealth Development Finance Company was set up in 1953 as
a new channel for the investment of private capital in Commonwealth
development schemes. Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of which
about 14^ million ‘A’ ordinary shares of (2s. paid) are held by industrial,
shipping, mining and banking interests in the United Kingdom, and nf
million ‘ B ’ ordinary shares of ^1 (10s. paid) are held by the Bank of England
and certain central banks in the Commonwealth. Commitments entered into
from its inception in 1953 up to the end of March 1965 amounted to the
sterling equivalent of approximately £31 million.
The primary function of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd.,
established in 1928, is to grant long-term loans against first mortgages on
agricultural lands and buildings in England and Wales. The share capital
was subscribed by the Bank of England and other banks, but the funds are
mainly derived from public issues of debentures, of which about £62 million
was outstanding in March 1965.
The Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Limited was established
in 1933 and fulfils broadly similar functions in Scotland. Its share capital
is subcribed by three Scottish banks.
There are 23 stock exchanges in the British Isles, of which 15 are in England
and Wales, five in Scotland, one in Northern Ireland and two in the Irish
Republic. In addition the Provincial Brokers’ Stock Exchange operates in
no cities and towns throughout Britain and the Irish Republic. The
Federation of Stock Exchanges in Great Britain and Ireland, comprising with
one exception all these organisations, was set up in July 1965 to co-ordinate
their work. Four of the Scottish stock exchanges are linked, as are also the
stock exchanges in the north of England.
The London Stock Exchange is by far the most important of these stock
exchanges and is one of the world’s two foremost free markets in securities.
Some 9,300 securities are quoted on the London Stock Exchange; at the
end of March 1965 these had a total market value of £75,000 million. Nearly
8,400 companies are quoted, including a number of leading overseas companies.
At nominal values 38 per cent of the securities represented company issues
and the remainder British and overseas government and corporation stocks;
at market values the proportion was about three-quarters.
The London Stock Exchange is linked by cable or telephone with stock
exchanges all over the world. Therefore, a quoted company, subject to any
limitations imposed by the exchange control regulations, has a world-wide
market for its issues. This is an important factor in the raising of new capital
by government and commercial borrowers. Arbitrage transactions by brokers
—the buying or selling of a particular security on one stock exchange with the
intention of reversing it on another—play an important part in equating
price differentials between different markets and maintaining a continual
flow of business between centres.
The stock exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains
are made between members reflect the interaction of supply and demand
for the securities concerned. All the stock exchanges operate under strict
rules of conduct which they formulate themselves.
In recent years there has been a constantly rising demand for ordinary
(equity) shares, partly in expectation that such shares will maintain their real
value or grow in value in periods of rising prices. Insurance companies and
pension funds now invest a larger proportion of their assets in these shares
than formerly, and the Trustee Investments Act of 1961 permits trustees,

under certain conditions, to invest up to half the funds they hold in trust in
equity shares.
The ownership of Stock Exchange securities in the United Kingdom is
much more widespread than formerly: it is estimated that there are about
3 million shareholders and that their shareholdings are widely distributed.
The largest public company in Britain has nearly 600,000 shareholders and
there are several others with more than 100,000.
Through investment trusts and unit trusts, investors may spread their risks
and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The ordinary type of investment trust is constituted as a public company
registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business is
to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies,
it may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits
to build up reserves. Investment trusts grew to importance in the latter half
of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital
towards overseas investment.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the securities. Normally, the managers
sell units to the public and invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of
Stock Exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly
by an initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit, and partly by a
semi-annual service charge which is taken usually out of the income of the
trust. The level of both charges is controlled by the Board of Trade, whose
authorisation is required before units can be offered to the public; this is
only granted if the Trust Deed is satisfactory to them.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at £80 million. This medium of saving
suffered a decline after the war, owing mainly to government restrictions
on new capital issues, but has grown considerably since 1957. At the end of
June 1965 there were 1-37 million unit holdings in 114 authorised unit trusts,
having total funds valued at ^446 million.
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by Friendly Societies and
trade unions, most insurance services in Britain are in the hands of either
mutual or joint stock companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.

premiums are collected at frequent intervals of two months or less by house to house
collection. It is conducted by both friendly societies (called collecting societies) and
companies, the former accounting for a net premium income of £35 million in 1963
and the latter for a further £185 million.

Table 27 shows the distribution of business in terms of net premium
income in 1963, the latest year for which figures are available.
There are over 350 insurance companies incorporated in the United Kingdom
but most of the business is in the hands of about 100 companies. Most
British insurers write several of the main classes of business although some
specialise in one class, particularly in life assurance where about 40 companies
write only that type of business. A few specialise in re-insurance.
In addition over 150 overseas companies carry on business (and even more
companies are represented) in the United Kingdom, thus emphasising the
international nature of the market. The natural centre of the market is in
London, but some of the large companies have their administrative head¬
quarters elsewhere.
In 1963 the total insurance funds of the British insurance companies and
collecting societies amounted to ,£11,000 million, the bulk of which is in
respect of life assurance business. With the growth of group pension schemes
the rate of accumulation of life funds is gradually increasing.
There is no government control over the investment policy of insurance
funds and these represent one of the most important sources of funds for
investment in commerce and industry. More than a third of the total assets
of British insurance companies are invested in equity shares and debentures,
and this proportion is gradually increasing.
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of underwriters in London. The name
‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late
seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century,
Lloyd’s coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business
and of intelligence about shipping movements. Although in its earlier history
the activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance
business, there has also been built up at Lloyd’s a very considerable world¬
wide market for the transaction of other classes of insurance business, except
life assurance of which the amount transacted at Lloyd’s is negligible.
Lloyd’s is now regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting
in 1871; the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are
administered by the Committee of Lloyd’s, which does not itself transact
insurance business.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business
is transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and
in competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through
Lloyd’s brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the
insured. Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact
insurance with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent
financial regulations laid down by the Committee of Lloyd’s, are permitted to
transact business at Lloyd’s; these financial safeguards give a security behind
the Lloyd’s policy which is second to none.
Today there are over 5,800 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped into
some 300 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents who
accept risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
In conjunction with its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a
world-wide organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on
behalf of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and
a valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance

business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London repre¬
sentatives of the latter.
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine insurance business comes
from abroad, partly by direct placing in London and partly from branches
and agencies established in over 100 countries. The basic principle of this
international business is that resources capable of meeting any potential loss
are instantly available for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the whole of the deposits, underwriting trust funds and
personal fortunes of Lloyd’s underwriters.
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on
the security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner occupation,
though loans are occasionally made on the security of commercial and
industrial premises and farms. The funds of building societies are derived
mainly from the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount
of share capital is not fixed; shares, which have a fixed value, are not dealt
with on the Stock Exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given.
The Building Societies Acts 1874 to 1962 prescribe the general way in
which societies must conduct their business. The Chief Registrar of Friendly
Societies has discretionary powers to stop a society either advertising or
accepting money from investors if he considers that the way in which the
society’s business is conducted is jeopardising investors’ money. The rapid
expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a
few very large societies. At the end of 1964, 635 societies were in operation,
with total assets of £4,863 million. Ten of the largest societies, however,
each with assets of over £100 million, account for 60 per cent of the total
funds. The amount advanced on mortgage in 1964 was £1,043 million, a
record total.

TRADE AND PAYMENTS
OVERSEAS TRADE
Although, relatively small in area and accounting for less than 2 per cent of
the world’s population, the United Kingdom is the world’s third largest
trading nation, conducting nearly io per cent of international trade.
In the nineteenth century Britain attained a pre-eminent position in
international trade. At the end of the century Britain’s share of exports of
manufactures entering into world trade was about 33 per cent. Its share of
world imports of all goods was somewhat larger than that of world exports,
as imports into Britain were paid for both by exports of goods and by interest
on overseas investments and net receipts from shipping and a variety of
financial services. As other countries followed Britain in becoming fully
industrialised, it was natural that Britain s share of world exports of manu¬
factures should fall. Even before 1914 this supremacy was being increasingly
challenged by other nations, including Germany and the United States,
and, although Britain’s imports and exports increased in absolute terms over
the years, its share of the world total tended to decline. By 1937 Britain’s
share in world exports of manufactures, measured by value, had fallen to
20 per cent compared with 22 per cent in 1929 and 32 per cent in 1914. In
the years immediately following the second world war, Britain’s share rose
again and in 1950 was 26 per cent; but by 1964 it had fallen to about 14 per
cent.
For over a century international trade has been of vital importance to
Britain’s economy. Britain relies upon imports for half its total consumption
of foodstuffs and nearly all the raw materials needed for its industries. Its
exports of goods and services together represent over a fifth of the gross
national product. It is a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal
manufactures, electrical apparatus, chemicals and textiles. It is the world’s
largest market for foodstuffs, and among the largest for metals, cotton, wool,
petroleum and many other products.
For some hundreds of years Britain has also been an important centre of
entrepot trade, the importance of which, however, in relation to total United
Kingdom trade, has declined in the last half-century.
PATTERN OF
TRADE
Changes in value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
Value and
Volume
The value of imports (c.i.f.) passed the £2,000 million mark in 1948 and,
with rapidly rising prices of raw materials, totalled £3,892 million in 1951!
Because of the tendency in subsequent years for import prices to fall, the
1951 level was not reached again until 1957. Since then, imports have recorded
peak levels of £4,541 million in i960, £4,820 million in 1963, and £5,513
million in 1964. The increase in exports has been at a steadier rate. The 1948
total of £1,579 million (f.o.b.) had increased to £2,566 million by 1951, and
thereafter increased in most years, but with marked expansion in 1955 and
I959- I9^4 exports reached a new record of £4,254 million, an increase of
420
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
4^ per cent over 1963. This was the sixth successive year in which the previous
total was surpassed.
Between 1961 and 1964 the volume of exports rose by 12 per cent and
that of imports by 19 per cent. In 1961 and 1962 the terms of trade, i.e. the
ratio between the general level of export prices and that of import prices,
moved in Britain’s favour. In 1963 and 1964, however, there were small
adverse movements for the first time since 1955.
The value and volume of exports and imports in selected years from 1954
to 1964 are shown in Table 28.

Commodity
Composition
Imports
The expansion of domestic agriculture has reduced Britain’s dependence on
imported food supplies and the proportion of imported foodstuffs to total
imports has not been above 40 per cent since before 1954. Imports of food¬
stuffs in 1964 (representing 32 per cent of total imports by value) nevertheless
reached a peak total of ^1,773 million, partly because of increases in the
prices of some commodities, especially of meat, but also because of a 3 per cent
increase in volume. There has been a similar downward trend in the
proportion accounted for by basic materials—from 30 per cent in 1954 to
20 per cent in 1964, but in both cases the rate of change has been slow in
recent years. Industrial production has tended to increase faster than the
consumption of imported raw materials. This is partly because there has been
a growing economy in materials’ consumption per unit of output, partly
because of a gradual switch from the production of goods with a high material
content (e.g., textiles) to those with a relatively low material content (e.g.,
engineering products), and also because of increasing use of substitutes
and synthetic materials.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
421
Imports of crude petroleum and lubricants are by far the biggest single
item by value among Britain’s imports: they accounted for 11 per cent
(£585 million) of the total value of imports in 1964, compared with 7J per
cent in 1948 and 10 per cent in 1954.
Imports of manufactured goods into Britain have been growing much more
rapidly than imports as a whole in recent years. Imports of semi-manufactures
have also been increasing steadily and in 1964) for the first time, accounted
for a greater proportion of the total import bill than basic materials. Imports,
by value, of semi-manufactured and manufactured goods amounted to £1,173
million and £838 million respectively in 1964, accounting for 21 per cent
and 15 per cent of Britain s total imports, compared with 15 per cent and 5*2
per cent in 1954.
COMMODITY COMPOSITION OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS IN 1964
(Percentages of total values)
Exports More than five-sixths of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods.
By far the most important group are engineering products, which in 1964
accounted for 45 per cent of the total, compared with 38 per cent in 1954.
Within this group, exports of many types of machinery, electrical equipment,
road vehicles, tractors and scientific instruments have expanded markedly
over this period. The share represented by chemicals grew steadily until i960,
when it represented 9 per cent of total exports, but then showed little change
until 1964, when it rose to 10 per cent. The proportion accounted for by
metals has fallen slightly in recent years and has been about 12 per cent since
i960. Exports of textiles have fallen from over 19 per cent of the total in 1948

to 13^ per cent in 1954 and 7 per cent in 1964. Exports of coal in 1964 were
less than 1 per cent of the total, in contrast to their importance in the pre-war
period. Exports of petroleum products, which have been about 3 per cent of the
total in the last few years, fell slightly in 1964; exports of foodstuffs rose to
nearly 7 per cent. But these were small shifts and neither has shown much
change in the past few years.

and the composition of engineering exports and food imports is given in the

The growth of trade between Britain and Western Europe has been a feature
of the area distribution of trade in recent years, but conversely there has been
a decline in the proportion of Britain’s exports going to primary producing
countries. In 1953, 27 per cent of exports went to Western Europe, but in
1962, for the first time, these exports began to exceed those to the sterling
area and by 1964 they formed 36 per cent of the total. The rise in exports to
Western Europe in 1964 (6 per cent) was modest compared with the annual
average rate of growth (14 per cent) in the three previous years. This was
because the rate of growth in exports to the European Economic Community
(EEC) which had been particularly marked up to 1963, slackened in 1964.
Exports to the European Free Trade Area (EFTA), on the other hand, rose
in value by 11 per cent, a greater increase than in the previous two years. In
1964, 31 per cent of total imports came from Western Europe, with increases
from both the EEC and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).
Relatively, trade with other members of the Commonwealth and with the
sterling area as a whole has tended to decline. Exports to the sterling area rose
in the early 1950s, but there were some falls in later years and the 1957 total
was not regained until 1963. In 1964, 36 per cent of Britain’s exports went to
the sterling area, compared with 47 per cent in 1953. There has been a similar
fall in respect of imports. Canada, Australia, India and New Zealand, however

been both Britain’s largest single market and source of supply since 1957.
The proportion of total exports going to North America rose to a peak in
1959 but by 1963 had fallen to 13 per cent, only slightly more than in 1953.
This proportion remained the same in 1964, despite a rising trend in exports
in the second half of the year. Expanding oil consumption in Britain has given
rise to a substantial expansion of imports from the Middle East. Trade with
Latin America has increased in recent years. There was a recovery in the
second half of 1964 after the heavy fall in exports in 1963. The trade accounted
for 4 per cent of exports and 5 per cent of imports. Britain’s trade with the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has been growing rapidly over the past
decade but is still small in relation to trade with other parts of the world.
Re-exports are goods which are exported (1) in the condition in which they
are imported or (2) after having undergone minor operations—such as simple
blending, husking, repacking—which leaves them essentially unchanged.
Traditionally, the greater part of United Kingdom re-export trade is in raw
materials and foodstuffs, for example, wool, rubber, tea, non-ferrous metals
and fur-skins. In recent years a considerable re-export trade has developed
in machinery. Commodities imported from Commonwealth countries and sent
on to countries in Europe, particularly traditional re-exports such as tea and
wool, account for a considerable proportion of the total value.
In 1964 the value of re-exports was £153 million, £6 million below the peak
total reached in 1961, and the principal items were: fur-skins, rubber, raw
wool, tea, non-ferrous metals, beverages, aero-engines and electrical and other
machinery. About half of the re-exports went to countries in Western
Europe. Re-exports of rubber, which tend to fluctuate widely from year to
year, fell to £3 million from £18 million in 1962 and £10 million in 1963.
As previously mentioned, the United Kingdom has usually imported more
goods than it exports; until a few years ago the gap was normally covered by
net earnings from invisible transactions, but between 1958 and 1961 this
source of foreign earnings declined sharply from ^295 million to £127 million.
The invisible balance improved, however, in 1962 and has fluctuated little
424
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
since then. In 1964 it was ^179 million; total credits were valued at £2,651
million and total debits at £2,472 million.
Invisible transactions are divided for statistical purposes into six main
groups: government; transport (mainly shipping); interest, profits and
dividends; travel; other services; and private transfers. Some of these figures
are precise (for instance, for government transactions), others are estimates.
The diagram below shows the breakdown of the figures from 1961 to 1964.
Under the heading of Government current transactions, the main items
on the debit side are rising military expenditure overseas and gifts, mainly
to less-developed countries. Shipping receipts come mostly from export
freights and cross trades between other countries and also from passenger
traffic. Shipping payments, on the other hand, arise mainly on account of
foreign tramp shipping services. Shipping transactions produced a net credit
until 1959 but have registered net deficits since then, ranging from £32
million in i960 to £11 million in 1963. The net deficit in 1964 was £27
million. Net earnings from civil aviation in 1962 and 1963 were enough to

offset the shipping debits and produce a small favourable balance on the
transport account; in the other years since i960, however, the account has
shown a small deficit.
About three-fifths of Britain’s receipts under the heading interest, profits
and dividends come from investments in the sterling area. The recovery
in net earnings under this heading, which started in 1961, has been an out¬
standing feature of the invisibles account since then, benefiting in 1964 from
the postponement of interest due on long-term loans from Canada and the
United States. On the debit side, major items include interest paid on sterling
held by other countries (which fluctuates with changes in short-term interest
rates in Britain) and interest payments on the North American loans. Receipts
from travel have increased greatly since 1950, reflecting the growing import¬
ance of the British tourist industry (see below), but expenditure on travel and
tourism overseas has also expanded, and the net debit, which fluctuated only
slightly around an annual average of ^19 million between 1959 and 1962,
more than doubled in 1963 and 1964. Major components of other services
include payments and receipts in respect of insurance and films; expenditure
of United States and Canadian forces in Britain; net earnings of merchants;
and royalties, commissions, banking and other services.
The tourist industry continues to be one of Britain’s largest earners of
foreign currency. In the ten years 1955-64, overseas visitors spent over
£1,600 million in this country. For 1964 alone these tourist receipts were
estimated at about £220 million. United Kingdom residents on holiday, or
travelling for business or other purposes overseas, spent about £260 million
in the same year. The United Kingdom usually has a large net surplus on
earnings from tourism with North America and the overseas sterling area, but
a substantial net deficit with Western Europe. The total number of visitors to
the United Kingdom in 1964, excluding visitors from the Irish Republic, was
estimated at about 2-5 million—an increase of some 14 per cent over the 1963
figure, and more than twice the number of visitors in 1955.
Britain’s national tourist office is the British Travel Association, which
derives the major part of its income from a government grant-in-aid.
The Association undertakes publicity overseas aimed at attracting visitors to
Britain and works towards the improvement of hotel accommodation, catering,
transport, entertainment and other amenities for the tourist in Britain. It
maintains offices (see Appendix, p. 519) or agencies in 14 overseas countries.
The Association works in close collaboration with the Scottish Tourist Board
and the Wales Tourist and Holidays Association (contributing to their informa¬
tion and publicity services), as well as the Northern Ireland Tourist Board,
which is a statutory body receiving a grant from the Government of Northern
Ireland. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Commerce can assist, by way of
grant, schemes submitted by local authorities for the promotion of tourist
traffic.
Britain’s prosperity depends on the prosperity of those who buy her exports
and theirs will depend on how they sell their exports elsewhere. Thus Britain
is a strong advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade and to this end
has taken a leading part in setting up such organisations as the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) (formerly the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation)
and the European Monetary Agreement (formerly the European Payments
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
Union). Britain has had a large share in these organisations’ activities,
especially those to free trade from the restrictions which grew up in the
second world war and post-war periods. It also played a full part in the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development that was held in
1964, as well as in the Conference’s subsequent work.
Customs duties on imports into Britain are divided into two broad
categories: revenue duties (to which there correspond excise revenue duties
on comparable British produced goods) and protective duties. Purchase tax
is chargeable on imported as well as home produced goods but in the main the
charge on imports is deferred until the goods are sold by a registered to a
non-registered trader. Customs revenue duties in the financial year 1964-65
yielded ,£1,750 million, by far the greatest part of which came from tobacco
and hydrocarbon oils (petroleum products). The yield from protective duties
in the financial year 1964-65 was £181 million, or about 3 per cent of the
value of all imports.
At the beginning of the twentieth century the only customs duties were
those imposed for revenue purposes on a small range of products. Certain
duties were imposed during the first world war (the McKenna Duties), in
1921 (for strategic reasons) and in 1925 (initially for revenue purposes) but it
was not until the Import Duties Act 1932 that any serious departure was made
from the principle of free trade. This measure provided a degree of protection
for British industry and, at the same time, a basis for negotiations with
foreign countries already in possession of a tariff structure. A series of bilateral
trade negotiations between 1932 and 1939 led to some modification in the
level of protection but in the next ten years, because of government purchase
and import controls introduced during and immediately after the second world
war, the tariff lost much of its importance. The substantial relaxation of
quantitative import controls from 1949 onwards re-established the tariff as the
main instrument of protection.
The Import Duties Act 1958 replaced the existing legislation relating to
the protective tariff (i.e. four main Acts and some 70 Finance Act provisions)
and brought it up to date in a single measure. Following the passing of the
Act, the tariff was recast into an internationally agreed form (the Brussels
Nomenclature), which came into use from 1st January, 1959. By the Customs
Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957, the Board of Trade is empowered
to impose duties on imported goods of any description which have been dumped
or subsidised and which are causing or threatening material injury to a
particular industry.
In October 1964, as part of its immediate measures to deal with the balance
of payments situation, the Government imposed a temporary charge on
imports at 15 per cent ad valorem. In broad terms it applied to all imports
except food and feedingstuffs, fuel, unmanufactured tobacco and raw
materials. Its purpose was different from that of the protective tariff in that
it was designed to curb imports of manufactures and semi-manufactures,
which had been rising rapidly, while other measures to improve the balance
of payments position took effect. The Government’s Statement on the
Economic Situation, issued at the time, made it clear that the charge was
essentially temporary and would be reduced as soon as the balance of payments
position permitted and abolished at the earliest opportunity. On 22nd
February, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that enough progress
had been made to enable the Government to reduce the rate of the charge to
10 per cent from 27th April, 1965, on a non-discriminatory basis. The receipts
from the charge in the period up to March 1965 amounted to £77 million.

The United Kingdom’s protective tariff has been considerably modified in
recent years as a result of a series of multilateral tariff negotiations held under
the auspices of the GATT, which seeks to increase the volume of world trade
by reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade, and by eliminating discrimina¬
tion in international commerce. Tariff reductions, and bindings against
increase, negotiated between countries under the GATT are applied equally
to all other GATT countries under the ‘most favoured nation’ clause.
Customs duties and preferences have been reduced, or bound against increase,
on goods which account for about half of Britain’s normal imports from other
countries which are parties to the GATT, in return for concessions by those
countries. In May 1964 GATT Ministers formally launched the new round
of tariff negotiations (the ‘Kennedy Round’) to which Britain has attached the
greatest importance. It is hoped that these negotiations will lead to a substantial
linear cut in tariffs (50 per cent has been adopted as a ‘working hypothesis’)
together with a reduction of non-tariff barriers and suitable arrangements for
agriculture. Exceptions to the linear cut in the industrial tariff were tabled by
the major industrial countries in November 1964 and it was planned that
specific offers aimed at liberalising trade in agricultural products should have
been tabled by September 1965.
The principle of Imperial Preference had been introduced into the United
Kingdom customs duties in 1919 and at the Ottawa Conference in 1932
agreements were concluded with independent Commonwealth countries,
providing for reciprocal preferential tariff treatment over a wide range of
goods. The Import Duties Act 1932 had already provided for the duty-free
entry of goods from the United Kingdom dependencies.
Broadly speaking, goods from Commonwealth countries can enter Britain
free of duty or at preferential rates of duty. A few foodstuffs, whatever the
country of origin, come in free of duty, but for most others imported from
non-Commonwealth sources there are duties, which are quite low except for
certain horticultural products.
Imports of most raw materials from all sources are free from protective
duties; the only exceptions are where duties are charged on foreign products
to give a margin of preference to Commonwealth suppliers. The full rates of
duty on semi-manufactures are mainly 15 per cent or less. The range of duties
on manufactured goods is much wider, ranging from 10 to 33 per cent ad
valorem, or higher on a few items. The preferential tariff arrangements have
encouraged some of the developing countries in the Commonwealth to build
up valuable outlets in Britain for the less complex types of manufacture.
In May 1964 at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
in Geneva, Britain declared itself prepared to extend tariff preferences to all
the developing countries if other major industrialised countries would do the
same, if the Commonwealth countries concerned would agree and provided
that preferences were not created by introducing new, or increasing existing,
general tariff rates.
The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) was set up under the
Stockholm Convention of January i960 by Austria, Denmark, Norway,
Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain, with the object of promoting the
harmonious development of trade and reducing trade barriers. Under the
Convention, customs tariffs on trade in industrial products between members
of EFTA were to be eliminated by 1st January, 1970; but the reductions
have been greatly accelerated. Already EFTA duties have been reduced by

70 per cent: that is, to 30 per cent of the basic duty; they will be reduced by a
further 10 per cent at the end of 1965, the remaining 20 per cent being
eliminated at the end of 1966. An Agreement of Association between Finland
and EFTA provides for the extension of EFTA tariff concessions to Finland
and for the elimination of Finland’s import duties on most EFTA manu¬
factures on 31st December, 1967.
The moves made by the European Economic Community (EEC) and
EFTA towards establishing closer economic unity in Europe have a direct
and far-reaching influence on tariff policy. In August 1961 the British
Government applied formally to join the EEC but negotiations were suspended
in January 1963.
The export trade and virtually all the import trade of the United Kingdom are
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the
industry, the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export
trade, especially of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through
exports merchants in the United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to
importers and consumers abroad through their own agents or resident
representatives in the countries concerned; in other cases, sales are made
through a firm’s own branch offices, distributing organisations or subsidiary
sales companies established in overseas markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or
domestic trade buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms may
find it more convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export
houses, commission agents, and the representatives of overseas firms. Since
January 1957 overseas trading undertaken directly by the Government has
been confined to jute goods; the purpose of this is to protect employment
in Dundee, where the jute industry is concentrated and forms the mainstay
of employment.
Most of the restrictions imposed on the movement of goods and services
during and immediately after the second world war have been progressively
abolished. Because of the heavy balance of payments deficit in 1964 exchange
control requirements for investments outside the sterling area have been
revised and made more stringent.
Exchange control is confined mainly to transactions between residents
of the United Kingdom and residents outside the sterling area and has been
greatly relaxed in the past few years. Since the end of 1958 residents of all
countries outside the sterling area have been able to settle transactions
between themselves in sterling. Sterling held by non-residents of the sterling
area on an external account is freely convertible into other currencies, includ¬
ing dollars.
The only remaining important restrictions relate to the movement of capital
from the United Kingdom to non-sterling countries. Exports of goods to
destinations outside the sterling area are subject to exchange control and, in
general, have to be paid for within six months in an acceptable currency or
by sterling from an external account. Control is also exercised over imports
to ensure that currency authorised for their payment is, in fact, used for
that purpose.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of
the administration is, in practice, carried out by the Bank of England as agent

of the Treasury; and, in turn, the Bank of England has delegated to the
commercial banks a wide variety of powers to deal with applications.
Since November 1959 there has been no limit on the amount of foreign
currency that United Kingdom travellers may take abroad but a closer
supervision over the use of foreign exchange for travel purposes was
introduced in the 1965 Budget. The amount of sterling notes that British
travellers may take out of the country has been reduced from £50 to ^25 a
journey. Up to £250 in foreign currency (including travellers’ cheques) for
any one journey is still allowed on demand, but is now recorded in the
passports of travellers. Anyone buying more than this in any calendar year is
asked to provide evidence to the Bank of England that the funds are required
for genuine travel expenditure and will not be used for any other purpose.
The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 empowers the
Board of Trade to make statutory orders prohibiting or regulating the import
or export of goods. The powers of both import and export control derive
from the same legislation, but the purpose and mechanism are quite distinct.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the
IMF, the United Kingdom Government has progressively removed quanti¬
tative restrictions from almost all imports from the countries of the free world.
The very short list of goods on which controls remain includes some items
of special difficulty and a few where restrictions are recognised internationally,
such as arms, ammunition and radioactive materials. They require a specific
import licence and quotas have been set up for most of them. Some quotas
refer specifically to individual countries and are usually shared out among
exporters by the authorities of the countries concerned. Others are accorded
on an overall or global basis; these are generally allocated by the United
Kingdom authorities to United Kingdom importers, usually on the basis of
their share of the trade in the commodity in the past. Apart from these
quantitative controls, some further restrictions or prohibitions are applied
on health grounds (e.g., on animals, plants and drugs).
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations
outside the sterling area are paid for in the proper manner, United Kingdom
exports are not, except in a very minor way, subject to any government
control or direction. The few controls that are in operation are imposed to
supervise exports of military and strategic importance, to conserve materials,
such as metal scrap, which may be in inadequate supply, to assist exchange
control operations in preventing the export of capital in the form of valuable
goods, and to prevent the export of works of art classed as national treasures,
such as paintings, manuscripts and antiques. Normally, individual licences
are required for specific consignments of goods subject to export licensing
control. Goods controlled for strategic reasons, not included in the category
of atomic energy materials and appliances, arms and ammunition, may, with
certain exceptions, be exported to the Commonwealth, the Irish Republic,
the Republic of South Africa and the United States of America without licence.
The British Government assists exporters1 by its efforts to create conditions
favourable to the export trade and by providing credit insurance facilities and
1 Export promotion is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry)
and the Development Corporation for Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Ministry
of Commerce provides a liaison service with the Board of Trade Export Services Branch
and the overseas posts.

information and advice about opportunities for trade in other countries.
Its general economic policy includes the use of fiscal, credit and other measures
to maintain a stable economy and to control excessive demand for goods and
services by the home market, and action through international negotiation
to reduce barriers to the free flow of trade and payments. In October 1964 the
Government introduced a scheme for repayment to exporters of sums broadly
equivalent to the amounts of certain indirect taxes which enter into the cost
of production of exported goods.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the Board of Trade or
the commercial posts overseas. There are posts in all the principal cities and
trade centres abroad and they supply the Board of Trade with information
of every kind affecting trade with their territories.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial
conditions, pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities,
and generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of
governmental regulations. These officers investigate potential markets for
British products, advise about methods of trading with particular areas, and
seek out and pass on opportunities for export business and inquiries for
British goods. Assistance is also given to United Kingdom exporters in
appointing agents and locating potential importers. From records kept in
London, brought up to date by reports from its overseas officers, the Export
Services Branch of the Board of Trade can provide information concerning
any country on:
(1) prospects for United Kingdom exports and requirements of particular
markets;
(2) governmental regulations affecting trade, including import restrictions
and tariffs and duties on particular commodities;
(3) methods of trading;
(4) local tastes and preferences in design; and
(5) the commercial standing of firms with which an exporter contemplates
business relations.
The Government’s official information services overseas help to promote
trade by publicising British industrial achievements and providing informa¬
tion on new developments in British industry.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department is an autonomous government
department responsible to the President of the Board of Trade. ECGD carries
on a commercial business, providing insurance for exporters against the main
risks in selling overseas. These facilities have been progressively developed
since the Department was first formed in 1919. From very small beginnings
the amount of business covered by ECGD has grown to reach 27 per cent of
the country’s export trade. ECGD is obliged to carry on its business on a
self-supporting basis, and in no way does it provide subsidies to exporters,
nor is it a charge on the taxpayer.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer,
governmental action which blocks or delays transfer of payment to the
United Kingdom exporter, imposition of new import licensing restrictions
in the buyer’s country, war between the buyer’s country and the United
Kingdom, cancellation or non-renewal of a United Kingdom export licence,
or ‘any other cause of loss occurring outside the United Kingdom and not

within the control of the exporter or the buyer, and not normally insurable
with commercial insurers’. Cover may commence from the date of contract
or (at lower premiums) from the date of shipment.
The main types of export insurance policy are:
1. Comprehensive policies normally covering goods sold on terms of up to
six months’ credit. The exporter insures the whole of his trade, or the
whole of his trade with an agreed group of markets, for the twelve
months (or, in some cases, three years) covered by his policy. For certain
engineering goods this type of cover is extended to goods sold on credit
terms of up to five years.
2. Specific policies which cover capital goods sold on credit terms normally
not exceeding five years. Specific policies are negotiated for each
individual contract.
In April 1961 ECGD introduced financial guarantees for United Kingdom
banks providing finance on a long-term basis for overseas purchasers of large
capital goods and works, and in January 1962 the London Clearing Banks, the
Scottish Banks and a number of insurance companies agreed to provide finance
at fixed rates of interest for such loans, and also in respect of other export
financing on longer than three years’ credit which was secured by an ECGD
guarantee to the bank concerned. In April 1965 bank guarantees covering
100 per cent of the credit, instead of the previous 90 per cent, were made
available for two or more years’ credit and at the same time the premium
was halved. The value of export contracts financed through such guarantees
totalled more than £106 million in 1964-65. Cover is also available for British
concerns carrying out services (including construction projects) for overseas
firms or, under certain conditions, entering into an international consortium.
The exporter or merchant is normally required to retain an interest in the
debt or risk involved and, consequently, guarantees are given up to a maximum
of between 85 and 95 per cent of loss. In February 1962 this was extended
to 100 per cent for transactions involving over three years’ credit which had
already operated satisfactorily for two years. The percentage of cover on
insolvency and protracted default losses was increased from 85 per cent to 90
per cent in April 1965. At the same time the two years’ ‘trouble free’ period was
reduced to one year. Premium rates are assessed separately for each country
and vary according to the risks and the terms of payment.
Some 300 exhibitions, of which about 200 were trade fairs, were held in
1965, compared with 154 in 1954. The number of trade fairs has more than
trebled in the last ten years. Some of the specialised fairs, such as the Motor
Show and the Royal Agricultural Show, attract large numbers of the public as
well as many trade buyers from home and overseas and provide an important
means of advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom products are shown at most of the large international
trade fairs throughout the world. For example, the United Kingdom is
usually well represented at the Milan, Hanover and Poznan Fairs. In addition,
since 1954 through a subsidiary company, British Overseas Fairs, Ltd., the
FBI has organised British Trade Fairs in ten major cities abroad, including
the British Exhibition in Tokyo in September 1965. British Trade Fairs were
also organised by Industrial and Trade Fairs Ltd., in Moscow in 1961 and
Peking in 1964. United Kingdom manufacturers have been prominent at
the many important specialised international fairs which are held in North
America and Europe.

Participation in trade fairs, 'British Weeks’ and store promotions overseas is
a form of export promotion for which the Government provides information,
advice and, in certain cases, free facilities. The amount allocated to the Board
of Trade for these purposes has risen from £60,000 in 1955-56 to £1-165
million in 1965-66. British weeks differ from trade fairs and exhibitions in
that they are primarily designed to promote consumer goods in shops and
other retail outlets in chosen commercial centres overseas.
The British National Export Council (BNEC), sponsored by representatives
of industry, trade, finance and organised labour in Britain, was established in
July 1964. The Council is an independent body but has the support of the
Government. Linked with it are the Export Council for Europe, established
in i960, the Committee for Middle East Trade (formerly the Council for
Middle East Trade set up in 1963) and three committees also formed in July
1964, to continue and develop the work formerly carried out in Canada, the
United States and Latin America by the Western Hemisphere Export Council.
A Commonwealth Export Council was set up early in 1965 in conjunction
with the BNEC to promote British exports to the Commonwealth. In addition
to the Committee for Exports to Canada referred to above, five new Area
Committees have been formed to cover Australia, New Zealand and
Commonwealth countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.
The tasks of the BNEC are to keep all British export activity under review;
to initiate, guide and inspire export efforts of British industry; to co-ordinate
the work of the associated Area Committees whose purpose is to encourage
exports to particular areas of the world; and to provide the necessary finance
and services for this purpose.
In the nineteenth century, the rapid growth of British industry, commerce
and shipping under the stimulus of the industrial revolution made Britain
the market as well as the workshop of the world. It became the site for the
chief world markets in raw materials (see below), freight, insurance, and
precious metals. A sound commercial banking system and a flexible system
of central bank control have been built up, while specialised institutions such
as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the stock exchanges,
investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to satisfy particular
needs for short-term or long-term finance. The facilities provided by merchant
banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been used to finance
shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but also between overseas
countries themselves.
At the same time, the banks which were already engaged in financing trade
naturally developed to become channels for finance for longer-term ventures.
British capital invested in overseas countries has assisted their development,
increased their output and exports, and provided markets for manufactured
goods. Since the end of the war there has been a substantial volume of loans
floated in the London capital market by Commonwealth Governments (see
p. 437). A number of specialised institutions have also been established in
recent years to assist the provision of financial services for overseas countries
(see p. 438).
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world’s basic
commodities. Most of these markets were closed during the war but most,
if not all, have now reopened and many have fully regained—some even
surpassed—their previous position. Among the more important are the Baltic

Exchange (the market for shipping and air transport, grain, seeds and
vegetable oils), the London Commodity Exchange (cocoa, coffee, copra,
hides and skins, rubber and sugar), the London Wool Exchange, the London
Metal Exchange, the Liverpool Cotton Exchange and the Liverpool Corn
Exchange. These markets not only cater for the import of goods for home
consumption but do much business in effecting transactions between buyers and
sellers in other countries. In addition to these formal markets, there is scarcely
any product which cannot be traded through an intermediary in the United
Kingdom. For example, London is the world’s most important philatelic
market and also the leading international centre for the sale of works of art.
The Foreign Exchange Market is subject to United Kingdom exchange
control regulations governing the purchase and sale of foreign currencies in
the sterling area, but these regulations have been progressively relaxed in
recent years. The turnover of the market has increased materially since the
introduction in December 1958 of external convertibility for the principal
European currencies.
The market consists of about 130 authorised banks and nine firms of
brokers, all linked together by telephone in the United Kingdom, and by
telephone, telex and cable with overseas centres.
The London Gold Market, which had remained closed from the outbreak
of war in 1939, was reopened in March 1954, under the general supervision
of the Bank of England. It has regained its pre-war position as the leading
centre for dealings in gold, handling the major part of the gold coming on to
the free markets of the world. All authorised banks may deal in gold but,
in practice, dealings are largely concentrated in the hands of the five members
of the gold market plus one or two others. Membership of the market confers
the right to be present at the daily price-fixing when the official London gold
price is settled.
An important development has been the setting up of a gold pool, initiated
in i960 to co-ordinate the gold operations in London of certain European
central banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The pool consists of
a selling consortium, which is not in operation all the time but may be invoked,
to stabilise the market, when conditions demand, and a buying syndicate.
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, several
countries tended not only to use sterling as their natural currency for inter¬
national transactions, but also to maintain central currency reserves in
Britain. When Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931 these countries,
which came to be known as the ‘sterling bloc’ and later as the ‘sterling area’,
did likewise, and pegged their currency exchange rates to the pound sterling.
In 1939, after the outbreak of war, the pound sterling was no longer freely
convertible into other currencies and the sterling area became more formally
defined as a currency area for exchange control purposes. The United
Kingdom imposes no exchange control on transactions with residents of
other sterling area countries.
All the Commonwealth countries (except Canada), together with Burma,
Iceland, the Irish Republic, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, the Republic of South
Africa, South West Africa, the British protected States in the Persian Gulf,
and Western Samoa are members of the sterling area. These countries contain
one-quarter of the world’s population and account for one-quarter of the
world’s trade. The main feature of the sterling area is that the greater part of
434
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the overseas trade of member countries is financed in sterling; they keep
their foreign reserves largely in the form of sterling and generally maintain
a fixed relationship between their currencies and sterling. Member countries
for the most part sell their foreign currency earnings in London in exchange
for sterling and can purchase for sterling the foreign currency they require.
They generally also sell gold in the London market for sterling. The United
Kingdom reserves of gold and foreign currencies are held in the Exchange
Equalisation Account, which buys and sells exchange in the market as appro¬
priate. All these currency arrangements are voluntary; there are no strict or
centralised rules of conduct.
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Estimates of the United Kingdom’s balance of payments are published
quarterly and provide a summary of the most important transactions with
other countries, classified by type of transaction and by area.
The transactions fall into three main groups—current account, long-term
capital account and monetary movements. The balance on current account is
composed of the balance of visible trade (i.e. the difference between mer¬
chandise imports and exports and re-exports) and the balance of invisibles.
On long-term capital account, the main groups of items are intergovernmental
loans (including amortisation) and other identified net long-term investment
abroad by United Kingdom residents, or in the United Kingdom by non¬
residents. The third heading, monetary movements, reflects in part the
United Kingdom’s position as an international banker. It includes identified
capital transactions not of a long-term character (e.g., changes in acceptances);
changes in overseas sterling holdings and changes in the United Kingdom
reserves of gold and convertible currencies.
Britain has for long been a net exporter of capital. To support this outflow
and, in particular, to give financial assistance to developing countries, it needs
a surplus on current account. The country tends to import more than it exports
but its trade deficit has usually been more than offset by the surplus earned
on invisible transactions. Britain’s invisible earnings are now running at a lower
level than some ten years ago, so that expanding its exports and narrowing
the gap between imports and exports are aims of ever-increasing importance.
Between 1945 and 1951 the balance of payments on current account
fluctuated widely. From 1952 to 1963 there were surpluses in each year
except in 1954, i960 and 1961. In 1964 there was a substantial deficit of £374
million made up of a surplus of £ 167 million in the current balance with the
overseas sterling area and a deficit of ^541 million in the balance with non¬
sterling area countries.
In almost every year from 1950 to 1959 the deficit on visible trade was more
than balanced by invisible earnings, but in i960 and 1961 the trade deficit
rose and the favourable net balance on invisibles fell to a level insufficient to
provide a current account surplus. There was a significant improvement in the
net balance on both visible trade and invisibles in 1962 and 1963; in 1964,
however, although the net credit on invisibles remained at about the same
level as in the previous two years (see p. 424), the trade deficit rose sharply.
In the ten-year period 1955-64 private investment abroad (net of dis¬
investment) averaged about £300 million a year and in 1964 rose to £423
million. Overseas private investment in Britain (also net of disinvestment)
averaged around £200 million a year, so that the net outflow of long-term
capital on private account averaged about £100 million a year. In 1964 it was
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
TABLE 30
United Kingdom

£251 million. The net outflow of official capital has risen, reflecting mainly
expansion of the economic aid programme: in 1955-64 it averaged £70
million a year and it was £120 million in 1964. Net investment abroad in all
forms, official and private, has thus averaged nearly ^170 million a year,
whilst the average surplus on current account has been £25 million. In his
Budget statement, presented to the House of Commons on 6th April, 1965,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced measures to strengthen
Britain’s balance of payments, some of which will moderate the heavy net
outflow of private investment.
Movements of capital, both short-term and long, may mean that changes
in balance on current account are not necessarily reflected in the reserves
of gold and convertible currencies. These rose by £31 million in 1961,
strengthened by borrowing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
but fell by ^183 million and £53 million in 1962 and 1963 and by a further
£122 million in 1964. At the end of 1964 they amounted to £827 million, of
which £763 million was in gold. Britain’s net external liabilities in sterling
amounted to £4,050 million at the end of 1964. Nearly two-thirds of these
were towards countries in the overseas sterling area. Table 30 summarises
Britain’s balance of payments from 1958 to 1964.

In addition to its reserves of gold and convertible currencies, Britain has
drawing rights on the IMF based on its quota, which was raised to £696
million in 1959. Under its stand-by arrangement with the IMF, made in
August 1962 and renewed annually since then, Britain drew $1,000 million
(£357 million) in eleven different currencies in December 1964. At the end
of May 1965 a further $1,400 million (£500 million) was drawn. Britain has

had recourse to the IMF on three previous occasions, of which the most recent
was in 1961 when $1,500 million was drawn. The final instalment in repayment
of this drawing was made in August 1962.
Informal arrangements between the central banks of certain European
countries to hold each other’s currencies, together with the gold pool (see
p. 433), provide further means of safeguarding the position of sterling.
In November 1964 the Bank of England arranged for $3,000 million to be
made available for the support of sterling from eleven central banks, including
those of the United States, Canada and Japan, as well as the Bank for
International Settlements and the US Export-Import Bank. All short-term
assistance outstanding under this facility was repaid in May 1965, but the
swap facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was reconstituted at
the figure of $750 million, to which it had been raised in November, and
the Export-Import Bank facility remained available at the level of $250
million. At the end of May 1965 the reserves stood at £1,021 million.
An additional line of reserves is provided by the dollar securities held by
the Exchange Equalisation Account, with a market value which has recently
fluctuated around $1,250 million.
In March 1964 the Bank of England brought together for the first time a
number of component items relating to Britain’s external assets and liabilities
at the end of 1962. The incompleteness or unavailability of statistics for
several important items had the effect of understating Britain’s external
assets more seriously than the corresponding external liabilities. But two
main features of Britain’s international capital position were clearly apparent.
One was the heavy net long-term indebtedness of the United Kingdom
Government to overseas Governments. This amounted to £1,532 million,
composed of a net liability of £1,793 million to countries outside the sterling
area and a net claim of £260 million against overseas sterling area countries.
In marked contrast to this heavy official long-term debt stood the much
larger overseas assets of the private sector, which amounted in aggregate to
about £8,000 million. Roughly £3,400 million of these investments were in
overseas sterling countries and £4,600 million in countries outside the sterling
area. By comparison, the corresponding external liabilities of the private
sector were in aggregate about £2,800 million (due mainly to residents of
non-sterling countries). It is estimated that by the end of 1964 the assets
of the private sector were approaching £10,000 million, of which direct
investment, including oil, accounted for some £6,000 million (at book value)
and portfolio investment for under £4,000 million (at current market prices).
Britain’s official long-term liabilities have mostly arisen from the second world
war and its aftermath. At the end of 1963, £1,884 million was still out¬
standing, of which the greater part (£1,759 million) was owed to the United
States and Canada.
The largest item among official external long-term claims is British
Government aid (see p. 438).
Overseas investors in Britain are allowed to repatriate the proceeds of the
sale of their direct investments, including any capital gains that may have
accrued, provided that the investment was made after 1st January, I950,
Earned profits and dividends can be transferred, irrespective of the amount;
transfers of this kind have never been restricted.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
Private
Investment:
Outgoing
437
Overseas long-term investment in the private sector of the British economy
has increased substantially since the war. According to a survey by the
Board of Trade, it is estimated that overseas portfolio holdings of British
ordinary shares at the end of 1962 (the latest year for which figures are
available) were of the order of £700 million, with roughly a further £35
million in debentures and preferences shares. Overseas direct investment in
Britain of companies incorporated abroad (except banks, oil and insurance
companies) was about ,£1,400 million, and the approximate book value of the
net assets of United States and European oil companies was some /700
million.
By far the largest proportion of private investment by overseas countries
in Britain is made by United States firms. It has been estimated1 that the
total value of United States direct investments in Britain amounted to $4,216
million (,£1,506 million) at the end of 1962, compared with $847 million
G£3°3 million) in I951- Just under two-thirds of these investments were in
manufacturing and rather less than a quarter in petroleum; most of the
remainder were in distribution and other trade enterprises.
Private investment abroad may take several forms: portfolio investment,
including the raising of loans on the London capital market; or direct invest¬
ment by the establishment of subsidiary companies, by the ploughing back of
profits earned overseas and participation, jointly with domestic capital, in
enterprises overseas.
The United Kingdom imposes no restriction on investment in the sterling
area by United Kingdom residents and about 60 per cent of Britain’s total
supply of private long-term capital abroad and 40 per cent of its direct
investment goes to Commonwealth countries. Direct investment is frequently
made from a firm’s existing resources. However, borrowers outside the
United Kingdom must normally obtain the consent of the Treasury (which
is advised by the Capital Issues Committee) if the amount borrowed exceeds
,£50,000 in any one year. Borrowing by Commonwealth and Colonial
Governments in the London capital market has fallen in recent years, but
averaged about ,£50 million a year in the 1950s. The market’s facilities have
been made available to the member governments of EFTA. Finance is also
made available by the Commonwealth Development Finance Company
(see p. 415).
Investment outside the sterling area is subject to Exchange Control
regulations and, broadly speaking, official exchange is only available for
direct investment projects which promise benefit to the United Kingdom
balance of payments in the short term. Direct investment projects which do
not satisfy this test may be financed by borrowing abroad or by using the
proceeds of the sale of foreign securities.
Britain’s private long-term capital assets abroad include portfolio invest¬
ments which, at the end of 1962, had a total estimated market value of
some ,£3,000 million. Published statistics show that ,£1,200 million was in the
hands of financial institutions other than banks (of which assets are mainly
short-term), implying that ,£1,800 million belonged to private individuals
and companies.
In addition, there are direct British investments abroad, for which figures
are published regularly by the Board of Trade, relating to all companies
excluding oil and insurance up to 1962 and excluding oil only from 1963.
1 United States Department of Commerce’s Survey of Current Business, August 1964.
438
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
These indicate a book value of about ^3,600 million at the end of 1962. The
approximate book value of oil companies’ assets at the end of 1962 was some
.£1,100 million. The total value of the overseas interest of British insurance
companies is not known but, according to United States official estimates, the
value of direct investments by these companies at the end of i960 in the United
States alone amounted to about ^350 million. The British insurance industry
also operates extensively in other foreign countries and throughout the
Commonwealth. The annual survey by the Board of Trade estimated that the
flow of private direct investment abroad by United Kingdom companies
(excluding oil) was about £262 million in 1964, a rise of £10 million compared
with the previous year; in 1963, 57 per cent was directed to the sterling area,
some 13 per cent to North America and about 21 per cent to Western Europe.
The figures include long-term and short-term investment and reinvested
profits.
Official
External
Assets
Owing to the increase in recent years in British Government aid to developing
countries, inter-governmental loans form the largest item among official
external long-term claims. The total of such loans outstanding at the end of
1963 was £449 million and included £314 million in loans to governments of
overseas sterling area countries. Amounts owed by countries outside the
sterling area are mostly in respect of advances by the British Government in
the second world war. Other official lending includes investments of the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (see below) and the United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
In addition, there are the official subscriptions to, and shareholdings in,
international financial organisations (see below) and the substantial govern¬
ment portfolio of dollar securities. The British Government also owns real
estate overseas, such as embassy buildings and military installations.
UNITED
KINGDOM
GOVERNMENT
AID FOR
DEVELOPMENT
Loans and gifts to the less-developed countries for economic development,
technical assistance, budget support and emergency relief from the United
Kingdom Exchequer since 1951 have amounted to nearly ,£1,550 million and
in the four years 1961-64 averaged -£165 million a year (see Table 31). The
greater part of such assistance goes to developing countries in the Common¬
wealth. The department responsible is the Ministry of Overseas Development
(ODM, see p. 56).
This assistance takes two forms: gifts and loans, and payments for technical
assistance arranged directly with the country receiving help (bilateral
assistance); and contributions to international bodies (multilateral assistance).
The division of assistance is shown in Table 31. In 1964 bilateral assistance
totalled ,£i74-5 million and multilateral assistance was ,£16 million. Bilateral
technical assistance, in so far as it is quantitatively assessable, accounted for
about ,£25-1 million, being nearly four times greater than it was in i960. About
half of Britain’s governmental aid goes to Commonwealth countries in Africa.
The terms of aid have been progressively softened over the last few years.
A substantial amount has always been provided in the form of grants. Since
1958 the maturity period of development loans has lengthened from a norm
of 15 years to between 20 and 25 years. Grace periods on the repayment of
capital during periods extending up to the first seven years of the life of the
loan have been granted on a widening scale. In 1963 the Government
announced its readiness to grant waivers for periods of up to seven years of
the interest payable on loans by countries whose position justified such a
concession. In some cases this has reduced the effective rate of interest

payable over the life of the loan by nearly half, compared with the normal
rate (which is based on that at which the Government can itself borrow),
plus a small management charge. In June 1965 the Minister of Overseas
Development stated that the Government recognised that the value of the
waiver was in some respect limited and that some more flexible means were
needed of giving relief in certain cases. It had decided, therefore, to make
loans free of interest to certain developing countries.
There are several public sources of finance from which United Kingdom
funds are made available for overseas development. The following are the
principal forms of machinery through which funds are provided.

“ The figures do not cover all technical assistance provided by the United Kingdom,
some of which cannot be assessed in quantitative terms.
Commonwealth
Assistance and
similar Loans
Under the Export Guarantees Acts 1949-64, the Government has authority
to give economic assistance to overseas countries. Securities issued by the
borrowing country are acquired by the Export Credits Guarantee Department
(ECGD), and their purchase price used to pay for British exports. The loans,
most of which are those known as Commonwealth Assistance Loans, are
made through these powers to overseas Governments and bear interest at
rates related to the notional rates for British Government borrowing.
From 1949 to February 1965 sixty agreements with a total value of over
£426 million had been made, of which all but eight had been made since
mid-1958. The total includes twenty-nine loans to India amounting to about
£,335'5 million, twelve to Pakistan to a value of ^64-1 million, seven to
Yugoslavia totalling £24-6 million and five to Nigeria valued at £30-1 million.
For the more recent loans, repayment periods are up to 25 years and in most
cases there is a grace period before repayments begin. During 1963-64,
twenty-six agreements, to the value of £55-9 million, were concluded.
Dependent The Colonial Development and Welfare Acts are the principal machinery for
Territories providing assistance for development in British dependent territories: ^340
million in grants has been made available for the period 1946-66. The 1959

and 1964 Acts enable Exchequer loans to be made, to a total of £105 million
for the years 1959-66, to finance development expenditure. By the end of the
1964-65 financial year ^82-2 million had been disbursed.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) (formerly the
Colonial Development Corporation), which is financed from Exchequer
funds, provides capital for development projects in Commonwealth countries.
Up to the end of 1964, the CDC had capital commitments totalling £125
million, of which two-thirds were in Africa.
The CDC is empowered to undertake schemes in British dependent
territories and in independent Commonwealth countries in which it operated
before independence.
About one-seventh of Britain’s governmental aid contribution is directed to
technical co-operation efforts. Under the Colombo Plan for Co-operative
Economic Development in South and South-East Asia it is providing £5
million in the three years to 1966 for technical assistance, and over 5,650 people
have come to Britain for training under the plan. (The United Kingdom’s
total development assistance to the area from the beginning of the Colombo
Plan in 1951 to the end of June 1964 amounted to ,£294-4 million.)
Technical assistance is an important element in the Special Commonwealth
Assistance Plan for Africa (SCAAP); the largest item in the estimated expendi¬
ture for 1965-66 of the ODM on grants and services connected with bilateral
overseas aid is ^34 million to the SCAAP. British contributions include
technical services, educational and training facilities in Britain, the provision
of specialist advisers, and of teachers under the Commonwealth Educational
Co-operation Scheme. During the academic year 1963-64 some 64,000
students and trainees from overseas were studying in Britain, about 50,000
from developing countries. Under the Overseas Service Aid Scheme overseas
Governments can retain the services of trained and experienced staff (at
present numbering between 15,000 and 20,000) until they can be replaced by
local people.
Arrangements are also made for supplying technical assistance under the
Central Treaty Organisation (covering Pakistan, Iran and Turkey) and
through the Foundation for Material Assistance in Africa (FAMA).
Britain’s subscription to the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and its two affiliated organisations, the International
Finance Corporation and the International Development Association (IDA)
is the second largest of any country. Britain’s contribution of ,£47 million to
IDA is being increased by a further ,£35 million over the three years 1965-67.
For technical aid through the machinery of the United Nations, Britain’s
subscription in 1965 to the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance
amounted to $4-75 million and to the United Nations Special Fund $7
million.
INTERNAL TRADE
The internal trade of the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad
categories: trade in raw materials, capital goods and intermediate products
(for example, vehicle components) and trade in consumer goods, involving
the network of distributive trades by which home produced or imported
goods reach the consumer. (The pattern of consumers’ expenditure is outlined
in Chapter 10, The National Economy.)
WHOLESALE
TRADES
TRADE AND PAYMENTS ^
There have been a number of official statistical inquiries into the distributive
trades. Most recently, during 1963 and 1964, the results of a full Census
of Distribution for 1961 were published by the Board of Trade, covering the
retail and (related) service trades in Britain (but not Northern Ireland). This
census was only the second of its kind undertaken in Britain; the first,
covering also the wholesale trades, related to 1950. A sample inquiry, however,
was conducted by the Board of Trade into the retail and service trades in
1957 and a full-scale inquiry into the wholesale trade for 1959. Sample
monthly and annual inquiries are also undertaken, covering a few aspects of
the distributive trades; for instance, turnover, stocks and capital expenditure.
Only a proportion of the trade in consumer goods passes through whole¬
salers: sales are also made to consumers through producers’ own selling
organisations (including their own retail outlets and mail order business);
and other sales are made directly by producers to retailers. Wholesale channels
are particularly in evidence in the distribution of textiles, agricultural produce
and foodstuffs. The inquiry made by the Board of Trade in respect of 1959
showed that out of a total of 19,000 business units engaged in wholesale
distribution in Great Britain, over 3,000 dealt in clothing, footwear and
textiles, 2,000 in grocery and provisions, 2,000 in vegetables and fruit, and
over 3,000 in other food and in drink. In addition, there were 8,000 dealers
(wholesale or retail) in coal, builders’ materials, grain or agricultural supplies,
and 7,000 dealers in other industrial materials and machinery.
The value of stocks held by wholesalers and dealers at the end of 1964 is
estimated to have been ^1,100 million; expenditure on capital assets during
the year was about £150 million.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchan¬
dise handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers
who sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres or, in some
cases, direct to retailers; fruit and vegetables, on the other hand, may be sold
by growers to commission agents who dispose of the produce either to whole¬
salers or direct to retailers, or alternatively the grower may deal only with
wholesale firms.
London’s wholesale markets are of outstanding importance in the distri¬
bution of foodstuffs, particularly imported supplies. Covent Garden handles
about i-2 million tons of fruit and vegetables each year; nearly 8,000 tons
of meat pass through Smithfield market each week; Billingsgate is the
principal distributing centre in Britain for fish. Other markets in London
include those at Leadenhall (poultry) and Spitalfields (fruit and vegetables).
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
societies, the two largest being the Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd.
(CWS) and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd. (SCWS) to serve
the needs of retail societies, membership being restricted to incorporated
co-operative organisations. The CWS had sales of /480 million in 1963 and the
SCWS had sales of ^89 million.
Two kinds of voluntary wholesale chains have developed in recent years.
Firstly, local retailers’ buying groups were formed and later (since 1954)
wholesaler-sponsored voluntary chains were set up. The latter are groups of
independent traders linked to a wholesaler or a group of wholesalers. Both
kinds benefit from the lower operating costs of large-scale trading without
losing their independence and both are of roughly equal importance. The
1961 Census of Distribution showed that about 27 per cent (or 40 per cent
in terms of turnover) of smaller grocers—mostly the medium-sized inde-

“ Number of organisations.
Retail businesses in Britain may be classified under three main headings:
(1) retail co-operative societies (see p. 446); (2) multiple traders, that is,
organisations other than co-operative societies with ten or more branches; and
(3) independent retail businesses, including for this purpose the small multiple
stores (i.e. chains of stores with nine or fewer branches). Businesses in each of
these categories may own department stores, defined as shops with 25 or more
persons engaged and selling a wide range of commodities, one of which must
be clothing. Other retail outlets include gas and electricity showrooms owned
by the area gas and electricity boards and mail order businesses
(see p. 445). Table 32 shows the number of establishments and turnover for
some of the main groups of retail business between 1957 and 1964.
Out of a total of over 580,000 establishments recorded by the 1961 Census
of Distribution, and shown in Table 33, grocery and other food retailing
groups numbered over 278,000 establishments, and the clothing and foot¬
wear group about 92,000.
A very wide range is covered in the size of retailing establishments. On
the one hand there were ten shops (nine of them department stores) with
sales in 1961 exceeding £5 million or having takings of more than £2,000 an
hour; at the other extreme there were more than 70,000 establishments
taking less than £2,000 in a year. Some of these are market and street traders,
whose volume of business may be very small.
The 1961 census showed that, in comparison with 1957, a larger volume of
trade has been handled by almost exactly the same number of shops and by
much the same number of people. A notable feature was the continued
expansion of the large multiple firms; these showed a further increase
between 1961 and 1964 relative to other types of shops. Independent shops,
however, still account for half of Britain’s retail trade.
According to the Census of Distribution there were nearly 70,000 shops
owned by multiples (including multiple departmental stores) in 1961, having
a total turnover of £2,580 million. This form of organisation showed the
largest rise in numbers between 1957 and 1961 and their share in total sales
went up from 25 per cent to 29 per cent. In the food trades their turnover
increased by 42 per cent, compared with 11 per cent for independent retailers
and only 3 per cent for co-operative societies. Other large retailers (small
chains with from five to nine branches and other firms with 25 or more

persons engaged) appear to have about maintained their relative position
from 1957 to 1961. Large traders of all kinds (including co-operative societies)
accounted for nearly 50 per cent of sales in food shops as a whole and for
60 per cent of the sales of all clothing shops. The number of co-operative
stores increased slightly between 1957 and 1961 but their share in total retail
trade dropped from 12 to 11 per cent. They account for a fifth of the turnover
of all grocers and a third of the turnover of all dairymen.

h Excluding department stores owned by co-operative societies.
Smaller independent shops have been giving ground only slowly in the face
of increased competition from the larger undertakings. The proprietors of
many of the smaller shops often have other means of livelihood. Average
turnover per shop increased, though by less than for the retail trade as a
whole. None the less, allowing for a 4 per cent increase in prices, the average
small independent shop sold more goods in 1961 than in 1957.
There were nearly 800 department stores in Britain in 1961, having a turnover
of nearly £550 million—about 6 per cent of the total turnover of all retail
establishments. Department stores were defined for the purposes of the 1961
census as having 25 or more persons engaged in selling clothing and at least
four other major commodity groups. Women’s, girls’ and infants’ wear,
haberdashery and other drapery was the most important category of goods
sold, accounting for over a third of turnover. A firm or a group of firms
frequently owns several department stores. Three groups of this kind owned
!45 stores in 1961 and co-operative societies owned a further 210 stores. In
1961 there were 53 stores each with a turnover above £2 million, accounting

for nearly 40 per cent of the turnover in this kind of business. Of the nine
department stores, mentioned on p. 442, which had a turnover of over
-£5 million, six were in the London area.
In broad terms, the kinds of retail trade which have been expanding most
rapidly since 1957 are the household goods shops—-especially radio and
television shops and do-it-yourself shops—and chemists and booksellers.
The share of foodstuffs in total retail trade has been roughly constant, though
off-licences (shops and other establishments selling beer, wines and spirits),
dairies and bread and flour confectioners have increased by more than the
average.
The value of retail sales increased by 13 per cent between 1961 and 1964
(an increase of just over 4 per cent per year), roughly the same as between
1957 and 1961 but less than between 1950 and 1957 (6 per cent). For 1964,
as a whole, retail sales increased compared with 1963 by 5 per cent in value
and by 2 per cent in volume. Food sales rose by 5 per cent in value and
1 per cent by volume but for non-food shops there was an increase in real
terms of 4 per cent. Sales of durable goods increased by 7 per cent in 1964,
the business of gas and electricity showrooms being particularly buoyant.
Clothing and footwear sales, however, showed a smaller increase. Other kinds
of business which contributed heavily to the rise in sales in 1964 were mail
order businesses and jewellers.
In Northern Ireland, it is estimated that the value of retail sales increased
by 6 per cent in 1964, compared with an increase of 4 per cent in 1963 and
3 per cent in 1962.
Retail prices, which had previously been rising for some years until 1958, were
relatively stable in 1959 and i960, but again moved upwards between 1961
and 1964. The rise was relatively large in 1964 on account of higher import
prices and increased taxes.
The development of self-service in retail establishments since 1950 has
probably helped the multiple stores and, to a lesser degree, the retail co¬
operatives to achieve a higher rate of expansion in sales. According to the
1961 Census of Distribution, self-service sales exceeded £525 million, two
and a half times the level of 1957, and the average turnover in fully self-
service grocery shops was over ^55,000 compared with £13,000 in other
grocery shops. About 9,500 stores, of which 9,100 were grocers, were operated
wholly or partly on self-service lines towards the end of 1961, compared with
4,000 in 1957, less than 500 in 1950 and 10 in 1947. By the end of 1964 it is
estimated that there were probably over 16,000 and the number was growing
at a rate exceeding 100 a month. The share of different forms of organisation
in the total of self-service business changed considerably between 1957 an<^
1961. The share of co-operative societies in total turnover decreased from
61 per cent to 39 per cent, while that of larger multiples (with ten or more
branches) increased from 28 per cent to 42 per cent and that of independents
(with up to nine branches) increased from 11 per cent to 20 per cent. A
quarter qf all self-service grocers were in London and the south-east of
England.
Supermarkets may be defined as self-service shops with a minimum selling
area of 2,000 square feet and having three or more check-out points. There
were about 750 supermarkets in 1961, according to the Census of Distribution,
of which 506 were owned by multiples, 203 by co-operative societies and
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 445
40 to 50 independents. It has been estimated that by the end of 1964 about
1,600 had been opened. The number of really large self-service shops in
Britain, however, is still relatively small.
Shopping Centres New trading ventures in Britain are enclosed shopping centres. One was opened
at the Bull Ring, Birmingham, in 1964 and one at the Elephant and Castle, in
south-east London, in 1965. A further centre is due to be opened at Chester
in 1966. Each centre has cost between £2 and ^5 million to build. They
comprise a large number of shops on more than one level, well served by
transport and parking facilities. About 140,000 people go to the Bull Ring to
shop every week, and the Elephant and Castle centre has 3 million people
living within a three-mile radius.
Automatic Vending New forms of automatic vending machines have come to the fore since
Machines I955> and an increasing number of coin-operated machines are being installed
in factories and commercial premises as well as in normal retail outlets. The
range of goods sold is widening, with hot and cold beverages and prepared
foodstuffs among the most popular. Various estimates have been made of the
trade done through automatic machines; about 300,000 machines are in
use, and total sales may be of the order of £20 million to £25 million a
year. Traders who owned and operated automatic vending machines, but were
not otherwise engaged in retail trade, had sales of over £4 million in 1961.
Mobile Shops Some 11,700 mobile shops1 were reported in the Census of Distribution for
1961, with sales amounting to £93 million. Nearly a quarter of this turnover
was concentrated in Scotland (compared with a tenth of all retail sales).
Co-operative societies accounted for 39 per cent of sales through mobile food
shops, against 16 per cent in ordinary food shops. For the most part, mobile
shops were concerned with food sales; about 40 per cent were travelling
grocers, and over 25 per cent and 20 per cent respectively were greengrocers
. and butchers. Only a very small proportion (about 6 per cent) were non-food
shops, and these specialised mainly in paraffin supplies and hardware.
Stamp Trading Stamp trading—the practice of giving stamps in proportion to the value of
goods sold, which may be exchanged later for a ‘free gift’—has expanded
rapidly in recent years. There are, however, signs that the rate of growth is
levelling off. According to an unofficial estimate made in 1964 they are saved,
on average, by about 36 in every 100 women in Britain, with a possibly
higher proportion in the London area, and are given by some 50,000 retail
outlets, the majority of which are food shops and petrol stations. The two
largest stamp companies in Britain claim about 90 per cent of the business,
the rest being shared among a number of small companies. Since July 1965
issuers of stamps have been required to mark them with their cash value and
redeem them in cash if so requested. Gifts distributed by the companies had a
retail value of about £8 million in 1964.
Mail Order
>ales and
Direct Selling
Mail order trading has been one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain in recent years, especially in the north of England. Mail order
sales through all channels reached £276 million in 1961. The 1961 Census of
Distribution showed that the sales of specialist retail mail order businesses
had risen from £126 million in 1957 to ^227 million in 1961, a rise of 80 per
cent; they showed a further increase of 42 per cent between 1961 and 1964.
Mail order sales in 1961 by large retailers amounted to £12 million, by
manufacturers to £34 million and by wholesalers to £4 million.
1 Excluding roundsmen and vans selling ice-cream.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Mail order houses operate through advertising in the press or through
recruiting agents who have at their disposal elaborate catalogues. General
mail order houses still largely dominate the trade, with sales of £205 million in
1961. About half of the goods sold by mail order are clothing and about a third
are household goods; sales of radio and electrical goods have increased con¬
siderably since 1957. The smaller mail order businesses generally specialise
in a single commodity, notably in the sale by post of seeds, plants and small
horticultural requisites.
An inquiry conducted by the Board of Trade showed that sales by manu¬
facturers direct to the public totalled ^144 million in 1961, compared with
£70 million in 1950. Mail order sales accounted for 24 per cent of the former
total, sales to employees for 11 per cent, and charges for work done for 9 per
cent. Other direct sales, including sales by door-to-door salesmen, accounted
for the balance of 56 per cent. Included in these sales were items as various as
carpets, washing machines, brushes, books and soft drinks.
Retail The retail co-operative societies are voluntary non-profit-making organisations
Co-operative engaged in retail trade and controlled by their members, who are also their
Societies customers. An operating surplus is returned periodically to members as a
dividend, and the amount distributed is proportionate to the value of the
member’s purchases.
Retail co-operatives also sell to the general public, but membership is open
to anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum share, which entitles the
member to an equal voice with other members in determining the policy of
the society. Investment by individual members is limited to £1,000 but the
rules of some societies fix lower limits. Only a low rate of interest is paid
on the shares.
At the end of 1963 there were 871 retail co-operative societies registered
under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act. Amalgamations are slowly
diminishing the number of societies, the total having fallen by 84 in three
years. More than a quarter of the total membership of the co-operatives
(12,961,000) was provided by the ten largest societies, each of which had a
membership of more than 150,000. One, the London Co-operative Society
with just under 1-3 million members and a turnover of over £50 million a
year, is the largest retail co-operative in the world. Total sales of the retail
co-operative societies in 1963 reached £1,025 million (this figure includes
certain activities not covered by the Census of Distribution figure in Table
32); and of the total trading surplus, £40 million, or about three-quarters, was
allocated to dividends on sales.
Service Trades About 1-3 million people are employed in Great Britain in industries providing
services directly to the public which are closely connected with the distributive
trades. The largest number are in the catering and hotel trades, employing
about 580,000; in the garage and motor repair trades there are over 390,000;
and in sport and other forms of entertainment, 180,000.
Catering An inquiry undertaken by the Board of Trade relating to i960 showed
that there were 124,000 establishments primarily concerned with catering
with a total turnover in that year of £1,300 million. (Catering was defined to
cover public houses, canteens, and fish and chip shops, as well as hotels and
restaurants, etc.). Hotels and holiday camps (i.e. excluding boarding houses
and unlicensed hotels) had receipts of about £17° million, of which £70
million was from residential accommodation. Nearly half the total turnover
of the catering trades was from the sale of alcoholic drinks. Between i960

Sales
and 1964 the turnover of all caterers increased by 26 per cent: the increase
was spread throughout all branches of catering.
There are about 1,400 commercial laundries with an annual turnover of
about ^67 million, of which some £45 million is domestic laundry. (The
latter figure has tended to decline with the increasing popularity of coin-
operated washing machines and launderettes.) Dry cleaning firms in 1961
had a turnover of £40 million.
An inquiry undertaken by the Board of Trade for 1962 showed that there were
nearly 47,000 businesses in the motor trades in Britain, with nearly 58,000
establishments. Their total turnover amounted to £2,962 million, including
transactions between traders amounting to roughly £6oo-£8oo million.
Traders classified as new vehicle dealers had nearly 14,700 establishments
and accounted for two-thirds of the total turnover. Over 14,000 establishments
were classified as being primarily petrol stations, and 12,600 were also general
repairers.
Takings in hairdressing establishments have increased very rapidly—from
£38 million in 1950 to £62 million in 1957 and £97 million in 1961. Over
two-thirds of total receipts are from women. The number of establishments
(currently about 40,000) has also increased, though less rapidly.
Boot and shoe repairers (excluding repairs handled through footwear shops)
had takings of £25 million in 1961, representing a steady increase since 1950.
The share of multiple firms and co-operative societies in this trade increased
at the expense of independent establishments.
The Institute of Packaging has estimated that British industry now spends
over £650 million annually on packaging, which is equivalent to between
£12 and £13 per head of the population a year. The expansion of self-service
shops and the growth of sales in the form of branded and standardised
products have been major factors in the great changes which have taken
place in packaging methods. Paper packaging remains the most extensively
used material with a turnover of £275 million a year, including cartons and
boxes. New uses are being found for tinplate (output, £110 million a year),
especially in sales of soft drinks and beer. Sales of glass containers reached
a new peak in 1964 at 5,000 million units, research having succeeded in
reducing the weight and the cost of a bottle without sacrificing strength.
The turnover of plastic packaging, however, has shown the greatest rate of
growth, rising from an insignificant level to over £30 million a year in the last
decade; new uses include crates for milk bottles, sachets for liquids and bottles
for detergents. Aerosol dispensers, almost unknown ten years ago, were being
produced at a rate of over 112 million in 1964, compared with 28 million in
1959. Their principal uses are for insecticides and air fresheners, but important
new uses are in paints, anti-perspirants, disinfectants and hair sprays.
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such
as cars, furniture, washing machines, refrigerators and cookers, has been greatly
helped by instalment purchasing. The Board of Trade has powers to regulate
the terms of hire-purchase and credit sales agreements. The current terms
are: a minimum deposit of 15 per cent on most durable consumer goods except
cookers, heaters, furniture and bedding (10 per cent) and cars and motor
cycles (25 per cent). There is usually a maximum repayment period of
30 months for most goods except furniture and bedding (three years) and
cookers and water heaters (four years). The Hire-Purchase Act 1964, which
448

Protection
came into force on ist January, 1965, gives improved protection to purchasers;
agreements up to £2,000 (formerly £300) now come within the scope of
the Act.
Total hire-purchase debt outstanding rose by about £450 million to
£937 million during the period between October 1958 and April i960 when
controls were removed; it amounted to £1,205 million at the end of July 1965.
Of this, about two-thirds was owed to finance companies and the remainder
to durable goods shops and department stores. There are a large number of
hire-purchase finance companies but a high proportion of the business is done
by a small number which operate on a national scale. It is estimated that in
1964, 50 per cent or more of all washing machines, gas and electric cookers
and radiograms were bought on hire-purchase and between roughly 30 per
cent and 45 per cent of all vacuum cleaners, electric irons, floor polishers,
tape-recorders, record players and radio sets were similarly acquired.
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating from offices in Northern Ireland amounted in 1964 to nearly
£14 million and at the end of 1964 the hire-purchase debt owed to them
amounted to £14 million.
The expansion of productive capacity and consumption in Britain has been
accompanied by a steady upward trend in expenditure on advertising. About
£501 million is estimated to have been spent on all forms of advertising in
I9^3) £22 million more than in 1962. x\bout £161 million was expended on
press advertising, well over half of it in the national and provincial press and
the rest in periodicals and magazines and in the technical trade press; and
£85 million (including tax) was spent on television advertising. The remainder
was divided between other media, such as posters, films, catalogues, window
displays, exhibitions, and free samples and gift schemes. Most of the advertis¬
ing is carried out by advertising agencies, which, in some cases, also provide
marketing, consumer research and other services; their representative
organisation is the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. The trade associa¬
tion for the industry as a whole, including the agencies, owners of advertising
media, and all others concerned in advertising, is the Advertising Association.
The latter was responsible for the setting up in 1962 of the Advertising
Standards Authority, an independent body whose objective is the promotion
and enforcement of the highest standards of advertising.
An independent body, the Advertising Inquiry Council, seeks to represent
the interests of the general public in scrutinising advertisements and trends
in advertising. The results of its inquiries are published in a quarterly bulletin
called Scrutiny.
Industry and commerce have in recent years paid increasing attention to
improving public understanding of their work and objectives. Public relations
consultancy firms and the public relations departments of advertising agencies
provide general services, apart from the increasing employment by industrial
organisations and trade associations of staff specialists in public relations.
Their professional body, founded in 1948, is the Institute of Public Relations:
not only commerce and industry, but the professions, national associations,
central and local government are represented within the Institute.
Various legislative measures exist in the United Kingdom to protect the
consumer against specific abuses. Independent organisations have also sought
to establish voluntary minimum standards of quality. Weights and measures
legislation, one of the earliest forms of consumer protection, was brought

up to date and extended in scope by the Weights and Measures Act 1963;
it is strictly enforced by qualified inspectors. The Merchandise Marks Acts
1887-1953 are designed to ensure that the marking of goods is both accurate
and honest. The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by the
Food and Drugs Acts 1955, 1956 and 1958. The Consumer Protection Act
1961 gives the Home Office power to make regulations to ensure the safety
of any class of goods.
The British Standards Institution (see p. 275) has established a number of
standards for consumer goods, and the Council of Industrial Design (see
p. 228) helps to foster improvements in the design of consumer goods.
The Consumer Council, financed by a grant-in-aid from the Board of Trade,
was set up in 1963 to concern itself with and promote the consumer’s interests'.
As a fully independent body it is free to make uninhibited criticism of govern¬
ment departments and to bring pressure to bear on other bodies. Its terms of
reference are wide but it is specifically debarred from engaging in comparative
testing of products and from taking up complaints on behalf of individual
consumers. As recommended by the Molony Committee (see below), it works
in close touch with the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (see p. 130).
Advice to its members on the merits of consumer goods is provided by the
Consumers’ Association, a private body financed by the subscriptions of
members. It tests and reports on the quality of goods bought on the open
market and its finding are published in its monthly bulletin Which?, issued
to subscribers. In addition to the Consumers’ Association there are a number
of local independent consumer groups, which in 1963 formed themselves into
a national Federation of Consumer Groups. Assistance with certain aspects
of consumer guidance is also given by a number of other private bodies and by
certain government departments. Special arrangements, in the form of con¬
sumer councils and consumer committees, have been made for the nationalised
industries. Individual trades and industries have also taken measures to raise
standards of quality.
A prospective purchaser of a second-hand car can obtain guidance as to
whether the car is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement. Virtually every
hire-purchase agreement on a car is registered with H.P. Information Ltd",
a non-profit-making company whose members are car dealers or finance
companies concerned with car sales, and this company will answer inquiries
made through its members, the police, solicitors, the motoring associations,
or the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux.
The Molony Committee on Consumer Protection, set up by the President
of the Board of Trade in 1959 to consider and report whether changes in the
law and other measures were desirable for the further protection of the
consumer, presented its final report in July 1962. Some of its principal recom¬
mendations have now been implemented, namely those concerning the setting
up of a Consumer Council and most of the suggestions for the revision of
hire-purchase law. Other recommendations of the committee included the
consolidation and modernisation of the Merchandise Marks Acts, and
amendment of the Sale of Goods Act 1893. (New legislation is now being
prepared to amend the Merchandise Marks Acts.)
The practice of resale price maintenance and its enforcement by the cutting
off of supplies is made unlawful under the Resale Prices Act 1964, though
exemptions may be granted on certain grounds by the Restrictive Practices
Court (see p. 276).

LABOUR
MANPOWER
The total working population of Great Britain at the middle of June 1965
was about 25 million, some 48 per cent of the total population, and included
about 73 per cent of persons of normal working age (15 years to 59 years for
women, 15 to 64 years for men). About 93 per cent of the men of working
age are today in or seeking gainful work. The remaining 7 per cent consist
mainly of those continuing their education, of the severely disabled and of
some persons of private means. The proportion of women of working age
in or seeking gainful work is much lower, about 50 per cent, as many
housewives have no wish to take employment outside the home or, if they
have, are prevented by household duties from doing so. Besides those of
normal working age, there are probably over a million older men and
women still at work. The great majority of the working population work for
a wage or salary, but i-6 million are employers or self-employed.
The situation is markedly different in Northern Ireland, where the ratio of
working to total population is about 40 per cent, and farmers and small¬
holders working their own holdings account for about one-tenth of the working
population. Northern Ireland, however, has under 3 per cent of the United
Kingdom population (but with a higher proportion of young persons under
15 years of age), so that the figures for Great Britain are broadly representative
of the position in the United Kingdom.
During the present century, decreases in both birth and death rates have
had the effect of increasing the proportion of persons over the age of 45 years
in both the total population and the working population (see p. 8). Changes
in laws and customs have also had an effect. The school-leaving age has been
raised to 15 years and more young people aged 15 and over are engaged in full¬
time education. The proportion of those over the normal working age who
are still working has declined (though the great increase in the number of
older persons has meant that the actual number who are working has increased).
The proportion of men aged 20 to 64 who are at work has remained very
high at all ages. Among women, on the other hand, there has been a steady
increase during the century in the proportions employed in the age groups
15 to 59, but this has been offset by the raising of the minimum working age.
There has been an increase in the employment of married women, particularly
in the last twenty years.
The proportion of single women at work tends to decrease with age.
Over 95 per cent of women aged 20 to 29 are in, or seeking, employment,
compared with about 60 per cent in their late fifties; among married women,
however, the proportion at work which is nearly 40 per cent for women in
their early twenties, declines for the age-groups 25 to 34 but rises again for
those aged between 35 and 50. A higher proportion of women are marrying.
An increasing proportion of women in the middle age groups are taking up
employment (including part-time work) and about 54 per cent of the women
at work are married.
Between 1950 and 1959 the total working population of Great Britain rose
by 5 per cent, from just under 23 million to just over 24 million. From

mid-1959 to mid-1962 it increased very sharply, by more than 750,000, owing
to the larger number of school leavers and considerable immigration. Since
June 1962, however, the growth has been relatively slight. The Ministry
of Labour estimated early in 1965 that the total labour force would have
increased by nearly half a million between 1964 and 1975. Much of this
increase is expected to be among married women. The planned raising of the
minimum school leaving age to 16 will result in a fall in the working population
between 1971 and 1972.
The broad changes in the manpower position in Great Britain between
mid-1948 and mid-1965 are shown in Table 34.

and temporarily stopped workers. Part-time workers are counted as full units.
? The working population figures include ex-Service personnel on leave after complet¬
ing their service and not included in the other figures in this table.
About 40 per cent of those in civil employment are employed in the mining
and manufacturing industries and only about 3 • 5 per cent in agriculture and
fisheries, even during the harvest season. Over half of those in manufacturing
are in the metal, engineering and chemicals groups of industries.
Most industries employ women as well as men, but there are jobs, such as
underground work in coal mines, for which it is illegal to employ women.
The industrial groups in which women are chiefly employed are in the
metal-using industries, in the manufacture of textiles and clothing, in the
food, drink and tobacco industries, and in the distributive trades and
professional and miscellaneous services.
An analysis of the total number in civil employment by broad industrial
groups is given in Table 35.
The numbers given in Table 35 as working in an industry or service
include those engaged on administrative, technical and clerical work, so that
the totals given for the production industries are greater than the numbers on

productive processes. According to an inquiry made in May 1964 by the
Ministry of Labour into the occupations of employees in manufacturing
industries in Great Britain (in firms with eleven or more employees) 24 per
cent were administrative, technical and clerical workers and the proportion
of apprentices was nearly 3 per cent. The group of industries employing the
highest proportion of administrative, technical and clerical staff were chemicals
and allied industries (over 37 per cent of their employees), followed by
engineering and electrical goods (30-5 per cent) and printing and publishing
(30 per cent). Groups with a low proportion were clothing and footwear
(under 12 per cent).

Ministry of Labour.
At the beginning of the twentieth century the occupied male population of
Great Britain still tended to be concentrated in five major groups of industries
and services: commerce and finance, agriculture, coalmining, building and
construction and engineering and shipbuilding. Women were also largely
employed in commerce and finance, but otherwise tended to be concentrated
in four other occupation groups: personal service (including domestic service),
clothing, textiles and professional work. During the past sixty-five years this
concentration and segregation of male and female labour has grown much
less marked as the result of a number of changes in the industrial and
occupational distribution of the population. The following appear to be among
the more important of these changes:
LABOUR
Unemployment
Northern
Ireland
453
C1) A general and large increase in the number of persons occupied in
professional, administrative, technical and clerical work; the increase
in the number of women in clerical work has been particularly large.
(2) A decline in the proportion of the working population engaged in
manual labour.
(3) A decrease in the number of persons occupied in private domestic
service; the number of women so occupied is now a tenth of what it
was in 1901.
(4) A large increase in the proportion of the working population employed
in professional, financial and scientific services and in personal services
other than private domestic service.
(5) ^n increase in the proportion of the working population employed in
the distributive trades.
(6) A large increase in the proportion employed by public authorities, as a
result of the taking of certain industries and services into public
ownership and also of increases in employment in national and local
government service.
(7) A continuance of the decline in agricultural employment which started
in the second half of the nineteenth century. Recent decreases are
associated with rising productivity rather than declining production.
(8) A very large increase (approaching double since 1931) in the numbers
employed in the metals, engineering and vehicles group of industries
and the chemical group. Expansion has been most marked in those
sections of the industries which are concerned with relatively new or
technically advanced products.
(9) A decline in employment in certain large old-established industries
notably coalmining, cotton textiles, shipbuilding and railways.
A manpower research unit was set up in 1963 to study the future dis¬
tribution of manpower and the probable changes in occupational structure,
so as to provide a basis for implementing the Government’s proposals for
industrial training (see p. 455) and to supply information needed for economic
planning (see p. 255).
Since the war the general unemployment rate in Britain has been among the
lowest in the world—usually between 1 and 2 per cent. Unemployment in
recent years has generally been a more serious problem in those parts of the
country which have the greatest dependence on shipbuilding, coalmining,
and certain branches of the heavy engineering and metal manufacturing
industries. In consequence unemployment in parts of Scotland and Wales
and in north-east England and Merseyside, has tended to be higher than in
the Midlands and south-east England. (For remedial action taken, see p 270 )
Between about June 1961 and the spring of 1963 the underlying trend of
unemployment was rising. For a short period during the severe weather in
the early months of 1963 unemployment reached a much higher level
(3-9 per cent in February), particularly among construction workers. Subse¬
quently the underlying trend was downward. By August 1965 unemployment
had fallen to 1-5 per cent in Great Britain. Unemployment was at that time
highest in Scotland (2-9 per cent of the region’s working population).
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed but excluding certain unpaid helpers—was about 549,000 in
454
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
General

for Adults
June 1964 (368,000 males and 181,000 females). The number of insured
employees was about 496,000. The largest productive industries are agricul¬
ture, engineering, textiles and clothing. Most of the agricultural work in
Northern Ireland is done by small farmers and their families without hired
help. The total manpower in agriculture, forestry and fisheries was 68,000 in
mid-1964, according to the official estimates of the Ministry of Health and
Social Services of the Northern Ireland Government, and was considerably
larger according to other estimates, which include unpaid helpers. The
engineering industry employs 51,000.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
England, Wales or Scotland. In June 1965 it was 5-9 per cent of the insured
employees. The Ministry of Commerce of the Northern Ireland Government
has wide powers (similar to those of the Board of Trade in development
districts in Great Britain) to assist the development and diversification of
industry. It is using these powers vigorously in an attempt to improve the
situation.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
The provision of employment services in Great Britain has been one of the
principal functions of the Ministry of Labour since its inception in 1916.
Northern Ireland has its own legislation in these matters which embodies the
main principles of the corresponding legislation in Great Britain, but owing
to the much smaller area of administration and the less favourable employment
situation, the facilities available are not so comprehensive in their scope as is
the case in Great Britain, and administrative arrangements are in some
respects on different lines. The responsible department is the Ministry of
Health and Social Services.
The following account, therefore, of services in Great Britain applies in
general to Northern Ireland except where otherwise stated. The scope of the
services in Great Britain has gradually been extended to include the provision
of advice on employment and, in suitable cases, of vocational training. The
Employment and Training Act 1948 provided a permanent legislative basis
for these wider services. The main services are provided through the country¬
wide network of some 1,000 local offices, which act as employment exchanges.
Local employment committees, composed of representatives of employers,
workers and other local interests, are attached to certain employment exchanges
as advisory bodies to secure for the department the full benefit of local
knowledge and the close co-operation of employers and workers. There is an
additional service designed to meet the needs of men and women who are
qualified for professional, administrative, managerial, executive and technical
and scientific posts at home and overseas and for those likely to qualify,
i.e. ex-regular officers of the armed forces and young men and women suitable
for training. This service is operated in Great Britain through the Professional
and Executive Register, held at 38 of the larger exchanges.
All the offices referred to above accept on their registers both employed and
unemployed persons seeking employment. Their primary function is to
introduce suitable persons seeking employment to employers requiring
employees, thus providing an efficient service to employers and job-seekers
and meeting the needs of the national economy.
The employment exchanges holding the Professional and Executive Register
are also ready to give information about the professions and allied occupations

to young men and women aged 18 years and over who have not already
established themselves in a profession or in the business world, and to older
people who wish to change their careers.
In certain densely populated areas where there are large groups of hospitals,
there are employment exchanges with officers specially trained to deal with
the employment problems of nurses, midwives and those in related occupations.
There are 27 of these offices. Outside the larger areas, nurses and their
employers are dealt with at the local employment exchange. Qualified nurses
are available to give advice and conduct interviews where necessary.
In view of the increasing number of older persons in the population the
Ministry recognises the need to promote the employment of older men and
women and seeks to persuade employers to consider older workers on their
merits without regard to their age; employment exchanges have instructions
to make special efforts to find employment for older persons.
As part of its plans for increasing productivity in industry the Government is
fostering the expansion and improvement of industrial training. The whole
framework of training in industry is being strengthened under the provisions
of the Industrial Training Act 1964. Under this Act the Minister of Labour is
empowered to set up industrial training boards which will be responsible for
the quantity and quality of industrial training in the industry concerned.
Each board can provide its own training courses or arrange for other organi¬
sations to provide training. It has power to raise a levy from employers and
make grants to those whose training courses it approves. The Minister meets
the initial administrative costs of each board and is making grants towards
certain other expenditure: for example, training courses for trainers and
research projects. By the middle of 1965 boards had been set up for nine
major industries: engineering, construction, shipbuilding, iron and steel,
wool textiles, gas, water and electricity supply and the ceramics, glass and
mineral products group of industries.
To advise the Minister of Labour on the administration of the Act and on
industrial training questions generally, a Central Training Council (CTC)
was appointed under the Act. It consists of employer and trade union
members, representatives of the nationalised industries, educationists, the
chairmen of a number of training boards and other members who have a
special interest in industrial training.
In some of the industries for which training boards have not yet been set
up, apprenticeship training is governed by agreements between employers’
associations and trade unions. Practical training is provided mainly within
the individual firm, and associated technical education is obtained by attending
a technical college. Training of operatives is usually arranged by the individual
firm but in a few industries there are agreed national or regional schemes.
The CTC also advises the Minister on the running of the Industrial
Training Service (ITS), which is grant-aided by the Ministry of Labour.
The work of the ITS, with its own board of directors and a regional organi¬
sation, includes the assessment of training needs both for industries and
individual companies, the development of training schemes at all levels, and
the promotion of group training schemes.
Other government measures to stimulate training activity include grants
for the training of training officers on approved courses, for the appointment
of training development officers and for the promotion of group training
schemes. The number of the Government’s own training centres is also being
substantially increased (see below).

456
Government
Vocational

Training of
Apprentices
A special responsibility of the local employment officer is the recruitment of
suitable persons for training under the Government Vocational Training
Scheme. In Britain the main responsibility for vocational training for employ¬
ment below professional level, including apprenticeship training for the skilled
crafts and the training of factory workers in semi-skilled processes, rests on
the industries and trades concerned. The Government itself, however,
provides training to augment what industry is doing to overcome shortages of
skilled workers in industries of importance to the national economy, as well as
helping persons in special need, such as the disabled, to fit themselves for
suitable employment. Training is provided for suitable persons over 18 years
of age who are unskilled or whose prospects of employment in their existing
trade are poor. Employed persons as well as the unemployed are accepted for
training in trades of importance to the national economy. Most of the training
is provided at Government Training Centres, which are situated within easy
reach of the main industrial centres of the country and between them offer
courses in about 40 different trades, with emphasis on trades in which there is
a shortage of skilled labour.
Under the expansion programme the number of centres is being increased
from 13 to 32 and additional places at existing centres are being provided.
When the programme is complete the centres will provide training for up to
about 13,000 persons annually. Courses vary in length according to the trade;
most of them last for six months. Schemes of training for particular trades
have been drawn up in consultation with representatives of the employers and
workers concerned who, in some cases, also assist in the selection of persons
suitable for training.
For the disabled and for ex-Regular Service men and women and the un¬
employed with special resettlement problems, training in other trades is also
available under the scheme at technical and commercial colleges and private
training schools, or by means of individual courses at employers’ establish¬
ments. For severely disabled persons training is provided at four residential
training colleges run by voluntary organisations with government financial
assistance.
During training, trainees are paid good allowances to maintain themselves
and their dependants. During 1964, 6,286 people were trained under the
scheme and about,90 per cent of them were subsequently employed in the
trade for which they had been trained.
The Ministry of Labour’s Regular Forces Resettlement Service helps
Regular officers and other ranks returning to civilian life to find suitable
employment. Nearly all those leaving the Services are successful in securing
satisfactory resettlement. The Ministry arranges special six-week business
training courses for Regulars and ex-Regulars (mainly ex-officers) at com¬
mercial and technical colleges; four-week courses in industrial supervision
are provided at the Ministry of Labour, Ebury Bridge House, London, for
non-technical warrant officers and senior NCOs (or other Service equivalent
ranks). In addition to full courses for a civilian trade, refresher courses and
conversion courses required for ex-Service men and women can be arranged
under the Vocational Training Scheme.
To demonstrate the value of systematic methods of practical and theoretical
instruction, combined with day release for further education at technical
colleges, and to encourage industry to increase its intake of young people
into skilled occupations, the Ministry is providing, at Government Training
Centres, full-time training for a limited number of first year apprentices.
Instruction is now given in four trades: engineering, radio and electronics

servicing, electrical trades, and sheet and plate metal work. The employers
continue to pay the apprentices’ wages during the course and are responsible
for completion of the remaining years of apprenticeship. In Northern
Ireland the Ministry of Health and Social Services sponsors the training of
additional apprentices by employers in the engineering industry, a condition
being that the sponsored apprentices are available for recruitment to new
industries.
The Ministry of Labour provides a sendee to industry through its scheme of
Training Within Industry for Supervisors. The four programmes of instruction
which comprise the TWI scheme are: job relations, the fostering of good
working relationships; job instruction, the technique of instructing or directing
staff; job methods, the steps taken in planning the best way of doing a job;
and job safety, which seeks to arouse safety consciousness and to train super¬
visors to detect dangers and deal with them.
The Ministry employs a staff of TWI officers, who train supervisors
directly and also train firms’ representatives to enable them to present TWI
courses to supervisors in their own concerns. The Ministry is prepared to
extend these services to overseas branches of British firms. It is prepared also
to train suitable persons to develop the scheme in their own territories. The
arrangements may be made by the government of the country concerned or
(where appropriate) by the Ministry of Overseas Development and the
International Labour Organisation (ILO).
In addition, the Ministry’s Instructor Training Colleges at Letchworth,
Hertfordshire, and Hillington, Glasgow, provide two-week courses in teaching
methods for instructors responsible for the training of apprentices and other
workers. These courses have been developed by the Ministry to meet its own
requirements for the training of instructors engaged in training adults and
apprentices at Government Training Centres, and the courses have been made
available to employers.
Vocational training services at Government Training Centres, TWI courses,
and courses at the Ministry’s Instructor Training Colleges at Letchworth and
Hillington are available to trainees from overseas under approved schemes
(for instance, those of the ILO or the Colombo Plan).
Foreigners are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment with
a particular employer, provided they are in possession of a permit issued to
the prospective employer by the Ministry of Labour (the Ministry of Health
and Social Services for Northern Ireland if the proposed employment is in
Northern Ireland): nearly 60,000 such permits are issued each year. Of these,
about one-quarter are for domestic workers in hospitals, schools, other
institutions and private households, and nearly one-eighth for student
employees. Employment is limited to a maximum of one year in the first
instance but may be extended on application by the employer.
Before a permit is issued, the Ministry of Labour must be satisfied that
there is a bona fide job, that no suitable British or foreign worker already
resident in Britain for a long period is available, and that the wages and con¬
ditions of employment are not less favourable than those enjoyed by British
workers. These conditions are waived for student employees who are admitted
for limited periods in order to improve their English and to gain a wider
knowledge of their occupations. A foreigner permitted to take employment
in the United Kingdom may not change his employment, unless his pros¬
pective employer has obtained prior approval from the Ministry to employ
the foreigner.

The permit system applies to individual foreigners, but the Ministry of
Labour has an arrangement for the admission on a ‘group’ basis of selected
Italian workers for employment in certain undermanned industries.
Britain, as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, participates with 13 European countries in the arrangements
for assisting nationals of the countries concerned to obtain employment in
other member countries.
Commonwealth citizens from overseas are subject to control under the Com¬
monwealth Immigrants Act 1962, which came into force on 1st July, 1962.
Except for those who were born in the United Kingdom or hold passports
issued by the United Kingdom Government, the control applies, broadly, to
all Commonwealth citizens. Such people, if they wish to come to Britain for
full-time employment, must first obtain a voucher issued by the Ministry of
Labour. Vouchers are issued subject to a numerical limit laid down from
time to time by the Government; priority is given to applicants who have
obtained jobs with named employers or who have certain special qualifications
of skills. (Commonwealth citizens who wish to work in Northern Ireland, and
who are not ‘Northern Ireland workers’,1 need special Northern Ireland
employment permits, which are issued only in respect of definite jobs.)
The Commonwealth Immigrants Act applies also to citizens of the Irish
Republic; but no control is imposed on persons travelling between Ireland
and Britain.
The Ministry of Labour is also responsible in Great Britain for two specialised
employment services: the Youth Employment Service and the Disablement
Resettlement Service.
The purpose of the Youth Employment Service is to help young people
at the stage of transition from school to work, up to the age of 18 years or
until they leave school if they stay beyond that age.
The Service is under the general direction of the Central Youth Employment
Executive, which is composed of senior officers of the Ministry of Labour, the
Department of Education and Science and the Scottish Education Department.
This joint executive is appointed by the Minister of Labour, who is responsible
to Parliament for the Youth Employment Service as a whole. The Minister has
appointed a National Youth Employment Council and separate advisory
committees for Scotland and for Wales to advise him.
Locally the Service is operated in most areas through Youth Employment
Offices established by local education authorities in accordance with the
schemes submitted by them to the Minister of Labour and approved by him.
In those areas where such schemes are not in operation, the Service is operated
by the local office of the Ministry of Labour. The expenditure incurred by
local education authorities in providing the Service is grant-aided to the extent
of 75 per cent by the Ministry of Labour.
The main functions of the Service are to collect and disseminate information
on careers, provide talks in schools, give vocational guidance, find suitable
employment and keep contact with young workers to help them settle down.
A further function is to help employers to fill vacancies for young people.
Local Youth Employment Committees, made up of teachers, employers,
workers and other appropriate interests, assist the service in an advisory
capacity.

In Northern Ireland the functions of the Youth Employment Service are
similar to those in Great Britain but its organisation is different. A compre¬
hensive service, for which the Minister of Education bears Parliamentary
responsibility and meets four-fifths of the cost, is operated by a statutory
board composed of representatives of local education authorities and other
educational and industrial interests. The local authorities bear one-fifth of the
cost. There are also local youth employment committees, as in Great
Britain.
The purpose of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Acts 1944 and 1958, on
which all the work of the Ministry of Labour for disabled persons is based,
is ‘to make further and better provision for enabling persons handicapped
by disablement to secure employment or work on their own account’, and the
Disablement Resettlement Service is designed to help disabled persons to get
and keep suitable work. The Service is available to all persons over school¬
leaving age who are substantially handicapped as a result of injury, disease
or congenital deformity in obtaining or keeping employment.
The Ministry of Labour is responsible for the administration of the Service
and is assisted by the National Advisory Council on the Employment of the
Disabled, set up under the 1944 Act. At each of the Ministry’s local offices
there is a disablement resettlement officer, working under the direction of the
manager and in co-operation with other officers. Besides his contacts with
employers, this officer is in touch with all the hospitals in his area and visits
any patient who wishes to discuss the question of future employment. His
work involves close co-operation with doctors, local authorities and voluntary
welfare agencies.
The help given by the Service falls under five main headings:
Vocational guidance is given at local offices by disablement resettlement
officers in consultation, as necessary, with the local disablement advisory
committees, hospital resettlement clinics and medical interviewing com¬
mittees, and also in the industrial rehabilitation units (see below).
Having regard to a disabled person’s qualifications and aptitude and to medical
guidance, and concentrating on what the person can do rather than on what
he cannot do, the disablement resettlement officer endeavours to find the
work most suited to each person, either immediately, or in appropriate cases
after a course of industrial rehabilitation or vocational training. To some
extent this is facilitated by the main provision of the Disabled Persons
(Employment) Act 1944, namely, that all employers of 20 or more persons
are required to employ a quota (at present 3 per cent for all industries, except
shipping, in respect of the manning of ships) of registered disabled persons.
Registration is voluntary. The number of disabled persons registered on
19th April, 1965, was 658,925. On 10th May, 1965, 46,522 registered disabled
were unemployed, 39,996 being considered capable of ordinary employment.
The remaining 6,526 were so severely disabled as to be classed as unlikely to
obtain ordinary employment, though in fact many so classed are found work
in open industry by careful selective placement.
Industrial rehabilitation1 is provided at seventeen units run by the Ministry
of Labour. The aim of these units is to provide the final link between sickness
and employment by enabling men and women to adjust themselves gradually
to normal working conditions and to give vocational guidance based on

skilled assessment of their aptitudes. Attendance at the unit is voluntary and
maintenance allowances are paid. Each man or woman is given an individually
planned course (lasting from 10 to 12 weeks) supervised by specialist staff
consisting of doctor, industrial psychologist, social worker, disablement
resettlement officer, remedial gymnast and industrially experienced workshop
supervisors, under the general leadership of a rehabilitation officer. Recom¬
mendations for courses are made to the disablement resettlement officer of
an Employment Exchange by hospitals, doctors, employers and welfare
organisations. This officer is responsible for putting into effect the unit’s
recommendation on future employment or training.
The Ministry gives financial assistance to two centres conducted by
voluntary organisations which provide similar facilities for the blind. It has
also approved, on an experimental basis, two schemes by voluntary organisa¬
tions for the rehabilitation of patients from mental hospitals.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government Training
Centres, educational institutions and employers’ establishments. For the more
seriously disabled there are special residential training colleges run by voluntary
organisations with the financial assistance and technical help of the Ministry
of Labour. There are also arrangements for the training of special categories
of disabled persons such as the blind, and for providing disabled persons
(including the blind), who are of the appropriate educational standard, with
grants to undertake study or training for the purpose of qualifying for pro¬
fessional or comparable employment.
Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company with no share capital, was
set up in accordance with the provisions of the Disabled Persons (Employment)
Act 1944. Its object is to provide employment facilities for registered disabled
persons unlikely to obtain work except under special conditions. Its powers
include the provision of special factories and workshops, hostel accommodation
and facilities for homeworkers. The directors are appointed by the Minister
of Labour; funds for capital development and to meet operational costs are
provided by loans and grants under the Ministry of Labour Vote. At the end
of 1964 Remploy Ltd. operated some 90 factories and employed 6,800
severely disabled men and women, including some 150 homeworkers.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT,
CONDITIONS OF WORK AND LABOUR RELATIONS
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, industrial workers lacked legiti¬
mate means of defending their standards of living or of ameliorating their
working conditions. The traditional methods of fixing wages had become
obsolete, trade unions were regarded as criminal conspiracies, and there was
no protective legislation setting minimum standards of safety, health and
welfare in places of work.
The first attempt at protective legislation was the Health and Morals of
Apprentices Act 1802, but the first effective Factory Act was that of 1833,
which created an inspectorate employed and paid by the central Government
to enforce its provisions. Since that date, legislation extending, strengthening,
adapting and consolidating the statutory protection for employees has been
passed at an accelerating rate. The progress in standards has owed much to
the recommendations of strengthened inspectorates, much to the example of
progressive employers and much to the persistent pressure of trade unions
and disinterested reformers.
LABOUR
461
Trade unions ceased to be actionable conspiracies in 1824 but their status as
legal entities was not properly established until 1871. This latter step had
been made acceptable to public opinion by the leaders of certain craft unions,
who had abandoned the revolutionary and financially unsound policies of
earlier trade unions to pursue the limited practical objectives of securing for
their members better wages and improved working conditions.
After 1880 the organisation of unskilled workers became more extensive
and effective and the whole tone of trade unionism became more militant and
political, while employers began to form associations in an increasing number
of industries. Partly as a result of continuing antagonisms and of the changing
and difficult economic situation, much of the first thirty years of the twentieth
century was marked by widespread and prolonged strikes. Since 1932, how¬
ever, the strike rate (in terms of man-days lost) has, in most years, been very
much lower, and arrangements for the negotiation of terms of service and the
peaceful settlement of disputes have become general and are on the whole
satisfactory.
This improvement in industrial relations has been achieved mainly by
voluntary action. Except in certain industries where wages and holiday pay
are fixed by statutory order, there has been very little legal limitation on the
right of an employer to hire an employee on any terms which the employee
will accept. There is, in general, no legal obligation on an employer to recognise
a trade union, or not to refuse to employ trade unionists; nor is a collective
agreement with a trade union held to be in itself a legal contract of employ¬
ment, though the terms of a collective agreement may be expressly or by
implication incorporated in an individual contract of employment. The
Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959 does, however, provide
machinery for enforcing on an employer the observance of terms or conditions
established by collective agreement in his industry (see p. 476). Two recent
statutes have extended the legal rights of employees; under the Contracts of
Employment Act 1963, employers are now required to give their employees
written particulars of the main terms of employment, and employees are
given rights to minimum periods of notice when their employment is to be
terminated; under the Redundancy Payments Act 1965, employees with a
minimum period of service of two years are entitled to lump sum payments if
their jobs cease to exist (for example, because of technological improvements
or because of a fall in demand) and their employers cannot offer suitable
alternative work, the cost being partly met from a fund subscribed to by
industry as a whole.
Nevertheless, in the majority of trades and industries minimum or standard
wages, normal working hours and other terms of employment are effectively
settled by collective agreements, whose negotiation and observance continue
to depend primarily on the strength, integrity and representative character
of the signatory organisations rather than on any legal sanction. The deter¬
mination by statute of minimum wages, holidays and holiday pay is in
principle confined to those trades and industries where the organisation of
employers or workers, or both, is inadequate to negotiate collective agree¬
ments and to ensure their observance.
On the other hand, the conditions of work of employees—their safety,
health and welfare—depend to a far greater extent on minimum standards
established by statute and enforced by official inspectorates. Voluntary action
is, however, of the greatest importance even in these matters. In some cases,
additional health, safety or welfare requirements are the subject of collective
agreements, while many employers provide higher standards on their own

initiative with help and advice from government departments and various
voluntary bodies.
Management-employee relations depend not only on terms and conditions
of employment, but on human relationships at the place of work; managements
have in recent years become increasingly concerned with improving such
relationships.
Minimum or standard time rates for most British manual workers, as deter¬
mined by agreements or by statutory orders, vary between 4s. 3d. and
5s. 3d. an hour for men and between 2s. nd. and 3s. nd. for women. Actual
earnings are usually higher. Higher rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates,
shift rates and overtime rates raise the level of average earnings.
The Ministry of Labour conducts a six-monthly survey of earnings and
hours of work of manual workers in manufacturing industries and in some
of the principal non-manufacturing industries in Great Britain. Table 36,
which is based on these surveys, shows how weekly and hourly earnings have
risen over the last five years. The survey does not cover agriculture, coal¬
mining, railways, dock work, shipping, distribution, catering or other services
but average weekly earnings are separately compiled for the first four of these
industries; they are somewhat above the average in coalmining and dock
work, and below the average in railway work and agriculture.

Between April 1955 and October 1964 average weekly wage rates increased
by about 42 per cent and average weekly earnings by about 64 per cent. Part
of the increase has been offset by a rise in the cost of living. The trends of
manual workers’ earnings, salaries, wage rates and retail prices from 1952
to 1964 are shown in the diagram on p. 463.
Women manual workers are for the most part engaged on different tasks
from men. Their earnings are markedly lower than men’s earnings, partly
because a high proportion of the work is of an unskilled or semi-skilled nature
and also because the average hours worked by women are shorter. Women’s
wage rates tend to be set at around 70-90 per cent of the male rate for similar
work, though this gap is gradually closing. In the relatively few instances
where men and women are employed on precisely the same type of manual

work, and under identical conditions, collective agreements frequently
provide for equal rates of pay.
The starting salaries in many professional and technical careers are often in
the range of £600 to ^8oo a year, though they may be lower for trainees
starting work in their teens, and higher for some graduates entering industry

and the Civil Service. Such posts offer incremental progression to higher
salaries and opportunities for promotion.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
are in the range of £2,750 to £7,000 a year. The posts with salaries of ^5,000
to £15,000 a year include those of Cabinet Ministers, most chairmen and
full-time members of boards of nationalised industries, judges of the High
Court and Court of Appeal, and Lords of Appeal, the Permanent Secretaries
of government departments, the clerks of the largest municipal authorities,
editors of daily newspapers, some persons outstanding in their professions
and in the higher managerial posts in industry, commerce and banking. A
few persons in business draw still higher salaries, while the earnings of star
entertainers and certain other very successful people exceed £25,000 a year.
Statistics published by the Inland Revenue Department indicate that in
1962-63 some 20-7 per cent of male employees received £1,000 a year or
more by way of wages or salaries (or pension after retirement), 4-7 per cent
£1,500 a year or more, 2-1 per cent £2,000 a year or more and o-8 per cent
£3,000 a year or more. Some 3 per cent of women employees received £1,000
a year or more.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices,
administrative posts and professions. They are paid the same salary for
doing the same work in journalism, broadcasting and architecture, and as
Ministers of the Crown, members of Parliament, salaried magistrates and
solicitors. Women in independent professions are not expected to charge
lower fees than men. The principle of equal pay has been applied to non-
manual work in the Civil Service, local government, the health service,
teaching and the nationalised industries (coal, gas, electricity and transport).
In many other non-manual occupations, however, women are still paid lower
salaries than are men engaged on comparable work.
Hours of Work In April 1965 the number of hours actually worked by manual workers
averaged 47-5 for men and 39-1 for women on full-time work. Agreed weekly
hours are mainly in the range 40 to 42 and may be worked as either a five-day
or a five-and-a-half-day week according to the industry and the rule of the
particular establishment. Hours actually worked by men are somewhat longer
owing to overtime working.
While the hours of work of adult men are not, in general, restricted by
statute, normal hours of work for both sexes and those of all ages are usually
well within the legal limits on the hours of women and young persons.
National legislation in the United Kingdom embodies a general prohibition
of employment of children under thirteen years of age; forbids the employ¬
ment of older children and women in certain occupations; and limits and
defines permissible hours of work for women and young persons in a number
of industries or trades. Children aged thirteen to fifteen may not be employed
during school hours or before 7 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on any day, or for more
than two hours on school days or on Sundays. This part-time employment
is further regulated in various ways by statute and by by-laws made by local
authorities.
The Shops Act 1950 makes local authorities responsible for ensuring that
the shops in their area observe its requirements. With certain exceptions,
shops must be closed on weekdays by 8 p.m. (9 p.m. on one late day) except
on the early closing day when they must be closed by 1 p.m., and all day
on Sunday; but local authorities may make orders modifying these and other
provisions of the Act within their own area. The hours of work of shop

employees under sixteen years of age are normally restricted to 44 a week,
and those of employees between sixteen and eighteen years of age to 48 a
week, with limited provision for overtime. Broadly speaking, all shop assistants
must be given a half-holiday (half a day) every week and, in addition, every
Sunday off or another day off instead.
In premises to which the Factories Act applies the working hours of women
and young persons between the ages of sixteen and eighteen are, subject to
certain exceptions, limited to 48 a week and nine a day, although some over¬
time is allowed (up to six hours a week but not more than 100 hours a year or
in more than 25 weeks in a year). Young persons who have not yet attained
the age of sixteen are limited to 44 hours a week. The maximum spell of work
and the intervals which must be allowed for meals are also specified. With
limited exceptions in certain continuous processes, the employment of women
and young persons at night is prohibited.
In mines and quarries, women and young persons under eighteen may not
normally start work before 6 a.m. and must never start before 5 a.m. Their
work must normally end before 9 p.m., in the case of young persons under
sixteen, and before 10 p.m., in the case of women and young persons aged
sixteen to eighteen; and never in any case after n p.m.
The Young Persons (Employment) Act 1938 imposes restrictions on the
hours of work of young persons (48 a week at the age of sixteen years and over
and 44 for those under sixteen years) in certain occupations not covered by
the Factories Act, the Mines and Quarries Act 1954, or the Shops Act 1950.
With a few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in indus¬
tries covered by agreements or statutory orders are entitled to paid holidays
of at least twelve days or two weeks. Moreover, payment is made for bank or
statutory public holidays, which are as follows: in addition to Good Friday
and Christmas Day, there are Bank Holidays in most parts of England, Wales
and the Channel Islands on Easter Monday, Whit-Monday, the last Monday
in August1 and the first weekday after Christmas (Boxing Day), and in
Scotland on New Year’s Day, the first Monday in May, and the last Monday
in August.2 Northern Ireland observes all the English holidays and, in
addition, has a holiday on St. Patrick’s Day, 17th March, and on 12th July
(commemorating the Battle of the Boyne, 1690); Easter Tuesday is also a
customary holiday for industry and trade. Many agreements provide that
payments should also be made for specially proclaimed holidays.
In some industries agreements provide for extended holidays related to
length of service with the same employer, whilst in others there is a progressive
increase so that at some date in the future the basic period becomes three
weeks instead of two weeks. In addition, numerous firms have long-service
extended holiday schemes which apply to both staff and manual workers.
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their
employees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a
duty of care towards each other. In addition, minimum required standards
of safety in certain kinds of workplaces or work are laid down under a number
1 The August Bank Holiday in 1965 was for the first time on the last Monday, not the
first, in the month. This is an experiment, to be repeated in 1966, which the Government
hopes will give a lead in extending the summer holiday season over a longer period.
2 In most towns in Scotland two locally determined days are observed more widely
than the Bank Holiday (outside the banking community) as the spring or autumn
holiday.

of statutes, some of which also deal with health and welfare. The statutes
include: the Mines and Quarries Act 1954, the Agriculture (Safety, Health
and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956, the Factories Act 1961 (which consolidates
earlier Acts), and the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963, which
closely follows the Factories Act 1961. Fatal and serious industrial accidents
have tended to diminish during the twentieth century and the British rates
for fatal and serious accidents are among the lowest in the world.
Over 200,000 industrial premises (factories, workshops, slaughterhouses,
shipyards and docks) and about 25,000 building and civil engineering sites
come under the Factories Act, which is administered by the Ministry of
Labour and enforced by H.M. Inspectorate of Factories, which forms part
of the Ministry. The actual strength of the Factory Inspectorate, including
medical and other specialists, was 473 in 1964, its authorised strength being
517. Over a million premises come under the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act, which is also administered by the Ministry of Labour; enforce¬
ment is shared by H.M. Inspectorate of Factories and local authorities.
Under these Acts, anyone intending to employ other people in industrial
or commercial premises to which they apply has to notify the enforcing
authority of his intention before he begins to employ people and every fatal
accident and every accident causing more than three days’ incapacity must be
reported; under the Factories Act provision is also made for compulsory
notification and for investigation of certain dangerous occurrences.
In addition, a number of general and specific safety requirements are laid
down. The general requirements of the Factories Act include provisions con¬
cerning the fencing of prime movers, transmission machinery and dangerous
parts of other machinery; the sale, hire or use of power-driven machinery
without effective guards of certain parts; the cleaning of machinery in motion;
the training and supervision of young persons employed at certain machines;
the safety and examination of hoists and lifting equipment, steam boilers and
steam and air receivers; the construction of floors; precautions against falls,
against gassing, and against explosions of flammable dust or gas; fire prevention,
fire-fighting, fire alarms and means of escape in case of fire; the protection of
the eyes; precautions where dangerous substances are present; and the lifting
of heavy weights. These general requirements are supplemented or modified
by regulations providing for safeguards against special risks in particular
industries, processes, and types of machinery. There are corresponding
provisions in the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act to deal with the
hazards arising in these premises, with power to make regulations.
Safety depends, in fact, at least as much on the education and voluntary
efforts of the employers and of the workers as upon safety regulations. In
addition to regulatory functions, the Ministry of Labour since 1959 has had the
duty of promoting safety, health and welfare in factories by the collection and
dissemination of information and by investigating safety, health and welfare
problems—activities which had, in fact, long been an important part of the
Ministry’s work. The voluntary Accident Prevention Movement is strongly
supported by the Factory Inspectorate. Inspectors inquire into safety aspects
of machine design and specification, circulate expert advice by personal
exhortation, lectures and literature, and encourage the appointment of safety
officers and the formation of works safety committees. The Factory Inspec¬
torate maintains an industrial health and safety centre in London, at which
various types of machinery demonstrating the effectiveness of guards are
displayed, as well as a wide range of protective clothing and equipment. The

Ministry also actively encourages the development of voluntary central
organisation within each industry at national level for the consideration of
safety matters and the formulation of policy on accident prevention.
The concern of both trade unions and employers’ associations with safety
helps to maintain safety standards; and the requirements about accident
notification help inspectors to examine the means of prevention with employers,
machinery manufacturers and interested organisations. But the voluntary
co-operation of managements and employees in individual workplaces is
essential to the safety drive. Many firms have works safety committees and,
in many areas, safety groups have been organised, whose members meet
monthly for the exchange of information, discussions, lectures and films on
safety measures.
Training for safety is an important facet of the safety drive and, to help in
this work, the Ministry of Labour has incorporated a safety course in the
Training Within Industry for Supervisors (TWI) scheme (see p. 457). An
industrial safety training centre in Birmingham is run by the Birmingham
and District Industrial Safety Group, and there are safety training centres
for the construction industries which have been set up, with the assistance
of the Ministry of Labour, by local accident prevention groups at Enfield
(London), Aintree (Liverpool), Granton (Edinburgh), Norwich and Leeds
and by the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors at Cardiff. The
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents helps the accident prevention
movement by providing publicity and organising conferences and courses
for safety officers, it has recently organised a course for the training of
safety instructors. The British Safety Council offers a similar service.
Organisations in industry are now concerning themselves to an increasing
extent with the promotion of safety at work and the provision of information
and advisory services to their members. They participate also in joint standing
and advisory committees appointed by the Minister of Labour. Representatives
of the Trades Union Congress, the Confederation of British Industry, the
nationalised industries and the Ministry of Labour meet on the Industrial
Safety Sub-committee of the National Joint Advisory Council. The Minister
of Labour has also established a joint advisory committee, representative of
employers and workers in the building and civil engineering industries, to
examine safety and health problems in these industries.
The safety of workers in mines and quarries is the subject of comprehensive
legislation which also deals with health and welfare at work and a number of
related matters. Protective legislation in mines began with an Act of 1842,
which forbade the employment of women underground; successive measures
laid down detailed requirements for the safe conduct of operations and dealt
with such matters as ventilation, dust suppression, support of workings, the
safe use of electricity, rescue and first aid. The latest stage was reached when
the Mines and Quarries Act was passed in 1954. This Act established the
basic modern principles of safety, health and welfare, leaving the details to
be dealt with in statutory regulations; it both consolidates the previous law
and brings it up to date. Apart from technical matters, it also covers such
subjects as the general responsibilities of owners and managements, the
appointment and duties of officials, training, welfare, the powers of official
inspectors, statutory qualifications of managers and under-managers, employ¬
ment of women and young persons, and inspections on behalf of workmen.
The Ministry of Power is responsible for the administration of these
468

Transport
enactments, while the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, which is part of the
Ministry of Power, is responsible for their enforcement.
The National Coal Board is expressly charged with the statutory duty of
securing the safety, health and welfare of its employees and has set itself to
accomplish this in all practicable ways. The Board has its own safety organisa¬
tion—a Standing Committee on Safety, a chief safety engineer, and safety
engineers at divisions, areas and the largest collieries. It conducts courses of
safety training for workmen and officials and is constantly on the alert for
new methods of reducing risks. Its research programme includes a number of
projects with a direct bearing on safety. Examples of voluntary action by the
Board to reduce risks include the use of fire-resistant conveyor belting, and
the withdrawal of light alloy equipment from the coal face pending the
development of an alloy unlikely to cause dangerous sparks.
The Minister of Power has a statutory responsibility for research concerning
the safety and health of coal miners. This responsibility is largely exercised
through its Safety in Mines Research Establishment with laboratories at
Sheffield and Buxton.
Two Acts provide for the protection of agricultural workers by means of
regulations made by the Ministers concerned with agriculture in Britain.
The risks involved in the use of chemicals are dealt with in the Agriculture
(Poisonous Substances) Act 1952; other risks are covered by the Agriculture
(Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956. Regulations have been
made dealing with the safe use of dangerous chemicals, the provision of
first-aid equipment, safety standards for workplaces and ladders, the safe¬
guarding and safe operation of farm machinery, the lifting of heavy weights
and the avoidance of accidents to children arising out of the use of farm
vehicles and machines. Regulations are enforced by inspectors of the
Agricultural Departments. To safeguard the many interests which might
be adversely affected by the use of chemicals in agriculture and food storage,
a voluntary scheme is operated by the Government with the help of an
advisory committee and with the full co-operation of the chemical industry.
The general safety legislation covering the main forms of transport protects
transport workers as well as members of the public against accidents involving
moving vehicles.
In the interests of road safety, the hours of driving and the rest periods of
drivers of buses and goods vehicles are regulated by the Road Traffic Acts.
In certain cases, the driver must be accompanied by a second person.
The Merchant Shipping Acts, for the administration of which the Board
of Trade is responsible, cover in great detail the question of marine safety,
including navigational procedures, the strength and design of hulls, the
safety of machinery, the safety and design of living quarters, life-saving
appliances, measures for protection against fire, and the carriage of special
cargoes and dangerous goods.
The Air Navigation Order and Regulations provide for the registration of
aircraft and for the issue of certificates of airworthiness and of competency
certificates and licences for aircrew, lay down requirements for safety equip¬
ment and for safety procedures during take-off, flight and landing, and
prescribe maintenance schedules for public transport aircraft. The Minister
of Aviation delegates most of his powers in respect of airworthiness to the
Air Registration Board (see p. 389).

an inspectorate whose main functions are statutory approval of new works on
railways carrying passenger traffic; accident investigation, including the
holding of formal inquiries; and technical advice to the Minister.
In addition to general safety legislation, there are certain statutory pro¬
visions concerned entirely, or mainly, with the safety of employees; for
example, railway employees are protected by the Railway Employment
(Prevention of Accidents) Act 1900, and the statutory rules and orders made
under it which enable the Ministry of Transport to require the use of safe
plant and appliances, to forbid what is unsafe, and to make rules for safe rail¬
way operation. This Act also sanctioned the appointment of inspectors, now
known as Railway Employment Inspectors, who inquire into the more serious
accidents to railway employees.
Both transport operators and the Ministries of Transport and of Aviation
give high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every
endeavour is made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic
densities, by improving the design of vehicles, transport plant and equipment,
by traffic regulation and control of standards of maintenance and by training
crews in competency and safety awareness. The detailed regulations and
instructions issued by the ministries and their agents form the basis of
elaborate safety procedures laid down by the operators themselves and by the
makers of vehicles and aircraft, equipment and works. The radio industry
and the transport services co-operate in the development and application of
radar systems and other safety devices.
There are at present no specific statutory safety requirements in hotels and
restaurants, places of entertainment or educational establishments, except in
so far as they are covered by fire regulations applicable under local authority
by-laws to all large buildings or (in respect of their offices and shops) by the
Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act. The Ministry of Labour has no
statutory responsibility in regard to safety in workshops or laboratories in
education establishments, though it keeps in touch with university authorities
and the education departments. Employers, however, are bound by their
common law obligation to provide a safe system of work, and employers and
educational authorities may voluntarily seek the advice and help of the
Factory Inspectorate, which is given freely on request.
Local authorities, under the Public Health Acts, have power to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary accommodation in houses and at places of work
and to treat workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded
as nuisances the abatement of which can be enforced.
Factories, other industrial premises, offices, shops and railway premises must
comply with the health and welfare requirements of the Factories Act or the
Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act. These include: the cleanliness of
workrooms, adequate ventilation and suitable temperature and lighting, the
avoidance of overcrowding and the provision of sanitary accommodation, and
the protection of workers against inhaling harmful dust or fumes; the provision
of washing facilities, lockers or other accommodation for outdoor clothing,
drinking water, first aid, and seats. On entry into employment in factories and
docks or on building operations all young persons under eighteen years of
age must be medically examined by doctors appointed by the Chief Inspector
of Factories and known as Appointed Factory Doctors, and they must be
re-examined annually until they reach the age of eighteen. Boys employed in
jobs involving night work are examined more frequently.

The general requirements of the Factories Act in regard to health and
welfare are supplemented by regulations, some of general application, others
providing for the needs of particular industries or processes. They may
include provision for compulsory periodic medical examinations. The Offices,
Shops and Railway Premises Act is similarly supplemented by regulations.
The far-reaching and detailed requirements of the Merchant Shipping Acts
and the regulations made thereunder include specific provisions for the
protection of merchant seamen, covering such matters as the engagement
and discharge of seamen, limitations on the employment of young persons at
sea, standards of crew accommodation, scales of provisions, medicines and
medical stores, and the care and repatriation of seamen left behind at ports
abroad.
The laws restricting the employment of children, young persons and women
form an important part of legislation to protect the health and welfare of
employees. National legislation, besides forbidding any employment of
children under thirteen years of age, forbids the employment of children
who have not reached the statutory minimum school-leaving age (see p. 156)
in any industrial undertaking; of women and young persons underground in
mines and in certain other dangerous occupations (for example, those involving
work with lead compounds); and of women in factories and workshops
within one month of childbirth. It also limits and defines the permissible
hours for children aged thirteen to fifteen and for young persons under
eighteen and women in a number of industries and occupations. Local
authorities, moreover, have wide powers under the Children and Young
Persons Acts 1933-63 as well as by the Education Acts 1944-48, which
regulate hours and conditions of employment of children under fifteen years
within their areas within the limits of national legislation.
The above are the main legislative provisions relating to health and welfare
at work, but it is essential to note that employers frequently achieve health and
welfare standards considerably higher than those prescribed by law. They are
helped to do this by the inspectorates, by government departments and
agencies, by employers’ associations and trade unions and by expert voluntary
bodies.
In addition to the statutory requirements of the Factories Act 1961, and
the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963, and regulations under
both Acts a number of employers voluntarily maintain medical services for
their employees. It is estimated that there are about 340 factories with full¬
time and about 4,700 factories with part-time doctors employed. In addition
several thousand nurses are employed in industry. Compulsory medical
examinations under the Factories Act and regulations are carried out by
2,300 part-time Appointed Factory Doctors.
The big employers, including the State and the boards of nationalised
industries, have naturally taken the lead in this matter. A number of smaller
factories also provide medical services and in a few cases have joined together
in group medical services. In 1955 the Minister of Labour appointed a
Standing Industrial Health Advisory Committee, of which he is the chairman,
to advise him on measures to further the development of industrial health
services. This committee includes persons nominated by the Confederation
of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the nationalised industries,
the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and other
organisations closely concerned with the promotion of industrial health. Two

booklets, Health at Work and Organisation of Industrial Health Services, have
been published. The former describes the medical services of 14 British
factories, while the latter provides guidance for employers considering the
establishment of an industrial health service.
Industrial hygiene services can give valuable assistance in securing healthy
working conditions in industry; there are at present two centres in Great
Britain which undertake studies of factory conditions and increasing use is
being made of their facilities. They are staffed and equipped to make compre¬
hensive investigations of particular problems or health risks and also carry
out routine physical, chemical and biological tests for industry.
Prompt and effective action in industrial health depends, among other
things, on adequate and properly co-ordinated arrangements for investigation
and research. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory Inspectorate,
which has specialised medical and technical branches. Research facilities are
provided by government agencies such as the Medical Research Council;
by the faculties of industrial health and social medicine of the universities;
and by the research departments of various industries and large industrial
concerns.
Welfare standards vary considerably from one firm to another. The amenities
provided by large factories or offices depend partly on the employees’ needs
and wishes. The requirements of a factory, or office or shop where the work
is light, and where many employees are women or young persons, are different
from those of an iron foundry or steelworks, where much of the work is
arduous and is undertaken by men. Progressive firms are careful to find out
what their employees want, and welfare policy is often decided in consultation
with the workers, through regular consultative machinery or by other means.
An increasing number of firms in Britain pay part or all of the cost of clubs
and sports grounds, operate retirement and sickness insurance schemes
supplementing the State schemes, and afford training and educational facilities.
Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes.
The provision of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become
usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. There are
also colliery canteens providing meals for about 98 per cent of coalminers,
it is customary for any surplus earned by canteens to be used to improve
the canteen or to finance some other welfare services, while any losses are
usually borne by the firm. Many offices and shops which are unable to
provide canteen facilities for their staff have adopted luncheon voucher
schemes. There are now over 15,500 firms using this service and more than
72 million vouchers are issued annually and are accepted by all principal
catering establishments.
dhe safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been
the subject of legislation which, with certain exceptions, is similar to that in
Great Britain and is embodied in separate statutes to meet the special require¬
ments of Northern Ireland. Provision for the safety, health and welfare of
workers in factories with and without power, shipyards, electrical stations,
certain institutions and at docks, warehouses, building operations and civil
engineering works is embodied in the Northern Ireland Factories Acts. Many
firms voluntarily employ safety officers, and an Industrial Safety Group for
the area, supported by representatives of industry, trade unions, insurance
companies and public authorities, is very active and makes a valuable contri-

bution in the field of industrial accident prevention on similar lines to what
is done in Great Britain.
The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
basis, and rests on the organisation of employers and workers into employers’
associations and trade unions. These organisations1 discuss and negotiate
terms and conditions of employment and other matters affecting the work¬
people at their work. In some industries these negotiations are conducted
simply by ad hoc meetings, which are held when necessary; in others, voluntary
joint machinery has been established on a permanent basis. Normally these
arrangements for collective bargaining suffice to settle all questions which
are raised, but provision is often made for matters not so settled to be referred
for settlement to independent arbitration. In certain trades where wages
cannot be effectively controlled by voluntary agreement owing to the in¬
adequate organisation of employers or workers, provision has also been made
by the State for statutory regulation under the Wages Councils Act 1959, the
Agricultural Wages Act 1948, and the Agricultural Wages (Scotland) Act 1949.
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ organisations,
which are wholly or partly concerned with labour questions.
The primary aims of such organisations are to help to establish suitable
terms and conditions of employment, including a sound wage structure and
proper standards of safety, health and welfare; to promote good relations with
employees and the efficient use of manpower; and to provide means of
settling any disputes which may arise. Different employers’ organisations
vary in the emphasis which they put upon these different aims and in the
means by which they try to achieve them. Some concentrate on defensive
action, trying by negotiation and representations to modify proposals of
trade unions and Government in their members’ interests. Others also try to
give their members practical help and advice in developing positive employ¬
ment policies. A number of them, for example, have developed training
schemes for their industries and some provide advisory services on recruitment,
training and further education and general or specialised training courses.
There is diversity in regard to structure as well as function. Generally,
however, employers’ organisations are organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis. Some are purely local in character and deal with a
section of an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with
the whole of a particular industry. In some of the chief industries there are
local or regional organisations combined into national federations, while in
others, within which different firms are engaged on making different principal
products, there is a very complex structure with national and regional
federations for these different sections of the industry as well as for the
industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 1,500 employers’ organisations
dealing with labour matters and about 80 are national employers’ federations.
The final authority of a local or small national organisation may be a meeting,
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local
organisations or through the regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council, central committee or general committee, which meets
1 Some employers, including the central Government and the public corporations
operating the nationalised industries, negotiate directly with the trades unions repre¬
senting their different types of employees.

perhaps once a quarter, mainly to take major policy decisions, to elect com¬
mittees and to ratify their work. The committees usually include a general
purposes committee and a negotiating committee. A small paid staff under a
director or secretary carries out the day-to-day work of the organisation.
There is usually a small working group, consisting of senior officials and
committee chairmen, which meets to deal with urgent questions and co¬
ordinate the work of the committees.
The Confederation The central organ of employers’ organisations is the Confederation of British
of British Industry Industry (CBI), incorporating the former British Employers’ Confederation
(BEC), which until August 1965 represented employers’ interests (see p. 267)
in questions of labour and industrial relations. The CBI deals with all matters
affecting the interests of organised employers and represents them nationally
to the Government and the public and also internationally, for instance, in
the International Labour Organisation. CBI representatives sit on various
government advisory committees, on other statutory bodies and on a number
of voluntary bodies concerned with labour matters.
Trade Unions In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over a great many years, and consequently their
form and organisation vary considerably. Trade unions started more than
two hundred years ago among the skilled craftsmen and spread later to the
general labouring and unskilled classes. More recently trade unionism has
increased among clerical, supervisory, technical and administrative workers.
A number of associations of professional workers, formed primarily for the
preservation and improvement of professional standards, have also come to
exercise many of the functions of trade unions, including negotiations on
salary and fee scales, and are legally trade unions.
The qualification for membership of some unions is occupational: for
instance, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed; while in
other the qualification is industrial, i.e. they seek to recruit all persons in an
industry, whatever their occupation. In a number of unions recruitment is
based on a combination of these principles. A few large unions recruit members
in a number of different occupations and industries.
At the end of 1963 the total membership of British trade unions was about
9,917,000. There were 596 unions but about two-thirds of all trade unionists
were in the 18 largest unions, while just over a half were in the eight unions
with a membership of over 250,000, namely: the Transport and General
Workers’ Union, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the National Union
of General and Municipal Workers, the National Union of Mineworkers, the
Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, the National Union of
Railwaymen, the National and Local Government Officers’ Association and
the Electrical Trades Union.
The basic unit of organisation in most British trade unions is the local
branch (called a lodge in some trade unions). Every member of the union
belongs to a branch or lodge. He may attend its meetings, put forward
suggestions about terms and conditions of employment, discuss the work
and policy of the union, and take part in the election of branch officers.
The branch takes action on certain matters considered to be entirely, or
mainly, of local interest but refers wider issues to the union’s national or
regional bodies.
Many unions also have shop stewards or other representatives at the place
of work to enrol members and collect dues, to report any encroachment on
474

agreed or customary conditions of work, and in some cases to act as repre¬
sentatives of members at their place of work for the settlement of grievances.
In a few trade unions, mainly in the printing and allied trades, organisation
is based primarily on the place of work.
In most large unions the central organisation is along the following lines:
elected officials, including a general secretary assisted by clerical and specialist
staff, are in charge of the work of the head office and are responsible to a
national executive council or committee which may be part-time or full-time,
and which is usually elected by, and responsible to, annual or biennial con¬
ferences of delegates from the branches.
Executive committees or councils play an important part in the government
of the unions; between conferences they are the highest authorities and carry
out policy decisions made by delegates. Most unions also have some regional,
district or area organisation, while in large unions there are usually regional,
district or area committees or councils.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations
whose main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade
unions in an industry in negotiations with employers. The scope and authority
of these federations and confederations vary greatly in different circumstances.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the Trades
Union Congress (TUC). Most trade unions of any size and importance are
affiliated to it: the main exceptions are the National Union of Teachers
(NUT) and certain Civil Service staff associations. The TUC’s objects are
to promote the interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the
economic and social conditions of the workers. Its membership comprises
174 organisations, of which about a dozen are federations of some 150 separate
unions; approximately 350 unions in all are affiliated directly or indirectly.
These represent about 8-5 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all
general questions which concern trade unions both nationally and inter¬
nationally and gives assistance on questions relating to particular trades or
industries at the request of the trade union concerned. It is recognised by the
Government as the channel of consultation between government departments
and representatives of organised workers on matters affecting the interests
of employees generally.
The congress of delegates, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for a
week every year to discuss matters of general interest to trade unionists and
to employees generally. It elects annually a General Council which represents
it during the remaining 51 weeks of the year. The General Council is
responsible for carrying out congress decisions, for watching economic and
social developments, and for providing educational and advisory services.
It is also empowered in certain circumstances to mediate in inter-union
disputes.
One of the main tasks upon which the TUC is at present engaged is a
re-examination of the aims and structure of the British trade union movement.
Previous inquiries dealt principally with structure but on this occasion the
purposes of the movement also are being reviewed in the light of modern
conditions.
The TUC and a number of affiliated unions have in recent years substantially
developed their educational services to members. At the training college in
TUC headquarters, Congress House, London, one-week and two-week
courses are provided for about 700 students each year in general trade union
subjects, management techniques, industrial relations, collective bargaining
(including special courses for office workers and for workshop representatives),
LABOUR
475
occupational health and safety, and social security. The TUC Educational
Trust also provides summer schools, regional week-end schools, and special
week-end schools for women and for young workers. A unified scheme
providing educational facilities (including postal courses) to members of all
affiliated unions has been operated directly by the TUC from the beginning
of 1965. It is financed mainly out of increased affiliation fees and replaces
the facilities previously afforded by the National Council of Labour Colleges
and the Workers’ Educational Trade Union Committee (WETUC). The
Workers’ Educational Association (partner with the TUC in the WETUC)
continues to co-operate in such matters as the supply of tutors. A regional
advisory committee system helps to keep the scheme in touch with local
requirements.
Certain unions organise one-week and other short residential courses, and
these and other unions provide week-end schools for the education and
training of officers and members in the principles and practice of trade
unionism. Scholarships for longer-term studies (usually one academic year) at
Ruskin College, Oxford, other adult residential colleges, or the London School
of Economics, are offered by the TUC Educational Trust and by certain unions.
The TUC is a non-political body but under the Trade Union Act 1913
individual trade unions can, by a ballot vote of members, decide to set up a
political fund, financed by a separate levy, which any member can refuse to
pay without loss of his normal union rights and benefits. About 100 separate
trade union organisations, including most of the largest trade unions, have
such a fund and, in most cases, it is used to support the Labour Party (or
the Co-operative Party, which is associated with the Labour Party and has
substantially the same platform).
Branches of various trade unions in a locality generally affiliate to a local
trades council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common
interest and as a local agent of the TUC, by which it is registered each year.
There are 500 trades councils in England and Wales alone, grouped together
in 22 federations.
There is also a separate Scottish Trades Union Congress, to which trade
unions may affiliate in respect of their membership in Scotland.
Voluntary
Joint
Negotiating
Machinery
At National Level
While in some industries all matters affecting terms and conditions of employ¬
ment are discussed on an ad hoc basis between the employers’ organisations
and the trade unions concerned, in other industries there are standard
procedures for dealing with such matters by joint discussion at national
level. In many industries there are, for this purpose, bodies composed of
representatives of both sides of the industry with, in some cases, an indepen¬
dent chairman. There are about 200 of these bodies, most of which are called
Joint Industrial Councils. Their functions vary considerably, some being
simply negotiating bodies, while others deal with a wide range of subjects
affecting the interests of the industry concerned. Provision is sometimes made
in their constitution that a dispute on which it is not found possible to reach
agreement should be referred to some form of conciliation or arbitration by
independent persons, including the means provided under the Conciliation
Act 1896, or the Industrial Courts Act 1919.
Collective agreements between employers’ associations and trade unions
are not civil contracts between particular employers and employees, and are
not, therefore, in themselves enforceable at law. Observance of agreed terms
and conditions is based mainly on the good faith of employers and the mutual
respect and vigilance of trade unions and employers’ organisations, but can

be secured in particular instances through reference to the Industrial Court
(see below).
Arrangements for negotiation and joint consultation also exist at district
and factory level in many industries, where matters are discussed either
between the appropriate representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis,
or through regular machinery provided by District Joint Industrial Councils
or similar bodies and Works Councils. Such bodies discuss how agreements
reached at a national level may be applied to their district or factory, but as a
rule have no power to alter the terms of such national agreements. They also
discuss new problems which may arise, and if no solution can be found at
factory or district level, refer them to the national body. In many of the larger
industries national agreements recommend such consultation, and in some
they even prescribe model rules for its conduct.
In certain industries in which, owing to the lack of organisation among
employers and workers, voluntary negotiating arrangements do not exist
for the effective settlement of terms and conditions of employment or are
inadequate to secure their observance by voluntary methods throughout the
industry, statutory bodies known as Wages Councils and Agricultural Wages
Boards have been set up. These are composed of equal numbers of representa¬
tives of employers and workers in the respective industries, with the addition of
certain independent members. Wages Councils may submit proposals for fixing
minimum remuneration and holidays with pay to the Minister of Labour, who
must then make orders giving statutory force to such proposals, subject only to
his right to return them as a whole to the councils for further consideration.
Orders relating to employment in agriculture are made by the appropriate
Agricultural Wages Board (England and Wales or Scotland). Such orders
are effective only in the county agricultural wages committee area in respect
of which they have been made, but there is a national minimum enforceable
in England and Wales and also one for Scotland.
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred
by agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators, and one way in which
the parties can find such persons is by invoking the help of the Minister of
Labour. Under authority derived from the Conciliation Act 1896, and the
Industrial Courts Act 1919, the Minister has certain powers to assist industry
to settle disputes which it is not found possible to resolve through an industry’s
own machinery and procedure. These powers are all intended to supplement
and not to supersede the industry’s own machinery. There is no legal obliga¬
tion on the parties to a dispute to notify the dispute to the Minister, nor to
place the question before a conciliator.
To assist conciliation in industry the Ministry of Labour has an industrial
relations service (see p. 275) which is staffed by specially trained industrial
relations officers who keep in touch with the course of relations between
employers and workers at national, district and, in some cases, factory level
and assists them, if requested, to settle their problems by joint discussion and
negotiation. Conciliators have no legal powers.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both
parties, be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or
an ad hoc Board of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent
tribunal established under the Industrial Courts Act. The court normally
consists of three members—the president, one member experienced in
representing employers and one in representing workpeople.
LABOUR
477
Like collective agreements, arbitration awards are not in themselves
enforceable at law but, under the Terms and Conditions of Employment
Act 1959, reports that a particular employer is not observing the recognised
(i.e. agreed or awarded) terms or conditions of employment in his trade or
industry may be made to the Minister of Labour by organisations which are
parties to the agreement or award. If the matter is not otherwise settled, the
Minister must refer it to the Industrial Court which, after hearing the case,
may issue an award requiring the employer to observe the recognised terms
or conditions. Such an award becomes an implied term of the contract of
employment. This procedure, established under the 1959 Act, replaced an
earlier one of similar intention and effect.
The Minister of Labour is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry
or Committee of Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended.
These procedures are primarily means of informing public opinion of the
facts of a dispute and are not means of arbitration. The report of a Court of
Inquiry has to be laid before Parliament. Although the recommendations
contained in the reports of such bodies are not binding on the parties, they
often provide the basis for further negotiations which lead to a settlement.
kes and
kouts
Over the past 30 years the number of working days lost each year through
stoppages of work arising from industrial disputes, i.e. through strikes and
lockouts, has been on an average about 2J million which, taking the working
population as a whole, works out at approximately one hour per worker per
year. These figures, however, only record the time lost at establishments
where strikes actually take place; they take no account of the effect in other
establishments or industries. Nevertheless, the time lost through strikes is very
much less than that lost on account of sickness, accidents and absenteeism
and the United Kingdom’s record over the past 10 years or so compares
favourably with that of most other industrial countries.
Strikes in Britain are not in general caused by a breakdown in the collective
bargaining machinery. This on the whole works smoothly and well. For
example, in 1964 some 210 important claims for higher wages or shorter
hours covering practically all industries were settled peacefully; less than
ten resulted in disputes that led to stoppage of work. In fact it is estimated
that over 90 per cent of all strikes and about 70 per cent of the time lost
through strikes are the result of the unofficial and usually unconstitutional
action of the comparatively small groups of workers in single firms.
These unofficial strikes are therefore symptoms of a breakdown in relations
between management and workers at the place of work itself. The Govern¬
ment’s approach to the problem presented by these strikes is that the best
way to tackle them is to attack their causes.This means in other words securing
a fundamental improvement in relations between employers and workers and
the loyal observance of agreements and constitutional procedures freely
negotiated. To this purpose the Minister of Labour has been getting the
leaders of both sides of industry, through his National Joint Advisory Council,
to work out agreed policies on labour/management relations.
between The Government is in contact with representatives of employers and workers
Government at all levels on matters affecting their common interests. At local and district
Industry level the industrial relations officers of the Ministry of Labour keep in touch
with the representatives of both sides of industry, while, at national level,
officers of the department are requested by many Joint Industrial Councils
to attend their meetings as liaison officers. Standing arrangements also exist

for consultation between the Government, the CBI and the TUC through
the National Joint Advisory Council, which was set up in 1939 to advise the
Government on matters in which employers and workers have a common
interest. It meets quarterly under the chairmanship of the Minister of Labour.
Its membership consists of representatives of the CBI and the TUC, together
with representatives of the managements of nationalised industries. In
recent years it has been turning its attention to a number of subjects that are
of importance to relations between management and workers generally
throughout industry. These subjects include redundancy arrangements,
provision for sick pay and guaranteed earnings, the selection and training of
supervisors, the training of shop stewards and communication and consultation
within the firm.
While labour relations in government service and in the nationalised industries
are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry, there
are some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are under the direct control of the Treasury, are per¬
mitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service staff associations
(trade unions) and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and
joint consultation by means of the National and Departmental Whitley
Councils (see p. 67), corresponding to the Joint Industrial Councils in
industry. The two sides of the National Whitley Council are parties to a
Civil Service Arbitration Agreement which, subject to certain limitations,
provides that if there is failure to reach agreement by negotiation a depart¬
ment or association may report the dispute to the Minister of Labour for
reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal. The tribunal is an
independent one appointed by the Minister by virtue of his powers under the
Industrial Courts Act 1919. Industrial employees of the central Government,
however, are organised by trades and not by departments; negotiations
regarding their wages and conditions of employment take place on Trade
Joint Councils and unresolved matters are referred for arbitration by the
Industrial Court. In the major employing departments, Departmental Joint
Councils also exist for the discussion of matters other than 'trade questions
which are of mutual concern to the department and its industrial employees
(and which are domestic to the department).
In local government services there are separate National Joint Councils
for the main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical
employees, and road-menders) which deal with wages and conditions of service
as well as other matters. There are corresponding regional and district councils.
In the nationalised industries, the main corporations, though not subject to
detailed governmental control, have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining in their industries and for joint con¬
sultation with their employees; but in carrying out these duties they are free
to choose the arrangements that suit them. In nearly every case a complex
system which already existed before nationalisation, has been taken over and
modified. The arrangements, therefore, as in industry generally, vary sub¬
stantially. The main difference from private industry is that the corporations
are not usually members of employers’ associations although they are eligible
to apply for a form of association with the CBI (see p. 267). In some industries
they are sole or main employers, but even where part of the industry is in

private hands, as for example in air or road transport, the corporations are
separately and directly represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of managements and trade
unions at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local
bodies, similarly representative, charged with the duty of applying these
agreements and dealing with any difficulties or differences which may arise.
Most of the industries use the facilities for arbitration offered to industry
generally by the Ministry of Labour, but coalmining and rail transport have
their own special arrangements.
The machinery for negotiation and conciliation in the United Kingdom is
usually agreed by and based on the industry as a whole and not on the individual
establishment or firm. Accordingly, those industries, such as electricity or
gas supply, where there are several corporations which act as employers, are
covered by a single set of arrangements for each industry, and the duty of
seeing that the arrangements are made falls on the central authorities, e.g., the
Gas Council or the Electricity Council. In civil aviation, there is a single joint
council at national level on which both the nationalised air corporations and
the private operators are represented. Where a single public corporation
engages in various activities, these may be treated as separate industries and
organised separately. For example, the National Coal Board’s coke and by¬
products plants have arrangements quite distinct from the coal mines.
Throughout the various organisational changes in the transport industries,
rail, road and water transport have kept their different methods, based on
individual traditions which existed before nationalisation.
Some of the nationalised industries have felt that joint consultation was
best carried out by their negotiating bodies; others have established separate
and specially constituted joint committees at all levels. In general, where
consultation and negotiation are conducted through the same machinery,
separate committees exist for different groups or grades of employees; where
the consultative and negotiating arrangements are kept apart, a single con¬
sultative committee serves all grades.
The system of labour relations in Northern Ireland is based on the same
principles as that of Great Britain and, in these matters, the Minister of
Health and Social Services has powers and duties broadly similar to those
of the Minister of Labour in Great Britain. About 90 per cent of trade
unionists in Northern Ireland are members of trade unions whose head¬
quarters are in Great Britain.
The establishment of good working conditions is assisted by the organisation
of employers and workpeople, by arrangements for negotiation and settlement
of differences, and by protective legislation and its enforcement. This
institutional framework, however, cannot by itself create satisfaction with
work and working conditions, nor the mutual trust and co-operation of
management and workers, nor the sense of shared effort and achievement
known as ‘team spirit’. Nor will good wages and hours, high standards of
safety and health and lavish employee services necessarily bring about these
attitudes and responses; their achievement depends rather on building up good
relations between individuals and interacting groups within the organisation.
In recent years, therefore, there has been a marked increase of interest in
‘human relations’ in industry, i.e. relations between managements and their
480
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Communica¬
tion and
Joint
Consultation
workers as individuals, as distinct from relations between organisations of
employers and organisations of workers. This has led to more widespread
attention being given to all aspects of personnel management and to the
establishment of more personnel departments.
Practically all large industrial firms and many small ones now have a
personnel department staffed by one or more specialist officers. While the
form of organisation of personnel departments varies, the personnel officer
is generally responsible for advising all levels of management on every aspect
of labour relations. This officer also has particular duties with regard to
recruitment, selection, education and training, transfer of labour, the appli¬
cation of wage agreements, the promotion of good communication and
consultation and the supervision of working conditions and employee services.
Both voluntary and official organisations are concerned with promoting
better human relationships in industry. Voluntary organisations include
bodies which deal with management problems and provide a service to
subscribing firms, professional associations, linking individuals with a
common interest in particular functions of management, and bodies providing
specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
In addition to its work in the settlement of disputes (see p. 476), the
Ministry of Labour’s industrial relations service helps to promote high
standards of personnel management and assists firms by advising on problems
of personnel policy.
Recruitment and promotion policies are matters which each undertaking
decides for itself, although in some industries the decisions may be limited
by collective agreements or by trade practices. Great importance has recently
been attached to selection; and courses for training personnel officers in
modern interviewing techniques, including the use of test procedures, are
now well attended. Selection of applicants for jobs is assisted by the Govern¬
ment Employment Services.
The realisation that the co-operation of workpeople depends largely on their
proper understanding of management’s aims and plans has focused attention
on the means of conveying information to workers. Methods used include
posters, wall information sheets, production charts, displays of photographs,
the production of news-sheets and house journals, discussions and lectures,
film shows and exhibitions. It is increasingly held, however, that, although
these media have their use, it is more important to improve communication
down the normal chain of responsibility to workshop level (a matter which
depends on personal relations and on the adequacy of supervisor training)
and to establish means for joint consultation, such as those provided by a
works council.
In the nationalised industries the various Acts placing them under public
ownership impose obligations on the management, except where adequate
machinery already exists, to consult with the appropriate trade unions to
establish such machinery for promoting measures affecting the safety, health
and welfare of employees and for discussing matters of mutual interest,
including efficiency. Arrangements for consultation at all levels, including the
workplace level, have been made in all the nationalised industries according
to the traditions and needs of each industry.
The range of subjects which works councils can fruitfully discuss is wide
and includes hours of work (within the framework of agreements), safety,
health, efficiency of production, absenteeism, labour turnover, training,
education, recreation and employees’ services generally. Works councils are
LABOUR
481
usually kept informed about the state of trade and production and the firm’s
prospects, and frequently consider problems resulting from decisions to
change production methods. It is the general practice, however, to exclude
all questions relating to wages and conditions of employment, and other
matters covered by negotiation between organisations of employers and
workers.
The Government has assisted these developments by advice on techniques,
by the supply of posters, pamphlets, films and other publicity material, and
by encouraging and promoting joint consultation. Industrial relations officers
of the Ministry of Labour are often approached by firms seeking advice on
the establishment of works councils or on ways in which their activities can
be made more effective.

SOUND AND TELEVISION
BROADCASTING
Broadcasting of sound and of television in the United Kingdom is regulated
under powers conferred on the Postmaster General by the Wireless Tele¬
graphy Acts 1949-1955, which prohibit the sending or receiving of radio
communications, except under licence. Users of sound and television receiving
sets must obtain an annual licence, which can be purchased from most post
offices.
Sound broadcasting services are provided solely by the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC), which was established as a public corporation by Royal
Charter in 1927. Two television services are provided by the British Broad¬
casting Corporation (BBC 1 and BBC 2) and one by the Independent Television
Authority (ITA), which was established by the Television Act 1954 and is
continued by the Television Act 1964.
There were 16,124,870 receiving licences current in the United Kingdom
in June 1965, of which 13,358,000 were for sound and television combined
and 2,766,870 (including 638,640 for sets fitted in cars) for sound only. A
combined sound and television licence costs ^5; a licence for sound only
costs j£i 5s. Registered blind people are entitled to free sound licences or to
combined licences for £3 15s. One licence covers all receiving sets in a house¬
hold, but a separate licence is required for a set fitted in a car.
Development of When sound broadcasting began in the United Kingdom in 1922, it was
the Services decided in Parliament that the Postmaster General should grant only one
licence for that purpose at any one time, and the first licence was granted
exclusively to a limited company (the British Broadcasting Company). The
decision to grant only one licence for broadcasting was maintained when the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was formed to take over the functions
of the limited company in 1927; it was reaffirmed in 1937 when the BBC’s
second charter was granted to cover the sound services and the television
service which the BBC had inaugurated during the previous year; and it was
upheld throughout the second world war and during the post-war period
until 1952.
During the second world war television broadcasting was suspended and
transmissions were not resumed until 1946. After resumption the television
service gained rapidly both in technical efficiency and in popularity; and
between 1949 and 1952 the Government instituted a major review of sound
and television broadcasting. After prolonged parliamentary and general
discussion it was decided by the Government that the potential power of
television was so great that it would be undesirable to leave transmission
services in this medium in the hands of a single authority, however excellent.
The ITA was therefore established in 1954, as a public body, to provide
services additional to those of the BBC for an initial period of ten years.
Independent television (ITV) transmissions began in September 1955—the
BBC’s monopoly in the provision of sound broadcasting services remaining
undisturbed.

The services provided by both broadcasting authorities were reviewed by
the Committee on Broadcasting, i960, and subsequently the powers of the
ITA were renewed, till 1976, by the Television Act 1963 (which was incor¬
porated in the Television Act 1964). This Act also strengthened the Authority’s
controlling and regulatory powers in relation to the independent programme
companies under contract to it to produce the actual programmes. The BBC
was confirmed as the sole provider of sound broadcasting services and
authorised to introduce a second television service (BBC 2); this opened in
April 1964.
The present Government has also decided to continue with the pay television
experiment announced by its predecessor. Of the three companies originally
licensed to take part, two have withdrawn, but one company, Pay-TV Limited,
has announced its intention to proceed with its part in the experiment. The
service will be subject to the same code of conduct as applies to existing
television services.
The BBC and the ITA are independent authorities in the day-to-day
operations of broadcasting, including programmes and administration. The
Government, however, retains ultimate control, and the Postmaster General,
as the responsible minister, is answerable to Parliament on broad questions
of policy and may issue directions to the BBC and the ITA on a number
of technical and other subjects. The Postmaster General also has powers to
prohibit the broadcasting of any particular matter or class of matter, or to
revoke the licences of the BBC or ITA at any time; these powers, however,
are treated as major reserve powers, and no formal veto has ever been placed
on the broadcasting of a particular item. Both the BBC and the ITA are
required to prepare annual reports and accounts, which are presented by
the Postmaster General to Parliament.
The BBC and the ITA both consult with the Postmaster General as to the
hours of television broadcasting, and he has approved an arrangement which
permits any one service a maximum of 50 hours a week (30 hours a week for
BBC 2), together with extensions (averaging ten hours a week) for certain
stated purposes, such as religious broadcasts, ministerial and party political
broadcasts, schools broadcasts, programmes of adult education and outside
broadcasts. The authorities may broadcast television programmes, within the
prescribed maxima, during any periods best suited to the needs of their
audiences. In April 1965 the BBC was broadcasting about 53 hours of
programmes from London in its domestic sound services during a normal
weekday.
The BBC operates under the provisions of two documents, each granted for
a limited period at the end of which they may be renewed or amended: the
Charter, which sets out the constitution, objects and organisation of the BBC
and contains certain financial provisions; and the Licence and Agreement
between the BBC and the Postmaster General, which deals with technical
matters, certain non-technical conditions such as the prohibition of sponsored
programmes, and details of the financial arrangements in force. The current
Charter, and Licence and Agreement, cover the period 30th July, 1964, to
31st July, 1976. The operations of the ITA are governed by the provisions
of the Television Act 1964, which formulates its constitution, its functions,
its purpose and the framework of its finances; and by the Licence (which
contains technical provisions) issued to it by the Postmaster General in
1964.

The British

Corporation
The Independent
Television
Authority
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Under the current Charter the corporation consists of nine governors
(including a chairman, a vice-chairman and separate national governors for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), each appointed for a period of not
more than five years by the Sovereign in Council. As a corporate body, the
governors are responsible for the conduct of the whole broadcasting operation,
including the content and presentation of the programmes in sound and
television, and the provision and working of the necessary installations and
equipment.
In discharging its responsibilities the BBC is required to ensure that
its services are used, as stated in the preamble to the Charter, ‘as a means of
disseminating information, education and entertainment’, and to pay heed to
the requirements of the Licence (for instance, it must allow the broadcasting
of any announcement at the request of a minister, and must not broadcast
sponsored programmes). It must refrain from expressing editorial opinion
on current affairs and on matters of public policy, and it is relied on to treat
controversial subjects with due impartiality.
The chief executive officer of the BBC—the Director-General—is appointed
by the governors at their discretion and with him they discuss all major
matters of policy and finance. Under the Director-General are six directors
(the Chief Assistant to the Director-General, and the Directors of Sound
Broadcasting, Television, External Broadcasting, Engineering, and Adminis¬
tration) who, between them, cover the whole work of the BBC, and who,
with the Director-General, constitute its Board of Management. The number
of staff employed is about 22,000.
The governors are advised on all aspects of their work by a number of
councils, established in accordance with the terms of the Charter: for example,
the General Advisory Council, which has been in existence, except for a
break during the war years, since 1934; the National Broadcasting Councils
for Scotland and Wales, which, under the chairmanship of the national
governors for Scotland and Wales, are responsible for domestic services in
those countries; and the Regional Advisory Councils for the English regions
and for Northern Ireland. There are also a number of other councils and
committees, not specifically required by the Charter, but established by the
BBC to advise on such matters as religious broadcasting, schools broadcasting,
science programmes, music, adult and further education and agriculture.
The services of the BBC are financed from (1) an annual sum, voted by
Parliament, which is related to revenue derived from the sale by the Post
Office of broadcast receiving licences; (2) an annual grant-in-aid, voted by
Parliament, for the External Services, i.e. the European Services, the Overseas
Services, and the Monitoring Service; and (3) profits from BBC publications,
mainly the Radio Times, which has a weekly sale of nearly 5 million copies
and attracts a large advertising revenue. The gross revenue from the sale of
licences for the year which ended on 31st March, 1965, amounted to
^56,180,940 from which the Post Office deducted £3,482,500 for the expenses
it incurred in collecting the licence fees, investigating complaints of electrical
interference, and administration, so that the net amount the BBC received
was £52,698,440. In the same year, the net revenue from publications was
£1,226,915 and grant-in-aid receipts for the external services amounted to
£9,434,000.
The Independent Television Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and, at present, eleven other members (three of whom have special
responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern
Ireland severally) appointed by the Postmaster General. It is responsible,
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
485
under the Television Act 1964, for television broadcasting services ‘as a
public service for disseminating information, education and entertainment’.
The ITA owns and operates the transmitting stations, but the production
studios and equipment are owned, and the actual programmes are provided,
by programme companies under contract to the ITA. Fourteen programme
companies are under contract for the period July 1964 to July 1967:
Rediffusion Limited; Associated Television Limited; ABC Television
Limited; Granada TV Network Limited; Scottish Television Limited;
Independent Television for South Wales and the West of England Limited
(TWW); Southern Television Limited; Tyne-Tees Television Limited;
Anglia Television Limited; Ulster Television Limited; Westward Television
Limited; Border Television Limited; Grampian Television Limited; and
Channel Television Limited. A common news service is provided by
Independent Television News Limited.
The Authority has controlling and regulatory powers of a wide and
important character in regard to programmes: for example the Television
Act requires it to ensure that they do not offend against good taste or decency,
that they are balanced in their subject matter, that they preserve due impar¬
tiality in presenting matters of industrial or political controversy, and that
the news is reported accurately; it also provides for the submission by the
programme contractors of programme schedules for the approval of the
Authority; and lays on it the duty to produce and keep under review a code
of programme standards governing the rules to be observed about the showing
of violence, particularly when large numbers of children and young people
may be expected to be watching. In the choice of programme companies the
ITA is guided by their potential ability to provide an efficient service and,
in the case of regional companies, by their associations with the local
communities concerned.
The chief executive officer of the ITA is the Director-General. There are
also two Deputy Directors-General, and a headquarters and regional office
staff covering all technical, administrative, clerical, typing and office services,
which numbered 630 in 1965. Engineering staff serving at the transmitting
stations number 231.
In the discharge of its duties the ITA is advised by a General Advisory
Council, three statutory committees and a statutory panel: the Advertising
Advisory Committee; the Educational Advisory Committee; the Central
Religious Advisory Committee to the BBC, which by arrangement also advises
the ITA; and the Medical Advisory Panel. Programme schedules are discussed
by the Programmes Policy Committee. The ITA also has a panel of six
consultants to assist it in the exercise of its day-to-day responsibilities for
religious services and programmes. A standing consultative committee,
composed of two representatives of the ITA and a representative of each of
the programme companies, provides consultative machinery between the
ITA and the companies on matters, other than programmes, affecting the
companies as a whole. There is also an Independent Television Companies
Association, designed to further the collective interests of the companies
with such outside bodies as trade unions and sporting organisations, and
generally to ensure that they speak as far as possible with one voice on public
issues connected with television broadcasting policy.
The ITA receives no payments from licence revenue; its finance is drawn
from annual rental payments made to it by the programme companies. In the
year which ended on 31st March, 1964, these payments amounted to about
£5-6 million, while the running costs of the ITA were ^4-3 million.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The BBC operates its domestic sound broadcasting services from 57 long¬
wave and medium-wave transmitters at 43 transmitting stations, and from
46 very high frequency (VHF) transmitting stations. The VHF service is
available to 98-5 per cent of the population of the United Kingdom. This
will rise to 99*7 per cent on completion of the present programme of relay
stations, about the middle of 1966. The external broadcasting services are
at present transmitted from 50 high power, high frequency transmitters:
40 in the United Kingdom, two (used for relay purposes) at Tebrau, near
Singapore, and eight (also for relay purposes) in Cyprus. Construction of a
short-wave relay station on Ascension Island is well under way and the modern¬
isation of the transmitter facilities in the United Kingdom is continuing.
There are 126 studios for the domestic sound programmes, of which 56
are in London and 70 at various centres in the regional areas. The external
services use 38 London studios. There are also 31 semi-automatic studios
which can be operated by programme officials without an engineering staff.
The domestic sound services consist of the Home Service, the Light
Programme and the Third Wavelength which carries the Music Programme
and Third Programme with Study Session (Mondays to Fridays) and Sports
Service (Saturday afternoons). These separate, but inter-related, services
give the BBC reasonable scope in providing programmes that fall within a
very wide range of what can be effectively broadcast in sound only.
Each of the services has its own characteristics: the Home Service is
planned as a general service, and in addition to a wide range of musical
programmes and plays provides the principal news and information services,
discussions on domestic and foreign affairs, political broadcasts (ministerial
broadcasts and controversial broadcasts by party spokesmen) and special
programmes of various kinds, including broadcasts for schools. It is also the
vehicle for regional broadcasting (i.e. programmes specially compiled for
listeners in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Midlands, north and
west of England). The main purpose of the Light Programme is to provide
a service of entertainment and relaxation for the majority. The Third Pro¬
gramme is intended for those who take pleasure in close and responsive
listening to broadcasts of artistic and intellectual distinction, and the Music
Programme provides good music during the day.
The external broadcasting services of the BBC are intended to provide a link
of culture, information and entertainment between the peoples of,the United
Kingdom and those in other parts of the world; to present events of world¬
wide importance with speed and accuracy; and generally to reflect British
opinion and the British way of life. These services are broadcast in English
and in 40 other languages for over 600 hours a week, which is longer than
the output of all the BBC’s domestic sound and television services added
together, and involves the transmission of over 1,100 news programmes and
1,200 talks a week.
The services, under the Director of External Broadcasting, are divided into
the European Services and the Overseas Services, each in charge of a Con¬
troller. Within these two groups are the regional divisions. Common to both
groups are the External Services News Department, which prepares all the
news broadcasts for audiences outside the United Kingdom, and the External
Services Production Department, which supplies feature programmes.
The European Services broadcast over 230 programme hours a week and
are subdivided into four regional groupings: South European (Spain,
Portugal, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Israel), Central European (Czechoslovakia,
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
Hungary, Poland, Finland), East European (Soviet Union, Rumania,
Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania), and German. A French language service
provides programmes for both European and African listeners. There is
also an English service directed to the whole of Europe, and a European
Talks Department.
The Overseas Services, which are directed to countries outside Europe,
broadcast about 390 programme hours a week. They comprise the BBC
World Service with its world-wide audience of English-speaking listeners,
and a number of regional services in English and 22 other languages!
The BBC World Service, which includes among its audience peoples
of the Commonwealth, British Forces and British communities overseas,
gives a complete programme service for nearly 23 hours every day. The
regional services consist of the African Service with programmes in English,
Hausa, Swahili and Somali; the Arabic Service; the Asian Service with
programmes in 14 oriental languages; the Latin American Service with
programmes in Spanish and Portuguese; and other special programmes in
English for North America, Australia, the Pacific, the Caribbean and the
Falkland Islands, in Maltese for Malta, in French for Canada and in French
and English for Mauritius.
The external broadcasting services include the Transcription, English by
Radio and Television, and Monitoring Services. The Transcription Service
records 1,000 BBC sound programmes annually, distributing them to broad¬
casting organisations in all parts of the world. The BBC English by Radio and
Television service broadcasts over 200 English by Radio lessons from London
every week with commentaries in 27 languages, reaching an audience of
several millions by direct transmission from London and from the BBC’s
Far Eastern station. In addition, some 250 local radio stations in 90 countries
also broadcast BBC English by Radio recorded series. The BBC’s first English
by Television senes has been shown in some 30 countries and a second series
for intermediate learners was scheduled for showing in the autumn of 1965
in seven European countries and in Iran. Two television courses designed
for teachers of English are also available and have been produced in
collaboration with the British Council. BBC English courses on gramophone
records and tape, with companion textbooks, are on sale in almost all parts
of the world. The Monitoring Service reports foreign broadcasts from some
50 countries in 35 languages and works under a reciprocal agreement with
its American counterpart for monitored material from the Far East and other
areas inaudible in the United Kingdom.
In the external services the Corporation works in consultation with the
government departments concerned with overseas relations which prescribe
the languages and hours of broadcasting, but the day-to-day content of the
programmes remains the responsibility of the BBC.
The BBC maintains offices in New York, Paris, Ottawa, Toronto, Sydney,
New Delhi and Beirut (as well as offices in Berlin and Singapore dealing with
BBC programmes) to encourage local interest in the BBC, to promote the
use of BBC television and radio material and to provide the BBC with advice
and help concerning programmes, whether for home listeners about that area
or for listeners in the area itself. The offices (which are concerned with the
whole field of sound radio and, where appropriate, television) are also
responsible for promoting good relations with the local broadcasting organisa¬
tions, and for keeping the BBC informed about local broadcasting and other
developments of interest; in these matters, they work closely with the BBC’s

Overseas and Foreign Relations Department. Audience research is undertaken
by sampling surveys and other research methods to assess the size, nature
and tastes of various audiences.
In 1936 the BBC launched the world’s first regular public service by high
definition television. Two programmes are now being transmitted: BBC 1,
which is available to over 99 per cent of the population of the United Kingdom
from 59 transmitting stations, and BBC 2, at present from three stations.
BBC 2 is transmitted on 625 lines on ultra high frequency (UHF) and is
expected to reach some two-thirds of the population by the end of 1966.
In the course of a year, the BBC television service broadcasts on a national
network for 7,450 hours, including studio productions, outside broadcasts,
films, and relays from other countries. BBC Television Enterprises undertakes
the world-wide sale of BBC television programmes (films, tele-recordings and
video-taped material); it also purchases material for the use of the BBC
television service and conducts business relations with other television
organisations throughout the world.
BBC studio productions in London come from five main studios at the
Television Centre, four at Lime Grove, two at Riverside Studios, Hammer¬
smith, and the Television Theatre, Shepherds Bush. With one exception
all London studios are now capable of operation on 405 lines for BBC 1,
and on 625 lines for BBC 2. In addition, the BBC’s largest studio, Studio 1
at the Television Centre, can operate on the American 525 line standard.
The BBC also has fully equipped regional studio centres at Manchester,
Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, Bristol and Belfast; these centres contribute
programmes to the national network as well as producing others of only local
interest. Work has started on a new Midland regional headquarters near
Birmingham, which will become the first combined television and sound
radio centre in the world. In addition to the main studios a number of small
interview studios (used mainly for short insertions into news bulletins) have
been established throughout the country. The Television Film Department
of the BBC uses two studios at Ealing as well as mobile film units. Television
news and newsreel programmes originate from specially equipped studios at
Alexandra Palace, London. Two further main studios are now being equipped
at the Television Centre, where a start has also been made on the first part
of the extension to the main block.
Outside broadcasting, which provides about 1,200 programmes annually,
covers most parts of the United Kingdom with its mobile units, presenting
programmes both of national and of specifically regional interest. Live
programmes and news items from other parts of the world are brought to
viewers in the United Kingdom over the Eurovision network and by means
of communications satellites (see p. 491).
The first regular independent television (ITV) service was inaugurated in
September 1955 by a programme transmission from the ITA London station
at Beulah Heights, Croydon. By 1965 programmes were being transmitted
from 27 stations in all parts of the United Kingdom, and 14-2 million homes
in the United Kingdom were able to receive independent television.
ITV programmes are produced at studio centres in London, Birmingham,
Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff, Southampton, Newcastle, Norwich, Belfast,
Dover, Plymouth, Carlisle, Aberdeen, Bristol, Leeds and St. Heher. The
establishment of these studios is the direct result of the ITA’s policy of
encouraging the development of regional television, and the programmes are
either for local broadcasting or for transmission to one or more of the other

regions through the link system operated by the ITA. This consists of some
6,000 miles of vision links, about 60 per cent of which are two-way circuits.
Both the BBC and the ITV services include programmes of music, drama,
light entertainment, variety, films, news reports covering international
national, and local events, political programmes, and outside broadcasts’
particularly of national and state occasions and sport. Religious broadcasts
and broadcasts for schools and adult students also feature regularly as do
programmes designed to stimulate thought and widen people’s horizons,
such as interviews with outstanding personalities, investigations into matters
of public interest, and programmes on the arts; and there are programmes of
specialised interest, such as children’s and family programmes, programmes
for women, regional programmes, and programmes on agriculture. In
addition, there are special series of party political broadcasts under arrange¬
ments agreed between the broadcasting authorities and the leading political
parties. The addition of a second BBC channel has made longer programmes
possible, allowing subjects to be examined in greater depth.
The BBC seeks to avoid giving publicity to any individual firm or organised
interest except in so far as is necessary in providing effective and informative
programmes under the terms of the Charter. The ITA broadcasts advertise¬
ments (on which the programme companies depend for their revenue) subject
to the relevant provisions in the Television Act, namely, that there should
be no sponsoring of programmes by advertisers, that all advertisements should
be clearly distinguishable as such and recognisably separate from the pro¬
gramme, and that the amount of time given to advertising should not be so
great as to detract from the value of the programmes as a medium of informa¬
tion, education and entertainment. Certain types of advertising are prohibited
notably the advertising of cigarettes, betting, and ‘cures’ for alcoholism. The
ITA also has rules agreed with the Postmaster General about certain classes
of broadcasts (including, in particular, religious services) in which advertise¬
ments may not be inserted and, on the advice of the Advertising Advisory
Committee and the Medical Advisory Panel drew up certain ‘principles for
television advertising’ with a view to the exclusion of misleading or unsuitable
advertisements from the programmes. These principles formed the basis of
the ‘Code of Advertising Standards and Practice’ which, under the Act, the
ITA keeps under review. The cost of inserting advertisements in the ITA
service is borne by the advertisers, who pay the programme companies for
advertising time.
An experiment in pay television by wire, a service whereby subscribers pay
for programmes they choose to view, will be taking place shortly in a few
selected areas, starting in the London Boroughs of Westminster and South¬
wark. The Postmaster General has licensed Pay-TV Limited to operate the
service, subject to certain conditions and safeguards, for a period of three years
from the date of commencement of service.
The company is to operate in conjunction with British Relay Limited
which will make available its television wire broadcasting system (see below)
for distributing the pay television service.
Wire broadcasting a system whereby programmes are received at a central
point, whence they are distributed by wire to listeners and viewers—began
in the United Kingdom in 1925 as a private venture and remains in the
hands of private enterprise. Wire broadcasting companies operate under

licence from the Postmaster General. They are not allowed to originate
programmes of their own, and their function is to distribute programmes put
out by general broadcasting stations. A specified minimum of their programme
material must be taken from BBC sources. Subscribers to wire broadcasting
services must have ordinary broadcast receiving licences. At the beginning
of 1965 there were 722 wire broadcasting services, of which 585 gave television
service and the remainder sound-only service. The number of subscribers at
that date was 1,217,241, including 866,712 who were receiving television
services.
Audience research, as conducted by the BBC, is carried on by means of
(a) a Survey of Listening and Viewing, during the course of which a represen¬
tative sample of the population is interviewed each day about its listening and
viewing on the previous day, (b) a continuous system of gathering information
about the way programmes are received by those who happen to see or hear
them, through panels of representative listeners and viewers, and (c) ad hoc
investigations. The ITA co-ordinates research programmes carried out for it
by outside experts.
The Postmaster General is advised on the technical aspects of television
(and VHP sound broadcasting) by the Television Advisory Committee,
which consists of an independent chairman, the Director-General of the BBC,
the Director-General of the ITA, representatives from the radio industry,
independent members, and representatives of interested government
departments.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and
engineering staffs of the BBC, the Post Office and the radio industry. In the
BBC a comparison has been made and work is continuing on three systems
of colour transmission, based on the NTSC (National Television Systems
Committee (USA)), SECAM (Sequentiel Couleur avec Memoire) and PAL
(Phase Alternation Line) systems. Other recent studies include: investigations
into various systems of stereophonic sound transmissions; methods of
improving studio acoustics, microphones and loudspeakers; long-distance
propagation studies in the short-wave, VHP and ultra high frequency bands;
and methods of increasing national coverage both in sound and television by
such means as the sharing of frequencies between stations, the construction of
transmitting aerials having special horizontal radiation patterns, and the
development of unattended relay transmitters of low power for providing a
television and VHP sound service to small and isolated communities. The
BBC has also developed equipment for converting television programmes from
European standards to those of North America, and the world’s first electronic
standards converter which operates unattended and gives converted pictures
of far higher quality than those of earlier converters.
The BBC and the ITA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union. The
union, which now has 29 full members among the broadcasting organisations
in the European zone and 40 associate members (mostly from outside Europe,
including the United States of America and many of the nations of the
Commonwealth), meets every year to exchange views and information, and
to study common problems. It also maintains a Technical Monitoring Station,
where frequency measurements and other observations on broadcasting
stations can be carried out.

Within the Commonwealth, the BBC is closely associated with the broad¬
casting organisations of the other member countries and of the dependent
territories. The BBC, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, and the Rank Organisation have jointly set up a
British Commonwealth International Newsfilm News Agency Trust. Through
an associated non-profit-making company (the British Commonwealth
International Newsfilm News Agency Limited), this joint enterprise provides
a reliable service of international news on film for subscribers who operate
television services, produce cinematograph newsreels or acquire newsfilm for
any other purposes, including education, anywhere in the world.
Both the BBC and the independent television companies are associated
with the Centre for Educational Television Overseas, which began work in
1962 and concentrates particularly on the needs of the service in developing
countries. The centre receives a government grant totalling £100,000 over five
years, but most of its funds come from private sources, including the indepen¬
dent television companies. The BBC provides free technical and other facilities,
including film library resources and some use of lecture studios. Training
in television work is also provided for overseas trainees at the Thomson
Centre, in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a charitable trust.
The BBC and the ITA also participate in the work of the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency
responsible for the regulation and control of all international telecommuni¬
cation services (including sound and television), for the allocation and
registration of all radio frequencies and (through its International Con¬
sultative Committees) for the promotion and co-ordination of the international
study of technical problems in broadcasting. In addition, the BBC has
long-established relations with the United Nations Radio Division, with the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO),
and with the Council of Europe.
As well as taking part in the exchange of sound radio programmes arranged
between the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
the BBC is a regular contributor to the network of European television
(Eurovision). This network now includes 23 Western European member
countries; the exchange of television programmes between them is arranged
by the EBU, which maintains an International Television Co-ordination
Centre (Eurovision) in Brussels. The range of Eurovision is steadily increasing
as countries expand their networks and facilities, and new countries participate.
Successful programme exchanges have also been made between Moscow and
London by both the BBC and the independent television companies.
The first television relay across the Atlantic by means of Telstar, the com¬
munication satellite, was seen in Britain in the early hours of nth July, 1962.
The first programme exchanges between America and Europe via Telstar
were televised on 23rd July, 1962. Further exchanges have been achieved by
means of the subsequent satellite Relay and successful transmissions have
been effected between Japan and Europe. On 2nd May, 1965, a further
significant advance in inter-continental television was marked by the first
transatlantic exchange of programmes using the Early Bird synchronous
satellite. Simultaneous two-way live television was achieved for the first time
between Europe and America. Early Bird is stationary over the South
Atlantic, and thus permits continuous contact between ground stations on
opposite sides of the Atlantic.

THE PRESS
Ownership
The British press caters for all political views, different levels of education
and a wide range of interests. It is not subject to state control or censorship.
The British public buys more newspapers per person than any other in the
world. It has been estimated {World Communications, 1964, UNESCO) that
for every 100 inhabitants of Britain 50 copies of daily papers are sold every
day. (Next comes Sweden with 46 per 100 inhabitants.) Circulation figures of
individual newspapers are proportionately high: five of the daily morning
newspapers and five of the Sunday papers have circulations in the millions.
These high figures are largely explained by the fact that the London morning
and Sunday papers have national circulations, i.e. they are distributed
throughout the United Kingdom, being available almost everywhere on the
day of publication.
Britain imports just over half its newsprint requirements, while the rest
is made from imported raw materials. In 1964, 1 -41 million tons of newsprint
were used in the United Kingdom. The average size of national morning
papers varies between 16 and 32 pages. Prices of daily newspapers vary from
4d. to 6d. (for The Times). Sunday papers are considerably larger and prices
run up to 8d. In addition to their normal paging some newspapers carry
occasional supplements and a number are providing regular weekly colour
supplements.
According to The Newspaper Press Directory1 there are 131 daily and
Sunday newspapers and well over 1,200 weekly papers published in Greater
London and almost every sizeable town in the rest of the country. These
papers deal mainly with news of interest to the region where they are sold.
There are also the sporting papers, papers in foreign languages for groups of
nationals of other lands resident in Britain, and religious papers.
Ownership of the newspaper press is varied: it includes individual owners,
two or more partner proprietors, local printing and publishing firms, news¬
paper companies owning between one and half a dozen papers, or press groups
controlling a chain of newspapers in different parts of the country. The largest
press groups are: International Publishing Corporation Limited; Associated
Newspapers Limited; Beaverbrook Newspapers Limited; and, for the provin¬
cial newspapers, the Thomson Organisation Limited, Westminster Press
Provincial Newspapers Limited and Provincial Newspapers Limited.
Some newspaper groups also have holdings in independent television
contracting companies2 and extensive interests in periodicals. The Inter¬
national Publishing Corporation is the largest publisher of periodicals in
the world and the largest, by far, in England and Wales. In Scotland the
largest publishers of magazines are the D. C. Thomson Group.
1 Changes in the number of newspapers occur constantly; figures are based on the
1965 edition of The Newspaper Press Directory.
2 The Television Act 1963 stipulates that, if it appears to the Independent Television
Authority at any time that newspaper shareholdings in television programme companies
have led or are leading to results which are contrary to the public interest, the
Authority may, with the consent of the Postmaster General, notify the companies that
their programmes may cease to be transmitted.

Although pronounced views may be expressed in newspapers and their
political leanings may be obvious, they are financially independent of any
political party. In order to preserve their character and traditions, certain
newspapers and periodicals are governed by arrangements which vest the
ownership of the undertaking in trustees, or operate it in accordance with a
deed of trust, or provide that the transfer of shares be in the hands of trustees.
Such arrangements govern the direction of The Guardian, The Observer, The
Economist, Spectator and New Statesman. Much public concern has been
caused, especially since the second world war, because some newspapers have
ceased publication and the ownership of the remainder has become concen¬
trated in fewer hands. This trend was studied by two Royal Commissions
on the Press, one of which reported in 1949 and the other in 1962. The
recommendation of the latter, that the danger of concentration of ownership
should be lessened by the establishment of a Press Amalgamations Court to
examine transactions involving changes in ownership, was covered by the
part of the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965 which refers to newspapers
being dealt with through a specially appointed panel. However, the Act
directs that the Monopolies Commission and not a court of law should be
the investigating body.
In the autumn of 1964 the first newspaper in Britain to be printed by code
type and webfed litho offset was published {The Shropshire Star)', a British
made computer-typesetter is being used for a new evening paper at Reading by
the Thomson Organisation; and the Daily Mirror is to transmit whole pages
by facsimile for the printing of an Irish edition in Belfast.
Eleven morning papers are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout
the British Isles, and there are eight ‘national’ Sunday papers (see Table 37).
Most papers with big circulations have northern editions published in
Manchester which, after London, is the largest press centre in England.
Certain specialised daily papers published in London have a circulation
limited by interest and not by region, for example, Lloyd's List and Shipping
Gazette and Sporting Life. The leading Scottish papers {The Scotsman and
The Glasgow Herald) have a considerable circulation outside Scotland. The
two London evening papers each have affiliations with a national daily, but
draw their readership very largely from people living within fifty miles
of London.
The provincial newspapers of England and Wales numbering over 80 morning
or evening daily and Sunday papers and about 870 weeklies, provide the
general and local news expected by readers whose daily life and interests are
known to, and shared by, the newspaper staff. Only a few reflect a definite
political tendency, most of them considering themselves independent. The
total circulation of the provincial morning and evening papers is over
million. The Journal, the Yorkshire Post, the Sporting Chronicle, the Northern
Echo and the Western Mail (of the mornings) have circulations of over 100,000,
two provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun and the Sunday Mercury—
have circulations of over 200,000; while, among evening papers, the cir¬
culations of the Birmingham Evening Mail and Despatch, the Liverpool Echo
and Evening Express and the Manchester Evening News and Chronicle exceed
400,000. The Yorkshire Evening Post has a circulation of over 300,000, the
Newcastle Evening Chronicle and the Wolverhampton Express and Star
exceed 200,000, and ten other evening papers have between 100,000 and
494
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
200,000. The provincial newspaper, often read far more thoroughly than the
national daily, is a valuable medium for national and local advertising.
There are over go London suburban weeklies.

and the Greenock Telegraph and Clyde Shipping Gazette. The Sunday papers
are the Sunday Ad ail and the Sunday Post.
Weekly newspapers published in Scotland number about 150. The most
widely known are the Weekly Scotsman and the People’s Journal.
Northern Ireland has two morning papers, one evening paper and one

and the Irish News (Nationalist), the evening Belfast Telegraph (Unionist)
which has a circulation of 210,262, and the Sunday News (Independent),
first published in March 1965. There are 42 weekly newspapers in Northern
Ireland, with circulations ranging from under 4,000 to over 20,000. The
majority are published by individual companies.
One daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in Cardiff, has a
circulation of 102,602 mainly in southern Wales. In North Wales the
Liverpool Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening
papers published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South
Wales Argus, Newport, and the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea. North
Wales is served by the Liverpool Echo and to a smaller extent by the Manchester
Evening News and Chronicle.
The weekly press includes 47 weekly papers in English, many of them
carrying articles in Welsh; 3 bilingual papers; and 11 papers in Welsh, of
which 3 are denominational.
The Channel Islands have three daily papers (two in Guernsey and one in
Jersey), three evenings and two weeklies. The Isle of Man Times is issued
from Mondays to Wednesdays with a special weekly edition which is published
on Friday: there are also five weeklies.
Weekly, monthly and quarterly journals cover an enormous field. Salient
features of the last thirty years have been the development, on the one hand,
of periodicals with a mass appeal, particularly those for women and
adolescent girls; and, on the other hand, the growth of the trade and technical
press. There are over 4,500 periodical publications: general magazines with
circulations of up to a million; women’s magazines, some of which have even
larger circulations; numerous publications for children; religious periodicals
for all denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport,
gardening and other hobbies, and humour; journals specialising in various
subjects such as politics, finance and economics, science, the professions, and
the arts; trade and technical publications, many of which have circulations
throughout the world, some being published solely for export, with little or
no circulation in Britain; and the publications of learned societies, trade unions,
regiments, universities, colleges, schools, and other associations. There has
also been a large increase in recent years in the number and circulation of
‘house journals’, produced by industrial organisations mainly for their staffs.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Woman (3,007,790);
Woman's Own (2,170,565); Woman's Weekly (1,489,427); Woman's Realm
(1,319,601); Weekend (1,205,583); Reveille (1,128,820); Woman's Mirror
(904,827); together with the Radio Times (4,438,406) and TV Times
(2,479,406). _ . . , .
The leading weekly journals of opinion are The Economist (circulation
76,651), a politically independent publication covering a wider range of
interests and attitudes than its title implies; the New Statesman (circulation
89,197), which is a review of politics, literature and the arts with an independent
socialist political tendency; the Spectator (36,834), which covers much the same
subjects from an independent conservative standpoint; and Tribune, which
has a strongly left-wing but anti-communist bias. The Statist, independent,
specialises in the financial and industrial aspects of world affairs. Punch
(120,436), traditionally the leading humorous periodical, has in recent years
devoted increasing attention to public affairs. New Society (35,000), which
THE PRESS
497
covers the sociological aspects of current affairs, has rapidly established its
reputation, as has New Scientist (52,500), which reports on the progress of
science and technology in terms which the non-specialist can understand.
Other papers whose circulations are in the tens of thousands are the illustrated
weeklies such as the Illustrated London News, the Field, Country Life, and
The Listener, which includes the texts of outstanding BBC broadcasts. All
these weeklies are read in libraries, clubs and other institutions, and readership
is far wider than the circulation figures suggest.
Monthly and quarterly journals, particularly the literary and political
journals and those specialising in international and Commonwealth affairs,
generally speaking appeal to the more serious type of reader.
In addition to the circulation of periodicals published in England, Wales
has its own farming weekly, the Welsh Farm News, and several monthly and
quarterly journals, published both in Welsh and English.
Four monthly illustrated periodicals are published in Scotland: Scottish
Field, Scotland's Magazine, the Scots Magazine and Scotland; and two
weeklies devoted to farming interests, Farming News and the Scottish
Farmer. Among literary journals, probably the most famous is Blackwood's,
published in Edinburgh. Numerous popular magazines are also published in
Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, weekly, monthly and quarterly publications cover
farming, the linen industry, building, motoring and politics.
News Agencies There are three principal British news agencies:
Reuters Ltd., which is a world news agency owned by the newspapers of
the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand and operated by them on
a non-profit-making basis under the terms of a deed of trust which guarantees
the independence and integrity of the news service and ensures that all profits
are used to develop it. Founded in London in 1850, Reuters has offices in
many countries and maintains several hundred correspondents throughout
the world, supplying a continuous report of foreign news to the London
newsroom. This is then distributed to the national newspapers, to the radio
and television news services and, through an extensive private network of
communications, to news media in almost every part of the world.
Press Association Ltd., which is owned collectively by British provincial
newspapers. The Association distributes home news within the British Isles,
supplies the same home news to Reuters and its associated agencies for
distribution abroad and distributes to newspapers of the British Isles outside
London the overseas news of Reuters and the Associated Press. All profits
are used to develop the service.
Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd. (Extel), which distributes mainly home
news to the national and provincial press, broadcasting organisations, overseas
news agencies, and private subscribers.
Two other agencies supply a general service of overseas news:
Associated Press, which is a branch of the Associated Press of America.
British United Press, which is a Canadian subsidiary of United Press
International, an American agency.
A number of other United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign agencies
and news services have offices in London, and there are agencies in other
cities, specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical requirements.
Syndication of features is not as common in the United Kingdom as in some
countries, but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.

Training for
Journalism
Press
Institutions
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Two experimental courses of pre-entry training for journalism have been
inaugurated with the approval of the newspaper industry but they are
restricted to sponsored students from newspaper enterprises. Other
entrants to provincial newspapers in the United Kingdom (and most
national newspaper reporters start work in the provinces and go to London after
gaining experience) take part in a training scheme administered by the
National Council for the Training of Journalists, which represents all the
principal press organisations. The scheme, which is based on training in
newspaper offices, and local colleges of further education, consists of a six-
month probationary period, followed by three years of basic training and a
proficiency test. A National Diploma Course of eighteen months may be
undertaken later. Between 30 and 40 university graduates are taken on by
newspapers each year and the number is steadily increasing. The National
Council for the Training of Journalists also introduced (in 1965) the first
nationally organised training courses for senior journalists; they were in
science, financial and industrial reporting and in sub-editing.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union travelling fellowship scheme for
the training and education of young journalists throughout the Common¬
wealth, each year about ten journalists from overseas spend six months
in the United Kingdom: two or three months in the offices of newspapers
or periodicals and the remaining time acquiring a general idea of life in
Britain.
The Thomson Foundation provides scholarships and organises training
courses in Britain for journalists from newly developing countries.
Both employers and employees in the industry are well organised. On the
employers’ side the most important organisations are the Newspaper
Proprietors Association, whose members are proprietors of the national
daily and Sunday newspapers; the Newspaper Society, whose members are
proprietors of provincial daily and weekly newspapers in England and
Wales; the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society which represents the interests
of daily and Sunday newspapers in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper
Proprietors’ Association which represents the owners of weekly newspapers
in Scotland; the Belfast Newspaper Society whose members are the
proprietors of Northern Ireland’s daily newspapers; Associated Northern
Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly news¬
papers in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Proprietors Association,
whose membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and
technical publications and general magazines. On the employees’ side there
are the Institute of Journalists (loj), founded in 1884 as the National Associa¬
tion of Journalists; and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in
1907. The National Union of Journalists has a membership of over 18,500
(December 1964) working journalists and is the largest trade union confined to
journalists (including those working in radio and television and in public
relations) in the world; editors who have powers of dismissal are excluded
from full membership but may be associate members. The Institute of
Journalists, as it admits all qualified journalists on equal terms of membership,
may claim to be representative of the profession as a whole. Free-lance
journalists (who are not on the staff of any one paper or group of papers, but
send contributions to any journal) may belong to the NUJ or loj. The aims
of these organisations are the improvement of the economic status of journal¬
ists, the promotion of their professional welfare, and the safeguarding of the
status of the press and its editorial staffs.

The main aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are to sustain
the dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of
editors, to protect the rights and freedom of the press, and to improve the
education and training of journalists: the Guild has about 330 members. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong.
The Printing and Kindred Trades Federation is made up of trade unions
concerned with printing and publishing. The principal craft unions are
the National Graphical Association and the Scottish Typographical Associa¬
tion which organise such workers as compositors and machine minders. The
National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA) has a
varied membership (850 categories), which includes machine room assistants,
clerical and administrative staff, and general assistants in printing works.
The Press Council, established in 1953 and reconstituted in 1963, has a lay
chairman and 25 members. Its aims are: to preserve the established freedom
of the British press; to maintain the character of the British press in
accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep
under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of
public interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of
the press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press; to
report on developments in the British press which may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly; to make representation on appropriate occasions
to the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to press organisations
abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodical reports recording its work
and to review from time to time developments in the British press and the
factors affecting them. Reports are published annually.
ant^ The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say
what it likes provided it does not transgress the law and, in general, is at
liberty to comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments
relating directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers, there are
no specific press laws but certain statutes include clauses which apply, in
particular or incidentally, to the press. These relate to such matters as
the right of press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local
authorities, restrictions on the publication of (<2) advertisement and investment
circulars, which are governed by Acts dealing with fraud and (b) advertisements
of remedies for certain diseases, which are covered by public health legislation;
agreements between the Post Office and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic
communications, which must comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions
on certain types of prize competition; and copyrights, which come under
copyright laws.
Some of the main aspects of the law which have particular relevance to the
work of the press are: contempt of court—a newspaper may not publish
comments on judges, magistrates or court proceedings which are likely to
prejudice their reputation for fairness, nor may it publish before or during a
trial anything which might tend to influence the result; seditious libel,
incitement to disaffection and revealing official secrets; offences against public
morality—laws covering blasphemous and obscene libel, forbidding publi¬
cation of advertisements of lotteries, and imposing restrictions on reports of
certain court proceedings; the Children and Young Persons Acts empower the
courts to forbid matter being published by which a child or young person
involved in proceedings can be identified; defamation; and criminal libel.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
One section of the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965 deals specifically with
newspaper ownership (see p. 493).
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the
majority of actions that do take place are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may all be
held responsible.
In 1964 a working party was set up, consisting of representatives of Justice
(British Section of the International Commission of Jurists) and of the
British Committee of the International Press Institute, ‘to inquire into the
extent to which the Law and the practices of the Courts as at present existing
in respect of Contempt of Court, Libel and Official Secrets, hamper the press
in publishing facts of public interest, and in editorially commenting thereon
within the limits of what is necessary for the protection of the liberty of the
subject and the security of the State’. The recommendations of the working
party were published in 1965 (The Law and the Press, Stevens, 17s. 6d.).

SPORT
In Britain, the word ‘sport’ is used generally to describe such activities as
organised outdoor games, athletics, field or country sports, indoor games,
aquatic sports, and such popular pursuits as horse-racing, dog-racing, show
jumping, riding, boxing, rock climbing, motor racing, cycling and rifle
shooting as well as those (for instance, archery, fencing, gliding and ice-skating)
which, although less popular judged by the number of participants and
spectators, all have their own devotees. Those who engage in sport may be
professionals (i.e. paid players) or amateurs.1 * * Professionals keep up the
technical standards of the sports in which they take part and spectators make
a vital contribution by their enthusiasm and their financial support; but the
sporting hfe of Britain derives its character principally from the’amateur
element people who devote time and energy to organising sport and to
teaching and training, as well as the many thousands of all ages who engage
in sport for pleasure alone. 6

Sport
e Government is not directly concerned with the organisation or promotion
of sport in Britain but it has assumed responsibility for providing encourage¬
ment, guidance and help; it gives grant-aid to voluntary bodies towards
approved expenditure on playing fields, swimming baths and other facilities
for physical recreation, and to national voluntary organisations in Great
Britain for various purposes, including the holding of world championships
and events of similar importance in Britain. The Government is advised on
matters relating to the development of amateur sport and physical recreation
by the Sports Council, which also fosters co-operation between the statutory
authorities in Great Britain (the Department of Education and Science and
the Scottish Education Department) and the voluntary organisations concerned.
The chairman of the Council is the Joint Under-Secretary for Education and
Science, who is the minister responsible for sport. In Northern Ireland the
Ministry of Education is advised by the Youth and Sports Council.
The Council works in close co-operation with the Central Council of
Physical Recreation, the National Playing Fields Association, the Scottish
equivalents of these bodies, and the British Olympic Association.
Direct Exchequer assistance to sport and physical recreation (other than
in educational establishments) in Great Britain amounted to £915 000 in
1964-65. This amount is to be increased to £1,571,000 in 1965-66 ’ repre¬
senting a rise of over 70 per cent. In Northern Ireland in 1964-65 over
£138,000 in grants was given to public authorities and voluntary organisations
for sports facilities and coaching schemes.
The Secretary of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland require that
all publicly maintained schools shall provide for the physical education
(gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and swimming) of their pupils. Schools
1 Some sports, for example athletics, Rugby Union football, hockey and rowing are
entirely amateur, but in other sports the distinction between professional and amateur
status is becoming less strictly defined. ur

in the national systems (excepting those solely for infants) must have their
own playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a
gymnasium. Facilities for, and instruction in, many kinds of sport are also
provided at the independent preparatory and public schools and at the
universities (some of which have departments of physical education). Local
authorities are empowered under the Public Health Acts and the Physical
Training and Recreation Acts to provide playing fields. They also provide
gymnasia, tennis courts, golf courses and swimming baths on an increasing
scale. Sports facilities for employees are also provided by industrial and
commercial concerns.
The national voluntary organisations most closely concerned with the general
development of sport are the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the
Scottish Council of Physical Recreation, and the National Playing Fields
Association. The British Olympic Association, whose main functions are
connected with the participation of British teams and competitors in the
Olympic Games, is also interested in all matters likely to benefit sport or
physical recreation in Britain as a whole.
The Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR) is an association of all
national bodies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland concerned wdth the
development of post-school physical recreation. Its funds are partly raised
by voluntary contributions but it receives a grant from the Department of
Education and Science, with which it is closely associated in much of its
work.
The CCPR is composed of representatives of the British Olympic Associa¬
tion, the National Playing Fields Association, the governing bodies of 41
sports, 16 national outdoor activity associations, 16 bodies concerned with
dancing and rhythmic movement, and 34 voluntary youth organisations, in
addition to representatives of community centres, educational, physical
education and health education organisations, local authorities and the
Services’ sports branches. Its headquarters are in London and it has nine
regional offices in other parts of England. Its activities in Wales are controlled
by a representative Welsh committee, and in Northern Ireland by a separate
section with its own executive committee.
Broadly, the function of the CCPR is to promote all forms of physical
recreation. Its activities include the organisation of some 2,400 courses for
coaches and instructors, courses in personal performance, lectures, displays
and other publicity events which are attended, on average, by about 52,000
young men and women each year. Its staff give advisory, technical and
administrative help wherever required, but particularly to the headquarters,
regional, county and local branches of the constituent organisations and to
local education authorities and industrial concerns.
The Scottish Council of Physical Recreation (SCPR) is the counterpart in
Scotland of the CCPR, and has 134 affiliated organisations, including the
governing bodies of all the Scottish sports; it receives a grant-in-aid from
the Scottish Education Department.
The main aim of the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA) is to
stimulate the provision of playing fields and playgrounds, especially for
children, by publicity and financial assistance. Since its inception in 1925
it has distributed over ^1-5 million in the form of grants for playing field
and playground schemes and about £107,000 in the form of loans. It assists
more than 400 schemes a year.

The NPFA council is composed of representatives of the governing bodies
of various sports organisations, of the British Olympic Association and the
CCPR, and of a number of educational bodies, voluntary youth organisations,
physical education associations and local authorities. The national headquarters
in London employs a small full-time staff, including a technical and research
department which gives advice on all aspects of recreational planning
including the provision and layout of indoor and outdoor sports facilities.
It also advises on matters relating to children’s playgrounds, play leadership
schemes, and the play and recreational needs of children from their earliest
years. The Association derives its funds mainly from voluntary contributions
but has recently been in receipt of a small contribution towards administrative
costs from the Department of Education and Science and the Ministry of
Education for Northern Ireland.
The NPpA has branches in Scotland and Northern Ireland; there are also
branches in nearly every English and Welsh county; administration is carried
out, in the main, on a voluntary basis, in many cases in association with a
local authority, Rural Community Council or Sports Development Council.
There are five National Recreation Centres in Britain, outside London—two
in England, one in Wales and two in Scotland—administered by the CCPR
and the SCPR. The centres, all but one of which were established by voluntary
funds, provide a wide range of courses for coaches, instructors and per¬
formers in many games, sports and other physical activities. A programme of
improvements, the capital cost of which will be borne by the Department of
Education and Science, is to be carried out during the next three or four
years. There is also a sailing centre, likewise administered by the CCPR,
which provides a range of activities, including courses on sailing, boat handling,'
cruising, navigation, racing, boat maintenance and boat building, for school
and youth groups and adults.
The Crystal Palace National Recreation Centre in London, built at a
cost of nearly £3 million, was opened in 1964. Covering 36 acres, the Centre
has a main stadium with seating for 12,000 spectators; a sports hall with an
arena divisible into three and seating for 2,000 spectators; a swimming hall
with pools of Olympic dimensions, a teaching pool and a gallery for 2,000
spectators; an indoor cricket school and practice rooms suitable for all indoor
activities; a lecture theatre, first-aid rooms and changing rooms; a hostel for
140 residents; and staff housing. The Centre, managed by the CCPR, is
designed for international competitions as well as to provide training facilities
for leaders, coaches and athletes.
A prototype local sports centre, to cost about £200,000, is to be provided
m Glasgow by the SCPR and Glasgow Corporation, in co-operation with the
Scottish Education Department, to demonstrate the possibilities of multi¬
purpose recreational buildings and to establish a pattern of facilities and
management which might be adopted, with suitable adaptations, by other
local authorities to meet their own needs.
Outdoor games played in Britain include team games such as football,
cricket, and hockey, and games such as lawn tennis and golf, in which
individuals or couples match their skill. Judged by the number of participants
and spectators, the most popular of the team games are football and cricket,
and the most popular of the individual games is lawn tennis.
Although football of a kind was played in the Middle Ages or even earlier,
as an organised game it dates from just over a century ago. One type of
R

—
504 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
football, in which only the feet are used, was adopted at Cambridge in 1855;
the other type, in which the ball is handled as well as kicked, was first played
at Rugby School, whence it derives its name, and was adopted by the
Blackheath football club in 1859.
In England the controlling body of the non-handling game, Association
Football (‘soccer’), is the Football Association (FA) formed in 1863. Its chief
function is to promote the interests of the game and to prevent infringement
of the agreed rules; it also arranges for the instruction of promising young
players (some £ 10,000 is spent annually on coaching); organises various
matches and competitions, including the international matches played by
England, the Amateur Cup competition, two national youth competitions,
and the competition for its own leading trophy, the Football Association
Challenge Cup; and chooses and manages English international teams. Over
350 clubs are registered with the FA, more than 200 as full members and
between 130 and 140 as associate members. There are also some 25,000 clubs
affiliated to county (i.e. district or regional) associations. The FA derives its
main income from subscriptions and admission charges to international and
cup matches, and ploughs back a large portion of the money into the game.
Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have their own controlling bodies:
the Scottish Football Association, the Irish Football Association and the
Football Association of Wales.
The principal professional matches in England and Wales (played once or
twice weekly) are controlled by the Football League, which comprises over
90 professional clubs in these countries. The funds of the League are derived
largely from contributions paid by member clubs in the form of a levy of
4 per cent of the net gate receipts from league matches, after allowable
expenses have been deducted, and from annual payments from the leading
football pools promoters for the use of league fixture lists.
In Scotland the Scottish Football League comprises 37 clubs; Northern
Ireland has its own league. Clubs belonging to the English and Scottish
Leagues are organised in divisions, the members of which compete against
one another for the respective league championships. Their positions in
the divisional tables are decided at the end of the season by the number of
points gained for wins or draws. During the season about 30 million people
watch league football matches and gate receipts usually amount to between
£5 million and £6 million.
Several million people stake small weekly sums on the results of the league
matches by filling in what are known as ‘pools’ coupons. The odds against
winning anything in the pools are very great, but the prizes are high and
individual payments of ^300,000 are occasionally made. The promoters
of the pools deduct varying amounts from the stakes for commission and
expenses.
The annual competition for the FA Cup is organised on a knock-out basis
and the Cup Final is one of the most important football matches of the year
in England; it is always played at Wembley Stadium, near London, which
can accommodate some 100,000 spectators. The Scottish Cup Final is played
at Hampden Park, Glasgow. The matches between England, Scotland, Wales
and Ireland also excite great interest, as do other international matches.
For the World Cup games in 1966 the Government is making available
a sum not exceeding £500,000 to the Football Association towards the cost
of facilities necessary for the games to be suitably staged. Between 80 and
90 per cent will be spent on permanent improvements; four-fifths of the
amount will be paid as a grant and the rest be provided as a loan.

There are many more amateur association football players than there are
professionals (the comparative figures are about 650,000 amateurs, including
schoolboys and members of the armed forces, to 7,000 or 8,000 professionals),
but with one or two notable exceptions their teams cannot compete on equal
terms, since professional teams are more systematically and intensively
trained. Amateur teams compete against each other for the Football
Association Amateur Challenge Cup.
Rugby Football (‘rugger’) is played under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union, established in 1871. The rules of the game are completely
different from those that govern soccer, and there are 15 players, instead of 11,
in a side. International matches between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland’
and France are played regularly at the leading rugby football grounds of each
country, including Twickenham, London—the headquarters of the Rugby
Football Union—and there are tours by international teams to and from
New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Other important rugger matches
are the county championship competitions, the annual match between the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the Hospitals’ Cup final, and the
Inter-Services tournament.
Seven-a-side football (a variant of Rugby football) is also played by clubs
and schools to a limited extent. Membership of the Rugby Union is strictly
confined to amateur clubs. In the north of England Rugby League Football
is played. This is a thirteen-a-side game played by professionals as well as
amateurs. The Rugby Football League (instituted in 1895) regularly sends
touring teams to Australia and New Zealand and has annual international
games, professional and amateur, against France. The major match of the
season—the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final—has attracted crowds of
95,000 at Wembley Stadium in recent years.
Cricket is often called the English national game. The exact date of its origin
is not recorded, but it is known that the game was played at Guildford Grammar
School during the sixteenth century, and by the beginning of the eighteenth
century it was popular both in the villages of England and on the larger country
estates. The game has been played more or less as it is played today since the
adoption of a generally accepted set of laws in 1744. About 1750 a cricket
club was formed in the Hampshire village of Hambledon; within 20 years
it had made an outstanding name for itself and acquired a membership
representative of patrons of cricket from all over England. In 1787 the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), now the governing body of cricket, was
founded, with its headquarters in London on a site rented by a Yorkshireman
called Thomas Lord. In the year 1810-11 the MCC moved its headquarters to
a ground near Regent’s Park, keeping the name Lord's-, four years later Lord's
transferred to another ground, at St. John’s Wood, in the same neighbourhood,
where it has remained ever since. Other clubs that sprang up all over England
during the nineteenth century recognised the MCC’s authority, and nowadays
all cricket is played according to the ‘laws of cricket’ as laid down by the
MCC in consultation with cricketing organisations in Britain and the overseas
Commonwealth.
In England cricket is played in schools and universities, and almost all
towns and villages have their cricket teams which play at least one match a
week from May to September; in the London area a large number of pitches
are provided by the local authorities besides many leased or owned by clubs.
Apart from the university match between Oxford and Cambridge and
certain representative games, the greater part of first-class cricket is played
in a county championship between seventeen ‘first-class counties’. (The
 —
506 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
other counties have a ‘minor counties championship’ of their own.) Famous
grounds besides Lord's are the Oval, Kennington, London, headquarters of
the Surrey Cricket Club; Old Trafford, Manchester; Headingley, Leeds; and
Trent Bridge, Nottingham.
In the late nineteenth century more amateurs played cricket than economic
conditions in the twentieth century allow: with first-class matches lasting
three days and each county playing up to thirty matches in a season, the
number of cricketers who can afford to play as true amateurs declined and
the distinction between amateur and professional in the first-class game has
now been abolished. League cricket, which is a feature of the game in the
north of England, is played by teams mainly consisting of amateur Saturday
afternoon players with one or more professionals, many of whom are
distinguished players from other Commonwealth countries. The MCC is
an entirely amateur body, although retired professional cricketers of ‘the
highest merit’ are elected to honorary membership.
In addition to county championships, matches known as ‘test matches’
are played regularly between a number of Commonwealth countries. The first
of these matches was played at Melbourne, Australia, in 1877, between
England and Australia. Present-day test matches last 30 hours (spread over
five or six days); they arouse great popular interest and are widely reported
in the press and on radio and television.
Lawn Tennis A form of tennis has been played out of doors from the earliest times; but
modern lawn tennis dates from about 1873, when it began to take its place
as one of the British national summer games. In 1877 words ‘and lawn
tennis’ were added to the title of the All England Croquet Club at Wimbledon,
near London, and in the same year the first championships were played;
the Lawn Tennis Association, the controlling body of the game in Britain,
was founded in 1888. The governing body of the game in the world is the
International Lawn Tennis Federation (founded in 1913), with headquarters
in London and Paris.
The number of people who play lawn tennis has greatly increased during
the present century, particularly since the game has spread to practically
every country in the world. In Britain the game is played in almost all girls’
schools and in very many boys’ schools where the pupils are of secondary
school age. It is also played on private courts, in parks and recreation grounds
and at several thousand tennis clubs.
The annual championships held at Wimbledon for two weeks at the end
of June and beginning of July are the main event of the lawn tennis season
in Britain and, in fact, in the world. These championships, in which men and
women of many nationalities compete, draw large crowds; there is accom¬
modation for over 30,000 spectators in the grounds of the All England Club
—14,000 can be accommodated round the centre court where the finals are
played. Other tournaments which attract a good deal of attention are: the
British Hardcourt Championships, the British Junior Championships, and
the County Championships. There are also competitions for boys’ and girls
schools on a national basis, and the Foundation Cup (for women). The most
important international event is the Davis Cup (for men). Women players
from Britain and the United States of America also compete annually for the
Wightman Cup.
Golf Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, but it did not become really well known in the other
countries of the United Kingdom until towards the end of the nineteenth

century. Since then, however, it has gained steadily in popularity and
nowadays there are golf courses in the vicinity of many towns and villages—
some owned by local authorities, but the majority owned by golf clubs. The
headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club is St. Andrews, Scotland.

anants of hockey (as distinct from ice-hockey) have been played in Britain
r ooTf fC;CeTnTtur;es' Modern hockey, however, dates from the formation
(in 1886) of the Hockey Association, which standardised the rules relating
to mens hockey. Nowadays there are some 1,100 hockey clubs affiliated to
e Hockey Association. Although there are no professional county teams and
no cup ties, a county championship was instituted in 1957. In addition
regular amateur international matches (inaugurated in 1894) are played. There
are over 35,000 adult and some 50,000 schoolboy hockey players in Britain.
n Britain hockey is more commonly played by women than by men. The
controlling bodies are: the All England Women’s Hockey Association
(founded 1895) to which are affiliated the Irish Ladies Hockey Union the
bcottish Women’s Hockey Association, the Welsh Women’s Hockey Associa¬
tion, some 1 900 girls’ schools and about 900 clubs. The first international
women s hockey match took place in 1896. Nowadays such a match is played
annually at Wembley Stadium and attracts some 56,000 spectators.
Lacrosse, adapted from the game played by the Iroquois Indians of North
America, is played mainly by women—in girls’ schools, at lacrosse clubs, and
at universities. International matches are played, as well as regional matches
by womens teams representing the East, West, South, North and Midlands
° ngland, under the auspices of the All England Ladies Lacrosse Association.
The men s game, of which the controlling body is the English Lacrosse
Union, is played m seven universities, and by clubs and schools, mainly in
and around London and Manchester. County matches are played and there
is an annual fixture between the North of England and the South.
NetbaH is a popular game for girls and women. The controlling body is the
All England Netball Association to which are affiliated the English countv
associations, the netball clubs of the three Women’s Services and sections of
the national youth organisations for girls and women. Inter-county and home
international matches are played regularly and inter-Commonwealth tours
are arranged.
Polo, of which the earliest records are Persian, was first played by the British
in India, and brought to England in 1869. The governing body of British
po o is the Hurhngham Polo Association to which all the Commonwealth
polo associations and that of South Africa are affiliated. Polo players are a
very small section of the community, for the cost of keeping polo ponies is
igh. However, many of the clubs now own trained ponies which are hired
out to members at moderate cost. There are about 300 players handicapped
by the Hurhngham Polo Association, but many less expert players take part
m club games for which they may be locally handicapped.
Public interest in polo has increased in recent years and large numbers of
spectators attend inter-club tournaments and matches between high-handicap
teams composed of players from several countries.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The game of bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century.
Nowadays the flat green game is regulated, as far as the English Bowling
Association is concerned, by the International Bowling Board (IBB), founded
in 1905. The Bowling Associations of Ireland, Scotland and Wales also come
under and play to the laws laid down by the IBB, but there are other bowling
associations in England—the English Bowling Federation, the Crown Green
Association and the English Women’s Bowling Association—which are not
under the IBB’s control.
During the summer bowls is played on bowling greens in the open; in
winter it is played on indoor greens, which are increasing in number. At one
time regarded as a pastime for the elderly, the game is now played by people
of all ages. Over 2,550 bowling clubs in England are affiliated to the English
Bowling Association alone, and international and inter-county matches are
played.
The popularity of mountaineering has greatly increased in recent years. The
number of clubs in the British Mountaineering Council and the Association
of Scottish Climbing Clubs, the representative bodies of the sport, has
doubled to over 140 in the last six years, mainly by the addition of smaller
town and district clubs to the older larger clubs such as the Alpine Club
(founded in 1857, the oldest mountaineering club in the world), the Climbers’
Club, the Scottish Mountaineering Club and the Fell and Rock Climbing
Club. A number of local education authorities, as well as national bodies
such as the YMCA, the Scouts and the Central Council of Physical Recreation,
have established mountaineering training centres in the hills. Training courses
are also run by the Mountaineering Association, the Youth Hostels Associa¬
tion and other bodies, while many schools now have mountaineering sections.
Membership of the known clubs is about 15,000, but several times this
number take part in climbing and mountaineering.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring most of the
great ranges of the world and in climbing their peaks; for example, the first
ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865, of Everest in 1953, and of Kangchenjunga
in 1955. In recent years frequent expeditions have gone to far off mountains,
to Greenland, Alaska, the Andes, Patagonia, the Caucasus and the Pamirs,
as well as the Himalayas.
Ski-ing in Scotland has become very popular, especially at the winter sports
centres established in the Cairngorms, Deeside, Glencoe and Glenshee,
where ski-lifts, ski-tows and professional instruction are now available.
Amateur athletics, which include running (track, road and cross-country),
relay racing, jumping, hurdling, throwing and race-walking, are governed by
the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA), which was founded in 1880 to
encourage amateur athletics, to improve the management of amateur athletic
meetings by the establishment of uniform regulations, and to promote annual
championship meetings. The Association, whose membership increased
rapidly, is now organised from club to national level by honorary officers
and managed by representative members appointed by the Northern, Midland,
Southern and Welsh areas and by affiliated clubs and associations (amateur
athletic clubs, schools and youth organisations), of which there are hundreds
throughout England and Wales. The AAA administers a coaching scheme,
with a constant expenditure of nearly £20,000 a year, under which seven
full-time national coaches, working mainly in separate regions, lecture,

demonstrate and coach in schools, youth clubs, evening institutes, training
colleges and universities and at special courses organised by the national
associations, by regional associations or by the Central Council of Physical
Recreation. The Crystal Palace National Recreation Centre is being used as
a training centre and for athletics matches. Some of the work of the national
coaches is directly concerned with coaching young athletes but their main
duties are to instruct men who wish to qualify as honorary coaches, over
2,000 of whom give voluntary services in the counties and districts of England
and Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own amateur athletic
associations, with similar functions; there are also separate women’s AAAs
for each country.
International athletics and the selection of teams representing the United
Kingdom are dealt with by the British Amateur Athletic Board which is
composed of representatives of the three national associations for men and
of the Women’s Council, and is affiliated to the International Amateur
Athletic Federation.
Track meetings are held throughout Britain from April to October. The
main events in England and Wales are: the AAA championships for men
and international matches held at Crystal Palace, London; area and county
championships; and the universities, Services, business houses and schools
championship meetings. Clubs usually compete in cross-country running
from October to March, and international county and area cross-country
championships are held.
Teams representing Britain compete in the Olympic Games (held every
four years), and separate teams representing England, Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games, held at four-yearly
intervals between the Olympic Games. In the last Olympic Games, held at
Tokyo, Japan, in October 1964, Britain won 18 medals (four gold, twelve
silver and two bronze) her best performance since 1920. The next Common¬
wealth Games (1966) will be held in Jamaica.
The Highland games are traditional gatherings of local people in the High¬
lands of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the
weight and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions
take place. Among the better known Highland games are the Northern
Meeting at Inverness, the Braemar Gathering on Deeside (traditionally
attended by the royal family), the Argyllshire Gathering at Oban, and the
meeting at Aboyne. The Highland games attract large numbers of spectators
from all over the world.
The most popular country sports are hunting, shooting and fishing; these are
old-established sports with a long history, and they still play a considerable
part in the life of the countryside. The organisation which looks after their
interests is the British Field Sports Society.
In Britain hunting means primarily fox hunting on horseback with a pack of
hounds; but it also includes stag hunting, which preceded fox hunting and
still goes on, mainly in Devon and Somerset; hunting the hare, either on foot
with beagles or with harriers when the followers are mounted; and otter
hunting along the banks of rivers. Hunting depends not on right but on
permission. Most landowners and farmers allow followers of recognised hunts
to cross their property.
Fox hunting originated some 200 years ago. Originally a sport mainly for
the landed gentry and local farmers, it has gradually widened its appeal, in
j 10 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
spite of the fact that it is an expensive pastime for those who ride to hounds.
The sport is not without its critics, but a large number of people, including
many townsmen, take a keen interest in it and follow the hunt in cars, on
bicycles or on foot. The fox hunting season proper starts in early November
and lasts until April; it is preceded by cub hunting, i.e. the hunting of young
foxes, when young hounds are trained. At the end of the season most hunts
organise steeplechases, known as point-to-points, which are patronised by
large crowds.
There are between 190 and 200 packs of hounds in England and Wales,
13 in Northern Ireland, and 10 in Scotland. The packs range in size from
the large establishments in the ‘shires’, i.e. the Midlands of England (for
instance, the Belvoir, the Cottesmore, the Quorn, and the Fernie) where
mounted followers may be two hundred or more, to small kennels in the
west and north, where hunting is sometimes on foot.
Hunts are financed mainly by the subscriptions of their members and with
the aid of the farmers, whose support enables fox hunting to continue to
flourish; car-parking fees, at such events as point-to-points, also contribute
and sometimes the Master of Fox-hounds (MFH), who is in charge of the
hunt, bears a proportion of the cost.
Shooting Game shooting as an organised country sport may be said to date from the
early part of the nineteenth century; nowadays, game consists mainly of
grouse, partridge, pheasant, snipe and woodcock.
There is virtually no free shooting in any part of the United Kingdom. In
the first place, a gun licence or a game licence must be applied for and pur¬
chased annually, and secondly, nearly all game birds are to be found on
privately owned land, shot over either by the owner and his friends or by
syndicates which have leased the shooting. However, in some parts of the
more remote countryside, rough shooting may be enjoyed in a less formal
way. Much of the country’s wildfowling is controlled by the Wildfowling
Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, through its numerous
clubs.
Grouse, partridge, pheasant and certain other birds are preserved . that
is to say, there is a ‘close season’ during which they are protected by law and
allowed to breed in security, often under the care of privately employed
gamekeepers on numerous estates. The grouse, partridge and pheasant
seasons open on 12th August, 1st September and 1st October, severally, and
last for between four and five months. Grouse shooting takes place mostly
in Scotland, northern England and North Wales; partridge and pheasant
shooting in nearly every county in England, Wales and Scotland, the former
mainly over farm land, and the latter in or near woodland; and wildfowhng on
the marshes and fenlands of the coastal areas.
The Game Research Association, formed by landowners, farmers and others
interested in game conservation and research, collects and collates information
on a national scale and makes a detailed study of factors controlling game
population, including diseases to which game birds are subject, game ecology
and density, survival rates and movements of game in changing environments.
Deer stalking, which derives its name from the fact that, in order to get
an effective shot, a very cautious approach is needed (since red deer have a
keen scent, are far-sighted, and take alarm at the slightest sound), is mainly
a sport of the Highlands of Scotland. The deer are preserved in privately
owned ‘deer forests’, ranging in size from 9,000 to over 30,000 acres. The
close seasons are October to June, inclusive, for stags and February to
October, inclusive, for hinds.
SPORT
Fishing
Aquatic Sports
Rowing
511
Fishing is the most popular of the country sports in that it is within the reach
of everyone in some form or another (from the small boy with his hook and
line to the experienced fly-fisherman), and that many more people fish in
their leisure hours than hunt or shoot.
The outstanding forms of the sport in Britain are salmon and trout fishing.
Trout streams are to be found in most parts of the country, and in Scotland
there are also many hundreds of lochs which provide good sport. Salmon
fishing may be enjoyed on many rivers in England, North Wales and Northern
Ireland, but the best salmon rivers are to be found in Scotland. In England
and Wales the most widely practised form of fishing is for coarse fish°such
as pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench, chub and bream, and the National
Federation of Anglers (NFA) has some 390,000 members. Match angling—
competitive fishing for coarse fish by weight—is a feature of the many angling
clubs affiliated to the NFA, particularly in the midlands and north of England;
a national angling championship, composed of no teams of 12 anglers, is
organised annually by the NFA; and the NFA enters a team in the Inter¬
national Angling Competition.
Fishing around the coasts is another popular pastime, while deep-sea
fishing for tuna and shark has gained many adherents during the past twenty
years.
Coastal and deep-sea fishing is free to all (except for salmon and sea trout
fishing in Scotland) but, as a rule, freshwater fishing has to be paid for and
local inquiries made about any permit or licence required. Most coarse
fishing is let to angling clubs; trout and salmon fishermen either rent a
stretch of river, join a club, stay at an hotel with its own fishing rights, or
pay for the right to fish by the day, week or month. The cost of salmon
fishing is often high.
Aquatic sports include rowing, sailing, swimming, canoeing, punting and
water ski-ing. The first three are the most commonly practised in Britain
and are included in the Olympic events and the Commonwealth Games.
Rowing as a pastime is enjoyed by people from all sections of the community,
and as a sport it arouses considerable public interest. The two most popular
annual rowing events are the University Boat Race, which originated in 1820
and has been rowed annually on the Thames in the early spring since 1836;
and Henley Regatta, founded in 1839, which takes place each July at Henley-
on-Thames in Oxfordshire. The University Boat Race is between eight-oared
crews from Oxford and Cambridge over a course of some 4J miles between
Putney and Mortlake; it is watched by many thousands of rival supporters
gathered on both sides of the river. Considerable interest is also shown in
the Head of the River Race from Mortlake to Putney, in March, in which
between 200 and 300 eights row in procession—the largest assembly of
racing craft in the world.
Crews from all over the world compete at Henley Regatta, where various
kinds of races are rowed over a straight course of 1 mile 550 yards; for
instance, for the Grand Challenge Cup, open to eight-oared crews from any
nation, the Silver Goblets for pair oars, the Diamond Sculls for single
scullers, and the Ladies Challenge Plate open to crews from schools and
colleges in the United Kingdom. Many other riverside resorts arrange
regattas every summer.
The oldest annual event in the English racing calendar is Doggett's Coat
and Badge, founded in 1716 and organised since by the Worshipful Company
of Fishmongers. Originally for professional watermen and limited to six

entrants, the race is now open to amateurs (who must, however, still be
apprentice watermen); if necessary, it may be rowed in heats. The course
is from London Bridge to Chelsea.
The art of oarsmanship is taught in many schools, universities and rowing
clubs, including women’s rowing clubs, throughout Britain; and women as
well as men compete in the European rowing championships. The Amateur
Rowing Association is the governing body of the sport.
Enthusiasts have always devoted much of their leisure to yachting on the
inland waters and round the coasts of Britain, but during the last fifteen years
the sport, and in particular small boat sailing, has greatly widened its appeal.
There are about 11,700 dinghies registered with the Royal Yachting Associa¬
tion, of which the most popular classes are the National Enterprise and
National Firefly; but as by no means all classes attain national status, there
is an even greater number of boats not included in this register.
Most British yacht racing is administered by the Royal Yachting Associa¬
tion, subject to the rules of the International Yacht Racing Union, founded
in 1907. The main event of the inshore yachting season is the annual regatta
at Cowes in the Isle of Wight, the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Squadron,
founded in 1812. Other events include the Round the Isle of Wight race and
the races arranged during the special yachting weeks (or fortnights) held at
such sailing centres as Poole in Dorset, Bembridge in the Isle of Wight,
Lowestoft in Suffolk, Harwich and Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, Plymouth
in Devon, Falmouth in Cornwall, and on the Scottish river Clyde.
Off-shore, or ocean, racing is based on rating and measurement rules
drawn up by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, founded in 1925. Typical courses
are: Cowes to Jersey (Channel Islands), Plymouth to La Rochelle (Charente
Maritime, France) and Harwich to the Hook of Holland.
Many children in Britain learn to swim at school, or during holidays at the
seaside, and swimming as a summer pastime is enjoyed by millions of people.
The existence of indoor swimming baths makes all-the-year swimming
possible, and instruction and coaching is provided in some places by qualified
teachers who hold certificates for elementary or advanced teaching and coach¬
ing awarded by the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA). (The Scottish
counterpart is the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association.) The objects of
the ASA are to promote the art of swimming and encourage its teaching to
schoolchildren; to stimulate public opinion in favour of providing proper
accommodation and facilities for learning to swim; to promote the game of
water polo and the art of diving; and to draw up, publish and enforce uniform
laws for the control and regulation of amateur swimming and water polo
championships and competitions.
Racing is a term which, in Britain, is taken to mean, first and foremost,
horse-racing. Other forms of racing include greyhound racing, coursing,
pony-racing, trotting races, and pigeon flying.
The history of the English turf proper began with the formation of the
Jockey Club in 1750, although horse-racing was known in Tudor times and
even earlier. The Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee (founded
in 1866) now exercise control over all horse-racing in England and indirectly in
many other countries, and their rules are the basis of universal turf procedure.
There are two forms of racing: flat racing carried on from late March till
November under the authority of the Jockey Club; and steeple-chasing,
conducted under the rules of the National Hunt Committee.
SPORT
513
The classic flat races are: the Two Thousand Guineas for colts and fillies,
run on the Newmarket course, owned by the Jockey Club; the One Thousand
Guineas for fillies only, also run at Newmarket; the Derby for colts and
fillies, run at Epsom; the Oaks for fillies only, also run at Epsom; and the
St. Leger for colts and fillies, run at Doncaster. The Derby is the outstanding
event in the racing calendar; it takes place annually in early June and
the scene on Epsom Downs on Derby Day is one of the most colourful and
exciting of the sporting year. The most fashionable race-meeting of the flat
racing season is held on the course at Ascot in Berkshire, in mid-June and
is known as ‘Royal Ascot’, being traditionally attended by the Sovereign.
The best known steeple-chase is the Grand National, run annually since
1839 over the Aintree course near Liverpool. Most steeple-chase meetings
are held during the period September to May, one of the most important
being the National Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham early in March.
In England and Wales there is racing on 64 racecourses (excluding
point-to-point courses), at which there are about 820 days’ racing annually;
Scotland has seven racecourses, where racing takes place on an average of
50 days in the year. There are approximately 8,700 horses in training in
Great Britain, at an average cost of about £12 a week each.
Horse racecourses must be licensed by the Jockey Club or the National
Hunt Committee. On-course facilities for both cash and credit betting are
provided by bookmakers who must have personal permits, and by totalisators
operated by the Horserace Totalisator Board, which is empowered to deduct
from money staked with the totalisator such percentage as it may determine.
The practice is to deduct 15 per cent from the losing stakes in the win, place
and forecast pools and 10 per cent of the double and treble pools; this
provides an average yield of approximately 11 per cent of the total annual
turnover. Facilities for oflf-the-course betting are provided in licensed betting
offices, of which there are some 14,400 throughout Great Britain. People
under 18 years old are forbidden by law to place bets.
A levy from both bookmakers and the Horserace Totalisator Board is
collected by the Horserace Betting Levy Board, which distributes the revenue
for purposes conducive to the improvement of horse breeding and racing,
for the advancement and encouragement of veterinary science and education,
and the welfare of those employed in racing.
rreyhound Racing The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare started in Britain in 1926,
when the first modern greyhound track was opened at Belle Vue, Manchester.
There are now some 140 licensed tracks in operation, nearly all of which are
situated in or on the outskirts of large towns, and meetings are generally held
two or three times a week. The licensing authorities for greyhound racing
tracks are the county and county borough councils. Some fourteen million
people a year attend the tracks.
The main authority of the sport is the National Greyhound Racing Club,
founded in 1928; its functions include drawing up the rules of greyhound
racing and exercising strict discipline over all aspects of the sport. The
National Greyhound Racing Society—an association of 62 of the leading
tracks accepts the rules of the National Greyhound Racing Club and
controls the general policies of greyhound racing. Most of the classic grey¬
hound races, including the Derby at the White City, the Laurels at Wimbledon,
the St. Leger at Wembley, and the Cesarewitch at West Ham, take place in
the London area, although many other large centres have their ‘big’ nights.
There is a considerable volume of betting at greyhound race-meetings,
both with bookmakers and on the totalisator which may be operated by the
5I4

Boxing

occupier of any licensed greyhound track on the 104 ‘betting days’. Ten per
cent of the money staked on the totalisators must be paid to the Government;
up to 6 per cent may be deducted for operational expenses before successful
backers are paid. The ‘copyright’ in tote odds granted to the Horserace
Totalisator Board in respect of horse-racing also applies to the occupiers of
licensed greyhound tracks on which totalisators are operated.
Interest in the art of horsemanship continues to increase rapidly, and many
more people have learned to enjoy riding as a pastime since the end of the
second world war than at any time since the advent of the motor car. There
are some 1,200 riding schools in Britain, many of a high standard, and about
50 new schools are opened each year; membership of the British Horse
Society has risen to about 12,000; there are some 180 riding clubs with
varied membership; and the Pony Club (open to young people up to the
age of seventeen years) now has an overall membership of about 77,000
members. There are over 900 branches of the Pony Club throughout the world,
of which 250 are attached to hunts in Britain, and the remainder are overseas.
The British Horse Society, as the national equestrian federation of Great
Britain, is the authority on all matters relating to horses and ponies, including
breeding, training, riding, show jumping and dressage, and is responsible for
preparing equestrian teams for the Olympic Games and all international
events. The Society is also the parent body of the Pony Club and the riding
clubs, and organises and provides tests, lectures, demonstrations, courses and
examinations to promote horsemanship and horsemastership.
Horse trials of all kinds are held throughout Britain during the spring and
summer. The three-day trials held each year—in April at Badminton Park,
Gloucestershire, and in September at Burghley House, Lincolnshire are
among the outstanding equestrian events of the year. These trials include
dressage, cross-country riding, and show jumping; some 25 one-day trials
on similar lines are held annually.
Show jumping competitions are held each year at over 1,000 shows. The
main events take place during the Royal International Horse Show (held at
the White City, London, under the auspices of the British Horse Society
towards the end of July)—the outstanding contest being the individual
jumping championship for the King George V Gold Cup. Jumping competi¬
tions are also a feature of the Horse of the Year Show, which takes place in
October at Wembley and is acknowledged to be one of the finest indoor
horse shows in the world. The total membership of the British Show Jumping
Association has risen to over 6,000. The number of horses and ponies registered
is approximately 4,5°° and over ,£140,000 is distributed annually in prize
money.
The selection of British riders and horses taking part in international
competitions (whose successes have materially contributed to the increased
popularity of show jumping) is the responsibility of the executive committee
of the Association.
Boxing as an English sport probably originated in Saxon times. Its modern
form, and the one that has been adopted in many overseas countries, dates
from 1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules which
eliminated much of the brutality that had hitherto characterised prize fighting,
and made the basis of the sport a trial of strength and skill.
Nowadays, many boys learn to box at school and in boys’ clubs, and there
are various amateur boxing competitions carried out according to the rules

of the Amateur Boxing Association (ABA), which controls all amateur
boxing, including schoolboy boxing, club and association boxing, and boxing
in the three Services.
Professional boxing is covered by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in I929- The Board has strict medical regulations which provide
for the examination of boxers before each contest, and the appointment of
inspectors to ensure that the regulations are observed and that all contests
are vetted to safeguard against over-matching and exploitation.
. Championships at fixed weights have been the rule in boxing contests
since the presentation of the Championship Challenge Belts by the late
Lord Lonsdale in 1909. Competitions organised by the ABA are decided at
ten weights: flyweight, bantamweight, featherweight, lightweight, light welter¬
weight, welterweight, light middleweight, middleweight, light heavyweight
and heavyweight. In professional boxing there are no light welterweight or
light middleweight classes.
Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world. The style most commonly
used in Britain is the ‘free’ style, which evolved from the Catch-as-Catch-Can
or Lancashire style, but Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling is still
practised in the north of England and in Scotland, and Cornish style wrestling
(in which the contestants wear rough canvas jackets by which all the holds
must be taken) takes place in Cornwall. Wrestling in the free and Graeco-
Roman styles are used at the Olympic Games; in the Commonwealth Games
only free style is wrestled.
Amateur wrestling in Britain is governed by the British Amateur Wrestling
Association, which is affiliated to the International Amateur Wrestling
Federation, under the rules of which all wrestling is conducted. Professional
wrestling is usually in the ‘all-in’ or ‘free’ style, which is not the same as the
free style used in amateur wrestling. Judo, a Japanese form of wrestling, has
a large following, and is governed by the British Judo Association which has
coaching schemes assisted by the Department of Education and Science.
Fencing, as a sport, has made considerable progress throughout Britain during
the past 20 years. The Amateur Fencing Association (founded 1902) has some
450 clubs, and many classes are organised and financed by local authorities.
Fencing is also practised in many schools and among the annual championships
held under the auspices of the Association are the National Schoolboys’
Championships, organised on a regional basis and attracting a large number
of entrants.
Motor racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in Britain; more
racing and sports cars have been built in Britain than in any other country;
and British drivers (including women drivers) have an international reputation
second to none.
British cars and British drivers take part in the international rallies and
world classic races which are the main features of the sport. They include the
British classic races—the British Grand Prix and the Tourist Trophy for
sports cars. There are also British national race meetings and British national
rallies, as well as several thousand day and night rallies and trials, endurance
tests, hill climbs and other events, arranged by various driving clubs, of which
there are over 500 in Great Britain.
The best-known motor racing circuits are those at Goodwood, Sussex-
bilverstone, Northamptonshire; Crystal Palace, London; Brands Hatch,’
5l6
Cycling
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Kent; Snetterton, Norfolk; Mallory Park, Leicestershire; Oulton Park,
Cheshire; Aintree, near Liverpool; and Charterhall, Berwickshire, in
Scotland. The controlling body of motor racing in Britain is the Royal
Automobile Club (RAC), founded in 1897; the RAC is represented on the
Federation Internationale de 1’Automobile, which draws up the regulations
for international motor racing.
In addition to motor car racing, there are motor cycle races the most
important contest of the year is for the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy and
motor cycle speedway racing, introduced into Britain in 1928, and go\erne
by the Speedway Control Board. There is also go-kait racing.
The internationally recognised body for cycle racing in the United Kingdom
is the British Cycling Federation. It controls track and massed start road
racing in Britain, and is concerned with the cycling events in the Olympic
and Commonwealth Games and the annual world championship. Time trials
are organised by the Road Time Trials Council.
Touring by bicycle is also a popular pastime, and both the British Cycling
Federation and the Cyclists’ Touring Club (CTC) cater for this. The CTC
is the oldest touring club in the world and has a membership of some 25,000.
Its representatives in all parts of the United Kingdom give advice and practical
help to touring cyclists; its fifty district associations arrange holiday and week¬
end tours and competitions, rallies and rides of all kinds; and its travel
department gives CTC members every facility, both at home and abroad,
from the provision of itineraries to the supplying of tickets, maps and other
essential requirements.
Rifle Shooting
Full-bore (-303) rifle shooting is organised by the National Rifle Association
(NRA) founded in i860. The Imperial Meeting held annually at Bisley Camp,
Surrey,’ is open to subjects of the Queen, and, for certain competitions, to
all-comers. The meeting, which is attended by some 2,500 competitors from
Britain and other Commonwealth countries, including cadets from schools
lasts for just over a fortnight: the first week consists of team and individual
competitions for members of the armed forces, and there are three days for
schools only. The premier award of the meeting is the Queen s Prize which
attracts about 1,250 entries. The NRA also organises postal matches for
British and overseas teams, and periodically sends rifle teams to shoot in
overseas countries of the Commonwealth.
Small-bore (-22) rifle shooting—carried out either on indoor ranges of
1 c to 25 yards in length or on open ranges up to 200 yards—is also wide y
practised in Britain. Some 4,000 clubs throughout the country are affiliated to
county rifle associations and the National Small-Bore Rifle Association
(NSRA), which arranges inter-club and inter-county competitions o various
kinds for teams and individuals. The NSRA also organises a National Bisley
Meeting (usually attended by about 1,500 competitors), a Scottish meeting
(some 600 competitors), and a pistol shooting competition (some 400 competi¬
tors) at Bisley. International small-bore rifle matches are fired against teams
from overseas countries, and British teams are entered for the world champion¬
ships and the competitions in the Olympic Games.
Indoor Games Indoor games played in Britain include Mar*, '“ich fadlidi" are
which are enjoyed by large numbers of people, and for which facilities ar
provided in social clubs of every kind, including youth clubs; and game
such as real tennis (a game which originated in thirteenth-century France),
SPORT

squash rackets, rackets and fives, which are less national games than games of
the schools, universities and specialised clubs. Annual championships are
held m all these games the controlling bodies of which are: the Billiards
Association and Control Council; the Badminton Association of England and
the Scottish Badminton Union; the Tennis, Rackets and Fives Association
and the Squash Rackets Association. Basket-ball, an indoor variant of
netball which originated in the United States of America, is also played in
Britain, primarily by men. Matches in the game are included among the
lympic events. The controlling body in Britain is the Amateur Basket Ball
Association.

£2; nickel-brass threepenny pieces up to 2s.; and bronze (id. and Id.) up to 12d.
Bank of England notes are issued in denominations of 10s., £1, £5 and £10.
Scottish banks issue £1, £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100 notes which are generally
accepted in Scotland and in some other parts of the United Kingdom. Northern
Ireland banks issue £1, £5, £10, £50 and £100 notes.
Minimum postage rates for letters are: 4d. (inland) and 6d. (overseas). Details
of all postal rates are given in leaflets obtainable at any post office and are
summarised in the books of stamps sold there.
Persons coming to the United Kingdom may bring in notes in any currency,
travellers’ cheques, letters of credit, etc., without limit; and although visitors
leaving the United Kingdom may normally only take with them sterling notes
to the value of £25, they can make arrangments for up to £100 to be changed
into travellers’ cheques available in their own country. Currency can be ex¬
changed at banks and there are bureaux de change at all the main ports and at
London and Prestwick airports, the main London air terminals and Victoria
Station, London.
Regulations relating to exchange control in the United Kingdom are some¬
what complex and are subject to modification from time to time. Accordingly,
any person who is going to live in the United Kingdom or who desires informa¬
tion affecting his own particular circumstances is advised to consult his own
or a United Kingdom bank; banks in Britain are experienced in all aspects of
exchange control. ... . , i j
In general, persons visiting the country for a limited period are regarded as
non-resident; any sterling account which they open with a United Kingdom
bank will be designated an External Account and funds in it may be used
without formality to make payments anywhere in the world. Persons intending
to reside permanently in the United Kingdom are subject to the provisions of
the Exchange Control Act 1947, and will require permission to make payments
outside the Scheduled Territories.
The question of when a visitor to the United Kingdom who is not domiciled
there is chargeable for income tax as a ‘resident’ is complicated. The main
qualifications are:
1 A visitor is resident in the United Kingdom for any income tax year
(beginning 6th April) in which he is in the United Kingdom for a period or
periods equal, in the whole, to six months.
2 Even if a visitor does not stay six months in any one year he is regarded
as being resident if he visits the United Kingdom regularly for substantial
periods of time.
3. If a person maintains a place of abode in the United Kingdom available
for his use, he is regarded as resident for any year in which he pays a visit o
whatever length.

income arising in another country and taxed there, may be entitled to a reduction
of liability to United Kingdom income tax.
Information on specific questions relating to income tax may be obtained
from The Secretary, The Board of Inland Revenue, Somerset House, London,
W.C.2 (or, for residents in Great Britain, from local offices).
Information about travel to Britain can be obtained in the major cities of the
world from travel agents, airline, shipping line and railway offices, and British
Government offices abroad, or directly from the headquarters of the British
Travel Association (BTA), 64-65 St. James’s Street, London, S.W.l (Tele¬
phone: Mayfair 9191). The Association has overseas offices in Argentina
(Buenos Aires), Australia (Sydney), Belgium (Brussels), Canada (Toronto and
Vancouver), France (Paris), Germany (Frankfurt-am-Main), Italy (Rome),
the Netherlands (Amsterdam), Africa (Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban
and Salisbury), Sweden (Stockholm), the United States (Chicago, Los Angeles
and New \ork), Brazil (Sao Paulo) and New Zealand (Wellington). Information
available from the Association includes details of places of interest, lists of
exhibitions, fairs, festivals, concerts and special events of interest to overseas
visitors to Britain, with hours of opening, etc.; and advice on motoring and
touring itineraries. The Association publishes an annual guide, Hotels and
Restaurants in Britain, listing accommodation, services and charges, and
booklets giving particulars of youth hostels, holiday camps, and camping and
caravan sites.
For information about the principal events of the day in London, visitors
may use the Teletourist Service (operated by the General Post Office in con¬
junction with the BTA and the BBC). The information can be obtained in
four languages by dialling the following telephone numbers: ASK 9211
(English), ASK 9311 (French), ASK 9411 (German), and ASK 9511 (Spanish).
If using a call box, the caller should refer to the instructions notice. The weather
forecast for the London area is also given in the French, German, and Spanish
services; in English it can be obtained by calling WE A 2211. The London
Tourist Information Centre, 64-65 St. James’s Street, London, S.W.l (and
with information centres at Victoria Station and the West London Air Terminal)
gives publicity to London’s attractions for the holiday and business visitor.
Demand for hotel space in London is heavy, especially in the summer; the
London Hotels Information Service, 88 Brook Street, London, W.l (Mayfair
5414), gives information free of charge to overseas visitors as to where accom¬
modation is available.
Additional information on travel in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
is obtainable from: the Wales Tourist and Holidays Association, 7 Park Place,
Cardiff; the Scottish Tourist Board, 2 Rutland Place, West End, Edinburgh, 1;
the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, 10 Royal Avenue, Belfast, and 13 Lower
Regent Street, London, S.W.l.
As a general rule travellers entering the United Kingdom must have a valid
passport and a visa issued by British consular authorities abroad, but visas are
not required for citizens of the following countries: all countries of the British
Commonwealth, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
German Federal Republic, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Liechtenstein,
Luxembourg, Monaco, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, San Marino,
Republic of South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey,
the United States of America, and all countries in Central and South America.
Citizens of the Republic of Ireland do not require either passport or visa (but,
with residents of Commonwealth countries, are subject to immigration control
if seeking employment in Britain: see p. 458).
Nationals of the following countries who wish to visit the United Kingdom
for social or holiday visits of up to three months may use instead of a passport
their national identity card (in the Netherlands a ‘toeristenkaart’, obtainable

from town halls) in conjunction with a special Visitor’s Card (obtainable from
travel agents in the tourist’s own country): Belgium, France, Germany (Federal
Republic and West Berlin), Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands,
and Switzerland. A passport must, however, still be used where the purpose of
the visit is other than touristic, or where a stay of longer than three months is
intended.
Foreign visitors who are sixteen years of age or over must register with the
police three months after their arrival.
The personal baggage of persons entering the United Kingdom is subject to
Customs examination. Many articles are liable to customs duty and a number
to purchase tax. Failure to make a complete declaration may result in
penalties; but, although there is no legal entitlement to them, certain concessions
are given to travellers who properly declare their belongings.
Used personal effects, including tools of trade and articles of professional
use, which have been in the ownership and use of a traveller for a considerable
period and are not intended for other persons or for sale, may be admitted free
of duty and purchase tax, as may also used furniture and domestic articles
belonging to persons transferring residence to the United Kingdom. Small
quantities of dutiable goods, including tobacco, wine and spirits, and perfume,
carried by travellers for their personal use are allowed to pass free of duty
within fixed limits.
Inquiries on importing personal and household effects should be addressed
to the Secretary, H.M. Customs and Excise, King’s Beam House, London, E.C.3.
There are purchase tax concessions for overseas visitors shopping in Britain.
Many of the principal stores are able to send goods to an address abroad free
of purchase tax; and under the Personal Export scheme, if the tax-free value
of goods bought at one time is £5 or more, a visitor may have them delivered
free of tax to the seaport or airport by which he is leaving the country.
All cats and dogs brought into the United Kingdom have to undergo six
months’ quarantine; and the landing of the animals must be authorised by a
licence issued by the appropriate Agricultural Department for England and
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (see Chapter 12). The department will
provide a list of approved carrying agents and quarantine kennels. An annual
licence (costing 7s. 6d. and obtainable at any post office) is needed for a house¬
hold dog aged 6 months or more.
The import of birds of the parrot family, if they are personal pets, is allowed
under licence, subject to certain conditions, by the Agricultural Departments.
Imports of live poultry are permitted only from certain countries.
Regulations concerning the temporary import of motor vehicles by visitors to
Britain are best obtained from the national motoring organisations in the visitor’s
country of residence. If a visitor is given a Temporary Importation Permit by
the customs officer at the port of entry, exemption from the need to pay vehicle
excise licence duty will be granted for the same period as stated on the permit
(maximum, 365 days). Insurance against third party risks is compulsory; a
visitor must produce evidence in the form of either an International Motor
Insurance Card {green card) or a certificate of insurance issued by a British
insurer.
A visitor holding a current International Driving Permit or a current domestic
driving licence for his own country is entitled to drive without obtaining a
British driving licence during the currency of his own permit or licence, subject
to a maximum of 12 months. Any person taking up permanent residence must
take a driving test to secure a British licence which costs 15s. and is valid for
three years.
The rule of the road is to keep LEFT. Road signs are illustrated and explained
in The Highzvay Code (published by H.M. Stationery Office).

Eligibility for the main social security benefits is dependent on (a) sufficient
National Insurance contributions having been paid under the United Kingdom
schemes or (b) the existence of a reciprocal agreement between the United
Kingdom and the previous country of residence of the claimant (see p. 132).
Information on specific points may be obtained from the Ministry of Pensions
and National Insurance, 10 John Adam Street, London, W.C.2.
To qualify for family allowances, a residence qualification must be fulfilled,
varying in length according to the nationality and previous country of residence
of the applicant.
The services provided under the National Health Service are available to
everyone in Britain without regard to residence, nationality or insurance qualifica¬
tion. Immigration authorities have been instructed, however, to refuse admission
to the country to any person coming solely for the purpose of securing free
treatment under the Health Service.
Persons from countries other than members of the British Commonwealth and
the Irish Republic are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment
with a particular employer only if they have a permit issued by the Ministry of
Labour (see p. 457). Until 1st July, 1962, citizens of the Commonwealth and of
the Irish Republic had free entry into the United Kingdom, but since that date
they have been subject to control under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act
1962 (see p. 458), and must obtain an employment voucher issued by the
Ministry of Labour before entering Britain for full-time employment.
Visitors of foreign nationality wishing to set up in any business or profession
in Britain must ask for permission from the Under-Secretary of State, Home
Office, Aliens Department, Princeton House, 271 High Holborn, London
W.C.l.
BRITISH WEIGHTS AND MEASURES AND THEIR METRIC
EQUIVALENTS
The Government announced in May 1965 that it was encouraging the adoption
of the metric system of weights and measures and by 1975 the greater part of
British industry should have effected the change. No decision has yet been
reached on the recommendations of the Halsbury Committee (appointed in
1963) on a decimal currency.

monthly periodicals on sport are also published. In addition, some newspapers
issue annual surveys of sport.
INDEX
55i
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter rather than
under Association of, British, National, Royal, etc. (i.e. Accidents, Royal Society for
the Prevention of; Anglers, National Federation of). In cases where the first word is not
separable, however (e.g., Royal Air Force, Royal Society) entries will be found
appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only where
they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed under the
relevant subject headings.
