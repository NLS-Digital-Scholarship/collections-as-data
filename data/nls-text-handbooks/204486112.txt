Foreword
Britain 1996 is the 47th in the series of
annual Handbooks prepared by the Central
Office of Information (COI). Drawing on a
wide range of official and other authoritative
sources, it provides a factual and up-to-date
overview of government policy and other
recent developments in Britain.
Handbook is widely recognised as an
established work of reference, not only in
Britain itself, but also overseas, where it is an
important element of the information service
provided by British diplomatic posts. It is
sold by HMSO and its agents throughout
the world.
Features
The text has, of course, been fully updated
and revised. There are more pages and more
charts, tables and graphs.
To mark COI’s fiftieth anniversary, we
have included a selection of COI pictures
highlighting people, places and events over
the past five decades.
And, in response to many requests, we
have provided a calendar of events for 1996,
featuring not only famous fixtures like
Wimbledon and Trooping the Colour, but
also many smaller, traditional local events
that are not so well known.
Coverage
Every effort is made to ensure that the
information given in Handbook is accurate at
the time of going to press. The text,
generally, is based on information available
up to September 1995.
As far as possible, Handbook presents
information that applies to Britain as a whole.
However, this is not always possible. Care
should be taken when using Handbook to
note whether the information given refers to:
• Britain, formally the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland;
• Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland;
• England and Wales, which are grouped
together for many administrative and
other purposes; or, in some instances,
• England alone.
Aspects of Britain
COI also produces the Aspects of Britain
series of paperbacks, which cover in depth
Britain’s political, economic and social
structure, and its place in the international
community. Appropriate titles are given in
the list of further reading at the end of most
chapters. For further information please
write to COI Publishing Services or phone
0171 261 8310.
Acknowledgments
Britain 1996 has been compiled with the
co-operation of around 250 organisations,
including other government departments and
agencies. The editor would like to thank all
those whose careful comments have
contributed once more to Handbook's high
standards of accuracy.

Britain and

Introduction
Britain comprises Great Britain (England,
Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland,
and is one of the member states of the
European Union (EU). Its full name is the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
Physical Features
Britain constitutes the greater part of the
British Isles. The largest of the islands is
Great Britain. The next largest comprises
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
Western Scotland is fringed by the large
island chain known as the Hebrides and to
the north east of the Scottish mainland are
the Orkney and Shetland Islands. All these
have administrative ties with the mainland,
but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the
Channel Islands between Great Britain and
France are largely self-governing, and are not
part of the United Kingdom.
With an area of about 242,000 sq km
(93,000 sq miles), Britain is just under
1,000 km (about 600 miles) from the south
coast to the extreme north of Scotland and
just under 500 km (around 300 miles) across
in the widest part.
The climate is generally mild and
temperate. Prevailing winds are south¬
westerly and the weather from day to day is
mainly influenced by depressions moving
eastwards across the Atlantic. The weather is
subject to frequent changes. In general,
there are few extremes of temperature; it
rarely rises above 32°C (90°F) or falls below
-10°C (14°F).
Average annual rainfall is more than
1,600 mm (over 60 inches) in the
mountainous areas of the west and north but
less than 800 mm (30 inches) over central
and eastern parts. Rain is fairly well
distributed throughout the year, but, on
average, March to June are the driest months
and September to January the wettest.
During May, June and July (the months of
longest daylight) the mean daily duration of
sunshine varies from five hours in northern
Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of Wight;
during the months of shortest daylight
(November, December and January) sunshine
is at a minimum, with an average of an hour
a day in northern Scotland and two hours a
day on the south coast of England.
Geographical Facts
• Highest mountain: Ben Nevis, in the
highlands of Scotland, at 1,343 m
(4,406 ft)
• Longest river: the Severn, 354 km (220
miles) long, which rises in central
Wales and flows through Shrewsbury,
Worcester and Gloucester in England
to the Bristol Channel
• Largest lake: Lough Neagh, Northern
Ireland, at 396 sq km (153 sq miles)
• Highest waterfall: Eas a’Chual Aluinn,
from Glas Bheinn, in the highlands of
Scotland, with a drop of 200 m (660 ft)
• Deepest cave: Ogof Ffynnon Ddu,
Wales, at 308 m (1,010 ft) deep
• Most northerly point on the British
mainland: Dunnet Head, north-east
Scotland
• Most southerly point on the British
mainland: Lizard Point, Cornwall
Historical Outline
The name ‘Britain’ derives from Greek and
Latin names probably stemming from a
Celtic original. Although in the prehistoric
timescale the Celts were relatively late

INTRODUCTION
arrivals in the British Isles, only with them
does Britain emerge into recorded history.
The term ‘Celtic’ is often used rather
generally to distinguish the early inhabitants
of the British Isles from the later Anglo-
Saxon invaders.
After two expeditions by Julius Caesar in
55 and 54 BC, contact between Britain and
the Roman world grew, culminating in the
Roman invasion of AD 43. Roman rule was
gradually extended from south-east England
to include Wales and, for a time, the
lowlands of Scotland. The final Roman
withdrawal in 409 followed a period of
increasing disorder during which the island
began to be raided by Angles, Saxons and
Jutes from northern Europe. It is from the
Angles that the name ‘England’ derives. The
raids turned into settlement and a number of
small English kingdoms were established. The
Britons maintained an independent existence
in the areas now known as Wales and
Cornwall. Among these kingdoms more
powerful ones emerged, claiming overlordship
over the whole country, first in the north
(Northumbria), then in the midlands (Mercia)
and finally in the south (Wessex). However,
further raids and settlement by the Vikings
from Scandinavia occurred, although in the
10th century the Wessex dynasty defeated
the invading Danes and established a
wide-ranging authority in England.
Dates of some of the main events in
Britain’s history are given on p. 4. The
early histories of England, Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland are included in
Chapters 2 to 5, which also deal with the
main aspects of their social, economic and
political life. Additional material is included
on the political situation in Northern
Ireland. Table 1.1 gives a selection of
some of the main statistics for each of the
four lands.
Wildlife
Britain is home to a great variety of
wildlife, with an estimated 30,000 animal
species, as well as marine, microscopic and
less well-known groups, about 2,800 species
of ‘higher’ plants, and many thousands of
mosses, fungi and algae.

INTRODUCTION
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
Although the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man are not part of the United
Kingdom, they have a special relationship
with it. The Channel Islands were part of
the Duchy of Normandy in the 10th and
11th centuries and remained subject to the
English Crown after the loss of Normandy
to the French. The Isle of Man was under
the nominal sovereignty of Norway until
1266, and eventually came under the direct
administration of the British Crown in 1765.
Today the territories have their own
legislative assemblies and systems of law.
The British Government is responsible for
their international relations and external
defence.

The Economy 10
England is predominantly a lowland country, although there are upland
regions in the north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian mountains and the
Yorkshire moorlands) and in the south west, in Cornwall, Devon and
Somerset. The greatest concentrations of population (see Table 2.1) are in
London and the South East, the West Yorkshire and north-west industrial
cities, the Midlands conurbation around Birmingham, the north-east
conurbations on the rivers Tyne and Tees, and along the Channel coast.
Early History
In 1066 the last successful invasion of
England took place. Duke William of
Normandy defeated the English at the Battle
of Hastings. Normans and others from
France came to settle. French became the
language of the nobility for the next three
centuries, and the legal and social structures
were influenced by those prevailing across
the Channel.
With the final loss of the English Crown’s
possessions in France during the late Middle
Ages, and the union of England and Scotland
in 1707, England’s position as the most
populous part of the British nation state was
established.
Government
England has no government minister or
department exclusively responsible for its
central administration, in contrast to Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. Instead, there
are a number of government departments,
whose responsibilities in some cases also
cover aspects of affairs in Wales and Scotland
(see Appendices).
There are currently 524 English
parliamentary constituencies represented in
the House of Commons. The changes
approved following the recent boundary
review (see p. 72) will increase this to 529
after the next general election. In September
1995 England had 314 Conservative Members
of Parliament, 195 Labour, 14 Liberal
Democrat and the Speaker of the House of
Commons. Conservative support tends to be
strongest in suburban and rural areas, and the
Conservatives have a large majority of the
parliamentary seats in the southern half of
England and in East Anglia. The Labour
Party derives its main support from urban
industrialised areas. Liberal Democrat
support in England is particularly strong in
the South West, where the party holds seven
of its 14 English seats.
Local government is mainly administered
through a two-tier system of counties

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(see map, p. 4) subdivided into districts.
However, there are some single-tier authorities.
The structure of local government in England
is being reformed following its review by the
Local Government Commission (see p. 72).
The English legal system comprises on the
one hand a historic body of conventions
known as ‘common law’ and ‘equity’, and, on
the other, parliamentary and European
Community (EC) legislation. In the
formulation of common law since the
Norman Conquest, great reliance has been
placed on precedent. Equity law derives
from the practice of petitioning the King’s
Chancellor in cases not covered by
common law.
The Church of England, which was
separated from the Roman Catholic Church
at the time of the Reformation, is the
Established Church; the Sovereign must
always be a member of the Church and
appoints its two archbishops and 42 other
diocesan bishops.
The Economy
Considerable changes in the economy of
England have occurred during the 20th
century. In the second half of the century,
jobs in service industries have grown and now
account for 74 per cent of employees in
employment, with expansion having been
particularly noticeable in financial and
business services. Services account for three-
quarters of gross domestic product (GDP) in
London and the South East, and over a fifth
of employees in Greater London work in
financial services. London is one of the
world’s leading centres of banking, insurance
and other financial services.
Manufacturing, although declining as a
proportion of the employment base, remains
important in a number of areas. In terms of
GDP, it is most significant in the West
Midlands (where manufacturing accounted
for 30 per cent of the region’s GDP in 1992)
and the North. The region with the highest
proportion of employment in manufacturing
is the East Midlands, followed by the West
Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside and the
North. East Anglia has been the fastest-
growing English region in terms of both
population and employment since the 1960s,
although in the recession of the early 1990s
the unemployment rate rose faster there than
in most other regions. Once largely
agricultural, high-technology industry has in
recent years developed in the region.
In agriculture, dairying is most common in
the west of England; sheep and cattle are
reared in the hilly and moorland areas of the
North and South West. Arable farming, pig
and poultry farming and horticulture are
concentrated in the east and south.
Tourism and leisure now form one of
England’s biggest industries, worth over
£36,000 million in 1994 and contributing
5 per cent of gross domestic product.
Tourism and leisure also provide about
1.5 million jobs.

Transport
The motorway network comprises four
long-distance routes linking London and the
cities of the Midlands, the North and North
West, and the South West; the London
orbital route (M25); and over 30 shorter
motorways. In all, there are about 3,200 km
(2,000 miles) of motorway in England, plus
about 14,400 km (9,000 miles) of other
trunk roads.
On the railways a major development was
the official opening in May 1994 of the
Channel Tunnel, which links Britain with the
European rail system.
Cultural and Social Affairs
London has a wealth of cultural centres,
including four major art galleries and many
renowned museums, together with theatres,
ballet and opera houses and concert halls.
Other major cities and towns also have a broad
range of cultural interests. Many theatres
outside London are used for touring by the
national theatre, dance and opera companies.
Further large arts projects are likely to benefit
from the proceeds of the National Lottery.
Numerous regions and towns have associations
with great English writers and artists, such as
William Shakespeare (Stratford-upon-Avon),
William Wordsworth (Lake District), Arnold
Bennett (Stoke-on-Trent), the Bronte sisters
(Yorkshire), Thomas Hardy (Dorset) and John
Constable (Essex and Suffolk).
Despite the relatively high population
density and degree of urbanisation, there are
still many unspoilt rural and coastal
areas.There are seven National Parks, six
forest parks, 36 designated ‘areas of
outstanding natural beauty’, 22
environmentally sensitive areas, almost
200 country parks approved by the
Countryside Commission, 800 km (500 miles)
of designated heritage coastline, and about
2,000 historic buildings and some 3,600
gardens open to the public. Safari, wildlife
and theme parks all offer family activities
and entertainment.

About half of the 1.6 million people in Northern Ireland are settled in the
eastern coastal region, the centre of which is the capital, Belfast. Most
industry is situated in this eastern part of the province. Northern Ireland is
at its nearest point only 21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It has a 488-km
(303-mile) border with the Irish Republic.
According to the 1991 Census, 50.6 per cent
of the people regarded themselves as
Protestants and 38.4 per cent as Roman
Catholics. Most of the Protestants are
descendants of Scots or English settlers who
crossed to north-eastern Ireland; they are
British by culture and tradition and
committed to remaining part of the United
Kingdom. The Roman Catholic population is
mainly Irish by culture and history, and the
majority of them favour a united Ireland.
History
During the tenth century Ireland was
dominated by the Vikings. In 1169 Henry II
of England launched an invasion of Ireland
since he had been granted its overlordship by
the English Pope Adrian IV, who was
anxious to bring the Irish Church into full
obedience to Rome. Although a large part of
the country came under the control of
Anglo-Norman magnates, little direct
authority was exercised from England during
the Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much
greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
During the reign of Elizabeth I, a series of
campaigns was waged against Irish
insurgents. The main focus of resistance was
the northern province of Ulster. After the
collapse of this resistance in 1607 and the
flight of its leaders, Ulster was settled by
immigrants from Scotland and England.
The English civil wars (1642-51) led to
further risings in Ireland which were crushed
by Oliver Cromwell. More fighting took place
after the overthrow of James II, a Roman
Catholic, in 1688. In 1690 during the Battle
of the Boyne the forces of James II were
defeated by those of the Protestant William
of Orange, who became the British King.
Throughout most of the 18th century
there was an uneasy peace. In 1782 the Irish
Parliament (dating from medieval times) was
given legislative independence; the only
constitutional tie with Great Britain was the
crown. The Parliament, however, represented
only the privileged Anglo-Irish minority, and
Roman Catholics were excluded from it. An
abortive rebellion led by Wolfe Tone’s
United Irishmen movement took place in
1798, and in 1801 Ireland was unified with
Great Britain, its separate Parliament being
abolished. Ireland was henceforth represented
in the British Parliament in London.
The Irish question was one of the major
issues of British politics during the 19th
century and after. In 1886 the Liberal
Government introduced a Home Rule Bill
designed to give an Irish Parliament devolved
authority over most internal matters while
12
NORTHERN IRELAND
reserving control over foreign policy to
Britain. This led to a split in the Liberal
Party and the failure of the Bill. In 1893 a
second Home Rule Bill was approved by the
House of Commons but rejected by the
House of Lords.
The issue returned to the political agenda
in 1910 because Asquith’s Liberal
administration was dependent on support
from the pro-home rule Irish Parliamentary
Party. The controversy intensified as
unionists and nationalists in Ireland formed
private armies. In 1914 home rule was
approved in the Government of Ireland Act.
Implementation, however, was delayed by the
outbreak of the First World War.
A nationalist rising in Dublin in 1916 was
suppressed and its leaders executed. Two
years later the nationalist Sinn Fein party won
a large majority of the Irish seats in elections
to the Westminster Parliament. Its members
refused to attend the House of Commons
and, instead, formed the Bail Eireann in
Dublin. A nationalist guerrilla force called the
Irish Republican Army began operations
against the British administration in 1919.
The 1920 Government of Ireland Act
provided for the establishment of two home
rule parliaments, one in Dublin and the other
in Belfast. The Act was implemented in 1921
in Northern Ireland, comprising six of the
nine counties of the province of Ulster; in
addition, Northern Ireland was represented
in, and subject to, the supreme authority of
the British Parliament.
In the South the guerillas continued to
fight for independence. A truce was agreed in
June 1921, followed by negotiations between
the British Government and Sinn Fein.
These concluded with the December 1921
Treaty establishing the Irish Free State,
which became a republic in 1949.
From its creation in 1921, Northern
Ireland’s Parliament had a consistent unionist
majority from which government ministers
were drawn. The nationalist minority
resented this persistent domination and their
effective exclusion from political office and
influence. Although an active and articulate
civil rights movement emerged during the
1960s, reforms made in response were unable
to forestall the development of serious
sectarian rioting. This led to the introduction
in 1969 of British Army support for the
police. These sectarian divisions were
subsequently exploited by terrorists from both
sides, most notably by the Provisional Irish
Republican Army (IRA), which claimed to be
protecting the Roman Catholic minority.
Because of increased terrorism and inter-
communal violence, the British Government
took over responsibility for law and order in
1972. The Northern Ireland unionist
Government resigned in protest at this
decision, and direct rule from London began.
Government
Under the system of direct rule, the British
Parliament approves all laws, and Northern
Ireland’s government departments are
controlled by the Secretary of State — a
Cabinet minister — and his ministerial team.
Seventeen members are elected to the
House of Commons. In the most recent
general election in April 1992 the Ulster
Unionists won 9 seats, the Democratic
Unionists 3, the Ulster Popular Unionists 1
and the nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour Party (SDLP) 4. The Alliance Party,
offering an alternative to unionists and
nationalists, did not obtain a seat. Sinn Fein
also fought the election but lost its only seat
to the SDLP.
Northern Ireland elects three members of
the European Parliament.
Efforts to Achieve Devolved Government
Throughout the period of direct rule,
successive British governments have favoured
a devolved administration widely acceptable
to both unionist and nationalist political
traditions. In 1974 a unionist-nationalist
coalition Executive was formed but collapsed
after a short period as a result of a protest
strike by those unionists opposed to power
sharing. In 1982 an Assembly was elected by
proportional representation but was
dissolved four years later because no
agreement could be reached between the
parties on a devolved administration.
Following another government initiative,
the four main constitutional parties (Ulster
13
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANL BOOK
Unionists, Democratic Unionists, Alliance
Party and SDLP) held a series of talks in
1991 and 1992 to see whether they could
reach an agreement taking into account three
sets of relationships relevant to the
Northern Ireland problem—those within
Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland
and between the British and Irish
governments. The talks ended in November
1992 without agreement.
Since then, the British Government has
been engaged in a series of bilateral talks with
the Northern Irish parties in order to explore
the basis on which they might come together
for further dialogue. Intensive discussions
were also held with the Irish Government.
The aim of all these discussions was to
produce a settlement attracting widespread
agreement among the two political traditions
in the North.
Relations with the Irish Republic
The British and Irish governments have
worked closely together in order to bring
peace to Northern Ireland. The 1985 Anglo-
Irish Agreement created an Intergovernmental
Conference, in which both governments
discuss issues such as improved cross-border
co-operation and security. The Irish
Government can put forward views and
proposals on matters related to Northern
Ireland provided that these are not the
responsibility of a devolved administration in
Belfast. Each government retains full
sovereign responsibility for decisions and
administration within its own jurisdiction.
The Downing Street Declaration
Signed in December 1993 by the British and
Irish governments, the Downing Street
Declaration is a statement of fundamental
principles which made clear that the consent
of a majority of people in Northern Ireland
would be required before any constitutional
change could come about. On this basis the
British Government reiterated that it had no
selfish strategic or economic interest in
Northern Ireland and that, were a majority in
Northern Ireland to wish it, the Government
would introduce legislation to bring about a
united Ireland. The Irish Government
accepted that it would be wrong to attempt
to impose a united Ireland without the freely
given consent of the majority of people in
Northern Ireland.
Paramilitary Ceasefires
In August 1994 the IRA announced a
complete cessation of its military operations.
This was followed in October by a similar
cessation by the loyalist paramilitary
organisations. In December 1994 British
officials started a separate exploratory
dialogue with Sinn Fein and with the
Progressive Unionist and Ulster Democratic
parties in order to explore the basis on which
they could be admitted to the talks process.
In 1995 British ministers joined this dialogue,
stressing the need for the decommissioning of
illegally held arms before these parties could
take part in wider political talks.
Joint Framework Document
In February 1995 the British and Irish
governments published their Joint Framework
Document, reaffirming the need for self-
determination in the North, the employment
of democratic and exclusively peaceful means
in the search for a settlement, and protection
for the rights of the unionist and nationalist
political traditions. The British Government
undertook to propose changes to its
constitutional legislation in order to
incorporate its continuing willingness to
accept the will of a majority of the people in
Northern Ireland and to exercise its
jurisdiction there with rigorous impartiality.
The Irish Government stated that it would
introduce and support proposals for changes
in the Irish constitution so that no territorial
claim over Northern Ireland contrary to the
will of a majority of its people is asserted; it
also recognised the legitimacy of any choice
freely exercised by the people of Northern
Ireland regarding their constitutional status.
The Document also proposed a new
North-South body comprising elected
representatives from, and accountable to, a
new elected Northern Ireland Assembly (see
below) and the Irish Parliament, which would
14
NORTHERN IRELAND
deal with matters designated by the two
governments in agreement with the parties;
all decisions within this body would be by
agreement between the two sides. It
envisages, for example, that the new body
should have an important role, in
consultation with the two governments, in
developing an agreed approach for the whole
of Ireland regarding the challenges and
opportunities of the European Union.
Both governments also envisage the creation
of a parliamentary forum, with representatives
from new political institutions in Northern
Ireland and from the Irish Parliament to
consider matters of mutual interest.
These proposals do not provide for joint
authority by the two governments over
Northern Ireland.
Accountable Government in Northern Ireland
Alongside the British-Trish Framework
Document, the British Government set out
its own proposals providing for:
• a single-chamber Northern Ireland
Assembly of about 90 members elected
by proportional representation for a fixed
term, with legislative and executive
responsibilities;
• a system of Assembly committees,
constituted broadly in proportion to party
strengths in the Assembly; and
• a system of detailed checks and balances
intended to sustain the confidence in the
new institutions by both parts of the
community in Northern Ireland.
These proposals closely reflect discussions
with the four main parties in the 1992 talks
process and subsequently. The British
Government has pointed out that any
settlement will have to be approved by
Parliament and by the people of Northern
Ireland in a referendum.
Human Rights
Economic and social deprivation exist on both
sides of the Northern Ireland community.
However, on all major social and economic
indicators, Roman Catholics generally
experience higher levels of disadvantage than
Protestants. These different experiences lead
to feelings of discrimination and alienation,
which in turn influence attitudes to political
and security issues. Government guidelines
aim to promote fair treatment by ensuring
that policies and programmes do not
discriminate unjustifiably against particular
sections of the community—for example,
people of different religious beliefs or
political opinions, women, disabled people,
ethnic minorities and people of different
sexual orientation. The Standing Advisory
Commission for Human Rights advises the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on
the effectiveness of anti-discrimination laws
and measures.
The aim is to encourage a more
pluralistic and tolerant society with equal
esteem for unionist and nationalist
traditions. Through the Community
Relations Council, the Government helps
finance organisations promoting
cross-community contact and reconciliation.
In addition, it provides grant aid to local
government programmes designed to
encourage mutual understanding and
appreciation of cultural diversity. Support is
also given to the Cultural Traditions
Programme, which aims to show that different
cultures do not have to lead to division.
Direct or indirect discrimination in
employment on grounds of religious belief or
political opinion is unlawful. Legislation
requires all public authorities and all those
private employers with more than ten
employees to register with the Fair
Employment Commission; it also provides for
compulsory monitoring of the religious
composition of workforces, review of
recruitment, training and promotion
procedures and affirmative action if fair
employment is not provided. There are
criminal penalties and economic sanctions for
defaulting employers, and the Fair
Employment Tribunal deals with individual
complaints about discrimination.
An independent Chief Electoral Officer
maintains the accuracy of the electoral
register, while electoral boundaries for
parliamentary constituencies are determined
by impartial statutory procedures conducted
by the Boundary Commission for Northern
15
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ireland. The Northern Ireland Ombudsman
and Commissioner for Complaints deal with
complaints against government departments
and local authorities. An independent
commission supervises police investigations
into the more serious complaints against
police officers and, at its discretion, the
investigation of other matters (see p. 85).
Security Policy
In order to protect the public, the Northern
Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1991 gives
the authorities exceptional powers to deal with
and prevent terrorist activities. These powers
include special powers of arrest for those
suspected of certain serious terrorist offences,
non-jury courts to try terrorist offences (see
p. 91) and the banning of terrorist
organisations. The legislation is subject to
annual independent review and to annual
approval by Parliament. Although ceasefires
have been implemented by republican and
loyalist paramilitary organisations, the
legislation remains in force, pending a political
settlement. The 1991 Act reaches the end of
its life in August 1996. The Government
hopes that, once a lasting peace is established,
there will be no need for these exceptional
powers and is keeping the requirement for
such powers under continuing review.
An independent Commissioner observes
and reports on the conditions under which
terrorist suspects are detained by the security
forces in police offices known as holding
centres. The Commissioner submits an
annual report to the Secretary of State which
is published.
Statutory codes of practice have been
published relating to the detention,
treatment, questioning and identification of
suspects. Any breach of the codes by a police
officer is a disciplinary offence.
The Economy
Trends in output and employment tend to
reflect overall trends in Britain. However,
unemployment (11.6 per cent in August 1995)
is higher because a relatively high birth rate
leads to a higher natural rate of population
increase than in any other region in Britain.
Some 74 per cent of employees work in
service industries and 18 per cent in
manufacturing. The largest industrial employer
is Short Brothers, owned by the Canadian
company Bombardier, with some 6,600
employees engaged on the manufacture of
aircraft and their components, guided missiles
and related products and services. Another
large undertaking is the shipbuilders Harland
and Wolff, with 1,175 employees. Two-thirds
of output from companies in Northern Ireland
is exported—50 per cent to Great Britain, 35
per cent to other European Union countries
and 15 per cent to the rest of the world.
Agriculture accounts for 4 per cent of gross
domestic product or 7 per cent if ancillary
industries are included. Some 10.5 per cent of
the workforce is employed in agriculture,
forestry, fishing and ancillary industries.
Tourism is promoted throughout the world
by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and
generates about 11,000 jobs. Over 1.29 million
people visited Northern Ireland in 1994 and it
hopes to attract 1.5 million in 1995.
Overseas and other companies are
important investors. Northern Ireland
attracted 9 per cent of all new investment
jobs in Britain in 1993—94 even though it
accounted for only 2.8 per cent of the British
population. Nearly 200 externally owned
companies employ almost 44,500 people
nearly half the manufacturing labour force.
Many overseas companies use the region as a
base for operations in the ever-increasing
European market.
The Industrial Development Board
encourages industrial development and new
international investment. In 1994-95, 6,000
new jobs were created by new and established
companies. The Local Enterprise
Development Unit assists the establishment
and growth of small businesses as well as 36
local enterprise agencies run by people with
business skills and expertise. The Training
and Employment Agency is responsible for
training the workforce. The Industrial
Research and Technology Unit manages
programmes aimed at increasing the quality
and level of innovation and research.
Considerable public expenditure has been
devoted to improving conditions in urban and
rural areas. The percentage of unfit houses in
16
NORTHERN IRELAND
Belfast has been reduced from 25 per cent to
8 per cent in the last 16 years or so. Other
government schemes include the £89 million
cross-harbour rail and road bridges, which
have transformed Belfast’s infrastructure. The
telecommunications firm BT is investing £30
million in its new Laganbank headquarters,
and another important Laganside
development is the Belfast City Council’s
new concert hall and conference centre. More
than 200 economic, social and environmental
projects in the city’s disadvantaged areas have
been supported in a bid to improve
education, training for adults, and job-finding
services for unemployed people.
In Londonderry major private and public
sector developments recently completed or
under way include a new £65 million
shopping centre and car park development in
the city centre, construction of a new
terminal building and access roads at the City
of Derry Airport, the relocation of the port of
Londonderry downstream on the River Foyle
and the construction of a new science and
technology park.
Northern Ireland has parity with England,
Scotland and Wales on taxation and services.
The British Government makes a contribution
of nearly £3,500 million a year to maintain
social services at the level of those in Great
Britain, to meet the cost of security measures
and to compensate for the natural disadvantages
of geography and lack of resources.
In 1986 the British and Irish governments
established the International Fund for
Ireland. Some three-quarters of its resources
is spent in Northern Ireland, the rest going
to border areas in the Irish Republic.
Programmes cover business enterprise,
tourism, community relations, urban
development, agriculture and rural
development. Donors include the United
States, the European Union, Canada and
New Zealand.
Cultural and Social Affairs
Northern Ireland’s cultural heritage is
preserved and portrayed by the Ulster
Museum in Belfast, the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum in County Down and a
number of smaller museums. The Ulster-
American Folk Park in Omagh specialises in
the history of Irish emigration to America; it
has an extensive database on emigrants which
is available for use by the public.
Local arts festivals are an important feature
of the arts calendar, the highlight being the
Belfast festival based at Queen’s University.
The Ulster Orchestra has a notable reputation.
Government support for the arts is channelled
through the Arts Council of Northern Ireland,
which gives financial help and advice to opera
and drama companies, orchestras and festivals,
arts centres, galleries, theatres, writers and
artistic groups.
Local district councils provide leisure
facilities, including leisure centres and
swimming pools. The Government finances
the Sports Council for Northern Ireland,
which promotes sport and physical recreation.
Health and personal social services
correspond fairly closely to those in the rest
of Britain.
Although publicly-financed schools must be
open to children from all religions, in practice
Roman Catholic and Protestant children are
mainly educated in separate schools. There are
28 integrated schools for both Protestant and
Roman Catholic children, and this process is
being encouraged by the Government
(see p. 429).
Most housing is owner-occupied. The
Housing Executive (see p. 343) allocates
public housing to those in greatest need.
Local television and radio programmes are
broadcast and there is a local press (see p. 495).
National television and radio broadcasts are
received, and the national press is sold widely.

Three-quarters of the population of Scotland and most of the industrial towns
are in the central lowlands. The chief cities are Edinburgh (the capital),
Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee. Just over half of Scotland consists of the
sparsely populated highlands and islands in the north.
Scotland contains large areas of unspoilt and wild landscape, and the
majority of Britain’s highest mountains—nearly 300 peaks over 913 m
(3,000 ft). The Grampians in the central highlands contain Ben Nevis
(1,343 m, 4,406 ft), the highest peak in Britain.
Early History
At the time of the Roman invasion of Britain,
what is now Scotland was mainly inhabited
by the Piets. Despite a long campaign,
Roman rule was never permanently extended
to most of Scotland. In the sixth century, the
Scots from Ireland settled in what is now
Argyll, giving their name to the present-day
Scotland. Lothian was populated by the
Angles, while Britons moved north to
Strathclyde. In the ninth century parts of
Scotland were subject to raids by the Vikings;
a united Scottish kingdom was established at
this time.
The powerful English monarchy
threatened Scottish independence in the
Middle Ages, particularly under Edward I,
and war between the two kingdoms was
frequent. There were also, however, strong
links with England; several Scottish kings
held land and titles in England and there was
intermarriage between the Scottish and
English royal families. Cultural influences on
Scotland were also strong. Despite reverses
such as the defeat of William W allace’s
uprising in 1298, Robert the Bruce’s victory
over Edward II of England at Bannockburn
ensured the survival of a separate kingdom
of Scotland.
The two crowns were eventually united
when Elizabeth I of England was succeeded
in 1603 by James VI of Scotland (James I of
England), who was her nearest heir. Even so,
England and Scotland remained separate
political entities during the 17th century,
apart from an enforced period of unification
under Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s. The
religions of the two kingdoms had also
developed in different directions, with
England retaining an Episcopalian church
18
SCOTLAND
(governed by bishops) and Scotland
embracing a Presbyterian system (see p. 452).
In 1707 both countries, realising the benefits
of closer political and economic union, agreed
on a single parliament for Great Britain.
Scotland retained its own system of law and
church settlement.
Government
There are special arrangements for the
conduct of Scottish affairs within the British
system of government and separate Acts of
Parliament are passed for Scotland where
appropriate. There are 72 Scottish seats in
the House of Commons. In August 1995
there were 49 Labour Members of
Parliament, 10 Conservative, 9 Liberal
Democrat and 4 Scottish Nationalist.
Scottish administration is the responsibility
of the Secretary of State for Scotland, a
member of the Cabinet, working through The
Scottish Office, which has its headquarters in
Edinburgh and an office in London.
Review of Scottish Government
In 1993 the Government issued a White
Paper, Scotland in the Union: A Partnership
for Good, following a wide-ranging
examination of Scotland’s place in Britain and
the role of Parliament in Scottish affairs.
Changes to improve the parliamentary
arrangements for handling Scottish business
are being implemented. The range of
business handled by the Scottish Grand
Committee (which consists of all 72 Scottish
MPs) is being widened and the Committee
now meets in Scotland as well as at
Westminster. Other changes include
improved scrutiny of Scottish legislation
through special standing committees; and
greater accountability of Scottish Office
ministers through parliamentary question
time (see p. 57).
Certain functions have been transferred
from Whitehall departments to The Scottish
Office. For example, responsibility for the
Scottish Arts Council was transferred from
the Department of National Heritage in April
1994. To increase the responsiveness of The
Scottish Office to the people of Scotland, a
central enquiry unit and information points
are being established in many towns.
Local Government Reform
The structure of local government is due to
change from April 1996. Under the Local
Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, a

single-tier structure of 29 councils will
replace the 62 regional and district councils.
The three islands councils—Orkney, Shetland
and the Western Isles—will be largely
unchanged. Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and
Aberdeen will each have its own council.
Elections for the new councils were held in
April 1995 and the councils are operating in
shadow form alongside the existing councils
until the change of responsibility. The new
councils will be required to devise plans by
April 1997 to decentralise their administration
and services, with the intention of enhancing
local democracy and encouraging public
participation.
Legal System
The principles and procedures of the Scottish
legal system differ in many respects from
those of England and Wales. These
differences stem, in part, from the adoption
of elements from other European legal
systems, based on Roman law, during the
16th century. One difference is in the
verdicts which a jury may give—in Scotland a
jury can give a verdict of ‘not proven’ when,
as with a ‘not guilty’ verdict, the accused is
acquitted.
Following a wide-ranging review of
the criminal justice system in
Scotland, the Criminal Justice
(Scotland) Act 1995 has been
introduced (see Chapter 8). The Act is
intended to:
• implement major procedural
reforms designed to make the
criminal justice system more
responsive to the needs of victims,
witnesses and jurors; and
• increase the capacity of the
system to deal with offenders and
strengthen the powers available to
prevent crime and reduce
re-offending.
The Economy
Scotland has experienced the same pressure
on its traditional industries as Wales and the
north of England. However, since 1987
economic growth in Scotland has on average
been greater than in Britain as a whole and it
was less affected by the recession in the early
1990s than were other areas.
The most significant development has been
the discovery in the early 1970s of oil and gas
under the North Sea. Up to about 100,000
jobs are estimated to have arisen directly or
indirectly as a result of North Sea activities.
Industry
As traditional industries such as coal, steel
and shipbuilding have declined, there has
been growth in high technology industries
such as chemicals, electronic engineering
and lighter forms of mechanical and
instrument engineering. Scotland has one
of the biggest concentrations of the
electronics industry in Western Europe.
The industry, which includes many of the
world’s leading companies in this field,
provides nearly 13 per cent of jobs in
manufacturing and about 19 per cent of
manufacturing output.
Some traditional industries, such as high-
quality tweeds and other textiles, and food
and drink products, remain important. There
are over 100 whisky distilleries, mostly in the
north-east. Whisky exports, valued at £2,191
million in 1994, represent about one-fifth of
Scotland’s manufacturing exports.
Industrial Development
Government measures have helped to attract
firms to Scotland, and investment by overseas
companies has helped to make a significant
contribution to the growth of modern
technologically based industries.
Government support for enterprise and
training is channelled through Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, which both have general functions
in economic development, training and
environmental improvement in the Scottish
lowlands and the Highlands and Islands
respectively. They contract with 22 Local
Enterprise Companies (led by the private
sector), which arrange the provision of
training and business support.
20
SCOTLAND
Services
A marked expansion has occurred in services,
which now employ over 70 per cent of the
workforce. Financial and business services are
of growing importance, and over 200,000
people are employed in the sector. There are
four Scottish-based clearing banks and they
have limited rights to issue their own
banknotes. About one-third of investment
funds in Britain are managed from Scotland,
which is also a base for a large number of
insurance companies.
Tourism and leisure also make a significant
contribution to the economy, directly providing
over 180,000 jobs. In 1993, 10.9 million visitors
spent over £2,000 million in Scotland. In
November 1994 the Government launched a
strategic plan for the development of the
tourism industry, including targets for raising
tourist expenditure and the number of jobs in
the industry. The plan aims to build on
Scotland’s strengths, such as scenery, culture,
historic buildings and opportunities for leisure,
while spreading tourism throughout Scotland
and increasing tourism in off-peak periods.
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing
About 75 per cent of the land area of
Scotland is devoted to agriculture. Most of
this is rough grazing for cattle and sheep.
Scotland’s cattle industry has a worldwide
reputation, both for the quality of meat and
for pedigree breeds. Arable farms are highly
productive, and the principal crop is barley,
which is used in the making of whisky.
Scotland accounts for over half of Britain’s
forest area and for just under half of timber
production. Forestry is continuing to expand
and many new woodlands are being created,
including native pine forests.
Fishing remains important, particularly in
the north-east and the islands. Scotland
accounts for 73 per cent by weight and 62
per cent by value of the fish landed in Britain
by British vessels.
Energy and Water Resources
Nuclear and hydro-electric generation supply
a higher proportion of energy than in any
other part of Britain. Over 40 per cent of
Scotland’s electricity comes from nuclear
power, with hydro-power and other
renewables contributing over 10 per cent.
With abundant rainfall, there is an
extensive supply of water from upland
sources. As a result of the changes in local
government, three new public water
authorities will be set up in April 1996 to
take over responsibility for water and
sewerage services from the regional and
islands councils.
Transport
Communications, both domestic and
international, have improved in many parts
of Scotland. Electrification of the Edinburgh
to London railway was completed in 1991.
The road construction programme
includes completion of the Central Scotland
motorway network and the extension of the
M74 from Carlisle to Glasgow. Proposals to
improve public and private transport services
around the Firth of Forth are being
considered. A public inquiry is planned to
examine proposals for a second Forth Road
Bridge and associated road links.
Environment
Scotland’s countryside contains a rich variety
of wildlife, with some species not found
elsewhere in Britain. There are 71 national
nature reserves and 1,381 Sites of Special
Scientific Interest. Four regional parks and
40 national scenic areas have been
designated, covering 13 per cent of the land
surface. Four of the 11 forest parks in Great
Britain are in Scotland, and a fifth spans the
border between Scotland and England.
In all, 43 Special Protection Areas
have been designated in Scotland
under the European Community (EC)
directive on wild birds. In March 1995
the Government announced that more
than 100 wildlife sites of international
importance would be consulted on for
possible designation as Special Areas
of Conservation under the EC’s
directive on habitats.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Housing and Urban Regeneration
The tenure pattern is somewhat different
from that in the rest of Britain. Home
ownership is increasing but, at 56 per cent, is
still lower than in other areas of Britain.
Some 34 per cent of housing is rented from
the public sector, compared with 20 per cent
for Britain as a whole. Projects to tackle the
problems in inner city areas and some
peripheral housing estates include a series of
partnerships between The Scottish Office and
other groups, such as local communities and
the private sector (see p. 350).
Health
There has been a general improvement in the
health of people in Scotland, but for certain
diseases, such as lung cancer and heart
disease, the health record is not as good as
elsewhere in Britain. In 1992 the Government
issued a policy statement with a range of
initiatives to improve health in Scotland and
meet the targets for the year 2000 which had
been announced in 1991. Progress is being
made towards meeting some of these targets,
with falls in mortality in coronary heart
disease, and lower levels of cigarette smoking
among those aged 25 to 64.
Education
The concept of universal education was
accepted in Scotland as early as the 16th
century. The Scottish education system has a
number of distinctive features, for example,
in examinations (see p. 436). Four of the 12
universities—St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen
and Edinburgh—were established in the 15th
century. Record numbers of students are
entering higher education; in 1993-94 about
143,000 students (full-time equivalents) were
taking higher education courses, 45 per cent
more than in 1989-90.

Cultural and Social Affairs
Gaelic, a language of ancient Celtic origin, is
spoken by some 70,000 people; the greatest
concentration of Gaelic speakers is in the
islands of the Hebrides. The Government is
encouraging people to learn more about the
Gaelic language and culture. Government
support for Gaelic—which amounted to
£11.3 million in 1994-95—covers three main
areas: education, Gaelic organisations and
television broadcasting.
Many Scots have achieved eminence in
arts and sciences. The annual Edinburgh
International Festival is one of the world’s
leading cultural events. Held in August and
September, it is the largest of its kind in the
world. Edinburgh and the Mayfest
international arts festival in Glasgow are
the two largest arts festivals in Britain.
Scotland possesses a number of major
collections of the fine and applied arts, such
as the Burrell Collection in Glasgow. A new
Museum of Scotland is to be built in
Edinburgh to house the National
Museums’ Scottish collection. Each spring
Edinburgh hosts the International Science
Festival, the world’s biggest science festival
in a single city.
The predominant Church of Scotland is
a Protestant church which is Presbyterian
in form; it is governed by a hierarchy of
church courts, each of which includes lay
people.
The sport of golf originated in Scotland,
and there are over 400 golf courses,
including St Andrews, Gleneagles,
Turnberry, Muirfield, Troon and Prestwick,
which are internationally renowned. A wide
range of outdoor activities, such as
mountaineering, hill walking and fishing, are
also pursued. Winter sports are becoming
increasingly popular in the Cairngorm
Mountains, Glencoe and a number of
other areas.

Two-thirds of the population of Wales live in the southern valleys and the
lower-lying coastal areas. The chief urban centres are Cardiff (with a
population of 300,000), Swansea, Newport and Wrexham. However, much of
Wales is hilly or mountainous. The highest mountains are in Snowdonia and
the tallest peak is Snowdon (1,085 m, 3,560 ft).
Wales is a principality; Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, was invested
by the Queen with the title of Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle in 1969,
when he was 20. The Welsh name of the country is Cymru.
Early History
After the collapse of Roman rule in Britain
(see p. 5), Wales remained a Celtic
stronghold, although often within the English
sphere of influence. For much of the period,
it was divided into a number of separate
principalities, and unity was achieved only
sporadically. In 1267 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd,
who had achieved control over a large portion
of Wales, was recognised as Prince of Wales
by the English. However, on his death in
1282, Edward I launched a successful
campaign to bring Wales under English rule.
The series of great castles that he had built
in north Wales remain among Britain’s finest
historic monuments (see p. 357). Edward Fs
eldest son—later Edward II—was born at
Caernarfon in 1284 and was given the title
Prince of Wales, which continues to be borne
by the eldest son of the reigning monarch to
this day.
Continued strong Welsh national feeling
culminated in the rising led by Owain
Glyndwr at the beginning of the 15th
century. The Tudor dynasty, which ruled
England from 1485 to 1603, was of Welsh
ancestry. The Acts of Union of 1536 and
1542 united England and Wales
administratively, politically and legally.
Language
At the time of the 1991 census Welsh
speakers made up 19 per cent of the
population. In much of the rural north and
west, Welsh remains the first language of most
of the population. There is some evidence
that the decline in the number of Welsh
speakers is being halted, with greater numbers
of children and young people able to speak
Welsh, and a revival in the largely anglicised
areas of south-east and north-east Wales.
The Government has reaffirmed its
commitment to enhancing Welsh culture and
developing greater use of the Welsh language.
Bilingual education in schools is encouraged
(see p. 435), and there has been an extended
use of Welsh for official purposes and in
23
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
broadcasting. There are now many more
bilingual publications and most road signs are
bilingual. Expenditure of £6.3 million in
support of the language is planned in
1995-96. The Welsh Language Act 1993
establishes the principle that, in the context
of public business and the administration of
justice in Wales, Welsh and English should
be treated on an equal basis.
The Act also put the Welsh Language
Board (formerly an advisory body) on a
statutory basis. Its aim is to promote and
facilitate the use of the Welsh language. One
of its main tasks is to help public bodies
which provide services in Wales to prepare
Welsh language schemes setting out their
commitments to provide services through the
medium of Welsh.
Government
The country returns 38 Members of
Parliament to the House of Commons. For
the last 60 years the industrial communities
have tended to support the Labour Party in
elections, ensuring a Labour majority of seats.
In August 1995 Wales had 27 Labour
Members of Parliament, 6 Conservative, 4
Plaid Cymru (Welsh Nationalist) and 1
Liberal Democrat. Special arrangements exist
for the discussion of Welsh affairs in the
parliamentary Welsh Grand Committee,
whose function is to consider matters relating
exclusively to Wales; Bills are referred to it
for consideration as to whether they should
be given a second reading (see p. 57).
The Secretary of State for Wales, who is a
member of the Cabinet, has wide-ranging
responsibilities relating to the economy,
education, welfare services and the provision
of amenities. The headquarters of the
administration is the Welsh Office in Cardiff;
it also has an office in London. The legal
system is identical to the English one.
Under the Local Government (Wales) Act
1994, local government is being reorganised,
with the abolition of the two-tier structure of
eight county councils and 37 district councils.
Elections for the 22 new unitary authorities
were held in May 1995 and the authorities
are operating on a ‘shadow’ basis until they
replace the existing councils in April 1996.
The Economy
Recent decades have seen fundamental
changes in the basis of the Welsh economy,
with the dependence on refined fuels and
coalmining considerably reduced. The most
notable features have been expansion in
service industries and the development of a
more diverse range of manufacturing
industries, including many at the forefront of
technology. About 800 new plants have been
created since 1980, providing around 55,000
new employment opportunities. Wales is now
an important centre for consumer electronics,
information technology, automotive
components, chemicals and materials, and
food and drink. About 16,000 people are
employed by around 100 companies in
electronics and telecommunications.
In the service sector the most marked
growth has been in financial and business

services, and leisure services. Annual earnings
from tourism, for example, are estimated at
about £1,300 million and the industry
employs about 95,000 people. The Wales
Tourist Board seeks to develop tourism in
ways which will yield the optimum economic
benefit for the people of Wales.
The traditional industry of
steelmaking remains important, and
Wales accounts for about a third of
steel production in Britain. British
Steel has invested £1,200 million over
the last ten years in its plants in
Wales, and there have been
significant improvements in
productivity. About £22 million is to
be invested in the steelworks at
Llanwern (Gwent), increasing hot
rolling capacity by a third.
Although south Wales remains the
principal industrial area, new industries and
firms have been introduced in north-east
Wales and light industry attracted to the towns
in the rural areas of mid- and north Wales.
Inward Investment
Wales has been particularly successful in
attracting investment from overseas
companies. Through its International
Division, the Welsh Development Agency
(WDA) seeks to attract investment into Wales
and co-ordinates the approach for responding
to the needs of investors. Since 1983 it has
recorded over 1,400 projects, promising a
total of over 84,000 new jobs and capital
investment of £7,200 million.
Economic Development
The economic programmes of the Welsh
Office are complemented by the work of the
WDA and the Development Board for Rural
Wales, which have wide powers to promote
economic, industrial and environmental
change. Planned expenditure by these
bodies in 1995-96 totals £153 million and
£18 million respectively. One of the main areas
of activity is providing accommodation for
business, increasingly in partnership with the
private sector. The WDA has also undertaken
the largest land reclamation programme in
Europe, and all the significant remaining
industrial dereliction in Wales is expected to
have been removed by the end of the 1990s.
The south Wales valleys are one of the
main areas to have been affected by the
decline in traditional industries. A second
five-year Programme for the Valleys was
launched in 1993. While retaining the most
successful features of the earlier programme,
the emphasis of the new programme has
moved away from centralised initiatives
towards stronger partnerships between the
Welsh Office, development agencies, local
councils and the private and voluntary
sectors. In September 1994 the Secretary of
State for Wales announced plans to attract
£1,000 million of private sector investment to
the valleys. During 1995 this economic
development and private finance initiative is
being extended to the rest of Wales.
A development corporation has been set
up to stimulate the regeneration of the
Cardiff Bay area. A new barrage is being
built across the harbour mouth and should be
completed in 1998. It is expected that more
than 23,000 new jobs will be created in the
Cardiff Bay area, 4,400 new homes built and
over £1,200 million of private sector
investment attracted. As well as commercial
and residential development, a new centre for
the Welsh National Opera is proposed.
Agriculture and Forestry
Agriculture occupies about 82 per cent of the
land area. The main activities are sheep and
cattle rearing in the hill regions and dairy
farming in the lowlands. About 12 per cent
of Wales is covered by woodland.
Transport
Improvements to road and rail links, such as
the upgrading of the north Wales coast road,
have helped the Welsh economy in recent
years. In the south there are motorway links
across the Severn Bridge to southern England
and the Midlands, and high-speed rail
services to a number of destinations in
25
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
England. A second major motorway crossing
of the Severn and associated approach
motorways are under construction. The
bridge, scheduled for completion in 1996, is
being built and financed by a private sector
company, Severn River Crossing pic.
Passenger traffic at Cardiff Wales
airport at Rhoose has nearly doubled
since 1991, to over 1 million
passengers in 1994. The airport was
privatised in April 1995.
Environment
About one-quarter of Wales is designated as a
National Park or Area of Outstanding Natural
Beauty (see p. 363). As well as three National
Parks—Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and
the Pembrokeshire Coast—and five Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty, there are two
national trails, 31 country parks and large
stretches of heritage coast. There are 52
National Nature Reserves and about 890 Sites
of Special Scientific Interest. Nearly all of the
rivers and canals are classified as having
water of good or fair quality, and a significant
improvement has been achieved in the quality
of bathing waters.
Cultural and Social Affairs
Welsh literature is one of the oldest and
richest in Europe. The Welsh people also
have strong musical traditions; the country is
well known for its choral singing and the
Welsh National Opera has an international
reputation. Special festivals, known as
eisteddfodau, encourage Welsh literature and
music. The largest is the annual Royal
National Eisteddfod, consisting of competitions
in music, singing, prose and poetry entirely
in Welsh. Artists from all over the world
come to the town of Llangollen for the annual
International Musical Eisteddfod. New galleries
and a permanent Evolution of W ales exhibition
were opened at the National Museum of
Wales in Cardiff in 1993. Work on a third
building at the National Library of Wales,
costing some £\\ million, started in 1994 and
is expected to be completed in 1998.
There is no established church, the
Anglican church in Wales having been
disestablished in 1920 following decades of
pressure from adherents of the Methodist and
Baptist churches. Methodism in particular
spread rapidly in Wales in the 18th century,
assuming the nature of a popular movement
among Welsh speakers and finding strong
support later in industrial communities.
An active local press includes a number of
Welsh language publications. The fourth
television channel, Sianel Pedwar Cymru
(S4C), broadcasts most of its programmes in
Welsh during peak viewing hours and is
required to see that a significant proportion
of programmes are in Welsh.
The education system is similar to that in
England. Welsh and English are both used as
media of instruction. Most Welsh-medium
schools are situated in the traditionally
Welsh-speaking, largely rural, areas, although
there are also bilingual schools in the
anglicised, mainly industrial areas to cater for
children whose parents want them to be
educated through the medium of both
languages. Welsh is a core subject in Welsh¬
speaking schools and a foundation subject
elsewhere under the National Curriculum
(see p. 435). The collegiate University of
Wales, founded in 1893, comprises six
member institutions.
Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union football,
which has come to be regarded as the Welsh
national game. The provision of sports
facilities, such as indoor sports halls and
swimming pools, has increased in recent years.

Language 31 Pattern 33
Ethnic and National Minorities 31
Among the main social changes during the second half of the 20th century
are longer life expectancy and a lower birth rate, reflected in a growing
proportion of elderly people; a higher divorce rate; wider educational
opportunities; technological progress and a higher standard of living.
POPULATION
According to mid-1994 estimates, Britain’s
population is 58.4 million, the 17th largest in
the world. Statistics are derived from the
census (taken every ten years), with
allowance made for subsequent births and
deaths (obtained from compulsory
registration), and migration.
The population has been growing slowly
since the early 1980s, thanks to increased
longevity. On mid-1992-based projections,
the population in Britain is forecast to rise to
59.8 million in 2001 and 61.3 million in 2011.
Birth Rates
In 1994 there were 751,000 live births in
Britain, compared with 762,000 in 1993. The
total period fertility rate (an indication of
average family size) remains below 2.1, the
level leading to the long-term replacement of
the population, although it is projected that it
will increase from 1.75 in 1994 to 1.9 for
women born in or after 1980.
Contributory factors to the relatively low
birth rate in recent years (12.9 live births per
1,000 population in 1994) include:
• the trends towards later marriage and
towards postponing having children,
which have led to an increase in the
average age of women giving birth—28.4
years in England and Wales in 1994,
compared with 26.8 in 1981;
• a preference for smaller families than in
the past, which has led to a significant
decline in the proportion of families with
four or more children;1 and
• more widespread and effective
contraception, making it easier to plan
families, and the greater prevalence of
voluntary sterilisation for both men
and women.
Mortality
At birth the expectation of life for a man is
about 73 years and for a woman 78 years,
compared with 49 years for men and 52 years
for women in 1901. There has, however,
'In 1993 20 per cent of households in Great Britain consisted of
a married couple with one or two dependent children, compared
with 5 per cent of households consisting of a married couple
with three or more dependent children.
27
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
been only a small increase in life expectancy
in the older age groups.
There were provisionally estimated to be
626,000 deaths in 1994, a death rate of 10.7
per 1,000 population. There has been a
decline in mortality at most ages,
particularly among children. The infant
mortality rate (deaths of infants under one
year old per 1,000 live births) was 6.3 in
1993; neonatal mortality (deaths of infants
under four weeks old per 1,000 live births)
was 4.2; and maternal mortality is about
0.07 per 1,000 total births. The decline in
the mortality rate reflects better nutrition,
rising standards of living, the advance of
medical science, the increased availability
of medical facilities, improved health
measures, better working conditions,
education in personal hygiene and the
smaller size of families.
Deaths caused by circulatory diseases
(including heart attacks and strokes) now
account for nearly half of all deaths, and
mortality from heart disease in England and
Wales remains high compared with that of
other developed countries. The next largest
cause of death is cancer, which is
responsible for nearly one-quarter of deaths.
Cigarette smoking is the greatest
preventable cause of illness and death in
Britain. However, there has been a
significant decline in the prevalence of
smoking, with 29 per cent of adult males
and 28 per cent of adult females smoking
cigarettes in 1992, compared with 52 and 41
per cent respectively in 1972.
Between 1990 and 1992 the Government
set out strategies for continuing the overall
improvement in health, emphasising disease
prevention and health promotion (see p.
402). A number of government priorities,
aimed at supporting the overall goals of
improving the country’s health and
providing high-quality care for those who
need it, have been listed. The Government
is also pursuing a comprehensive strategy
against drug misuse in Britain. Initiatives
are aimed at reducing both the supply of,
and demand for, drugs.
From 1991 onwards, annual surveys have
been carried out in England to monitor
trends in health.
Marriage and Divorce
Britain has one of the highest marriage and
divorce rates in the European Union. In 1993
there were 341,600 marriages in Britain, of
which 38.4 per cent were remarriages of one
or both parties. Some 36.2 per cent of
marriages were remarriages where one or
both parties had been divorced. Of the
population aged 16 or over in England and
Wales in 1992, 57 per cent were married,
27 per cent single, 9 per cent widowed and
7 per cent divorced. The average age for first
marriages in England and Wales is now about
28.2 for men and 26.2 for women.
With the coming into force of the
Marriage Act 1994, couples in England
and Wales who choose a register
office marriage are no longer
restricted to having the ceremony in
the register office for the area in
which they live. Ceremonies may also
now be held at other buildings, such
as hotels and stately homes, approved
for marriages by the local authority
for the area.
In 1993 there were 13.9 divorces for every
1,000 married couples in England and Wales.
The rates for Scotland and Northern Ireland
are lower than that for England and Wales.
In 1993 180,400 divorces were granted in
Britain. The average age of people at the time
of divorce in England and Wales is now
about 39.3 for men and 37.6 for women.
Another feature, common to many other
Western European countries, has been an
increase in cohabitation, and 18 per cent of
non-married men and women aged 16-59 in
Great Britain were cohabiting in 1992.
Between 1979 and 1992 the proportion of
non-married women aged 18^19 who were
cohabiting rose from 11 to 21 per cent.
Cohabitation is particularly high (25 per cent)
among divorced women, but recently the
largest increase has been for single women.
There is some evidence of a growing
number of stable non-married relationships.
Roughly half of all births outside marriage
(which accounted for 32 per cent of live
28
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
births in Britain in 1994) are registered by
both parents giving a single address as their
place of residence.
Age and Sex Structure
The most significant changes in the age
structure of the population have been the
growing numbers of elderly people and the
decline in the proportion of young people.
The proportion of young people aged under
16 fell from 25.5 per cent in 1971 to 20.6 per
cent in 1993. During the same period the
proportion of elderly people (those aged 65
and over) increased from 13.2 to 15.8 per
cent, while 18.3 per cent of the population
were over the normal retirement ages (65 for
men and 60 for women), compared with 16.3
per cent in 1971.
There is a ratio of about 104 females to
every 100 males in the population as a whole.
There are about 3 per cent more male than
female births every year. However, because of
the higher mortality of men at all ages, there
is a turning-point, at about 50 years of age,
beyond which the number of women exceeds
the number of men. This imbalance increases
with age so that there are many more women
among the elderly.
I Distribution of Population
The population density is about 241
inhabitants per sq km, which is well above
the EU average of about 153 per sq km. Of
the four lands, England is the most densely
populated, with 373 people per sq km. Scotland
is the least densely populated, with 67 people
per sq km. Wales and Northern Ireland have
140 and 122 people per sq km respectively.
Since the 19th century there has been a
trend, especially in London, for people to
move away from congested urban centres into
the suburbs. Between the 1981 and 1991
censuses, all metropolitan counties (with the
exception of West Yorkshire) experienced
small decreases in population, the largest
being in Merseyside (5 per cent). There has
also been a geographical redistribution of the
population, away from Scotland and the
northern regions of England. The regions
with the highest rates of increase in
population between 1981 and 1991 were East
Anglia (10 per cent) and the South West (8
per cent). Retirement migration is also a
feature of population movement, the main
recipient areas being the south coast of
England and East Anglia (where in some
towns the retired constitute over one-quarter
of the population).
Migration
From 1989 to 1993 some 1.1 million people
left Britain (excluding the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man) to live abroad. About
1.2 million came from overseas to live in
Britain, so that net immigration increased the
population by about 94,000. These figures
exclude migration to and from the Irish
Republic, and are also likely to exclude
people admitted as visitors who were
subsequently granted an extension of stay for
a year or more.
In 1993 the total inflow of people
intending to stay in Britain for one year or
more was 209,000, some 3 per cent less than
in 1992. The outflow of people leaving to
live abroad, at 213,000, was 6 per cent lower
than in 1992.
Of the 213,000 departing residents in 1993:
• 29 per cent left for EU countries;
• 24 per cent for Australia, Canada, New
Zealand or South Africa;
• 15 per cent for other Commonwealth
countries;
• 15 per cent for the United States;
• 4 per cent for the Middle East; and
• 12 per cent for other countries.
Of the 209,000 new residents in 1993:
• 21 per cent came from Australia, Canada,
New Zealand or South Africa;
• 22 per cent from other Commonwealth
countries;
• 24 per cent from EU countries;
• 11 per cent from the United States;
• 4 per cent from the Middle East; and
• 17 per cent from other countries.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Nationality
Under the British Nationality Act 1981 there
are three main forms of citizenship:
• British citizenship for people closely
connected with Britain;
• British Dependent Territories citizenship
for people connected with the dependent
territories (see p. 117); and
• British Overseas citizenship for those
citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies who did not acquire either of
the other citizenships when the 1981 Act
came into force.
British citizenship is acquired automatically
at birth by a child born in Britain if his or
her mother or father is a British citizen or is
settled in Britain. A child adopted in Britain
by a British citizen is a British citizen. A
child born abroad to a British citizen born,
adopted, naturalised or registered in Britain is
generally a British citizen by descent. The
Act safeguards the citizenship of a child born
abroad to a British citizen in Crown service,
certain related services, or in service under a
European Union institution.
British citizenship may also be acquired:
• by registration for certain children,
including those born in Britain who do
not automatically acquire such citizenship
at birth, or who have been born abroad
to a parent who is a citizen by descent;
• by registration for British Dependent
Territories citizens, British Overseas
citizens, British subjects under the Act,
British Nationals (Overseas) and British
protected persons after five years’
residence in Britain, except for people
from Gibraltar, who may be registered
without residence;
• by registration for stateless people and
those who have previously renounced
British nationality; and
• by naturalisation for all other adults aged
18 or over.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion. Requirements include five years’
residence, or three years if the applicant’s
spouse is a British citizen. Those who are not
married to a British citizen are also required
to have a sufficient knowledge of English,
Welsh or Scottish Gaelic; they must also
intend to have their main home in Britain or
be employed by the Crown, by an
international organisation of which Britain is
a member, or by a company or association
established in Britain.
Legislation passed in 1983 conferred
British citizenship on Falkland Islanders who
did not acquire it under the 1981 Act.
Special arrangements covering the status of
British Dependent Territories citizens
connected with Hong Kong when the
territory returns to the People’s Republic of
China in 1997 are made by the Hong Kong
(British Nationality) Order 1986. Under this,
such citizens are entitled, before 1997, to
acquire a status known as British National
(Overseas) and to hold a passport in that
status. In addition, the British Nationality
(Hong Kong) Act 1990 made provision for
the registration as British citizens before 30
June 1997 of up to 50,000 people who are
able to meet certain criteria and who are
recommended by the Governor, together with
their spouses and children who are still minors.
In 1994, 44,000 people were granted
British citizenship.
Immigration
Immigration into Britain is largely governed
by the Immigration Act 1971 and the
Immigration Rules made under it. The Rules
set out the requirements to be met by those
who are subject to immigration control and
seek entry to or leave to remain in Britain.
New Immigration Rules came into effect in
October 1994. British citizens and those
Commonwealth citizens who had the right of
abode before January 1983 maintain the
right of abode and are not subject to
immigration control.
Under the Immigration Rules nationals of
certain specified countries or territorial entities
must obtain a visa before they can enter
Britain. Other nationals subject to immigration
control require entry clearance when coming
to work or settle in Britain. Visas and other
entry clearances are normally obtained from
the nearest or other specified British
diplomatic post in a person’s home country.
30
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
Nationals of the European Economic Area
(EEA)—EU member states plus Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein—are not subject to
substantive immigration control. They may
work in Britain without restriction. Provided
that they are working or able to support
themselves financially, EEA nationals have
a right to reside in Britain.
Britain respects its obligations under the
United Nations Convention and Protocol
relating to the Status of Refugees. These
provide that refugees lawfully resident should
enjoy treatment as least as favourable as that
accorded to other foreign nationals.
In 1994 9.2 million foreign and
Commonwealth nationals (excluding EEA
nationals) were admitted to Britain. About
55,000 people were accepted for settlement.

LANGUAGE
English is the main language spoken in
Britain, and is also one of the most widely
used in the world.2 Recent estimates suggest
that 310 million people speak it as their first
language, with a similar number speaking it
as a second language. It is an official language
in a large number of overseas countries, and
is widely used internationally as the main
2For the Welsh language see p. 23; for Gaelic see p. 22.
language for purposes such as air traffic
control and academic gatherings.
Modern English derives primarily from
one of the dialects of Anglo-Saxon. However,
it has been very greatly influenced by other
languages, particularly, following the Norman
conquest, by French. French was the
language of the nobility and the law courts
for many years after 1066. The re-emergence
of English as the universal language of
England was signified by such events as the
Statute of Pleadings in 1362, which laid down
that English was to be used in court. The
14th century also saw the first major English
literature since Anglo-Saxon days, with the
writing of works such as Piers Plowman by
William Langland and The Canterbury Tales
by Geoffrey Chaucer. However, there remained
great regional variations in the language, and
spellings were not always standardised.
The 16th and early 17th centuries saw a
considerable flowering of English literature,
with writers such as William Shakespeare,
Edmund Spenser and Christopher Marlowe.
Cranmer’s prayerbook and the Authorised
(‘King James’) Version of the Bible, which
have had a profound effect on literature down
to modern times, also date from this period.
About this time, too, translations of Latin,
Italian and other European works into
English vastly expanded the English
language. The work of early lexicographers,
of whom the most famous was Samuel
Johnson (1709-84), also led to greater
standardisation in matters such as spelling.
ETHNIC AND NATIONAL
MINORITIES
For centuries people from overseas have
settled in Britain, either to escape political or
religious persecution or in search of better
economic opportunities.
The Irish have long formed a large section
of the population. Jewish refugees who came
to Britain towards the end of the 19th century
and in the 1930s were followed by other
European refugees after 1945. Substantial
immigration from the Caribbean and the
South Asian sub-continent dates principally
from the 1950s and 1960s. In recent years, the
number of people coming from the South
31
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Asian sub-continent has remained roughly
stable, but there has been a rise in immigration
from some African countries, such as Ghana,
Nigeria and Somalia (see Table 6.1).
The 1991 census included for the first
time a question on ethnic grouping. This
found that 94.5 per cent of the population
belonged to the ‘white’ group, while just over
3 million people (5.5 per cent) described
themselves as belonging to another ethnic
group (see Table 6.2). Members of other
ethnic groups were heavily concentrated in
industrial and urban areas, and over half lived
in the South East. The highest proportion
was in the London borough of Brent: nearly
45 per cent of the population. Ethnic
minority groups also accounted for over a
third of the population in the London boroughs
of Newham, Tower Hamlets and Hackney.
Outside London the main concentrations
were in Leicester, Slough, Luton, Bradford,
the West Midlands and the Pennine
conurbation. Regional concentrations varied
among the ethnic groups. About three-fifths
of people from black ethnic groups lived in
London, compared with about two-fifths of
Indians and 18 per cent of Pakistanis, who
were concentrated in other metropolitan areas
such as West Yorkshire.
Overall, 47 per cent of the ethnic minority
population were born in Britain. A higher
proportion is under 16 than for the white
group (33 per cent and 19 per cent
respectively), but a much lower proportion is
over pensionable age (3 per cent and about
17 per cent respectively).

According to the Labour Force Survey,
economic activity rates for men of working
age in Great Britain tend to be similar to
those for the white groups. In spring 1994
they were 79 per cent for the black group, 80
per cent for the Indian group, 75 per cent for
the Pakistani/Bangladeshi population and 86
per cent for the white group. The variations
are much greater for women: 67 per cent of
those from the black ethnic group were
economically active, compared with 62 per
cent in the Indian group, 72 per cent in the
white group and only 26 per cent in the
Pakistani/Bangladeshi group.
Alleviating Racial Disadvantage
Although many members of the black and
Asian communities are concentrated in the
inner cities, where there are problems of
deprivation and social stress, progress has
been made over the last 20 years in tackling
racial disadvantage in Britain.
Many individuals have achieved
distinction in their careers and in public life,
and the proportion of ethnic minority
members occupying professional and
managerial positions is increasing. There are
at present six ethnic minority Members of
Parliament, and the number of ethnic
minority councillors in local government is
growing. There has also been an expansion of
commercial enterprise, and numerous self-
help projects in ethnic minority communities
have been established. Black competitors
have represented Britain in a range of
sporting activities (such as athletics and
football), and ethnic minority talents in the
arts and in entertainment have increasingly
been recognised.
The principal means of combating
disadvantage is through the economic,
environmental, educational and health
programmes of central government and local
authorities. There are also special allocations,
mainly through Home Office and
Department of the Environment grants,
which channel extra resources into projects of
specific benefit to ethnic minorities. These
include, for example, the provision of
specialist teachers for children needing
English language tuition. Cultural and
32
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
recreational schemes and the health and
personal social services also take account of
the particular needs of ethnic minorities.
The Government is promoting equal
opportunities for ethnic minorities through
training programmes, including greater
provision for unemployed people who need
training in English as a second language.
In recognition of the tensions that can arise
between the police and ethnic minorities,
there is statutory consultation between the
police and the community. Liaison work is
also undertaken with children in schools.
Race Relations Legislation
The Race Relations Act 1976 strengthened
previous legislation passed in the 1960s. It
makes discrimination unlawful on grounds of
colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national
origin in the provision of goods, facilities and
services, in employment, in housing, in
education and in advertising. The 1976 Act
also gave complainants direct access to civil
courts and, for employment complaints, to
industrial tribunals. The Race Relations
(Remedies) Act 1994 removed the ceiling on
industrial tribunal awards in race
discrimination cases. It is a criminal offence
to incite racial hatred under the provisions of
the Public Order Act 1986.
Commission for Racial Equality
The Commission for Racial Equality was
established by the 1976 Act. It has power to
investigate unlawful discriminatory practices
and to issue non-discrimination notices,
requiring such practices to cease. It has an
important educational role and has issued
codes of practice in employment, education,
health care, maternity services and housing.
It also provides advice to the general public
about the Race Relations Act and may
help individuals with their complaints
about racial discrimination. In 1994 the
Commission registered 1,937 applications
for assistance and handled successfully 137
litigation cases. It can also undertake or
fund research.
The Commission supports the work of
over 90 racial equality councils. These are
autonomous voluntary bodies set up in most
areas with a significant ethnic minority
population to promote equality of
opportunity and good relations at the local
level. The Commission helps pay the salaries
of the racial equality officers employed by the
councils, most of whom also receive funds
from their local authorities. It also gives
grants to ethnic minority self-help groups and
to other projects run by or for the benefit of
the minority communities.
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
PATTERN
Marked improvements in the standard of
living have taken place during the 20th
century. According to a United Nations
report on human development published in
1994, Britain ranked tenth out of 173
countries on a human development index that
combines life expectancy, education levels
and basic purchasing power.
Britain has also performed well
economically. Growth between 1980 and 1990
was higher than in all other major EU
countries except Spain. Subsequently,
following the recession of the early 1990s,
Britain has been one of the first countries to
experience recovery. Gross domestic product
in Britain grew by 3.9 per cent in 1994—
well above the EU and Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
averages of 3.3 per cent. Inflation has
recently been around 3 per cent a year, with
the underlying level of inflation in 1994 the
lowest since 1964.
Income and Wealth
Wages and salaries remain the main source of
household income for most people, although
the proportion they contribute of household
income (56 per cent in 1993, compared with
68 per cent in 1971) has been declining.
Sources which have become more important
include private pensions and annuities
(11 per cent, up from 5 per cent in 1971) as
the number of people who have made such
provision has grown. Disposable income
in 1992 was nearly 80 per cent higher than in
1971 after allowing for inflation.
33
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The proportion of household income that
is paid in income tax and National
Insurance contributions by a two-children
family with a father on average earnings was
21.8 per cent in 1994-95. This figure has
not changed significantly in recent years.
The top 20 per cent of households by
income received 43 per cent of income in
1991_92. Wealth is less evenly distributed,
with the richest 10 per cent of the
population having 49 per cent of marketable
wealth in 1992. The inclusion of ‘non-
marketable’ wealth, such as rights in
occupational and state pension schemes,
reduces this share substantially, to 33 per
cent. Since the mid-1970s there has been
little change in the distribution of
marketable wealth.
A large proportion of personal wealth—30
per cent in 1993—is in dwellings, down
quite sharply from the level of immediately
preceding years as house prices have fallen.
The proportion of net wealth held in shares
declined up to 1984, but has since increased.
The Government’s privatisation programme
has contributed to the growth in share
ownership. In 1993 about 10 million people—
22 per cent of the adult population in Great
Britain—owned shares, compared with 7 per
cent in 1979.
Eating and Drinking Habits
The general level of nutrition remains high.
There has been a significant shift in eating
patterns over the last decade, reflecting
greater emphasis on health, frozen and
convenience foods. Changes in household
consumption of selected foods between 1983
and 1994 are shown in the diagram below.
Consumption of several items, such as packet
sugar, eggs, fresh potatoes and fresh green
vegetables, has declined substantially. Other
changes include:

• a decline in consumption of beef, lamb and
pork—this has been partly offset by a
continuing increase in poultry consumption,
which is now at a record level;
• an increase in purchases of semi-skimmed
milk, with skimmed milk now
constituting more than half of the total
household consumption of liquid milk;
• a decline in the total consumption of
cooking and spreading fats, with large
falls in butter and lard usage being partly
offset by rapid rises in the consumption
of vegetable and salad oils and reduced-
fat spreads;
• an increase in the consumption of rice
and pasta, which may be partly
responsible for the decline in the
consumption of fresh potatoes;
• a trend away from consumption of some
fresh green vegetables such as cabbages
and beans towards leafy salads and
cauliflowers;
• a large increase in purchases of fruit
juice; and
• a switch in fish consumption away from
fresh white fish towards canned fish and
shellfish.
Average mineral and nutrient intakes are
generally above the daily amounts
recommended by the Department of Health.
There has been a steady fall in fat intakes,
and a small increase in the intake of fibre.
There is some evidence that health
considerations influence food consumption,
for example, the move away from whole milk
and in the growth in low fat spread
35
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
consumption. The Government encourages
the widest availability of wholesome food,
while giving high priority to consumer safety.
There has been an increase in the number
of meals eaten away from home, for example,
in restaurants or at work, and a growth in the
consumption of food from ‘take-away and
‘fast food’ shops.
There has been little change in alcohol
consumption in recent years. Beer is the most
popular drink among male drinkers, whose
overall consumption is significantly higher
than that of women. Lager is now estimated
to account for over half of all beer sales. The
largest consumers of alcohol are those aged
18 to 24, with consumption generally
declining with age. Consumption of table
wine has grown, although there has been
little change in the consumption of higher
strength wines such as sherry and port.
A high proportion of beer is drunk in
public houses (‘pubs’), traditional social
centres for many people, and in clubs. The
Licensing Act 1988 relaxed restrictions on the
opening hours of public houses, but this has
not resulted in a significant increase in
alcohol consumption. There are signs that
they are becoming more popular with
families: more meals are being served and the
consumption of non-alcoholic drinks is
increasing. Under the Deregulation and
Contracting Out Act 1994, pubs can now
apply for a children’s certificate. This allows
children under 14 into designated areas if
accompanied by an adult.
Households
The average size of households in Great Britain
has fallen from over four people in 1911 to
three in 1961 and 2.4 in 1993. The fall
reflects a greater number of people living on
their own (14 per cent of adults in 1993), or
in one-parent families, the increasing number
of old people (more of whom are living alone)
and the preference for smaller families.
A large proportion of households—67 per
cent—own their own homes. Owner-
occupation is higher for married couples than
for single, divorced or widowed household
heads. The number of owner-occupied
dwellings rose from over 4 million in 1951 to
15.8 million in 1994. Four-fifths of British
households live in houses rather than flats.
Transport and the Environment
An important influence on the planning of
housing and services has been the growth of
car ownership; in 1993, 68 per cent of
households had the use of at least one car or
van, including 23 per cent with the use of
two or more. Greater access to motorised
transport and the construction of a network
of modern trunk roads and motorways have
resulted in a considerable increase in
personal mobility and changed leisure
patterns. Most detached or semi-detached
houses in new suburban estates have garages.
Many out-of-town shopping centres, often
including large supermarkets and do-it-
yourself stores, have been built with the
motorist in mind.
Although the growth in car ownership has
brought benefits, there have been a number
of problems, notably increased congestion,
noise and air pollution arising from motor
vehicle emissions. Cars, taxis and motor
cycles accounted for 87 per cent of all
passenger transport in Great Britain in 1994,
compared with 57 per cent in 1961. To
relieve road congestion, the Government
regards carefully targeted improvements to
the road system as essential. The
Government is also seeking to use the
planning system (see p. 353) to reduce
people’s need to travel without inhibiting
their freedom to do so. To help meet the
British target for reducing carbon dioxide
emissions (see p. 373), it is increasing fuel
duty by 5 per cent a year in real terms.
Women
The economic and domestic lives of women
have been transformed in the 20th century.
These changes are due partly to women
obtaining many political and legal rights
previously open only to men. A major
feature has been the rise in the number of
women, especially married women, at work.
Women now make up nearly 46 per cent of
the workforce in employment. The growth
of part-time and flexible working patterns,
36
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
and training and retraining schemes,
increases employment opportunities, allowing
more women to combine raising a family
with paid employment. About 800,000 women
run their own businesses, 27 per cent more
than in 1984.
Responsibility for co-ordinating policy on
women’s issues was strengthened in 1992,
when a ministerial group was upgraded to a
Cabinet Sub-committee for Women’s Issues.
A working group advises on practical
measures to extend equal opportunities for
women in the workplace and elsewhere. The
Women’s National Commission, an official
advisory committee, represents the views of
women to the Government and other public
bodies. About 50 of the main national
women’s organisations are represented on
the Commission.
In 1991 the Government launched an
initiative to increase the proportion of
public appointments held by women.
The proportion has subsequently
risen from 23 to 30 per cent. Nearly
half of the appointments made by
public bodies in 1994 went to women.
The Government supports the
‘Opportunity 2000’ campaign, an employer-
led initiative to increase the quantity and
quality of women’s participation in the
workforce. Membership stands at over 280
employers, with organisations employing
about a quarter of the workforce being
committed to the campaign. Many member
organisations are adopting improvements to
their equal opportunities policies and
practices, such as offering job share
arrangements and flexible working hours to
employees. Within the civil service, the
proportion of posts at the top seven grades
filled by women rose from 7.2 per cent to
17.2 per cent between 1984 and 1994.
The Government is trying to maximise the
options available to working parents by
increasing childcare provision. It is spending
£45 million to help set up over 50,000 out-
of-school and holiday childcare places in
Great Britain. By June 1995, over 33,250
childcare places had been created.
Equal Opportunities
The Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986
make discrimination between men
and women unlawful, with certain limited
exceptions, in employment, education,
training and the provision of housing, goods,
facilities and services. Discriminatory job
recruitment advertisements are unlawful.
Complaints of discrimination concerning
employment are dealt with by industrial
tribunals; other complaints are taken before
county courts in England and Wales or the
Sheriff Court in Scotland. Under the Equal
Pay Act 1970, as amended in 1984, women in
Great Britain are entitled to equal pay with
men when doing work that is the same or
broadly similar, or work which is rated as
equivalent or work which is of equal value.
Parallel legislation on sex discrimination and
equal pay is in operation in Northern Ireland.
The Equal Opportunities Commission has
powers to enforce some parts of the Sex
Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts. Its
statutory duties are to work towards the
elimination of sex discrimination, to promote
equality of opportunity, and to keep
legislation on sex discrimination and equal
pay under review, submitting proposals for
amending it to the Government. The
Commission may advise people of their rights
under the Acts and may give financial or
other assistance to help individuals conduct a
case before a court or tribunal. It is
empowered to carry out formal investigations
and issue notices requiring discriminatory
practices to stop. The Commission carries out
research on the causes, nature and effects of
discrimination. It runs an ‘Equality
Exchange’, which enables employers to
exchange information on good practice.
The Voluntary Sector
There is a long tradition in Britain of
voluntary service to the community. There
are hundreds of thousands of voluntary
organisations, ranging from national bodies to
small local groups. One area of rapid
expansion in the last 20 years or so has
been ‘self-help’ groups. Examples include
bodies which provide playgroups for
37
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
pre-school children, or help their members to
cope with a particular disability-
Voluntary organisations may be staffed by
professional workers, but many rely on the
efforts of volunteers at some level. It has
been estimated that up to half of all adults
take part in some form of organised voluntary
work in the course of a year. Many
volunteers are involved in work which
improves the quality of life in their local
communities or, more widely, give their time
to help organise events or groups in areas as
diverse as social welfare, education, sport and
the arts. A very large number of volunteers
are involved in activities to protect or
improve the environment, working, for
example, for the National Trust, which has
over 2 million members (see p. 359). The
Government greatly values the voluntary
sector’s contribution to society and, as a
result, is keen to encourage productive
partnerships between the statutory and
voluntary sectors. For example, voluntary
organisations are important providers of
government-supported employment and
training services for unemployed people.
‘Make a Difference ’ Initiative
The Home Office Voluntary Services Unit
co-ordinates government policy towards the
voluntary sector throughout Britain. It also
aims to support a healthy and cost-effective
voluntary sector and to promote volunteering.
Its ‘Make a Difference’ initiative, launched in
1994, brings together the business, voluntary
and public sectors to develop effective local
voluntary action. As one aspect of the initiative,
a nationwide telephone helpline was set up in
March 1995. This aims to provide callers
throughout Britain with information on how
to get involved with local voluntary initiatives.
The report of a team responsible for
drawing up a national strategy on volunteering
was published in June 1995. The Government
is considering its recommendations.
Funding
Voluntary organisations receive income from
several sources, including contributions from
individuals, businesses and trusts; central and
local government grants; and earnings from
commercial activities and investments. They
also receive fees (from central and local
government) for those services which are
provided on a contractual basis. In 1993-94
direct grants to voluntary organisations from
government amounted to £612 million.
Tax changes in recent budgets have
helped the voluntary sector secure more
funds from industry and individuals. The
Gift Aid scheme provides tax relief on single
cash donations of more than £250. By March
1995 charities had received donations of more
than £1,000 million under the scheme and
had claimed tax repayments of £340 million
on them. Employees can also make tax-free
donations to charity from their earnings. The
Payroll Giving scheme provides tax relief on
donations of up to £900 a year.
Charities
In England and Wales nearly 178,700 charities
are registered with the Charity Commission.
The Commission also gives advice to trustees
of charities on their administration.
Organisations may qualify for charitable status
if they are established for exclusively
charitable purposes such as the relief of
poverty, the advancement of education or
religion, or the promotion of certain other
purposes of public benefit. These may include
good community relations, the prevention of
racial discrimination, the protection of health
and the promotion of equal opportunity. The
Charity Commission also has a statutory
responsibility to ensure that charities make
effective use of their resources.
By August 1995, National Lottery
proceeds available to the distributing
body for charities, the National
Lottery Charities Board, had
reached £172 million. In its initial
grants programme, the Board will
concentrate on people in Britain
disadvantaged by poverty. Charities
are also eligible to apply to the
other distributing bodies to support
projects that meet the criteria of
those bodies.

"Mostly donations but also includes other funds such as legacies and proceeds of charity shops.
The Charities Acts 1992 and 1993
strengthened the Commissioners’ power to
investigate and supervise, so increasing their
accountability. For example, new measures to
protect charities and donors from bogus fund¬
raisers came into force in March 1995. The
changes will enable people who buy goods in
aid of charity to know how much of what
they pay will go to that charity.
The Charities Aid Foundation, an
independent body, is one of the main
organisations that aid the flow of funds to
charity from individuals, companies and
grant-making trusts.
Umbrella Organisations
The National Council for Voluntary
Organisations is one of the main co¬
ordinating bodies in England, providing close
links between voluntary organisations,
government departments, local authorities, the
European Commission and the private sector;
around 650 national voluntary organisations
are members. It also protects the interests and
independence of voluntary agencies, and
provides them with advice, information and
other services. Councils in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland perform similar
functions. The National Association of
Councils for Voluntary Service is another
umbrella organisation providing resources,
with over 230 local councils for voluntary
service throughout England. Their role is to
encourage the development of local voluntary
action, mainly in urban areas. The rural
equivalent is Action with Communities in
Rural England, representing 38 rural
community councils.
Leisure Trends
About 14 per cent of total household
expenditure went on leisure goods and
services in 1993. The most common leisure
activities are home-based, or social, such as
visiting relatives or friends. Television
viewing is by far the most popular leisure
pastime, and nearly all households have a
television set, with 96 per cent in 1992
having a colour set. Average viewing time is
nearly 27 hours a week. Around 73 per cent
of households now have at least one video
recorder, compared with 30 per cent in 1985.
Listening to radio has been increasing, and
averages over 10 hours a week. Purchases of
compact discs have risen very rapidly, and
in 1992 for the first time exceeded the sales
of audio cassettes. The proportion of
households with a compact disc player has
grown considerably, from 15 per cent in
1989 to 46 per cent in 1994.
Other popular pursuits include: reading,
do-it-yourself home improvements, gardening
and going out for a meal, for a drink or to
the cinema. About half of households have a
pet, the most common being dogs and cats,
with roughly 7 million of each in Britain.
39
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Holidays
In 1994, 60 per cent of the adult population
took at least one long holiday of four or more
nights away from home. The number of long
holidays taken by British residents was 58
million, of which 31.5 million were taken in
Britain. The most frequented free attraction
was Blackpool Pleasure Beach (Lancashire),
with an estimated 7.2 million visitors. The
most popular destinations for summer holidays
are the West Country, Scotland and Wales.
In 1994 the most popular destinations for
overseas holidays by British residents were:
• France (12 per cent);
• mainland Spain (11 per cent);
• the United States (8 per cent); and
• mainland Greece (1 per cent).
In all, British residents took 26.3 million
long holidays overseas in 1994, of which 57
per cent involved ‘package’ arrangements.
About 77 per cent of all holidays abroad are
taken in Europe, although more people are
taking holidays further afield, for example to
the United States. The proportion of adults
taking two or more holidays a year was 26 per
cent in 1994.

The system of parliamentary government in Britain is not based on a written
constitution, but is the result of gradual evolution over many centuries. The
Monarchy is the oldest institution of government, dating back to at least the
ninth century. Parliament is one of the oldest representative assemblies in
the world. In government among the most significant recent developments
have been the steps taken to improve management. New management
structures—such as the creation of executive agencies—have been developed;
competition has been introduced or extended; and arrangements for pay are
changing. The aim of all these changes is to safeguard and improve the
standards of the public services.
Development of the British
System of Government
The growth of political institutions in
England can be traced back to the period of
Saxon rule, which lasted from the fifth
century ad until the Norman Conquest in
1066 (see p. 6). This period saw the origins
of the institution of kingship, and of the idea
that the king should seek the advice of a
council of prominent men.
The period of Norman rule after 1066 saw
a considerable strengthening of royal power.
However, the monarchy eventually experienced
difficulties in controlling the growing
machinery of government. The actions of
King John (1199-1216) led to opposition
from the nobility and leading figures in the
Church. In 1215 the barons forced the King
to agree to a series of concessions embodied
in a charter which became known as Magna
Carta. The charter, which provided for the
protection of the rights of freemen against
the abuse of royal power, came to be
regarded as the key expression of the rights
of the community against the Crown.
The first known occurrence of the term
‘Parliament’ to describe the meetings of
nobles to advise the king is in 1236; by the
late 13th century representatives of counties
and towns were also occasionally being
summoned at the same time, usually to
express political support, but increasingly to
give consent to taxation. By the end of the
15th century Parliament existed in a form
virtually recognisable today: as a body whose
function was to agree to taxes and to legislate,
and which consisted of two separate
chambers—the House of Commons and the
House of Lords.
Although the influence of government in
43
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parliament was considerable, the body was
always an area for political conflict; one such
clash led to the outbreak of the Civil War in
1642 between Crown and Parliament.
Following the defeat of the royalist armies
and the execution of Charles I in 1649, the
Monarchy and the House of Lords were
abolished and the country was proclaimed a
republic. However, the republican experiment
came to an end in 1660, two years after the
death of the ‘Lord Protector’, Oliver
Cromwell. Charles Fs son was restored to the
throne as Charles II.
Charles IPs successor, James II (James VII
of Scotland: 1685-88), sought both to bypass
Parliament and to make it more amenable. As
a result, in 1688 a group of leading men
invited William of Orange (a grandson of
Charles I and the husband of Mary, James’s
eldest daughter) to ‘secure the infringed
liberties’ of the country. James fled into exile.
Following the success of the revolution of
1688, Parliament in 1689 passed the Bill of
Rights, which defined the rights and
privileges of Parliament.
Increasingly thereafter parliamentary
control of national finance made it
impracticable for the Sovereign to ignore the
wishes of Parliament. Ministers were
appointed by the Sovereign, but they had to
have sufficient support in the House of
Commons to enable them to persuade
Parliament to pass legislation and vote for
taxation. The development of ‘party’ during
the 18th and 19th centuries provided them
with the machinery for securing that support,
while the personal involvement of the
Monarch in policy and the day-to-day
business of administration declined, leaving
government in the hands of the cabinet,
presided over by a ‘Prime’ Minister.
Since the mid-19th century the Prime
Minister has normally been the leader of the
party with a majority in the House of Commons.
The Reform Act of 1832 altered the
medieval system of parliamentary
representation and standardised the
qualifications for the right to vote.
Subsequent reforms gave the vote to virtually
all adults—women were finally enfranchised
in 1918, but not on the same terms as men
until 1928.
The British Constitution
The British constitution is to a large extent a
product of the historical events described
above. Unlike the constitutions of most other
countries, it is not set out in any single
document. Instead it is made up of statute law,
common law and conventions. (Conventions
are rules and practices which are not legally
enforceable but which are regarded as
indispensable to the working of government.)
The constitution can be altered by Act of
Parliament, or by general agreement, and is
thus adaptable to changing political conditions.
The organs of government overlap but can
be clearly distinguished. Parliament is the
legislature and the supreme authority. The
executive consists of:
• the Government—the Cabinet and other
ministers responsible for national policies;
• government departments and agencies,
responsible for national administration;
• local authorities, responsible for many
local services; and
• public corporations, responsible for
operating particular nationalised
industries or other bodies, subject to
ministerial control.
The judiciary (see Chapter 8) determines
common law and interprets statutes.
The Monarchy
The Monarchy is the oldest institution of
government, going back to at least the ninth
century. Queen Elizabeth II is herself directly
descended from King Egbert, who united
England under his rule in 829. The only
interruption in the history of the Monarchy
was the republic which lasted from 1649 to
1660 (see above).
Today the Queen is not only head of
State, but also an important symbol of
national unity. The royal title in Britain is:
‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith .

of Commonwealth states1. In each such state
the Queen is represented by a Governor-
General, appointed by her on the advice of
the ministers of the country concerned and
completely independent of the British
Government. In each case the form of the
royal title varies. Other Commonwealth states
are republics or have their own monarchies.
In British dependent territories (see
p. 117) the Queen is usually represented by
governors, who are responsible to the British
Government for the administration of the
countries concerned.
Succession
The title to the Crown is derived partly
from statute and partly from common law
rules of descent. Despite interruptions in the
direct line of succession, the hereditary
principle upon which it was founded has
always been preserved.
Sons of the Sovereign have precedence
over daughters in succeeding to the throne.
When a daughter succeeds, she becomes
Queen Regnant, and has the same powers as a
king. The consort of a king takes her
husband’s rank and style, becoming Queen.
The constitution does not give any special
rank or privileges to the husband of a Queen
Regnant, although in practice he fdls an
important role in the life of the nation, as
does the Duke of Edinburgh.
Under the Act of Settlement of 1700,
which formed part of the Revolution
Settlement following the events of 1688 (see
p. 44), only Protestant descendants of a
granddaughter of James I of England and VI
of Scotland (Princess Sophia, the Electress of
Hanover) are eligible to succeed. The order of
'The other Commonwealth states of which the Queen is head of
state are: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados,
Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, St Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St Vincent and
the Grenadines, Solomon Islands and I uvalu.
succession can be altered only by common
consent of the countries of the Commonwealth.
Accession
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as soon
as his or her predecessor dies: there is no
interregnum. He or she is at once proclaimed
at an Accession Council, to which all
members of the Privy Council (see p. 63) are
summoned. The Lords Spiritual and
Temporal (see p. 50), the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen and other leading citizens of the
City of London are also invited.
Coronation
The Sovereign’s coronation follows the
accession after a convenient interval. The
ceremony takes place at Westminster Abbey
in London, in the presence of representatives
of the Houses of Parliament and of all the
great public organisations in Britain. The
Prime Ministers and leading members of the
other Commonwealth nations and
representatives of other countries also attend.
The Monarch’s Role in Government
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she
is head of the executive, an integral part of
the legislature, head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of
the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of the
established Church of England. As a result of
a long process of evolution, during which the
Monarchy’s absolute power has been
progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the
advice of her ministers. Britain is governed
by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of
the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a
trend during the past hundred years towards
giving powers directly to ministers, the
Queen still takes part in some important acts
of government. These include summoning,
proroguing (discontinuing until the next
session without dissolution) and dissolving
Parliament; and giving Royal Assent to Bills
passed by Parliament. The Queen also
formally appoints many important office
holders, including government ministers,
46
GOVERNMENT
judges, officers in the armed forces,
governors, diplomats, bishops and some other
senior clergy of the Church of England. She
is also involved in pardoning people
convicted of crimes; and in conferring
peerages, knighthoods and other honours.2 An
important function is appointing the Prime
Minister (see p. 61). In international affairs
the Queen, as head of State, has the power to
declare war and make peace, to recognise
foreign states and governments, to conclude
treaties and to annex or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as appointing
the Prime Minister), acts involving the use of
‘royal prerogative’ powers are now performed
by government ministers, who are responsible
to Parliament and can be questioned about
particular policies. Parliamentary authority is
not required for the exercise of these
prerogative powers, although Parliament may
restrict or abolish such rights.
The Queen continues to play a role in the
working of government. She holds Privy
Council meetings, gives audiences to her
ministers and officials in Britain and overseas,
receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs state papers. She must
be consulted on every aspect of national life,
and must show complete impartiality.
Provision has been made to appoint a
regent to perform these royal functions
should the Queen be totally incapacitated.
The regent would be the Queen’s eldest son,
the Prince of Wales, then those, in order of
succession to the throne, aged 18 or over. In
the event of her partial incapacity or absence
abroad, the Queen may delegate certain royal
functions to the Counsellors of State (the
Duke of Edinburgh, the four adults next in
line of succession, and the Queen Mother).
However, Counsellors of State may not, for
instance, dissolve Parliament (except on the
Queen’s instructions), nor create peers.
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremonial has always been associated with
the British monarchy, and, in spite of
Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her
personally—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle,
the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.
changes in the outlook of both the Sovereign
and the people, many traditional ceremonies
continue to take place. Royal marriages and
royal funerals are marked by public
ceremony, and the Sovereign’s birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the
Colour on Horse Guards Parade. State
banquets take place when a foreign monarch
or head of State visits Britain; investitures are
held at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Scotland to bestow
honours; and royal processions add
significance to such occasions as the state
opening of Parliament.
Each year the Queen and other members
of the Royal Family visit many parts of
Britain. They are also closely involved in the
work of many charities. For example, the
Prince of Wales is actively involved in the
Youth Business Trust, set up to encourage
small firms and self employment in inner
cities, while the Princess Royal is President of
the Save the Children Fund and takes an
active interest in third world development
issues. The Queen pays state visits to
foreign governments, accompanied by the
Duke of Edinburgh. She also tours the
other countries of the Commonwealth.
Other members of the Royal Family pay
official visits overseas, occasionally
representing the Queen.
Royal Income and Expenditure
Until 1760 the Sovereign had to provide for
payment of all government expenses,
including the salaries of officials and the
expenses of the royal palaces and households.
These were met from hereditary revenues,
mainly income from Crown lands, and
income from some other sources granted to
the Monarch by Parliament. The income
from these sources eventually proved
inadequate and in 1760 George III turned
over to the Government most of the
hereditary revenue. In return he received an
annual grant (Civil List), from which he
continued to pay royal expenditure of a
personal character, the salaries of government
officials, the costs of royal palaces, and
certain pensions. The latter charges were
removed from the Civil List in 1830.
47
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Present Arrangements
Today the expenditure incurred by the
Queen in carrying out her public duties is
financed from the Civil List and from
government departments—which meet the
cost of, for example, the Royal Yacht and the
aircraft of No. 32 (the Royal) Squadron. All
such expenditure is approved by Parliament.
In 1991 Civil List payments were fixed at
£7.9 million a year for ten years. About
three-quarters of the Queen’s Civil List
provision is required to meet the cost of staff.
They deal with, among other things, state
papers and correspondence, and the
organisation of state occasions, visits and
other public engagements undertaken by the
Queen in Britain and overseas. The Queen’s
private expenditure as Sovereign is met from
the Privy Purse, which is financed mainly
from the revenue of the Duchy of Lancaster;3
her expenditure as a private individual is met
from her own personal resources.
Under the Civil List Acts, other members
of the Royal Family also receive annual
parliamentary allowances to enable them to
carry out their public duties. The Prince of
Wales, however, receives no such allowance,
since as Duke of Cornwall he is entitled to
the income of the estate of the Duchy of
Cornwall. Each year the Queen refunds the
government for all annuities paid to members
of the Royal Family except the Queen
Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Since April 1993 the Queen has
voluntarily paid income tax on all her
personal income and on that part of the Privy
Purse income which is used for private
purposes. The Queen also pays tax on any
realised capital gains on her private
investments and on the private proportion of
assets in the Privy Purse. Inheritance tax
will not, however, apply to transfers from
one sovereign to his or her successor,
although any personal bequests other than to
the successor will be subject to inheritance
tax. In line with these changes the Prince of
Wales pays income tax on the income from

always been enjoyed by the reigning Sovereign. It is kept quite
apart from his or her other possessions and is separately

the Duchy of Cornwall to the extent that it
is used for private purposes.
Parliament
Origins of Parliament
The medieval kings were expected to meet all
royal expenses, private and public, out of their
own revenue. If extra resources were needed for
an emergency, such as a war, the Sovereign
would seek to persuade his barons, in the Great
Council—a gathering of leading men which met
several times a year—to grant aid. During the
13th century several kings found the private
revenues and baronial aids insufficient to meet
the expenses of government. They therefore
summoned not only the great feudal magnates
but also representatives of counties, cities and
towns, primarily to get their assent to
extraordinary taxation. In this way the Great
Council came to include those who were
summoned by name (those who, broadly
speaking, were to form the House of Lords)
and those who were representatives of
communities—the commons. The two parts,
together with the Sovereign, became known
as ‘Parliament’ (the term originally meant a
meeting for parley or discussion).
Over the course of time the commons
began to realise the strength of their position.
By the middle of the 14th century the
formula had appeared which in substance was
the same as that used nowadays in voting
supplies to the Crown—that is, money to the
government—namely, cby the Commons with
the advice of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal’. In 1407 Henry IV pledged that
henceforth all money grants should be
approved by the House of Commons before
being considered by the Lords.
A similar advance was made in the
legislative field. Originally the King’s
legislation needed only the assent of his
councillors. Starting with the right of
individual commoners to present petitions,
the Commons as a body gained the right to
submit collective petitions. Later, during the
15th century, they gained the right to
participate in giving their requests—their
‘Bills’—the form of law.
48
GOVERNMENT
The subsequent development of the power
of the House of Commons was built upon
these foundations. The constitutional
developments of the 17th century (see p. 44)
led to Parliament securing its position as the
supreme legislative authority.
The Powers of Parliament
The three elements which make up
Parliament—the Queen, the House of Lords
and the elected House of Commons—are
constituted on different principles. They
meet together only on occasions of symbolic
significance such as the state opening of
Parliament, when the Commons are
summoned by the Queen to the House of
Lords. The agreement of all three elements is
normally required for legislation, but that of
the Queen is given as a matter of course.
Parliament can legislate for Britain as a
whole, or for any part of the country. It can
also legislate for the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies
and not part of Britain. They have local
legislatures which make laws on island affairs
(see p. 7).
As there are no legal restraints imposed by
a written constitution, Parliament may
legislate as it pleases, subject to Britain’s
obligations as a member of the European
Union. It can make or change any law, and
overturn established conventions or turn
them into law. It can even prolong its own
life beyond the normal period without
consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not
assert its supremacy in this way. Its members
bear in mind the common law and normally
act in accordance with precedent. The House
of Commons is directly responsible to the
electorate, and in this century the House of
Lords has recognised the supremacy of the
elected chamber. The system of party
government helps to ensure that Parliament
legislates with its responsibility to the
electorate in mind.
The European Union
As a member of the European Union, Britain
recognises the various types of Community
legislation and wider policies. It sends 87
elected members to the European Parliament
(see p. 114).
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are:
• to pass laws;
• to provide, by voting for taxation, the
means of carrying on the work of
government;
• to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
• to debate the major issues of the day.
In carrying out these functions Parliament
helps to bring the relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament
is also informed before all important
international treaties and agreements are
ratified. The making of treaties is, however, a
royal prerogative exercised on the advice of
the Government and is not subject to
parliamentary approval.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five
years, but in practice general elections are
usually held before the end of this term. The
maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation in rare circumstances such as the
two world wars. Parliament is dissolved and
writs for a general election are ordered by the
Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into
sessions. Each usually lasts for one year—
normally beginning and ending in October or
November. There are ‘adjournments’ at
night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the late Spring Bank Holiday, and during a
long summer break usually starting in late
July. The average number of ‘sitting’ days in
a session is about 165 in the House of
Commons and about 140 in the House of
Lords. At the start of each session the
Queen’s speech to Parliament outlines the
Government’s policies and proposed
legislative programme. Each session is ended
by prorogation. Parliament then ‘stands
49
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
prorogued’ for about a week until the new
session opens. Prorogation brings to an end
nearly all parliamentary business: in
particular, public Bills which have not been
passed by the end of the session are lost.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of the Lords
Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The
Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of
Canterbury and York, the Bishops of
London, Durham and Winchester, and the
21 next most senior diocesan bishops of the
Church of England. The Lords Temporal
consist of:
• all hereditary peers of England, Scotland,
Great Britain and the United Kingdom
(but not peers of Ireland);
• life peers created to assist the House in
its judicial duties (Lords of Appeal or
‘law lords’)4; and
• all other life peers.
Hereditary peerages carry a right to sit in
the House provided holders establish their
claim and are aged 21 years or over.
However, anyone succeeding to a peerage
may, within 12 months of succession,
disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime.
Disclaimants lose their right to sit in the
House but gain the right to vote and stand as
candidates at parliamentary elections. When a
disclaimant dies, the peerage passes on down
the family in the usual way.
Peerages, both hereditary and life, are
created by the Sovereign on the advice of the
Prime Minister. They are usually granted in
recognition of service in politics or other
walks of life or because one of the political
parties wishes to have the recipient in the
House of Lords. The House also provides a
place in Parliament for people who offer
useful advice, but do not wish to be involved
in party politics.
Peers who attend the House (the average
daily attendance is some 360) receive no
salary for their parliamentary work, but can

Britain and for criminal cases in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
claim for expenses incurred in attending the
House (for which there are maximum daily
rates) and certain travelling expenses.
Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, who takes his place on the
woolsack5 as ex-officio Speaker of the House.
In his absence his place is taken by a deputy.
The first of the deputy speakers is the
Chairman of Committees, who is appointed
at the beginning of each session and normally
chairs Committees of the Whole House and
some domestic committees. The Chairman
and the Principal Deputy Chairman of
Committees are the only Lords who receive
salaries as officers of the House.
In mid-1995 there were 1,194 members of
the House of Lords, including the two
archbishops and 24 bishops. The Lords
Temporal consisted of 754 hereditary peers
who had succeeded to their titles, 15
hereditary peers who had had their titles
conferred on them (including the Prince of
Wales), and 399 life peers, of whom 24 were
‘law lords’. i
The potential membership of the House of
Lords is about 1,200, but this number is
reduced by about 75 by a scheme which
allows peers who do not wish to attend to
apply for leave of absence for the duration of
a Parliament. In addition some hereditary
peers do not establish their claim to succeed
and so do not receive a writ of summons
entitling them to sit in the House; there were
around 77 such peers in mid-1995.
The Clerk of the Parliaments is
responsible for the records of proceedings of
the House of Lords and for the text of Acts
of Parliament. He is the accounting officer
for the cost of the House, and is in charge of
the administrative staff of the House, known
as the Parliament Office. The Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod, usually known as
‘Black Rod’, is responsible for security,
accommodation and services in the House of
Lords’ part of the Palace of Westminster.
’The woolsack is a seat in the form of a large cushion stuffed
with wool from several Commonwealth countries; it is a tradition
dating from the medieval period, when wool was the chief source
of the country’s wealth.
50
GOVERNMENT
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is elected by
universal adult suffrage (see below) and
consists of 651 Members of Parliament
(MPs). In mid-1995 there were 63 women,
three Asian and three black MPs. Of the 651
seats, 524 are for England, 38 for Wales, 72
for Scotland, and 17 for Northern Ireland.
General elections are held after a
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Queen. When an MP dies
or resigns,6 or is given a peerage, a by-
election takes place. Members are paid an
annual salary of £33,189 and an office costs
allowance of up to £41,308. There are also
a number of other allowances, including
travel allowances, a supplement for
London members and, for provincial
members, subsistence allowances and
allowances for second homes. (For ministers’
salaries see p. 62.)
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons
is the Speaker, elected by MPs to preside
over the House. Other officers include the
Chairman of Ways and Means and two
deputy chairmen, who act as Deputy
Speakers. They are elected by the House on
the nomination of the Government but are
drawn from the Opposition as well as the
government party. They, like the Speaker,
neither speak nor vote other than in their
official capacity. Responsibility for the
administration of the House rests with the
House of Commons Commission, a statutory
body chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs)
include the Clerk of the House of Commons,
who is the principal adviser to the Speaker
on its privileges and procedures. The Clerk’s
departmental responsibilities relate to the
conduct of the business of the House and its
committees. The Clerk is also accounting
officer for the House. The Serjeant-at-Arms,
who waits upon the Speaker, carries out
6An MP who wishes to resign from the House can do so only by

certain orders of the House. He is also the
official housekeeper of the Commons’ part
of the building, and is responsible for
security. Other officers serve the House in
the Library, the Department of the Official
Report (Hansard), the Finance and
Administration Department and the
Refreshment Department.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes Britain is divided
into constituencies, each of which returns
one member to the House of Commons.
To ensure that constituency electorates are
kept roughly equal, four permanent
Parliamentary Boundary Commissions, one
each for England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland, keep constituencies
under review. They recommend any
adjustment of seats that may seem
necessary in the light of population
movements or other changes. Reviews are
conducted every eight to 12 years. Elections
are by secret ballot.
The last general review of
constituencies began in 1991. The
reports of the Commissions for
Scotland and for Wales were
approved by Parliament in April 1995,
the report for England was approved
in June 1995, and that for Northern
Ireland was submitted in June 1995.
Following this review, the number
of seats will increase from 651 to
659: England will get an extra five
seats. Wales two and Northern
Ireland one. The new boundaries
will come into effect after the
dissolution of Parliament at the next
general election.
Voters
British citizens, together with citizens of
other Commonwealth countries and citizens
of the Irish Republic resident in Britain,
may vote provided they are:
• aged 18 or over;
51
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• included in the annual register of electors
for the constituency; and
• not subject to any disqualification.
People not entitled to vote include
members of the House of Lords, patients
detained under mental health legislation,
sentenced prisoners and people convicted
within the previous five years of corrupt or
illegal election practices. Members of the
armed forces, Crown servants and staff of the
British Council employed overseas (together
with their wives or husbands if accompanying
them) may be registered for an address in the
constituency where they would live but for
their service. British citizens living abroad
may apply to register as electors for a period
of 20 years after they have left Britain.
Voting Procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in
person at a polling station. Electors whose
circumstances on polling day are such that
they cannot reasonably be expected to vote in
person at their local polling station for
example, electors away on holiday—may
apply for an absent vote at a particular
election. Electors who are physically
incapacitated or unable to vote in person
because of the nature of their work or because
they have moved to a new area may apply for
an indefinite absent vote. People entitled to
an absent vote may vote by post or by proxy,
although postal ballot papers cannot be sent
to addresses outside Britain.
Voting is not compulsory; 76.6 per cent of
a total electorate of 43.3 million people voted
in the general election in April 1992. The
simple majority system of voting is used.
Candidates are elected if they have more
votes than any of the other candidates
(although not necessarily an absolute majority
over all other candidates).
Candidates
British citizens and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand for
election as MPs provided they are aged 21 or
over and are not disqualified. Those
disqualified include undischarged bankrupts;
people sentenced to more than one year’s
imprisonment; clergy of the Church of
England, Church of Scotland, Church of
Ireland and Roman Catholic Church; peers;
and holders of certain offices listed in the
House of Commons Disqualification Act
1975. A candidate’s nomination for election
must be proposed and seconded by two
electors registered as voters in the
constituency and signed by eight other electors.
Candidates do not have to be backed by a
political party. A candidate must also deposit
£500, which is returned if he or she receives
5 per cent or more of the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may
spend on a general election campaign is
£4,642 plus 3.9 pence for each elector in a
borough constituency, or 5.2 pence for each
elector in a county constituency. Higher
limits have been set for by-elections in order
to reflect the fact that they are often regarded
as tests of national opinion in the period
between general elections. The maximum
sum is £18,572 plus 15.8 pence for each
elector in borough seats, and 20.8 pence for
each elector in county seats. A candidate
may post an election communication to each
elector in the constituency free of charge. All
election expenses, apart from the candidate’s
personal expenses, are subject to the
statutory limit.
The Political Party System
The party system, which has existed in one
form or another since the 18th century, is an
essential element in the working of the
constitution. The present system depends
upon the existence of organised political
parties, each of which presents its policies to
the electorate for approval. The parties are
not registered nor formally recognised in law,
but in practice most candidates in elections,
and almost all winning candidates, belong to
one of the main parties.
For the last 150 years a predominantly
two-party system has existed. Since 1945
either the Conservative Party, whose origins
go back to the 18th century, or the Labour
Party, which emerged in the last decade of
the 19th century, has held power. A new
party—the Liberal Democrats—was formed
52
GOVERNMENT
in 1988 when the Liberal Party, which traced
its origins to the 18th century, merged with
the Social Democratic Party, formed in 1981.
? Other parties include two nationalist parties,
Plaid Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and
the Scottish National Party (founded in
1934). In Northern Ireland there are a
number of parties. They include the Ulster
Unionist Party, formed in the early part of
this century; the Ulster Democratic Unionist
Party, founded in 1971 by a group which
broke away from the Ulster Unionists; and
the Social Democratic and Labour Party,
founded in 1970.
Since 1945 eight general elections have
been won by the Conservative Party and six
by the Labour Party; the great majority of
members of the House of Commons have
belonged to one of these two parties. The
results of the general election of April 1992
are shown in Table 7.1.
The party which wins most seats
(although not necessarily the most votes) at a
general election, or which has the support of
a majority of members in the House of
Commons, usually forms the Government.
By tradition, the leader of the majority party
is asked by the Sovereign to form a
government. About 100 of its members in the
House of Commons and the House of Lords
receive ministerial appointments (including
appointment to the Cabinet—see p. 62) on
the advice of the Prime Minister. The
largest minority party becomes the official
Opposition, with its own leader and
‘shadow cabinet’.
The Party System in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition
sit on the front benches of the Commons
with their supporters (the backbenchers)
sitting behind them.
Similar arrangements for the parties also
apply to the House of Lords; however, a
significant number of Lords do not wish to
be associated with any political party, and sit
on the ‘cross-benches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in
Parliament rests largely on the relationship
between the Government and the opposition
parties. Depending on the relative strengths
of the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition may seek to overthrow the
Government by defeating it in a vote on a
‘matter of confidence’. In general, however,
its aims are to contribute to the formulation
of policy and legislation by constructive
criticism; to oppose government proposals it
considers objectionable; to seek amendments
to government Bills; and to put forward its
own policies in order to improve its chances
of winning the next general election.
The detailed arrangements of
government business are settled, under the
direction of the Prime Minister and the
Leaders of the two Houses, by the
Government Chief Whip in consultation with
the Opposition Chief Whip. The Chief
Whips together constitute the ‘usual
channels’ often referred to when the question
of finding time for a particular item of
business is discussed. The Leaders of the two

Houses are responsible for enabling the
Houses to debate matters about which they
are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is
exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside, it is exercised by the
Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
chosen within the party. Their duties include
keeping members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the
party’s voting strength by ensuring members
attend important debates, and passing on to
the party leadership the opinions of
backbench members. Party discipline tends to
be less strong in the Lords than in the
Commons, since Lords have less hope of
high office and no need of party support
in elections.
The formal title of the Government Chief
Whip in the Commons is Parliamentary
Secretary to the Treasury. Of the othet
Government Whips, three are officers of the
Royal Household (one of these is Deputy
Chief Whip), five hold titular posts as
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury and
five are Assistant Whips. The Opposition
Chief Whips in both Houses and two of the
Opposition Assistant Whips in the
Commons receive salaries. The Government
Whips in the Lords hold offices in the
Royal Household; they also act as
government spokesmen.
Financial Assistance to Parties
Annual assistance from public funds helps
opposition parties carry out parliamentary
work at Westminster. It is limited to parties
which had at least two members elected at the
previous general election or one member
elected and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast.
The amount for the period 1 April 1995 to
31 March 1996 is £3,442.5 for every seat won
at the 1992 general election, plus £6.89 for
every 200 votes.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom
and precedent, partly codified by each House
in its Standing Orders. The system of debate
is similar in both Houses. Every subject starts
off as a proposal or ‘motion’ by a member.
After debate, in which each member may
speak only once, the motion may be
withdrawn: if it is not, the Speaker or
Chairman ‘puts the question’ whether to
agree with the motion or not. The question
may be decided without voting, or by a
simple majority vote. The main difference of
procedure between the two Houses is that the
Speaker or Chairman in the Lords has no
powers of order; instead such matters are
decided by the general feeling of the House.
In the Commons the Speaker has full
authority to enforce the rules of the House
and must guard against the abuse of
procedure and protect minority rights. The
Speaker has discretion on whether to allow a
motion to end discussion so that a matter
may be put to the vote and has powers to put
a stop to irrelevance and repetition in debate,
and to save time in other ways. In cases of
grave disorder the Speaker can adjourn or
suspend the sitting. The Speaker may order
members who have broken the rules of
behaviour of the House to leave the
Chamber or can initiate their suspension for
a period of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the
Commons and announces the final result. In
a tied vote the Speaker gives a casting vote,
without expressing an opinion on the merits
of the question. The voting procedure in
the House of Lords is broadly similar,
although the Lord Chancellor does not have
a casting vote.
Financial Interests
The Commons has a public register of MPs’
financial interests. Members with a financial
interest in a debate in the House must
declare it when speaking. If the interest is
direct, immediate and personal, the member
cannot vote on the issue. In other
proceedings of the House or in dealings
with other members, ministers or civil
servants, MPs must also disclose any relevant
financial interest.
There is no register of financial interests
in the Lords, but Lords speaking in a debate
in which they have a direct interest are
expected to declare it.
54
GOVERNMENT
Public Access to Parliamentary Proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally
public. The minutes and speeches
(transcribed verbatim in Hansard, the official
report) are published daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and
of the Commons from 1547, together with the
parliamentary and political papers of a
number of former members of both Houses,
are available to the public through the House
of Lords Record Office.
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television
and radio, either live or, more usually, in
recorded or edited form. Complete coverage
is available on cable television.
The Law-making Process
Statute law consists of Acts of Parliament and
delegated legislation made by ministers under
powers given to them by Act (see p. 57).
While the law undergoes constant refinement
in the courts, changes to statute law are made
by Parliament.
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary
Bills. Proposals for legislation affecting the
powers of particular bodies (such as local
authorities) or the rights of individuals (such
as certain proposals relating to railways, roads
and harbours) are known as Private Bills, and
are subject to a special form of parliamentary
procedure. Bills which change the general law
and which constitute the significant part of
the parliamentary legislative process are
Public Bills.
Public Bills can be introduced into either
House, by a government minister or by an
ordinary (‘private’ or ‘backbench’) member.
Most Public Bills that become Acts of
Parliament are introduced by a government
Minister and are known as ‘Government Bills’.
Bills introduced by other members of Parliament
are known as ‘Private Members’ Bills.’
The main Bills which constitute the
Government’s legislative programme are
announced in the Queen’s Speech at the State
opening of Parliament, which usually takes
place in November, and the Bills themselves
are introduced into one or other of the
Houses over the succeeding weeks.
Before a government Bill is drafted, there
may be consultation with professional bodies,
voluntary organisations and other agencies
interested in the subject, and interest and
pressure groups which seek to promote
specific causes. Proposals for legislative
changes are sometimes set out in government
‘White Papers’, which may be debated in
Parliament before a Bill is introduced. From
time to time consultation papers, sometimes
called ‘Green Papers’, set out government
proposals which are still taking shape and
seek comments from the public.
Private Members' Bills
Early in each session backbench Members of
the Commons hold a ballot (draw lots) for
the opportunity to introduce a Bill on one of
the Fridays during the session on which such
Bills have precedence over government
business. The first 20 Members whose names
are drawn win this privilege, but it does not
guarantee that their Bills will pass into law.
Members may also present a Bill on any day
without debate, and on most Tuesdays and
Wednesdays on which the Commons is
sitting there is also an opportunity to seek
leave to present a Bill under the ‘ten minute
rule’, which provides an opportunity for a
brief speech by the Member proposing the Bill
(and by one who opposes it). Few of these Bills
make further progress or receive any debate,
but in most sessions a few do become law.
Recent examples include the Marriage Act
1994, the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994
and the Building Societies (Joint Account
Holders) Act 1995. Private Members’ Bills do
not often call for the expenditure of public
money; but if they do they cannot proceed to
committee stage unless the Government decides
to provide the necessary money resolution.
Peers may introduce Private Members’ Bills
in the House of Lords at any time. A Private
Members’ Bill passed by either House will
not proceed in the other House unless it is
taken up by a member of that House.
Passage of Public Bills
Public Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Bills relating mainly to financial
55
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
matters are almost invariably introduced in
the Commons. Under the provisions of the
Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the powers of
the Lords in relation to ‘money Bills’ are
very restricted. The Parliament Acts also
provide for a Bill to be passed by the
Commons without consent of the Lords in
certain (very rare) circumstances.
The process of passing a Public Bill is
similar in each House. On presentation the
Bill is considered, without debate, to have
been read a first time and is printed
(although a substantial number of Private
Members’ Bills are never printed). After an
interval, which may be between one day and
several weeks, a Government Bill will receive
its second reading debate, during which the
general principles of the Bill are discussed. If
it obtains a second reading in the Commons,
a Bill will normally be committed to a
standing committee (see p. 57) for detailed
examination and amendment. In the Lords,
the committee stage usually takes place on
the floor of the House, and this procedure
may also be followed in the Commons if that
House so decides (usually in cases where
there is a need to pass the Bill quickly or
where it raises matters of constitutional
importance). The Commons may also decide
to divide the committee stage of a Bill
between a standing committee and a committee
of the whole House (which is commonly the
case with the annual Finance Bill).
The committee stage is followed by the
report stage (‘consideration’) on the floor of
the House, during which further amendments
may be made. In the Commons, this is
usually followed immediately by the third
reading debate, where the Bill is reviewed in
its final form. In the Lords, a Bill may be
further amended at third reading.
After passing its third reading in one
House a Bill is sent to the other House,
where it passes through all the stages once
more, and where it is, more often than not,
further amended. Amendments made by the
second House must be agreed by the first, or
a compromise agreement reached, before a
Bill can go for Royal Assent.
In the Commons, the House may vote to
limit the time available for consideration of a
Bill. This is done by passing a ‘timetable’
motion proposed by the Government,
commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’.
There are special procedures for Public Bills
which consolidate existing legislation or which
enact private legislation relating to Scotland.
Royal Assent
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen
for Royal Assent, after which it is part of the
law of the land and known as an Act of
Parliament. Royal Assent takes the form of an
announcement rather than any signature or
mark on a copy of the Bill. The Royal Assent
has not been refused since 1707. (A list of the
main Public Bills receiving Royal Assent
since autumn 1994 is given on p. 537.)
Limitations on the Power of the Lords
Most Government Bills introduced and
passed in the Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty, but a Lords Bill
which was unacceptable to the Commons
would not become law. The Lords, on the
other hand, do not generally prevent Bills
insisted upon by the Commons from
becoming law, though they will often amend
them and return them for further
consideration by the Commons. By
convention the Lords pass Bills authorising
taxation or national expenditure without
amendment. Under the Parliament Acts 1911
and 1949, a Bill that deals only with taxation
or expenditure must become law within one
month of being sent to the Lords, whether or
not they agree to it, unless the Commons
directs otherwise. If no agreement is reached
between the two Houses on a non-financial
Commons Bill the Lords can delay the Bill
for a period which, in practice, amounts to at
least 13 months. Following this the Bill may
be submitted to the Queen for Royal Assent,
provided it has been passed a second time by
the Commons. The Parliament Acts make
one important exception: any Bill to lengthen
the life of a Parliament requires the full
assent of both Houses in the normal way.
The limits to the power of the Lords,
contained in the Parliament Acts, are based
on the belief that nowadays the main
56
GOVERNMENT
legislative function of the non-elected House is
to act as a chamber of revision, complementing
but not rivalling the elected House.
Delegated Legislation
In order to reduce unnecessary pressure on
parliamentary time, primary legislation often
gives ministers or other authorities the power
to regulate administrative details by means of
‘delegated’ or secondary legislation. To
minimise any risk that delegating powers to
the executive might undermine the authority
of Parliament, such powers are normally only
delegated to authorities directly accountable
to Parliament. Moreover, the Acts of
Parliament concerned usually provide for
some measure of direct parliamentary control
over proposed delegated legislation, by giving
Parliament the opportunity to affirm or annul
it. Certain Acts also require that organisations
affected must be consulted before rules and
orders can be made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports
on the technical propriety of these ‘statutory
instruments’. In order to save time on the
floor of the House, the Commons uses
standing committees to debate the merits of
instruments; actual decisions are taken by the
House. The House of Lords has appointed a
delegated powers scrutiny committee which
examines the appropriateness of the powers to
make secondary legislation in Bills as they
come before that House.
Private Legislation
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers.
They go through a similar procedure to
Public Bills, but most of the work is done in
committee, where procedures follow a semi¬
judicial pattern. The promoter must prove
the need for the powers sought and the
objections of opposing interests are heard.
Both sides may be legally represented. Hybrid
Bills are Public Bills which may affect private
rights. As with Private Bills, the passage of
hybrid Bills through Parliament is governed
by special procedures which allow those
affected to put their case.
Parliamentary Committees
Committees of the Whole House
Either House may pass a resolution setting
itself up as a committee of the whole House
to consider Bills in detail after their second
reading. This permits unrestricted discussion:
the general rule that an MP or Lord may
speak only once on each motion does not
apply in committee.
Standing Committees
House of Commons standing committees
debate and consider Public Bills at the
committee stage. The committee considers
the Bill clause by clause, and may amend it
before reporting it back to the House. The
standing committees include two Scottish
standing committees, and the Scottish, Welsh
and Northern Ireland Grand Committees.
Ordinary standing committees do not have
names but are referred to simply as Standing
Committee A, B, C, and so on; a new set of
members is appointed to them to consider
each Bill. Each committee has between 16
and 50 members, with a party balance
reflecting as far as possible that in the House
as a whole.
The Scottish Grand Committee comprises
all 72 Scottish members (and may be
convened anywhere in Scotland as well as at
Westminster). It may consider the principles
of Scottish Bills referred to it at second
reading stage. It also debates Scottish public
expenditure estimates and other matters
concerning Scotland. Since July 1994 these
have included questions tabled for oral
answer, ministerial statements and other
debates in addition to statutory instruments
referred to it.
The Welsh Grand Committee, with all 38
Welsh members and up to five others,
considers Bills referred to it at second
reading stage, and matters concerning Wales
only. Similarly, the Northern Ireland Grand
Committee debates matters relating
specifically to Northern Ireland. It includes
all 17 Northern Ireland members and up to
25 others.
There are also standing committees to
57
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
debate proposed European legislation, and to
scrutinise statutory instruments made by
the Government.
The Lords’ equivalent to a standing
committee, a Public Bill Committee, is rare!}
used; instead the committee stage of a Bill is
taken by the House as a whole.
Select Committees
Select committees are appointed for a
particular task, generally one of enquiry,
investigation and scrutiny. They report their
conclusions and recommendations to the
House as a whole; in many cases their
recommendations invite a response from the
Government, which is also reported to the
House. A select committee may be appointed
for a Parliament, or for a session, or for as
long as it takes to complete its task. To help
Parliament with the control of the executive
by examining aspects of public policy,
expenditure and administration, 17
committees, established by the House of
Commons, examine the work of the main
government departments and their associated
public bodies. The Foreign Affairs Select
Committee, for example, ‘shadows’ the work
of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. The
committees are constituted on a basis which
is in approximate proportion to party
strength in the House.
Other regular Commons select committees
include those on Public Accounts, European
Legislation, Members’ Interests, and the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
(the ‘Parliamentary Ombudsman’—see p. 60).
‘Domestic’ select committees also cover the
internal workings of Parliament.
In their examination of government
policies, expenditure and administration,
committees may question ministers, civil
servants, and interested bodies and
individuals. Through hearings and published
reports, they bring before Parliament and the
public an extensive body of fact and
informed opinion on many issues, and build
up considerable expertise in their subjects
of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal
and Appellate Committees, in which the bulk
of the House’s judicial work is transacted,
there are two major select committees (along
with several sub-committees), on the
European Community and on Science and
Technology. Ad hoc committees may also be
set up to consider particular issues, and
‘domestic’ committees—as in the Commons
cover the internal workings of the House.
Joint Committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn
from both Houses, are appointed in each
session to deal with Consolidation Bills and
delegated legislation. The two Houses may
also agree to set up joint select committees on
other subjects.
Party Committees
In addition to the official committees of the
two Houses there are several unofficial party
organisations or committees. The
Conservative and Unionist Members
Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of
the backbench membership of the party in
the House of Commons. When the
Conservative Party is in office, ministers
attend its meetings by invitation and not by
right. When the party is in opposition, the
whole membership of the party may attend
meetings. The then leader appoints a
consultative committee, which acts as the
party’s ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Parliamentary Labour Party
comprises all members of the party in both
Houses. When the Labour Party is in office,
a parliamentary committee, half of whose
members are elected and half of whom are
government representatives, acts as a channel
of communication between the Government
and its backbenchers in both Houses. When
the party is in opposition, the Parliamentary
Labour Party is organised under the direction
of an elected parliamentary committee, which
acts as the ‘shadow cabinet’.
Other Forms of Parliamentary Control
House of Commons
In addition to the system of scrutiny by
select committees, the House of Commons
58
GOVERNMENT
offers a number of opportunities for the
examination of government policy by both the
Opposition and the Government’s own
backbenchers. These include:
1. Question time, when for 55 minutes on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs’
questions. The Prime Minister’s question
time is every Tuesday and Thursday when
the House is sitting. Parliamentary
questions are one means of seeking
information about the Government’s
intentions. They are also a way of raising
grievances brought to MPs’ notice by
constituents. MPs may also put questions
to ministers for written answer; the
questions and answers are published in
Hansard. There are some 50,000 questions
every year.
2. Adjournment debates, when MPs use
motions for the adjournment of the House
to raise constituency cases or matters of
public concern. There is a half-hour
adjournment period at the end of the
business of the day, while immediately
before the adjournment for each recess
(Parliament’s Christmas, Easter, Whitsun
and summer breaks) a full day is spent
discussing issues raised by private
members. There are also adjournment
debates following the passage, three times
a year, of Consolidated Fund7 or
Appropriation Bills.8
In addition, an MP wishing to discuss
a ‘specific and important matter that
should have urgent consideration’ may, at
the end of question time, seek leave to
move the adjournment of the House. On
the very few occasions when leave is
obtained, the matter is debated for three
hours in what is known as an emergency
debate, usually on the following day.
3. Early day motions (EDMs) provide a
further opportunity for backbench MPs to
express their views on particular issues. A
number of EDMs are tabled each sitting
At least two Consolidated Fund Acts are passed each session
authorising the Treasury to make certain sums of money
available for the public service.

provided for particular items of expenditure.
day; they are very rarely debated but can
be useful in gauging the degree of support
for the topic by the number of signatures
of other MPs which the motion attracts.
4. The 20 Opposition days each session,
when the Opposition can choose subjects
for debate. Of these days, 17 are at the
disposal of the Leader of the Opposition
and three at the disposal of the second
largest opposition party.
5. Debates on three days in each session on
details of proposed government expenditure,
chosen by the Liaison Committee.
Procedural opportunities for criticism of
the Government also arise during the debate
on the Queen’s speech at the beginning of
each session; during debates on motions of
censure for which the Government provides
time; and during debates on the
Government’s legislative and other proposals.
House of Lords
Similar opportunities for criticism and
examination of government policy are
provided in the House of Lords at daily
question time and during debates.
Control of Finances
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and
more particularly of the House of Commons,
in overseeing the revenue of the State and
public expenditure, are to authorise the
raising of taxes and duties, and the various
objects of expenditure and the sum to be
spent on each. It also has to satisfy itself that
the sums granted are spent only for the
purposes which Parliament intended. No
payment out of the central government’s
public funds can be made and no taxation or
loans authorised, except by Act of Parliament.
However, limited interim payments can be
made from the Contingencies Fund.
The Finance Act is the most important of
the annual statutes, and authorises the
raising of revenue. The legislation is based on
the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Budget
statement. This includes a review of the
public finances of the previous year, and
proposals for future expenditure (see p. 159).
59
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scrutiny of public expenditure is carried out
by House of Commons select committees
(see p. 58).
European Union Affairs
To keep the two Houses informed of EU
developments, and to enable them to
scrutinise and debate Union policies and
proposals, there is a select committee in each
House (see p. 58), and two Commons
standing committees debate specific European
legislative proposals. Ministers also make
regular statements about Union business.
The Commons' Ability to Force the Government
to Resign
The final control is the ability of the House
of Commons to force the Government to
resign by passing a resolution of ‘no
confidence’. The Government must also
resign if the House rejects a proposal which
the Government considers so vital to its
policy that it has declared it a ‘matter of
confidence’ or if the House refuses to vote
the money required for the public service.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
The post of Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman’) was established under the
Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967. The
Ombudsman is independent of government
and reports to a Select Committee of the
House of Commons. He investigates
complaints from members of the public
(referred through MPs) alleging that they
have suffered injustice arising from
maladministration. The Ombudsman’s
jurisdiction covers central government
departments and a large number of non-
departmental public bodies. He cannot
investigate complaints about government
policy, the content of legislation or relations
with other countries. In making his
investigations, the Commissioner has access
to all departmental papers, and has powers to
summon those from whom he wishes to take
evidence. When an investigation is
completed, he sends a report with his
findings to the MP who referred the
complaint (with a copy report for the
complainant). In reports of justified cases, the I
Ombudsman normally recommends that the
department provides redress (which can
include a financial remedy for the
complainant in appropriate cases). His
recommendations are almost always put into
practice. He submits an annual report to
Parliament, and also publishes selected cases
three times a year.
In 1994 the Ombudsman received a
record 1,332 new complaints. He
completed 226 investigations; of these
he found 200 wholly or partly justified
and 26 unjustified.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman also
monitors the Code of Practice on Access to
Official Information, which came into force
in 1994. He investigates complaints, referred
through MPs, that government departments
or bodies have wrongly refused access to
official information. If he finds a complaint
justified, he can recommend that the
information is released.
Parliamentary Privilege
Each House of Parliament has certain rights
and immunities to protect it from obstruction
in carrying out its duties. The rights apply
collectively to each House and to its staff and
individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally
claims from the Queen ‘their ancient and
undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include
freedom of speech; first call on the
attendance of its members, who are therefore
free from arrest in civil actions and exempt
from serving on juries, or being compelled to
attend court as witnesses; and the right of
access to the Crown, which is a collective
privilege of the House. Further privileges
include the rights of the House to control its
own proceedings (so that it is able, for
instance, to exclude ‘strangers’9 if it wishes);
9A11 those who are not members or officials of either House.
60
GOVERNMENT
to decide upon legal disqualifications for
membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and to punish for breach of its
privileges and for contempt. Parliament has
the right to punish anybody, inside or outside
the House, who commits a breach of
privilege—that is, offends against the rights
of the House.
The privileges of the House of Lords
are broadly similar to those of the House
of Commons.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of
ministers responsible for the conduct of
national affairs. The Prime Minister is
appointed by the Queen, and all other
ministers are appointed by the Queen on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister. Most
ministers are members of the Commons,
although the Government is also fully
represented by ministers in the Lords. The
Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary
both in the number of ministers and in the
titles of some offices. New ministerial offices
may be created, others may be abolished, and
functions may be transferred from one
minister to another.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition,
First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for
the Civil Service. The Prime Minister’s
unique position of authority derives from
majority support in the House of Commons
and from the power to appoint and dismiss
ministers. By modern convention, the
Prime Minister always sits in the House
of Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the
Cabinet, is responsible for the allocation of
functions among ministers and informs the
Queen at regular meetings of the general
business of the Government.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities
include recommending a number of
appointments to the Queen. These include:
• Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans and some 200 other clergy in
Crown ‘livings’;
• senior judges, such as the Lord Chief
Justice;
• Privy Counsellors; and
• Lord-Lieutenants.
They also include certain civil
appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner to the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate,
Constable of the Tower, and some university
posts; and appointments to various public
boards and institutions, such as the BBC
(British Broadcasting Corporation), as well as
various royal and statutory commissions.
Recommendations are likewise made for the
award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (to people who
have achieved eminence in science or the arts
and are in financial need). The Prime
Minister also selects the trustees of certain
national museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister’s Office at 10
Downing Street (the official residence in
London) has a staff of civil servants who
assist the Prime Minister. The Prime
Minister may also appoint special advisers to
the Office to assist in the formation of policies.
Departmental Ministers
Ministers in charge of government
departments are usually in the Cabinet; they
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or
‘Minister’, or may have a special title, as in
the case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Non-departmental Ministers
The holders of various traditional offices,
namely the Lord President of the Council,
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,
the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General
and, from time to time, Ministers without
Portfolio, may have few or no departmental
duties. They are thus available to perform
any duties the Prime Minister may wish to
give them. In the present administration, for
example, the Lord President of the Council is
Leader of the House of Commons and the
61
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is
Minister for Public Service.
Lord Chancellor and Law Officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position,
as both a minister with departmental
functions and the head of the judiciary (see
p. 105). The four Law Officers of the Crown
are: for England and Wales, the Attorney
General and the Solicitor General; and for
Scotland, the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State and Junior Ministers
Ministers of State usually work with
ministers in charge of departments. They
normally have specific responsibilities, and
are sometimes given titles which reflect these
functions. More than one may work in a
department. A Minister of State may be gn en
a seat in the Cabinet and be paid accordingly.
Junior ministers (generally Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State or, where the
senior minister is not a Secretary of State,
simply Parliamentary Secretaries) share in
parliamentary and departmental duties. They
may also be given responsibility, directly
under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work.
Ministerial Salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons range from £47,987 a year for junior
ministers to £67,819 for Cabinet ministers. In
the House of Lords salaries range from
£41,065 for junior ministers to £55,329 for
Cabinet ministers. The Prime Minister receives
£82,003 and the Lord Chancellor £126,138.
(The Leader of the Opposition receives
£64,257 a year; two Opposition whips in the
Commons and the Opposition Leader and
Chief Whip in the Lords also receive salaries.)
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of about 20
ministers (the number can vary) chosen by
the Prime Minister and may include
departmental and non-departmental ministers.
The functions of the Cabinet are to
initiate and decide on policy, the supreme
control of government and the co-ordination
of government departments. The exercise of
these functions is vitally affected by the fact
that the Cabinet is a group of party
representatives, depending upon majority
support in the House of Commons.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its
proceedings are confidential. Its members are
bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not
to disclose information about its proceedings,
although after 30 years Cabinet papers may
be made available for inspection in the Public
Record Office at Kew, Surrey.
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few hours
each week during parliamentary sittings, and
rather less often when Parliament is not sitting.
To keep its workload within manageable limits,
a great deal of work is carried on through the
committee system. This involves referring
issues either to a standing Cabinet committee
or to an ad hoc committee composed of the
ministers directly concerned. The committee
then considers the matter in detail and either
disposes of it or reports upon it to the Cabinet
with recommendations for action.
The membership and terms of reference of
all ministerial Cabinet committees are published
by the Cabinet Office. Where appropriate, the
Secretary of the Cabinet and other senior
officials of the Cabinet Office attend meetings
of the Cabinet and its committees.
Diaries published by several former
ministers have given the public insight into
Cabinet procedures in recent times.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office is headed by the
Secretary of the Cabinet (a civil servant who
is also Head of the Home Civil Service)
under the direction of the Prime Minister. It
comprises the Cabinet Secretariat and the
Office of Public Service (OPS).
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers
collectively in the conduct of Cabinet
business, and in the co-ordination of policy a
the highest level.
GOVERNMENT
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster
is in charge of the Office of Public Service
and is a member of the Cabinet. The OPS is
responsible for:
• raising the standard of public services
across the public sector through the
Citizen’s Charter (see p. 66);
• promoting openness in government; and
• improving the effectiveness and efficiency
of central government, through, among
other things, the establishment of
executive agencies and the market testing
programme (see p. 69).
The Historical and Records Section is
responsible for Official Histories and
managing Cabinet Office records.
Ministerial Responsibility
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the
collective responsibility for government policy
and actions, which ministers share, and to
ministers’ individual responsibility for their
departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility
means that the Cabinet acts unanimously even
when Cabinet ministers do not all agree on a
subject. The policy of departmental ministers
must be consistent with the policy of the
Government as a whole. Once the
Government’s policy on a matter has been
decided, each minister is expected to support
it or resign. On rare occasions, ministers have
been allowed free votes in Parliament on
government policies involving important issues
of principle. In February 1994, for example,
free votes were allowed on lowering the age
of consent to homosexual sex from 21 to 18.
The individual responsibility of ministers
for the work of their departments means that
they are answerable to Parliament for all their
departments’ activities. They bear the
consequences of any failure in administration,
any injustice to an individual or any aspect of
policy which may be criticised in Parliament,
whether personally responsible or not. Since
most ministers are members of the House
of Commons, they must answer questions
and defend themselves against criticism in
person. Departmental ministers in the
House of Lords are represented in the
Commons by someone qualified to speak on
their behalf, usually a junior minister.
Departmental ministers normally decide all
matters within their responsibility. However,
on important political matters they usually
consult their colleagues collectively, either
through the Cabinet or through a Cabinet
committee. A decision by a departmental
minister binds the Government as a whole.
On assuming office ministers must resign
directorships in private and public
companies, and must ensure that there is
no conflict between their public duties and
private interests.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief
source of executive power in the State; its
origins can be traced back to the King’s
Court, which assisted the Norman monarchs
in running the government. As the system of
Cabinet government developed in the 18th
century, however, much of the role of the
Privy Council was assumed by the Cabinet,
although the Council retained certain
executive functions. Some government
departments originated as committees of the
Privy Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy
Council is to advise the Queen on the
approval of Orders in Council, including
those made under prerogative powers, such as
Orders approving the grant of royal charters
of incorporation and those made under
statutory powers. Responsibility for each
Order, however, rests with the minister
answerable for the policy concerned,
regardless of whether he or she is present at
the meeting where approval is given.
The Privy Council also advises the
Sovereign on the issue of royal proclamations,
such as those summoning or dissolving
Parliament. The Council’s own statutory
responsibilities, which are independent of the
powers of the Sovereign in Council, include
supervising the registration authorities of the
medical and allied professions.
Membership of the Council (retained for
life, except for very occasional removals)
is accorded by the Sovereign on the
63
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
recommendation of the Prime Minister
(or occasionally, Prime Ministers of
Commonwealth countries) to people eminent
in public life—mainly politicians and
judges—in Britain and the independent
monarchies of the Commonwealth. Cabinet
ministers must be Privy Counsellors and, if
not already members, are admitted to
membership before taking their oath of office
at a meeting of the Council. There are about
450 Privy Counsellors. A full Council is
summoned only on the accession of a new
Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces
his or her intention to marry.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council
committees. These include prerogative
committees, such as those dealing with
legislation from the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, and with applications for
charters of incorporation. Committees may
also be provided for by statute, such as those
for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge
and the Scottish universities. Membership of
such committees is confined to members of
the current administration. The only
exceptions are the members of the Judicial
Committee and the members of any
committee for which specific provision
authorises a wider membership.
Administrative work is carried out in the
Privy Council Office under the Lord
President of the Council, a Cabinet minister.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is the highest court of appeal for
certain independent members of the
Commonwealth, the British dependent
territories, the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man. It also hears appeals from the
disciplinary committees of the medical and
allied professions and certain ecclesiastical
appeals. In 1994 69 appeals were registered
and 58 were heard.
Government Departments
Government departments and their agencies,
staffed by politically impartial civil servants,
are the main instruments for implementing
government policy when Parliament has
passed the necessary legislation, and for
advising ministers. They often work alongside
local authorities, statutory boards, and
government-sponsored organisations operating
under various degrees of government control.
A change of government does not
necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments,
although major changes in policy may be
accompanied by organisational changes.
The work of some departments (for
instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers
Britain as a whole. Other departments, such
as the Department of Social Security, cover
England, Wales and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others, such as the
Department of the Environment, are mainly
concerned with affairs in England. Some
departments, such as the Department of
Trade and Industry, maintain a regional
organisation, and some which have direct
contact with the public throughout the
country (for example, the Department of
Social Security) also have local offices.
Departments are usually headed by
ministers. In some departments the head is a
permanent official, and ministers with other
duties are responsible for them to
Parliament. For instance, ministers in the
Treasury are responsible for HM Customs
and Excise, the Inland Revenue, the
National Investment and Loans Office and a
number of other departments as well as
executive agencies such as the Royal Mint.
Departments generally receive their funds
directly out of money provided by
Parliament and are staffed by members of
the Civil Service.
The functions of the main government
departments are set out on pp. 525-33.
Non-departmental Public Bodies
There are bodies which have a role in the
process of national government, but are not
government departments nor parts of a
department (in April 1994 there were
1,345, employing 110,200 staff). There are
three kinds of non-departmental public
bodies: executive bodies, advisory bodies
and tribunals. The last of these are a
64
GOVERNMENT
specialised group of bodies whose functions
are essentially judicial (see p. 104).
Executive Bodies
Executive bodies normally employ their own
staff and have their own budget. They are
public organisations whose duties include
executive, administrative, regulatory or
commercial functions. They normally operate
within broad policy guidelines set by
departmental ministers, but are in varying
degrees independent of government in
carrying out their day-to-day responsibilities.
Examples include the Legal Aid Board, the
Police Complaints Authority, the Countryside
Commission and the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Authority.
Advisory Bodies
Many government departments are assisted
by advisory councils or committees which
undertake research and collect information,
mainly to give ministers access to informed
opinion before they come to a decision
involving a legislative or executive act. In
some cases a minister must consult a standing
committee, but advisory bodies are usually
appointed at the discretion of the minister.
Examples include the British Overseas Trade
Board and the Theatres Trust.
The membership of advisory councils
and committees varies according to the
nature of the work involved, but normally
includes representatives of the relevant
interests and professions.
In addition to standing advisory bodies,
there are committees set up by the
Government to examine specific matters and
make recommendations. For example, the
Committee on Standards in Public Life (the
Nolan Committee) was set up in October
1994, reporting directly to the Prime
Minister. The Committee issued its first
report in May 1995, recommending, among
other things, independent scrutiny of the
conduct of MPs and ministers and of how
ministers make appointments to public
bodies. The Government has accepted the
broad thrust of its recommendations.
For certain important inquiries, Royal
Commissions, whose members are chosen for
their wide experience, may be appointed.
Royal Commissions examine evidence from
government departments, interested
organisations and individuals, and submit
recommendations; some prepare regular
reports. Examples include the standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution, set
up in 1970, and the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice, which issued its report in
1993 (see Chapter 8). Inquiries may also be
undertaken by departmental committees.
Government Information Services
Each of the main government departments
has its own information division, public
relations branch or news department. These
are normally staffed by professional
information officers responsible for
communicating their department’s activities
to the news media and the public (sometimes
using publicity services provided by the
Central Office of Information—see p. 530).
They also advise their departments on the
public’s reaction.
The Lobby
As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the
Prime Minister’s Press Secretary and other
staff in the Prime Minister’s Press Office
have direct contact with the parliamentary
press through regular meetings with the
Lobby correspondents. The Lobby
correspondents are a group of political
correspondents who have the special privilege
of access to the Lobby of the House of
Commons, where they can talk privately to
government ministers and other members of
the House. The Prime Minister’s Press
Office is the accepted channel through which
information about parliamentary business is
passed to the media.
Administration of Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Affairs
Scotland
Scotland has its own system of law and wide
administrative autonomy. The Secretary of
65
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
State for Scotland, a Cabinet minister, has
responsibility in Scotland (with some
exceptions) for a wide range of policy matters
(see p. 532). Following an examination of
Scotland’s place in Britain which began after
the general election in April 1992, a number
of changes to the responsibilities of The
Scottish Office have been made. These make
it responsible for more areas of policy.
The distinctive conditions and needs of
Scotland and its people are also reflected in
separate Scottish legislation on many
domestic matters. Special provisions applying
to Scotland alone are also inserted in Acts
which otherwise apply to Britain generally.
British government departments with
significant Scottish responsibilities have
offices in Scotland and work closely with The
Scottish Office.
Wales
Since 1964 there has been a separate
Secretary of State for Wales, who is a
member of the Cabinet and is responsible for
many aspects of Welsh affairs. (For further
details see p. 533.)
Northern Ireland
Since the British Government’s assumption
of direct responsibility for Northern Ireland
in 1972 (see p. 13), the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland, with a seat in the Cabinet,
has been in charge of the Northern Ireland
Office, which governs the province. The
Secretary of State is directly responsible for
political and constitutional matters, security
policy, broad economic questions and other
major policy issues. A team of ministers share
responsibility for the Departments of
Agriculture, Economic Development,
Education, Environment, Finance and
Personnel, and Health and Social Services.
Citizen’s Charter
The Citizen’s Charter was launched by the
Prime Minister in 1991. The Charter’s aim is
to raise the standard of all public services and
make them more responsive to their users. It
is closely linked to other reforms, including
the Next Steps programme, efficiency
measures and the Government s contracting
out and market testing programmes (see
p. 69). The Citizen’s Charter is a ten-year
programme which is intended to be at the
heart of the Government’s policy-making
throughout the 1990s.
The Charter applies to all public services,
at both national and local levels, and the
privatised utilities. Most major public services
have now published separate charters (by
mid-1995 40 had been issued). In many cases
separate charters have been published for
services in Northern Ireland, Scotland and
Wales. (Details of many of the charters can
be found in the relevant chapters; a full list,
together with information on how to obtain
them, appears on p. 538.)
The Principles of Public Service
The Charter sets out a number of key
principles which users of public services are
entitled to expect:
Standards
Setting, monitoring and publishing explicit
standards for the services that individual
users can reasonably expect. Publication of
actual performance against these standards.
Information and Openness
Full and accurate information should be
readily available in plain language about how
public services are run, their cost and
performance, and who is in charge.
Choice and Consultation
There should be regular and systematic
consultation with those who use services.
Users’ views about services, and their
priorities for improving them, should be taken
into account in final decisions about standards.
Courtesy and Helpfulness
Courteous and helpful service from public
servants, who will normally wear name
66
GOVERNMENT
badges. Services available equally to all
who are entitled to them and run to suit
their convenience.
Putting Things Right
If things go wrong, an apology, a full
explanation and a swift and effective remedy
should be given. Well publicised and easy to
use complaints procedures, with independent
review wherever possible, should be available.
Value for Money
Efficient and economical delivery of public
services within the resources the nation can
afford, and independent validation of
performance against standards.
Implementing the Charter
A Cabinet minister, the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, is responsible for the
Charter programme. The Chancellor of the
Duchy is supported by the Citizen’s Charter
Unit within the OPS (see p. 62). The Prime
Minister also receives advice on the Charter
from an Advisory Panel drawn from
business, consumer affairs and education. The
Panel works with the Citizen’s Charter Unit
and officials in all the departments to
implement and develop the Citizen’s Charter
programme. The Prime Minister holds
regular Citizen’s Charter seminars with
Advisory Panel members and Cabinet
ministers to report on progress and plan
further action.
Executive agencies (see p. 69) are expected
to comply fully with the principles of the
Citizen’s Charter, and the pay of agency chief
executives is normally directly related to their
agency’s performance. Performance-related
pay is being introduced throughout the
public service.
Progress on the Charter
Projects to ensure that the Charter becomes
an integral part of all public services and that
members of the public are aware of the
standards of service to which they are
entitled include:
Charter Mark Awards
The Charter Mark Scheme has been
introduced to reward excellence in delivering
public services: winners are judged by the
Prime Minister’s Citizen’s Charter Advisory
Panel. Applicants have to demonstrate that
they have achieved measurable improvements
in the quality of services over the previous
two years, and that their customers are
satisfied with their services.
In 1994 awards were made to 98 of
over 520 public service organisations
and privatised utilities which had
applied. Winners ranged from schools
and colleges, hospitals and health
services, and executive agencies, such
as the Benefits Agency and the
Employment Service, to Victoria
Coach Station. Award winners can
use the Charter Mark on their
products and equipment, and on
stationery, vehicles and promotional
material for up to three years.
Complaints Task Force
A task force set up in June 1993 reviews and
recommends improvements to public service
complaints procedures.
Charter Forums and Quality Networks
A programme of Charter Forums has been
held around the country, providing an
opportunity for local service providers to
exchange information about best practice in
implementing the Citizen’s Charter.
Following this, a series of Citizen’s Charter
Quality Networks was announced in July
1994. These offer public service managers the
opportunity to discuss lessons of good
practice on a regular basis.
Open Government
In line with Citizen’s Charter principles, the
Government has a general policy of
increasing the openness and accountability of
67
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
public administration. In 1994 it introduced a
code of practice on access to government
information. This commits the Government
to release certain information as a matter of
course and also to respond to requests for
other factual information which it holds. The
code is policed by the Parliamentary
Ombudsman. Similar codes of practice have
been proposed to cover the health service and
local authorities.
As part of the same openness, the
Government is also to propose legislation to
provide rights of access to health and safety
information and personal records. These
rights would add to a number of existing
rights of access to information in specific
areas such as environmental information.
The Civil Service
The Civil Service is concerned with the
conduct of the whole range of government
activities as they affect the community.
These range from policy formulation to
carrying out the day-to-day duties of
public administration.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown.
Fo. all practical purposes the Crown in this
context means, and is represented by, the
Government of the day. In most
circumstances the executive powers of the
Crown are exercised by, and on the advice of,
Her Majesty’s ministers, who are in turn
answerable to Parliament. The Civil Service
as such has no constitutional personality or
responsibility separate from that of the
Government of the day. The duty of the
individual civil servant is first and foremost
to the minister of the Crown who is in
charge of the department in which he or she
is serving. A change of minister, for
whatever reason, does not involve a change
of staff. Ministers sometimes appoint
special advisers from outside the Civil
Service. The advisers are normally paid from
public funds, but their appointments come to
an end when the Government’s term of
office finishes, or when the minister
concerned leaves the Government or moves
to another appointment.
Following publication in July 1994 of a
White Paper on the role and future of the
Civil Service—The Civil Service: Continuity
and Change—a new Civil Service code has
been drawn up. This describes the duties and
responsibilities of civil servants and their
relationship with ministers and the
Government. The code, which will have an
independent line of appeal, is designed to
protect the political impartiality and
professional standards of all civil servants.
The number of civil servants fell from
732,000 in April 1979 to 520,000 in March
1995, reflecting the Government’s policy of
controlling the cost of the Civil Service and
of improving its efficiency.
About half of all civil servants are engaged
in the provision of public services. These
include paying sickness benefits and pensions,
collecting taxes and contributions, running
employment services, staffing prisons,
and providing services to industry and
agriculture. A quarter are employed in the
Ministry of Defence. The rest are divided
between central administrative and policy
duties; support services; and largely financially
self-supporting services, for instance, those
provided by the Department for National
Savings and the Royal Mint. Four-fifths of
civil servants work outside London.
Equality of Opportunity
The Government is committed to achieving
equality of opportunity for all its staff. In
support of this commitment, the Civil
Service, which recruits and promotes on the
basis of merit, is actively pursuing policies to
develop career opportunities for women,
ethnic minorities and people with disabilities:
• women now represent 51.3 per cent of all
non-industrial civil servants, and since
1987 the proportion of women in the top
three grades of the service has more than
doubled to 9.3 per cent;
• representation of ethnic minority staff
among non-industrial civil servants has
increased from 5.2 per cent in 1993 to
5.3 per cent in 1994 and compares
well with 4.9 per cent, which is the
ethnic minority representation in the
working population.
68
GOVERNMENT
• 1.6 per cent of civil servants are
registered as disabled, which is just above
the proportion of registered disabled
people in the workforce as a whole and
twice the proportion employed in the
private sector.
Progress is monitored and reported on
regularly by the Cabinet Office (OPS).
Management Reforms
Civil Service reforms are being implemented
to ensure improved management performance,
in particular through the increased
accountability of individual managers, based
on clear objectives and responsibilities. These
reforms include performance-related pay
schemes and other incentives.
Executive Agencies: Next Steps
Programme
The Next Steps Programme, launched in
1988, aims to deliver government services
more efficiently and effectively within
available resources for the benefit of
taxpayers, customers and staff. This has
involved setting up, as far as is practicable,
separate units or agencies to perform the
executive functions of government. Agencies
remain part of the Civil Service but under
the terms of individual framework documents
they enjoy greater delegation of financial, pay
and personnel matters. Agencies are headed
by chief executives who are accountable to
ministers but who are personally responsible
for the day-to-day operations of the agency.
No agency can be established until the
‘prior options’ of abolition, privatisation and
contracting out have been considered and
ruled out. These ‘prior options’ are
reconsidered when agencies are reviewed after
three to three-and-a-half years of operation.
The Government announced in its White
Paper The Civil Service: Continuity and
Change in July 1994 that the normal period
between agency reviews would in future be
five, rather than three, years.
By April 1995 over 100 agencies had been
set up, together with 23 Executive Units of
Customs and Excise and 29 Executive Offices
of the Inland Revenue. Over 369,000 civil
servants—66 per cent of the total—work in
organisations run on Next Steps lines. In
April 1995 a further 65 agency candidates—
employing over 84,000 staff—had been
identified as suitable for agency status.
In 1993-94 agencies met around 80 per
cent of their key performance targets—a
small improvement on the previous year
because, in general, targets will have been
made progressively tougher.
Competing for Quality
In 1991 the Government announced further
proposals to extend competition and choice
in the provision of public services. Value
for money improvements in public
expenditure are being sought through a
range of techniques, including market testing
the in-house operation against external
competition and, where appropriate,
contracting out. Between April 1992 and
September 1994:
• £2,000 million worth of government
services had been market tested or
otherwise examined;
• annual savings of at least £410 million
had been identified;
• £1,100 million of work had been awarded
to external suppliers; and
• there had been a reduction of 26,900
posts in the areas reviewed; 10,600 staff
had transferred to external suppliers; and
3,300 redundancies had been made,
divided evenly between voluntary and
compulsory.
Central Management and Structure
Responsibility for central co-ordination and
management of the Civil Service is divided
between the Cabinet Office (OPS) and
the Treasury.
The OPS, which is under the control of
the Prime Minister, as Minister for the Civil
Service, oversees organisation, senior civil
service pay, pensions and allowances,
recruitment, retirement and redundancy
policy, personnel management and statistics,
and the overall efficiency of the Service.
69
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Following the fundamental expenditure
review of the Treasury’s running costs
during 1994 (see p. 159), that department’s
responsibilities for the effective and efficient
management of the public sector have been
narrowed down to the basic objective of
maintaining a Financial control system which
delivers continuing improvements in the
efficiency of government.
The function of official Head of the
Home Civil Service is combined with that of
Secretary of the Cabinet.
At the senior levels, where management
forms a major part of most jobs, there are
common grades throughout the Civil
Service. These unified grades 1 to 7 are
known as the Open Structure and cover
grades from Permanent Secretary level to
Principal level. Within the unified
grades each post is filled by the person
best qualified, regardless of the
occupational group to which he or she
previously belonged.
Below this the structure of the non¬
industrial Civil Service is based on a system
of occupational groups. These groups assist
the recruitment and matching of skills to
posts and offer career paths in which
specialist skills can be developed.
Departments and agencies are being
encouraged to develop their own pay and
grading arrangements. They are expected to
produce value-for-money benefits which are
greater than those available through centrally
controlled negotiation. From April 1996 all
departments and agencies will take
responsibility for implementing their own
systems of pay and grading of staff below
senior levels.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service
of some 6,000 people, provides the staff
for the Foreign & Commonwealth Office
(see p. Ill) and for British diplomatic
missions abroad.
The Diplomatic Service has its own
grade structure, linked to that of the Home
Civil Service. Terms and conditions of
service are comparable, but take into account
the special demands of the Service,
particularly the requirement to serve abroad.
Home civil servants, members of the armed
forces and individuals from the private
sector may also serve in the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office and at overseas posts
on loan or attachment.
Civil Service Recruitment
Recruitment is based on the principle of
selection on merit by fair and open
competition. Independent Civil Service
Commissioners are responsible for approving
the selection of people for appointment to
Grade 5 and above. Recruitment of all other
staff is the responsibility of departments and
executive agencies. Departments and agencies
can choose whether to undertake this
recruitment work themselves, to employ a
private sector recruitment agency or to use
the Recruitment and Assessment Services
Agency to recruit on their behalf.
People from outside the Civil Service may
be recruited directly to all levels, particularly
to posts requiring skills and experience more
readily found in the private sector. The
exchange of staff between the Civil Service
and industry is also encouraged.
Since May 1995 departments and agencies
have been required to publish information
about their recruitment systems.
Training
Individual government departments and
agencies are responsible for the performance
of their own staff. They provide training and
development to meet their business needs, to
improve performance, and to help staff
respond effectively to changing demands.
Most training and development takes place
within departments and agencies. In addition,
the Civil Service College provides
management and professional training, mainly
for those who occupy, or hope to occupy,
relatively senior positions. Considerable use is
made of other providers in the private and
public sectors.
Civil servants aged under 18 may continue
their general education by attending courses,
usually for one day a week (‘day release
schemes). All staff may be entitled to
70
GOVERNMENT
financial support to continue their education,
mainly in their own time. There are also
opportunities for civil servants to undertake
research and study in areas of interest to
them and to their department or agency.
Promotion
Departments are responsible for promotion
up to and including Grade 4. Promotion or
appointment to Grades 1 and 2 and all
transfers between departments at these levels
are approved by the Prime Minister, who is
advised by the Head of the Home Civil
Service. Promotions and appointments to
Grade 3 are approved by the Cabinet Office.
Political and Private Activities
Civil servants are required to perform
loyally the duties assigned to them by the
Government of the day, whatever its
political persuasion. It is essential that
ministers and the public should have
confidence that the personal views of civil
servants do not influence the performance of
their official duties, given the role of the
Civil Service in serving successive
governments formed by different parties.
The aim of the rules which govern political
activities by civil servants is to allow them,
subject to these fundamental principles, the
greatest possible freedom to participate in
public affairs consistent with their rights and
duties as citizens. The rules are therefore
concerned with activities liable to give public
expression to political views rather than with
privately held beliefs and opinions.
The Civil Service is divided into three
groups for the purposes of deciding the
extent to which individuals may take part in
political activities:
• those in the ‘politically free’ group,
consisting of industrial staff and
non-office grades, are free to engage in
any political activity outside official
time, including adoption as a
prospective candidate for the British
or the European Parliament (although
they would have to resign from the
Service before giving their consent to
nomination).
• those in the ‘politically restricted’
group, which comprises staff in Grade 7
and above as well as Administration
Trainees and Higher Executive Officers
(D), may not take part in national
political activities but may apply for
permission to take part in local political
activities; and
• the ‘intermediate’ group, which
comprises all other civil servants, may
apply for permission to take part in
national or local political activity, apart
from candidature for the British or the
European Parliament.
Where required, permission is granted to
the maximum extent consistent with the
Civil Service’s reputation for political
impartiality and the avoidance of any
conflict with official duties. A code of
discretion requires moderation and the
avoidance of embarrassment to ministers.
Generally, there are no restrictions on the
private activities of civil servants, provided
that these do not bring discredit on the
Civil Service, and that there is no
possibility of conflict with official duties.
For instance, a civil servant must comply
with any departmental instruction on the
need to seek authority before taking part
in any outside activity which involves
official experience.
Security
Each department is responsible for its own
internal security. As a general rule the
privately-held political views of civil servants
are not a matter of official concern.
However, no one may be employed on work
which is vital to the security of the State
who is, or has been, involved in, or
associated with, activities threatening
national security. Certain posts are not open
to people who fall into this category, or to
anyone whose reliability may be in doubt for
any other reason.
The Security Commission may
investigate breaches of security in the public
service and advise on changes in security
procedure if requested to do so by the
Prime Minister after consultation with the
Leader of the Opposition.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Local Government
Although the origins of local government in
England can be traced back to Saxon times,
the first comprehensive system of local councils
was established in the late 19th century.
Local Government Reform
A major reform of local government took
place in 1974 in England and Wales and in
1975 in Scotland. This created two main tiers
of local authority throughout England and
Wales: counties and the smaller districts.
Local government in London had been
reorganised along the same lines in 1965. In
Scotland functions were allocated to regions
and districts on the mainland; single-tier
authorities were introduced for the three
Islands areas. In Northern Ireland changes
were made in 1973 which replaced the two-
tier county council and urban/rural council
system with a single-tier district council system.
The Local Government Act 1985
abolished the Greater London Council and
the six metropolitan county councils in
England. Most of their functions were
transferred to the London boroughs and
metropolitan district councils respectively in
1986 (see below).
Local Government Commission
The Local Government Act 1992 made
provision for the establishment of a Local
Government Commission to review the
structure, boundaries and electoral
arrangements of local government in England.
The Commission, set up in 1992, has
reviewed the structure of local government in
non-metropolitan England. The reviews
considered whether the two-tier structure
should be replaced by single-tier (‘unitary’)
authorities in each area; for the most part the
Commission recommended the retention of
two-tier government, but suggested unitary
authorities for some areas, especially the
larger cities. Most of these recommendations
have been accepted by the Secretary of State
for the Environment. In some areas he has
asked the Commission to conduct fresh
reviews of individual districts. The first
changes, on the Isle of Wight, were
implemented in April 1995. Other changes
will follow in April 1996 and April 1997. The
Commission will also be looking at the
boundaries of metropolitan areas, probably
starting in 1996. The Government is looking
at ways of improving the internal
management of local authorities.
Scotland and Wales
The Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act
1994 provides for 29 new unitary councils to
replace the present system of nine regional
and 53 district councils. The three islands
councils will remain. The new authorities will
take over in April 1996. In Wales, under the
Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, 22
unitary authorities will replace the existing
eight county councils and 37 district councils,
again from April 1996. The first elections for
the new councils took place in April 1995 for
Scotland and May 1995 for Wales.
Local Authorities’ Powers
Local authorities derive their power from
legislation. Although local authorities are
responsible for administering certain services,
ministers have powers in some areas to secure
a degree of uniformity in standards to
safeguard public health or to protect the
rights of individual citizens.
Relations with Central Government
The main link between local authorities and
central government in England is the
Department of the Environment. However,
other departments such as the Department
for Education and Employment and the
Home Office are also concerned with various
local government functions. In the rest of
Britain the local authorities deal with the
Scottish or Welsh Offices or the Department
of the Environment for Northern Ireland,
as appropriate.
Principal Types of Local Authority
Before the recent reforms, England outside
Greater London was divided into counties,
72
GOVERNMENT
sub-divided into districts. All the districts
and the non-metropolitan counties had
locally elected councils with separate
functions. County councils provided large-
scale services such as education and social
services, while district councils were
responsible for the more local ones (see
p. 74). These arrangements will broadly
continue in areas where two-tier local
government will remain.
Greater London is divided into 32
boroughs and the City of London, each of
which has a council responsible for local
government in its area. In the six
metropolitan counties there are 36 district
councils; there are no county councils. A
number of services, however, require a
statutory authority over areas wider than the
individual boroughs and districts. These are:
• waste regulation and disposal (in certain
areas);
• the fire services, including civil defence;
and
• (outside London) public transport.
These are run by joint authorities composed
of elected councillors nominated by the
borough or district councils. Local councils
also provide many of the members of the
police authorities (see p. 83).
In addition to the two-tier local authority
system in England, over 8,000 parish
councils or meetings provide and manage
local facilities such as allotments and village
halls, and act as agents for other district
council functions. They also provide a forum
for discussion of local issues. In Wales over
700 community councils have similar
functions, and provision is made for local
community councils in Scotland.
The boundaries and electoral
arrangements of local authorities in Wales
and Scotland are kept under review by the
Local Government Boundary Commissions
for Wales and Scotland respectively. In 1992
the responsibilities of the former Local
Government Boundary Commission for
England passed to the Local Government
Commission (see p. 72).
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils
are responsible for local environmental and
certain other services. Statutory bodies, such
as the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
and area boards, are responsible to central
government departments for administering
other major services (see p. 531).
Election of Councils
Local councils consist of elected councillors.
Councillors are paid a basic allowance but
may also be entitled to additional allowances
and expenses for attending meetings or
taking on special responsibilities. Parish and
community councillors cannot claim
allowances for duties undertaken within
their own council areas. In Scotland
community councillors are not eligible for
any form of allowance.
In England and Wales each council elects
its presiding officer annually. Some districts
have the ceremonial title of borough, or city,
both granted by royal authority. In boroughs
and cities the presiding officer is normally
known as the Mayor. In the City of London
and certain other large cities, he or she is
known as the Lord Mayor. In Scotland the
presiding officer of the district council of
each of the four cities is called the Lord
Provost. In other councils he or she is
known as a convenor or provost. District
councils in Northern Ireland are presided
over by mayors. In Wales the presiding
officer of the new authorities is called
chairman in the case of counties and mayor
in the case of county boroughs.
Councillors are elected for four years. All
county councils in England, London
borough councils, and about two-thirds of
non-metropolitan district councils are elected
in their entirety every four years. In the
remaining districts (including all
metropolitan districts) one-third of the
councillors are elected in each of the three
years when county council elections are not
held. Where new unitary authorities are to
be set up in England, Parliamentary Orders
make the necessary provisions regarding
elections. In Scotland local elections will
now be held every three years, with the next
elections due in 1999. Each election covers
the whole council. In Wales elections will
continue to be held every four years, again
with the next due in 1999.
73
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Voters
Anyone may vote at a local government
election in Britain provided he or she is:
• aged 18 years or over;
• a citizen of Britain or of another
Commonwealth country, or of the Irish
Republic, or (from 1996) a citizen of the
European Union;
• not legally disqualified; and
• on the electoral register.
To qualify for registration a person must be
resident in the council area on the qualifying
date. In Northern Ireland there are slightly
different requirements.
Candidates
Most candidates at local government elections
stand as representatives of a national political
party, although some stand as independents.
Candidates must be British citizens, other
Commonwealth citizens or citizens of the
European Union, and aged 21 or over. In
addition, they must either:
• be registered as local electors in the area
of the relevant local authority; or
• have occupied (as owner or tenant) land
or premises in that area during the whole
of the preceding 12 months; or
• have had their main place of work in the
area throughout this 12-month period.
No one may be elected to a council of which
he or she is an employee, and there are
some other disqualifications. All candidates
for district council elections in Northern
Ireland are required to make a declaration
against terrorism.
Electoral Divisions and Procedure
Counties in England are divided into electoral
divisions, each returning one councillor.
Districts in England and Northern Ireland
are divided into wards, returning one
councillor or more. In Scotland the electoral
areas in the new councils are called wards
and in Wales they are called electoral
divisions; each returns one or more
councillors. Parishes (in England) and
communities (in Wales) may be divided into
wards. Wards return at least one councillor.
The minimum parish/community council
size is five councillors.
The procedure for local government
voting in Great Britain is broadly similar to
that for parliamentary elections. In Northern
Ireland local government elections are held by
proportional representation, and electoral
wards are grouped into district electoral areas.
Council Functions and Services
At present in England county councils are
responsible for strategic planning, transport
planning, highways, traffic regulation,
education,10 consumer protection, refuse
disposal, police,11 the fire service, libraries
and the personal social services. District
councils are responsible for services such as
environmental health, housing, decisions on
most local planning applications, and refuse
collection. Both tiers of local authority have
powers to provide facilities such as museums,
art galleries and parks; arrangements depend
on local agreement. Where unitary authorities
are created in non-metropolitan areas, they
will be responsible for both county and
district level functions.
In the metropolitan counties the district
councils are responsible for all services apart
from the police, the fire service and public
transport and, in some areas, waste regulation
and disposal (see p. 367). In Greater London
the boroughs and the Corporation of the City
of London have similar functions, but
London’s metropolitan police force is
responsible to the Home Secretary.
Responsibility for public transport lies with
London Transport (see p. 298).
In Wales the division of responsibilities
between districts and counties is broadly the
same as in England up to April 1996, when
the new unitary councils will take over.
In mainland Scotland the functions of
regional and district authorities are at present
divided up in a broadly similar way to the
10Schools may, however, ‘opt out’ of local education authority
control by obtaining grant-maintained status—see p. 428.
11 In many areas, police forces cover more than one county, and
in these cases a joint board is set up to act as police authority.

there was a surge in emigration to Canada; the total gross figure for that period is
estimated at about 230,000, with immigration in the same year thought to be at least as high.

counties and districts in England and Wales.
As in Wales, new unitary councils come into
being in April 1996, taking over all local
government functions.
In Northern Ireland local environmental
and certain other services, such as leisure and
the arts, are administered by the district
councils. Responsibility for planning, roads,
water supply and sewerage services is
exercised in each district through a divisional
office of the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland. Area boards,
responsible to central departments, administer
education, public libraries and the health and
personal social services locally. The Northern
Ireland Housing Executive, responsible to the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland, administers housing.
Changes in Local Government
There have been numerous changes in recent
years in the way that local authorities
approach their responsibilities. Many of these
can be encapsulated under the term ‘the
enabling authority’. It is used to describe the
general shift away from local authorities
providing services directly and towards them
arranging for services to be provided, or
carrying out functions in partnership with
other bodies. For example, councils often
have nomination rights to housing association
properties (see p. 341), so that they are acting
not as provider but as ‘gatekeeper’. Likewise,
under the community care reforms, councils
with social services responsibilities draw up
care plans for those who need them (see
p. 407), but the care is often provided by the
private or voluntary sectors funded by the
council, rather than directly by the local
authority itself.
Internal Organisation of Local
Authorities
Local authorities have considerable freedom
to make arrangements for carrying out their
duties; these are set out in standing orders.
Some decisions are made by the full council;
many other matters are delegated to
committees composed of members of the
council. A council may delegate most
functions to a committee or officer, although
certain powers are legally reserved to the
council as a whole. The powers and duties of
local authority committees are usually laid
down in the terms of reference. Parish and
community councils in England and Wales
are often able to do their work in full session,
although they appoint committees from time
to time as necessary.
In England and Wales committees
generally have to reflect the political
composition of the council (although the
legislation governing this specifically excludes
parish or community councils). In practice,
this is often also the case in Scotland,
although it is not enforced by legislation.
People who are not members of the council
may be co-opted onto decision-making
committees and can speak and take part in
debates; they cannot normally vote.
Legislation also prevents senior officers and
others in politically sensitive posts from being
members of another local authority or
undertaking public political activity. Some of
these provisions have not been introduced in
Northern Ireland.
Public Access
The public (including the press) are admitted
to council, committee and sub-committee
meetings, and have access to agendas, reports
and minutes of meetings and certain
background papers. Local authorities may
exclude the public from meetings and withhold
these papers only in limited circumstances.
Employees
About 1.4 million people12 are employed by
local authorities in England. These include
administrative, professional and technical
staff, teachers, firefighters, and manual
workers, but exclude those in law and order
services. Education is the largest service,
employing some 40 per cent of all local
government workers. Councils are
individually responsible, within certain
national legislative requirements, for deciding
the structure of their workforces.

75
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Senior staff appointments are usually
made by the elected councillors. More
junior appointments are made by heads of
departments. Pay and conditions of service aie
usually a matter for each council, although
there are scales recommended by national
negotiating machinery between authorities and
trade unions, and most authorities follow these.
Authorities differ in the degree to which
they employ their own permanent staff to
carry out certain functions or use private
firms under contract. The Government’s
policy of promoting value for money is
encouraging the use of private firms where
savings can be made. Many local government
functions, such as refuse collection and
leisure management, must be put out to
tender (‘compulsory competitive tendering’
CCT), although the local authority’s own
workforce can put up an in-house bid.
Between 1989 and 1992, CCT achieved
average cost savings of 6 to 7 per cent. CCT
is currently being extended to local
authorities’ provision of a range of
professional services. The metropolitan
districts and London boroughs will need to
have new arrangements in place during
1996-97 for most of these services.
Local Authority Finance
Local government expenditure accounts for
about 25 per cent of public spending. The
Government has sought to influence local
government spending as part of a general
policy of controlling the growth of public
expenditure. Since 1984 the Government has
had powers to limit or ‘cap’ local authority
budgets (local authority taxation in Scotland)
by setting a maximum amount for local
authorities which have, in its view, set
budgets which are excessive.
In 1994-95 expenditure by local authorities
in Britain was about £73,300 million. Current
expenditure amounted to £62,100 million;
capital expenditure, net of capital receipts,
was £6,900 million; and debt interest
£4,300 million. Local government capital
expenditure is financed primarily by
borrowing within limits set by central
government and from capital receipts from
the disposal of land and buildings.
Local authorities in Great Britain raise
revenue through the council tax, which
replaced the community charge system in
April 1993 (see p. 166). However, their
revenue spending is financed primarily by
grants from central government and by the
redistribution of revenue from the national
non-domestic rate, a property tax levied on
businesses and other non-domestic properties.
District councils in Northern Ireland
continue to raise revenue through the levying
of a domestic rate.
Financial Safeguards
Local councils’ annual accounts must be
audited by independent auditors appointed by
the Audit Commission in England and Wales,
or by the Commission for Local Authority
Accounts in Scotland. In Northern Ireland
this role is exercised by the chief local
government auditor, who is appointed by the
Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
Local Government Complaints System
Local authorities are encouraged to resolve
complaints through internal mechanisms, and
members of the public will often ask their
own councillor for assistance in this. Local
authorities must also appoint a monitoring
officer, whose duties include ensuring that
the local authority acts lawfully in the
conduct of its business.
Allegations of local government
maladministration may be investigated by
statutory independent Commissioners for
Local Administration, often known as ‘local
government ombudsmen’. There are three of
these in England, and one each in Wales and
Scotland. A report is issued on each
complaint fully investigated and, if injustice
caused by maladministration is found, the
local ombudsman normally proposes a
remedy. The council must consider the
report and reply to it.
An independent review of the local
government ombudsman service began in
July 1995.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner
for Complaints deals with complaints
76
GOVERNMENT
alleging injustices suffered as a result of
maladministration by district councils and
certain other public bodies.
Pressure Groups
Pressure groups are informal organisations
which aim to influence Parliament and
Government in the way decisions are made
and carried out, to the benefit of their
members and the causes they support. There
is a huge range, covering politics, business,
employment, consumer affairs, ethnic
minorities, aid to developing countries, foreign
relations, education, culture, defence, religion,
sport, transport, social welfare, animal welfare
and the environment. Some have over a
million members, others only a few dozen.
Some exert pressure on a number of different
issues; others are concerned with a single
issue. Some have come to play a recognised
role in the way Britain is governed; others
seek influence through radical protest.
While political parties seek to win political
power, pressure groups aim to influence those
who are in power, rather than to exercise the
responsibility of government and to legislate.
Pressure Groups and Policy
Pressure groups operating at a national level
have a number of methods for influencing the
way Britain is governed. Action by them may
highlight a particular problem, which is then
acknowledged by the Government. Groups
whose scale of membership indicates that they
are broadly representative in their field may
then be consulted by a government
department, or take part in Whitehall working
groups or advisory councils. If the Government
considers that legislation is necessary, then
proposals are drafted, which are circulated to
interested groups for their comments.
Legislation is then put before Parliament, and
at various times during the passage of a Bill—
especially at the committee stage—pressure
groups have opportunities to influence its
content. If the Act includes delegated
legislation (see p. 57), pressure groups may be
consulted and have the opportunity to
provide information and express their views.
Pressure Groups and Government
The principle of consultation to gain the
consent and co-operation of as wide a range of
organisations as possible, and to ensure the
smooth working of laws and regulations, plays
an important part in the relationship between
government departments and interested groups.
In some instances a department is under
legal obligation to consult interested groups.
The Government has a duty to consult
organised interests, providing the pressure
groups involved have a broad enough
membership for them to represent a majority
view, and that they observe confidentiality
about their discussions with the department.
Members of pressure groups have direct
expertise, and an awareness of what is
practicable, and can give advice and information
to civil servants engaged in preparing policy or
legislation. In return, the pressure groups have
the opportunity to express their opinions
directly to the Government. The contacts
between civil servants and pressure group
representatives may be relatively informal—
by letter or telephone—or more formal,
through involvement in working parties or by
giving evidence to committees of inquiry.
Administration by Pressure Groups
As well as providing information and
opinions, pressure groups can also be
involved in administering government policy.
The Law Society—the representative body
for solicitors— administered the
Government’s Legal Aid scheme until that
function was taken over in 1989 by the Legal
Aid Board (see p. 106). The Government also
makes grants to pressure groups which, as
well as speaking on behalf of their members
or for an issue, also provide a service. Relate:
National Marriage Guidance has received
grants for the advice centres it runs, and
government departments make grants to a
number of pressure groups for research
relating to public policy.
Pressure Groups and Parliament

MPs or Lords, persuading them to act

on behalf of a cause, and enabling them to
do so by providing advice and information
is a form of pressure group activity which
has increased substantially in recent years.
A common pressure group tactic is to ask
members of the public to write to their MP
about an issue—for example, the Sunday
trading laws, or the plight of political
prisoners in particular countries in order to
raise awareness and persuade the MP to
support the cause.
Raising Issues in Parliament
Other ways through which pressure groups
may exert influence include:
• suggesting to MPs or Lords subjects
for Private Members’ Bills (see p. 55);
many pressure groups have ready-
drafted legislation waiting to be
sponsored;
• approaching MPs or Lords to ask
parliamentary questions as a means of
gaining information from the
Government and of drawing public
attention to an issue;
• suggesting to MPs subjects for Early Day
Motions (see p. 59); and
• orchestrating public petitions as a form of
protest against government policy, or to
call for action. If the petition is to be
presented in Parliament, it must be
worded according to Commons or Lords
rules, and be presented by an MP or
Lord in his or her own House.
Parliamentary Lobbyists
Many pressure groups employ full-time
parliamentary workers or liaison officers,
whose job is to develop contacts with MPs
and Lords sympathetic to their cause, and to
brief them when issues affecting the group
are raised in Parliament.
There are also public relations and
political consultancy firms specialising in
lobbying Parliament and Government. Such
firms are employed by pressure groups—as
well as by British and overseas companies
and organisations—to monitor parliamentary
business, and to promote their clients’
interests where they are affected by
legislation and debate.

A new independent Criminal Cases Review Commission will investigate the
safety of criminal convictions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
following the enactment of the Criminal Appeal Act in July 1995.
In Scotland the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act, which also received the
Royal Assent in July 1995, will reinforce the powers available to crack down
on crime and reduce offending. The bulk of the Act’s provisions are being
implemented on 1 April 1996.
England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern
Ireland all have their own legal systems, with
considerable differences in law, organisation
and practice. All three have separate
prosecution, prison and police services. Crime
prevention policy and non-custodial treatment
for offenders are similar throughout Britain.
There are different civil court and civil law
systems in England and Wales and in
Scotland; Northern Ireland’s system is in
many ways similar to the English and
Welsh model.
Common Law and Statute Law
One of the main sources of law in England
and Wales and in Northern Ireland is
common law, which has evolved over
centuries from judges’ decisions. It forms the
basis of the law except when superseded by
legislation. In Scotland, too, the doctrine of
legal precedent has been more strictly applied
since the end of the 18th century.
Much of the law, particularly that relating
to criminal justice, is statute law passed by
Parliament. If a court reaches a decision
which is contrary to the intentions of
Parliament, then Parliament must either
accept the decision or pass amending
legislation. Some Acts create new law, while
others are passed to draw together existing
law on a given topic. Parliament can repeal a
statute and replace it with another.
European Community Law
European Community law, deriving from
Britain’s membership of the European Union,
is confined mainly to economic and social
matters; in certain circumstances it takes
precedence over domestic law. It is normally
applied by the domestic courts, but the most
authoritative rulings are given by the
European Court of Justice (see p. 114).
Certain changes to United Kingdom law
have been made to bring it into line with
rulings of the European Court of Human
Rights (see p. 129).

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Branches of the Law
There are two main branches of the law
criminal and civil. Criminal law is concerned
with acts punishable by the State. Civil law
covers:
9 disputes between individuals about their
rights, duties and obligations; and
• dealings between individuals and
companies, and between one company
and another.
Criminal Justice
Crime Statistics
Differences in the legal systems, police
recording practices and statistical
classifications make it impracticable to analyse
in detail trends in crime for Britain as
a whole. Nevertheless, there has, as in
Western Europe generally, been a substantial
increase in crime since the early 1950s.
Annual official statistics cover crime recorded
by the police and can be affected by changes
in unreported crime.
Recorded crimes in England and Wales in
1994 are detailed in Table 8.1. In 1994 the
Scottish police recorded 527,064 crimes, of
which 195,745 were cleared up. In Northern
Ireland, of the 67,886 recorded crimes in 1994,
24,342 were cleared up.
Most crime is committed by young males,
is opportunist and is not planned by
hardened professional criminals, although
these do exist.
Crime tends to be concentrated in large
cities and urban areas. About 93 per cent of
offences recorded by the police in England
and Wales are directed against property but
only 6 per cent involve violence. Rising
affluence has provided more opportunities for
casual property crime. In 1957, for example,
car crime was only one-tenth of total crime
but this has risen to about 28 per cent. The
demand for, and supply of, illegal drugs has
been an increasing factor in the incidence of
crime in recent years.
Regular crime surveys are undertaken in
England and Wales and in Scotland. These
indicate that many crimes go unrecorded by
the police, mainly because not all victims
report what has happened to them. The
surveys confirm that the majority of crimes
are against property, in the form of theft
and vandalism.
Crime Prevention
National publicity campaigns are a regular
feature of the Government’s crime prevention
programmes. The Home Office provides
support to the police effort through its Crime
Prevention Centre, which offers training and
advice, and promotes best practice. Other
government departments are brought together
with the Home Office to formulate
prevention strategies.
Crime Concern, a national independent
organisation, encourages local initiatives and
business participation in crime prevention.
Local crime prevention panels (including
mainly school-based youth panels) assist the

JUSTICE AND THE LAW
police in preventing crime through publicity,
marking goods and equipment, and
fund-raising to buy security devices.
A major initiative promoting co¬
operation between the public and the
police—Partners Against Crime—was
launched by the Government in
September 1994. It is based on a
three-tier approach:
1. Neighbourhood Watch schemes, of
which there are 142,000 in England
and Wales covering over 5 million
households (and also 3,600 schemes in
Scotland);
2. Street Watch, in which local people,
in agreement with the police, work
out specific routes and regularly walk
the chosen area; and
3. The Neighbourhood Constable
scheme, which is a variation of the
existing special constabulary (see
p. 83). Neighbourhood constables have
the same status, powers and training
as special constables, but they work in
their own neighbourhood.
In 1994 the Home Office issued a booklet
on best practice in the use of closed-circuit
television (CCTV) for the prevention and
investigation of crime; the Government has
actively encouraged the setting up of CCTV
schemes across the country.
The Safer Cities Programme tackles crime
and the fear of crime in inner city and urban
areas in England through joint crime
prevention action by local government, private
businesses, the police and voluntary agencies.
Twenty locally-based projects had, by
October 1994, supported 3,600 schemes with
funding of over £22 million. The second
phase of the programme has seen the
establishment of 32 new projects, including
some in Wales.
There is a Safer Cities programme in
Scotland, and similar projects are being funded
by the Government in Northern Ireland.
The National Board for Crime Prevention
advises the Government about ways of
involving all sections of the community in the
development and delivery of crime prevention
in England and Wales. There is also a
Scottish Crime Prevention Council and a
Northern Ireland Crime Prevention Panel.
Helping the Victim
The Government has emphasised the
importance of victims’ interests within the
criminal justice system.
There are some 365 victim support schemes
—with some 12,000 volunteer visitors,
covering the whole of England and Wales—
providing practical help and emotional
support to victims of crime. They are co¬
ordinated by a national organisation, Victim
Support, which receives a government grant
(£10.8 million in 1995-96). Similar schemes
operate in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales the Witness
Service, run by Victim Support with Home
Office funding, provides support for victims
and witnesses attending the Crown Court.
About 55 witness schemes have been set up
to help victims through the stress of giving
evidence; the Witness Service is being
extended to all 78 main Crown Court centres
by the end of 1995.
A new offence of witness intimidation was
introduced by the Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994 to protect victims who are
also witnesses. The same legislation provides
for the abolition of committal proceedings (see
p. 90), so that victims no longer have to give
evidence and be cross-examined twice over.
The Government accepted all the
recommendations made by the Roval
Commission on Criminal Justice in 1993 on
help for the victims of crime, such as giving
them better information about the progress of
investigations or court proceedings and
improving facilities for them at court. Most of
these have now been implemented, and the 50
standards of treatment set out in the Victims’
Charter (published by the Government in
1990) have been or are well on the way to
being met (see also Courts Charter—p. 90).
In September 1994 the Government
announced that reports prepared on offenders
before sentencing would include a section
about the effects of the crime on the victim
(see p. 93).
81
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Blameless victims of violent crime in
England, Wales and Scotland, including
foreign nationals, may be eligible for
compensation from public funds. In 1994-95
£170 million was paid out under the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. In
Northern Ireland there are separate statutory
arrangements for compensation for criminal
injuries, and for malicious damage to property,
including any resulting loss of profits.
Strengthening the Law
Important measures to strengthen the
criminal justice system have been taken in
recent years. The courts, for instance, have
powers to trace, freeze and confiscate the
proceeds of drug trafficking. A court can
require an offender to pay an amount equal
to the full value of the proceeds arising from
the trafficking. Following a conviction, the
onus is on the offender to prove that
property does not represent the proceeds of
trafficking. Offenders may not opt to serve a
period of imprisonment in default of paying a
confiscation order. Restraint and confiscation
orders made by courts can be enforced
against assets held overseas, and vice versa, if
a bilateral confiscation agreement has been
made between Britain and another state.
A court in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland may also confiscate the proceeds of
offences such as robbery, fraud, blackmail
and insider dealing in shares. These powers
are being strengthened under the provisions
in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1995. The
Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995
introduces powers for the courts in Scotland
to order confiscation of the proceeds of
general crime and widens their powers for
ordering forfeiture.
New powers to clamp down on money
launderers1 came into force in 1994, with
heavy penalties for those who launder money
gained from any sort of serious crime.
There are strict legislative controls on
firearms. The police license the possession of
firearms and have powers to regulate their
'Money laundering is the process by which illegally obtained
property—from drugs or arms trafficking, terrorist activities or
other serious crimes—is given the appearance of having
originated from a legitimate source.
safekeeping and movement. The private
ownership of certain highly dangerous types
of weapon, such as machine guns,
high-powered self-loading rifles and burst-fire
weapons, is banned.
It is unlawful to manufacture, sell or
import certain weapons such as
knuckledusters or to carry a knife in a public
place without good reason.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 made a
number of reforms to the criminal law in
England and Wales, mainly concerning
sentencing and the system for early release of
prisoners (see p. 98). Similar reforms in
Scotland took effect from October 1993.
The Police and Magistrates’ Courts Act
1994 and the Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994 (mainly applicable in
England and Wales, but also to some extent
in Scotland) are designed to improve the
organisation and management of the police,
so that they are better able to combat crime,
and to tilt the balance of the criminal justice
system further against criminals.
The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995
increases the capacity of the criminal justice
system in Scotland to deal with offenders,
and increases the powers available to prevent
crime and reduce re-offending.
Measures to Combat Terrorism
Certain special powers are available to help in
preventing and investigating terrorist crime.
The powers take account of the need to
maintain a proper balance between the safety
of the public and the rights of the individual.
They must be renewed by Parliament each
year and the use of the powers is reviewed
annually by an independent person.
The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary
Provisions) Act 1989 applies throughout
Britain. It makes it unlawful to support
specified organisations involved in terrorism
connected with the affairs of Northern
Ireland, and enables the Government to
exclude from all or part of Britain people
who are believed to be involved in such
terrorism. The legislation also gives the police
wider powers to deal with suspected
terrorists, including international terrorists,
than are available under the general criminal
82
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
law. For example, the police may arrest
terrorist suspects without warrant and hold
them for up to 48 hours, and ministerial
approval may be sought to extend detention
for up to a further five days.
The legislation contains strong powers to
deal with those who provide financial support
for terrorism, or who launder terrorist funds,
including powers to order the restraint or
forfeiture of terrorist funds.
The Criminal Justice and Public Order
Act 1994 gives the police new powers to stop
and search for articles which may be used for
terrorist purposes, and has created a new
offence of possession of such articles.
Northern Ireland
The security forces in Northern Ireland have
special powers to search, question and arrest
under the Northern Ireland (Emergency
Provisions) Act 1991. A person who is
detained under emergency provisions is
entitled to consult a solicitor privately.
The ceasefires declared by the paramilitary
groupings in Northern Ireland in 1994
(see p. 14) have led to a new security
situation, but the Government does not think
it would be prudent to remove the protection
of the emergency legislation from the statute
book while illegal weaponry and explosives
are still at large.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The Home Secretary and the Scottish and
Northern Ireland Secretaries, together with
police authorities and chief constables, are
responsible for the provision of an effective
and efficient police service in Britain.
Organisation
There are 52 police forces in Britain, mainly
organised on a local basis: 43 in England and
Wales, eight in Scotland and one (the Royal
Ulster Constabulary) in Northern Ireland.
The Metropolitan Police Force and the City
of London force are responsible for policing
London. The police service is financed by
central and local government.
At the end of 1994 police strength in
Britain was about 150,000, of which the
Metropolitan Police numbered over 28,000.
The establishment of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary was around 8,500. Police strength
in Scotland was about 14,300. Each force has
volunteer special constables who perform
police duties in their spare time, without
pay, acting in support of regular officers.
The Government is aiming to recruit a
further 10,000 special constables by the
end of 1996, so increasing the overall
number by 50 per cent. In Northern Ireland
there is a 5,000-strong part-time and
full-time paid reserve.
Police forces are maintained in England
and Wales by local police authorities
(see below). The Home Secretary is
responsible for London’s Metropolitan Police
Force. The police authorities in Scotland are
the regional and islands councils, although
new unitary councils will assume this role in
April 1996. In Northern Ireland the police
force is responsible to a police authority
appointed by the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland.
Provincial forces are headed by chief
constables. They are generally answerable to
the police authorities for their force’s
competence, efficiency and conduct. The
police authorities appoint the chief constable
and assistant chief constable. They also fix
the maximum strength of the force, and
provide buildings and equipment.
London’s Metropolitan Police Commissioner
and immediate subordinates are appointed on
the recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Police forces are inspected by independent
inspectors of constabulary, whose reports to
central government are published.
Police officers are not allowed to join a
trade union or to go on strike. All ranks,
however, have their own staff associations.
Reforms
The Police and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1994
is designed to change the relationship
between central government, police
authorities and chief constables—to improve
the management of the police and to reduce
cumbersome central controls, devolving more
power and decision-making to the local level.
83
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The legislation provides for the
appointment of independent members to police
authorities in England and Wales outside
London, in addition to local councillors and
magistrates. The standard size of a police
authority is set at 17 members, comprising
nine locally elected councillors, three
magistrates and five independent members.
The Home Secretary may increase the size of
a police authority beyond 17 if local
circumstances make it desirable. The
independent members are chosen by the other
members of the police authority, from a list
of ten names forwarded by the Home
Secretary from a shortlist of 20 prepared by a
local selection panel. A 12-member
Metropolitan Police Committee assists the
Home Secretary, who acts as police authority
for the Metropolitan Police.
Police authorities in Scotland continue to
be composed of elected councillors.
Other main provisions of the legislation
include:
• setting key objectives for the police which
give priority to fighting crime and
protecting the public;
• placing a greater emphasis on community
needs through local policing plans;
• strengthening the role of the Inspectorate
of Constabulary, which has assumed a
statutory responsibility to inspect the
Metropolitan Police;
• ending detailed government controls on
finance and manpower by giving chief
constables freedom to manage police and
civilian staff and to determine staff
numbers; and
• introducing fixed-term appointments for
senior police officers and abolishing the
ranks of deputy chief constable and chief
superintendent.
The duties of the police in Scotland have
been set out in statute for many years.
Co-ordination of Police Operations
Certain police services are provided centrally
either by the Government or through
co-operation between forces. In England and
Wales these include criminal intelligence,
telecommunications, and research and
development. In Scotland the main common
services are centralised police training, the
Scottish Crime Squad and the Scottish
Criminal Record Office.
The National Criminal Intelligence
Service, with a headquarters in London and
five regional offices, co-ordinates and
provides information to the police and HM
Customs about major criminals and organised
crime, including drug trafficking. The
Service also liaises with the International
Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL),
which promotes international co-operation
between police forces.
Britain has taken the lead in developing,
with other European Union countries, a
European police organisation (EUROPOL)
designed to provide Union-wide intelligence
about serious crime (see p. 130).
All British police forces have fraud squads
responsible for investigating financial and
commercial fraud.
Six regional crime squads in England and
Wales deal with serious crime which goes
beyond individual force, regional or national
boundaries.
The Police National Computer provides
all British police forces with rapid 24-hour-a-
day access to operationally essential
information. Phoenix—the Criminal Justice
Record Service—is being implemented on the
Police National Computer, and will give the
police direct on-screen access to national
records of arrests, bail decisions and
convictions. This will gradually replace the
manual record-keeping service currently
operated by the National Identification
Bureau (NIB), which is located at
Metropolitan Police headquarters but
financed by all police forces. Phoenix will
eventually provide information direct to other
agencies such as the courts, the Prison
Service and the Crown Prosecution Service.
The Police National Network, a new
communications network providing the full
range of telecommunications services to
forces throughout Britain, was officially
opened in November 1994.
Scottish criminal records are held on
computer at the Scottish Criminal Record
84
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Office, which has an automatic national
fingerprint record system; the initial
implementation of a similar national system in
England and Wales is planned for 1997-98.
The Police National Missing Persons
Bureau, which comes under the NIB, is the
first national database of missing people,
holding information which all forces and
international agencies can share.
Firearms
Officers in Great Britain do not normally
carry firearms, although in an emergency
they can be issued on the authority of a
senior officer. Officers in armoured response
vehicles in London can wear their sidearms
in holsters at all times. In Northern Ireland
police officers are issued with firearms for
personal protection and other firearms are
available for duty purposes.
Forensic Science Service
The Forensic Science Service (FSS) serves
the administration of justice in England and
Wales by providing scientific support in the
investigation of crime, and by giving
evidence to the courts. Its customers include
the police, the Crown Prosecution Service
(see p. 89), coroners and defence solicitors.
In February 1995 the Government
announced that the FSS would merge with
the Metropolitan Police Forensic Science
Laboratory with effect from April 1996 to
form a single agency serving all police forces
in England and Wales through seven
regional operational laboratories.
In Scotland forensic science services are
provided by forces’ own laboratories.
Northern Ireland has its own forensic
science laboratory.
Police Discipline
A police officer may be prosecuted if
suspected of a criminal offence. Officers are
also subject to a disciplinary code designed to
deal with abuse of police powers and maintain
public confidence in police impartiality. If
found guilty of breaching the code, an officer
can be dismissed from the force.
Revised disciplinary procedures for the
police in Great Britain, similar to those in
operation elsewhere in the public service, are
being introduced. These provide for a more
flexible system with greater line management
involvement, the introduction of
unsatisfactory performance procedures and
changes in the appeals procedures which no
longer involve the Home Secretary.
Members of the public have the right to
make complaints against police officers if they
feel that they have been treated unfairly or
improperly. In England and Wales the
investigation and resolution of complaints is
scrutinised by the independent Police
Complaints Authority. In Scotland
complaints against police officers involving
allegations of any form of criminal conduct
are referred to the procurator fiscal for
investigation (see p. 89). The Police and
Magistrates’ Courts Act 1994 empowers the
Scottish Inspectorate of Constabulary to
consider representations from complainants
dissatisfied with the way the police have
handled their complaints.
In Northern Ireland the Independent
Commission for Police Complaints is
required to supervise the investigation of a
complaint regarding death or serious injury
and has the power to supervise that of any
other complaint. In certain circumstances, the
Secretary of State may direct the Commission
to supervise the investigation of matters that
are not the subject of a formal complaint.
Community Relations
Police/community liaison consultative groups
operate in every police authority; they consist
of representatives from the police, local
councillors and community groups.
Particular efforts are made to develop
relations with young people through greater
contact with schools. School governing bodies
and head teachers have to describe in their
annual reports the steps taken to strengthen
their schools’ links with the community,
including the police.
The Government is committed to
improving relations between the police and
ethnic minorities. Central guidance
recommends that all police officers should
85
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
receive thorough training in community and
race relations issues. Home Office and police
service initiatives are designed to tackle
racially motivated crime and to ensure that
the issue is treated as a police priority.
Forces’ responses to racial incidents are
monitored by the Inspectorate of
Constabulary. Discriminatory behaviour by
police officers, either to other officers or to
members of the public, is an offence under
the Police Discipline Code.
All police forces recognise the need to
recruit women and members of the ethnic
minorities in order to ensure that the police
represent the community. At the end of 1993
there were 1,730 ethnic minority officers and
16,750 women police officers in England and
Wales. Scottish police forces had 1,680
women officers. Every force has an equal
opportunities policy.
Police Powers
The powers of a police officer in England
and Wales to stop and search, arrest and
place a person under detention are contained
in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984. The legislation and its accompanying
codes of practice set out the powers and
responsibilities of officers in the investigation
of offences, and the rights of citizens.
An officer is liable to disciplinary
proceedings if he or she fails to comply with
any provision of the codes, and evidence
obtained in breach of the codes may be ruled
inadmissible in court. The codes must be
readily available in all police stations for
consultation by police officers, detained
people and members of the public.
Stop and Search
A police officer in England and Wales has the
power to stop and search people and vehicles
if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting
that he or she will find stolen goods,
offensive weapons or implements that could
be used for theft, burglary and other
offences. The officer must, however, state
and record the grounds for taking this action
and what, if anything, was found.
The Criminal Justice and Public Order
Act 1994 enables a senior police officer to
authorise uniformed officers to stop and
search people or vehicles for offensive
weapons or dangerous implements where he
or she has reasonable grounds for believing
that serious incidents of violence may take
place. The officer must specify the time
scale and area in which the powers are to
be exercised.
Arrest
In England and Wales the police have wide
powers to arrest people suspected of having
committed an offence with or without a
warrant issued by a court. For serious
offences, known as ‘arrestable offences’, a
suspect can be arrested without a warrant.
Arrestable offences are those for which five
or more years’ imprisonment can be imposed.
This category also includes ‘serious
arrestable offences’ such as murder, rape
and kidnapping.
There is also a general arrest power for all
other offences if it is impracticable or
inappropriate to proceed by way of summons
to appear in court, or if a police officer has
reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is
necessary to prevent the person concerned
from causing injury to any other person or
damage to property.
Detention, Treatment and Questioning
An arrested person must be taken to a police
station (if he or she is not already at one) as
soon as practicable after arrest. The suspect
has a right to speak to an independent
solicitor free of charge and to have a relative
or other named person told of his or her
arrest. Where a person has been arrested in
connection with a serious arrestable offence,
but has not yet been charged, the police in
England and Wales may delay the exercise of
these rights for up to 36 hours in the
interests of the investigation if certain strict
criteria are met.
A suspect may refuse to answer police
questions or to give evidence in court.
Changes to this so-called ‘right to silence’
have been made by the Criminal Justice and
Public Order Act 1994 to allow courts in
86
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
England and Wales to draw inferences from a
defendant’s refusal to answer police questions
or to give information during his or her trial.
Reflecting this change in the law, a new form
of police caution (which must precede any
questions to a suspect for the purpose of
obtaining evidence) is intended to ensure that
people understand the possible consequences
if they answer questions or stay silent.
Questions relating to an offence may not
normally be put to a person after he or she
has been charged with that offence or
informed that he or she may be prosecuted
for it.
The length of time a suspect is held in
police custody before charge is strictly
regulated. For lesser offences this may not
exceed 24 hours. A person suspected of
committing a serious arrestable offence can be
detained for up to 96 hours without charge
but beyond 36 hours only if a warrant is
obtained from a magistrates’ court. Reviews
must be made of a person’s detention at
regular intervals—six hours after initial
detention and thereafter every nine hours as a
maximum—to check whether the criteria for
detention are still satisfied. If they are not,
the person must be released immediately.
The tape recording of interviews with
suspected offenders at police stations must be
used when the police are investigating
indictable offences and in certain other cases.
The police are not precluded from taping
interviews for other types of offences. The
taping of interviews is regulated by a code of
practice approved by Parliament, and the
suspect is entitled to a copy of the tape.
A person who thinks that the grounds for
detention are unlawful may apply to the High
Court in England and Wales for a writ of
habeas corpus against the person who
detained him or her, requiring that person to
appear before the court to justify the
detention. Habeas corpus proceedings take
precedence over others. Similar procedures
apply in Northern Ireland and a similar
remedy is available to anyone who is
unlawfully detained in Scotland.
Recognising that the use of DNA analysis
has become a powerful tool in the
investigation of crime, the Government has
extended police powers to take body samples
from suspects. The Criminal Justice and
Public Order Act 1994 allows the police to
take non-intimate samples without consent
from anyone who is detained or convicted
for a recordable offence, and to use the
samples to search against existing records of
convicted offenders or unsolved crimes. In
time a national database will be built up.
Charging
Once there is sufficient evidence, the police
have to decide whether a detained person
should be charged with the offence. As an
alternative, they can, for example, decide to
defer charging or to take no further action
and release the person on or without bail.
They may also issue a formal caution (see
p. 97), which will be recorded and may be
taken into account if the person reoffends.
If charged, a person may be kept in
custody if there is a risk that he or she
might fail to appear in court or might
interfere with the administration of justice.
When no such considerations apply, the
person must be released on or without bail.
Where someone is detained after charge,
they must be brought before a magistrates’
court as soon as practicable. This is usually
no later than the next working day.
Scotland
In Scotland the police have common law
powers of arrest and may search an arrested
person. A police officer may also search a
person for stolen property if he or she has
reasonable grounds for suspicion.
The police may detain and question a
suspect for up to six hours. After this
period the person must either be released or
charged. Tape recording of interviews with
suspects is common practice. A court will
only allow as evidence statements fairly
obtained by the police. Anyone arrested
must be brought before a court on the first
working day after arrest. In less serious
cases the police may release a person who
gives a written undertaking to attend court.
Where the charges involve serious crime,
the accused is brought before the sheriff in
private, either to be committed for a period
.
87
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
not exceeding eight days to allow further
enquiries to be made or to be committed
for trial.
The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995
provides for an extension of the range of
samples which the police in Scotland may
take without warrant for DNA analysis.
Awaiting Trial
England and Wales
There are time limits on the period a
defendant may be kept in custody awaiting
trial in England and Wales. In cases tried
before a magistrates’ court these are generally
56 days from first appearance to trial or 70
days between first appearance to referral to
trial in the Crown Court. The limit in Crown
Court cases is 112 days from referral from
the magistrates’ court to taking of the plea.
There are some cases where it is not possible
to comply with the time limit and the courts
have powers to extend limits if satisfied that
there is a good reason and the prosecution
has acted as quickly as possible.
Most accused people are released on bail
pending trial. They are not remanded in
custody except where strictly necessary. In
England and Wales the court decides whether
a defendant should be released on bail.
Unconditional bail may be withheld only if the
court believes that the accused would abscond,
commit an offence, interfere with witnesses
or otherwise obstruct the course of justice.
A court may also impose conditions before
granting bail. If bail is refused, the defendant
may apply to a High Court judge or to the
Crown Court for bail. In certain
circumstances the prosecution may appeal to
a Crown Court judge against the granting of
bail by magistrates. An application can also
be made to the Crown Court for conditions
imposed by a magistrates’ court to be altered.
In some cases a court may grant bail to a
defendant on condition that he or she lives in
an approved bail or probation/bail hostel.
The probation service’s bail information
schemes provide the Crown Prosecution
Service with information about a defendant
which helps it to decide whether to oppose
bail and enables the courts to take an
informed decision on whether to grant bail.
The Criminal Justice and Public Order
Act 1994 gives the police powers of
immediate arrest for breach of police bail and
removes the presumption in favour of bail for
people alleged to have offended while on bail.
It also restricts the right to bail for someone
charged with murder, manslaughter or rape if
previously convicted of the same offence.
Scotland
When arrested, an accused person in
Scotland may be released by the police to
await summons, on an undertaking to appear
at court at a specified time, or be held in
custody to appear at court on the next
working day. Following that appearance, the
accused may be remanded in custody until
trial or released by the court on bail. If
released on bail, the accused must undertake
to appear at trial when required, not to
commit an offence while on bail, and not to
interfere with witnesses or obstruct the
course of justice. The court may also impose
additional conditions on the accused as
appropriate (for example, to keep away from
certain people or locations).
There is a right of appeal to the High
Court by an accused person against the
refusal of bail, or by the prosecutor against
the granting of bail, or by either against the
conditions imposed.
The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995
gives the courts increased powers to sentence
a person who commits an offence while on
bail. A prison sentence may be increased by
up to six months; a fine by up to £1,000.
Bail will not be granted where an accused
person is charged with murder, attempted
murder, culpable homicide, rape or attempted
rape and has a previous conviction for such a
crime (in the case of culpable homicide
involving a prison sentence).
If a person charged with a serious offence
has been kept in custody pending trial, the
trial must begin within 110 days of the date
of full committal. The trial of a person
released on bail on a serious offence must
begin within 12 months of the first
appearance in court on that charge. The trial
of a person charged with a summary offence
88
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
and held in custody must begin within 40
days of the date of first appearance in court.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland bail may be granted by
a resident magistrate except in cases dealt
with under emergency provisions, where
the decision is made by a judge of the
High Court.
CRIMINAL COURTS
Prosecution
England and Wales
Once the police have instituted criminal
proceedings against a person, the independent
Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) takes
control of the case, reviews the evidence and
decides whether the case should be continued.
The CPS is headed by the Director of
Public Prosecutions, who is accountable to
Parliament through the Attorney General. It
is divided into 13 regional areas, each of
which is headed by a Chief Crown
Prosecutor.
A prosecution will proceed only if the
prosecutor is satisfied that there is, on the
evidence, a realistic prospect of conviction,
and if so, that it is in the public interest for
the prosecution to proceed. In nearly all cases
the decision to prosecute is delegated to the
lawyers in the area offices. However, some
especially sensitive or complex cases,
including terrorist offences and breaches of
the Official Secrets Act, are dealt with by
CPS headquarters.
Scotland
The Lord Advocate is responsible for
prosecutions in the High Court of Justiciary,
sheriff courts and district courts. There is no
general right of private prosecution. The
Lord Advocate is advised by the Crown
Agent, who is head of the Procurator Fiscal
Service and is assisted in the Crown Office
by a staff of legally qualified civil servants.
Prosecutions in the High Court of
Justiciary are prepared by procurators fiscal
and Crown Office officials. They are
conducted by the Lord Advocate, the
Solicitor General for Scotland (the Lord
Advocate’s ministerial deputy) and advocate
deputes, collectively known as Crown Counsel.
Crimes tried before the sheriff and district
courts are prepared and prosecuted by
procurators fiscal. The police and other law
enforcement agencies investigate crimes and
offences and report to the fiscal, who decides
whether to prosecute, subject to the
directions of Crown Counsel.
When dealing with minor crime, the fiscal
can use alternatives to prosecution, such as
formal warnings or diversion to social work.
The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995
provides for an extension of fiscal fines for a
wider range of minor offences.
The new legislation also strengthens the
procedures for judicial examination of the
accused before trial, and introduces an
enhanced system of intermediate diets
(sittings of the sheriff and district courts in
advance of the trial) to establish the state of
readiness of both the defence and the
prosecution. These procedures should
reduce inconvenience to both police and
civilian witnesses, and should ensure that
less time is wasted on trips to court that are
not needed.
Northern Ireland
The Director of Public Prosecutions for
Northern Ireland, appointed by the Attorney
General, prosecutes all offences tried on
indictment and may do so in other
(summary) cases. Most summary offences are
prosecuted by the police.
Prosecutions for Fraud
The Serious Fraud Office prosecutes the
most serious and complex cases of fraud in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Investigations are conducted by teams of
lawyers, accountants, police officers and other
specialists. In Scotland the Crown Office
Fraud Unit, which is part of the public
prosecution service, directs the investigation
and preparation for prosecution of serious
and complex fraud cases.
89
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Courts
England and Wales
Very serious offences such as murder,
manslaughter, rape and robbery can only be
tried on indictment in the Crown Court,
where all contested trials are presided over by
a judge sitting with a jury. Summary
offences—the less serious offences and the
vast majority of criminal cases—are tried by
unpaid lay magistrates or, in a few areas, by
paid stipendiary magistrates; both sit
without a jury.
Offences in a third category—such as
theft, the less serious cases of burglary and
some assaults—are known as ‘either way’
offences. They can be tried either by
magistrates or by jury in the Crown Court. If
magistrates are content to deal with the case,
the accused has the right to choose trial by
magistrates or trial by jury in the Crown Court.
All those charged with offences triable in
the Crown Court must first appear before a
magistrates’ court, which decides whether to
send them to the Court for trial. As
recommended by the Royal Commission, a
new administrative procedure for transferring
cases to the Crown Court is replacing all
committal proceedings under the provisions
of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994. The defence can still argue that there is
no case to answer and the magistrates’ courts
have a discretion to admit, on application,
oral argument by the defence. No witnesses
are called to give evidence. Existing
procedures for transferring cases of serious or
complex fraud or cases involving child
evidence are not affected by the legislation.
A magistrates’ court, which is open to the
public and the media, usually consists of
three lay magistrates—known as justices of
the peace—who are advised by a legally
qualified clerk or a qualified assistant. There
are about 30,000 lay magistrates. The few
full-time, legally qualified stipendiary
magistrates may sit alone and usually preside
in courts where the workload is heavy.
Most cases involving people under 18 are
heard in youth courts. These are specialist
magistrates’ courts which either sit apart
from other courts or are held at a different
time. Restrictions are placed on access by
ordinary members of the public. Media
reports must not identify a young person
concerned in the proceedings, whether as
defendant, victim or witness.
Where a young person under 18 is charged
jointly with someone of 18 or over, the case
may be heard in an ordinary magistrates’
court or the Crown Court. If the young
person is found guilty, the court may transfer
the case to a youth court for sentence.
An independent inspectorate has been set up
to inspect the administration and management
of magistrates’ courts in order to improve
performance and spread good practice. It does
not comment on the judicial decisions of
magistrates or their clerks in particular cases.
The Crown Court sits at 93 venues and is
presided over by High Court judges, full¬
time circuit judges and part-time recorders.
Courts Charter
A Courts Charter, setting out the standards of
service which apply in the higher courts in
England and Wales, came into operation in
January 1993. It outlines arrangements to help
court users and ease the strains associated
with court attendance. A new Charter, called
the Charter for Court Users, was launched in
July 1995. It gives more information about
court systems and procedures and has new
standards on, for example, the treatment of
victims and witnesses and on complaints
handling. It does not cover judicial decisions.
Scotland
The High Court of Justiciary tries the most
serious crimes and has exclusive jurisdiction
in cases involving murder, treason and rape.
The sheriff court is concerned with relatively
less serious offences and the district court
with minor offences.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard
under solemn or summary procedure. In
solemn procedure, an accused person’s trial
takes place before a judge sitting with a jury
of 15 people. Details of the alleged offence
are set out in a document called an
indictment. In summary procedure the judge
sits without a jury.
90
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
All cases in the High Court and the more
serious ones in sheriff courts are tried by a
judge and jury. Summary procedure is used
in the less serious cases in the sheriff courts,
and in all cases in the district courts.
District court judges are lay justices of the
peace. In Glasgow there are also stipendiary
magistrates, who are full-time lawyers
[ with the same powers as a sheriff in
summary procedure.
Children under 16 who have committed an
offence are normally dealt with by children’s
hearings (see p. 102).
The levels of service which citizens are
entitled to expect from the main criminal
justice agencies are set out in the Justice
Charter for Scotland.
Northern Ireland
Cases involving minor summary offences are
heard by magistrates’ courts presided over by
a full-time, legally qualified resident
magistrate. Young offenders under 17 are
dealt with by a juvenile court consisting of
the resident magistrate and two specially
qualified lay members, at least one of whom
must be a woman.
The Crown Court deals with criminal
trials on indictment. It is served by High
Court and county court judges. Contested
cases are heard by a judge and jury, although
people charged with terrorist-type offences
are tried by a judge sitting alone, because of
the possibility of jurors being intimidated by
terrorist organisations.
In non-jury Crown Court trials the onus
remains on the prosecution to prove guilt
beyond reasonable doubt and defendants have
the right to be represented by a lawyer of
their choice. The judge must set out in a
written statement the reasons for convicting
and there is an automatic right of appeal
against conviction and sentence on points of
fact as well as of law.
Trial
Criminal trials in Britain have two parties: the
prosecution and the defence. The law
presumes the innocence of an accused person
until guilt has been proved by the
prosecution. An accused person has the right
to employ a legal adviser and may be granted
legal aid from public funds (see p. 106). If
remanded in custody, he or she may be
visited by a legal adviser to ensure a properly
prepared defence.
Disclosure to the Defence
In England and Wales, the prosecution in
Crown Court cases must disclose to the defence
all the statements from the witnesses on whom
it proposes to rely. This duty does not apply to
offences tried in the magistrates’ court, except
when advance information is requested by the
defence in ‘either way’ cases (see p. 90).
There is also a general duty to disclose to
the defence evidence, documents and
information which might have a bearing on
the defence case. In circumstances where
the material attracts public interest immunity
or is otherwise subject to a duty of
confidentiality, the prosecution is obliged to
place it before the court for a ruling.
In Scottish solemn cases the
prosecution must give the defence advance
notice of the witnesses it intends to call
and of the documents and other items on
which it will rely. In summary cases this is
usually done as a matter of practice,
although there is no obligation on the Crown
to do so.
Trial Procedure
Criminal trials normally take place in open
court and rules of evidence, which are
concerned with the proof of facts, are rigorously
applied. If evidence is improperly admitted,
or excluded, a conviction can be quashed on
appeal. In Scotland the Criminal Justice
(Scotland) Act 1995 allows hearsay evidence
to be admitted in particular circumstances.
During the trial the defendant has the
right to hear and cross-examine prosecution
witnesses. He or she can call his or her own
witnesses who, if they will not attend
voluntarily, may be legally compelled to do
so. The defendant can also address the court
in person or through a lawyer, the defence
having the right to the last speech before the
judge sums up.
91
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The defendant cannot be questioned
without consenting to be sworn as a witness
in his or her own defence, although a court
in England and Wales may, under recent
legislation, draw inferences from a refusal to
give evidence (see pp. 86—7). In Scotland,
under the provisions of the Criminal Justice
(Scotland) Act 1995, the prohibition on the
prosecutor commenting on an accused person’s
failure to give evidence will be removed.
When a defendant does testify, he or she
may be cross-examined about character or
other conduct only in exceptional
circumstances. Generally the prosecution may
not introduce such evidence.
In Scotland cross-examination about the
character or other conduct of the accused
may be made in certain circumstances.
Child Witnesses
Legislation in 1988 abolished the
presumption that children were incompetent
as witnesses. It also introduced the system
which allows children to give their evidence
at court by means of a closed-circuit
television link. Building on that, the Criminal
Justice Act 1991 extended the closed-circuit
television provisions, forbade the cross-
examination of a child directly by the
accused, and provided for a video-recorded
interview with a child victim or witness to be
admissible in court as his or her main
evidence. The Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994 further clarified the law on
child evidence, by requiring judges to admit
the evidence of a child unless he or she is
incapable of giving intelligible testimony. It is
for the jury to decide what weight should be
placed on a child’s evidence.
In Scotland live television links installed
in a number of criminal courts enable
children to give their evidence without
entering the courtroom. A child’s evidence
may also be given from behind a screen.
Corroboration of a child’s evidence is
necessary to sustain a conviction.
Fraud Proceedings
In complex fraud cases the judge may order a
preparatory Crown Court hearing to be held.
It is in open court but subject to restrictions
on press reporting. This provides an
opportunity for the judge to determine
questions regarding admissibility of evidence
and any other questions of law relating to the
case. The judge also has the power to order
the prosecution and the defence to serve on
each other certain statements and to prepare
the case in such a way that it is easier to
understand. Appeals may be made to the
Court of Appeal from certain decisions of the
judge in the preparatory hearings.
The Jury
In jury trials the judge decides questions of
law, sums up the evidence for the jury, and
discharges or sentences the accused. The jury
is responsible for deciding questions of fact.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the
verdict may be ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’, the
latter resulting in acquittal. If the jury cannot
reach a unanimous decision the judge may
allow a majority verdict provided that, in the
normal jury of 12 people, there are no more
than two dissenters.
In Scotland the jury’s verdict may be
‘guilty’, ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’; the
accused is acquitted if either of the last two
verdicts is given. The jury consists of 15
people and a verdict of ‘guilty’ can only be
reached if at least eight members are in
favour. As a general rule no one may be
convicted without corroborated evidence from
at least two sources.
If the jury acquits the defendant, the
prosecution has no right of appeal and the
defendant cannot be tried again for the
same offence.
A jury is independent of the judiciary.
Any attempt to interfere with a jury is a
criminal offence. Potential jurors are put on a
panel before the start of the trial. In England
and Wales the prosecution and the defence
may challenge individual jurors on the panel,
giving reasons for doing so. In Northern
Ireland each defendant has the right to
challenge up to 12 potential jurors without
giving a reason. In Scotland, new legislation
provides for improved procedures for the
selection of juries, including the abolition of
peremptory challenge.
92
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
People between the ages of 18 and 70 (65
in Scotland) whose names appear on the
electoral register, with certain exceptions, are
liable for jury service and their names are
chosen at random. Ineligible people include,
for example, judges and people who have
! within the previous ten years been members
of the legal profession or the police, prison or
probation services. People convicted of certain
offences within the previous ten years cannot
serve on a jury. Anyone who has received a
prison sentence of five years or more is
disqualified for life. Under the Criminal
Justice and Public Order Act 1994, people on
bail are also ineligible to sit on juries.
Sentencing
If a person is convicted, the magistrate or
judge (or their Scottish equivalent) decides on
the most appropriate sentence, taking into
account the facts of the offence, the
circumstances of the offender, any previous
convictions or sentences and any statutory
limits on sentencing. The defence lawyer may
make a speech in mitigation.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 places a
requirement on the courts in England and
Wales to obtain a ‘pre-sentence’ report from
the probation service on offenders under the
age of 18 in cases involving an offence triable
either way before passing a custodial or more
complex community sentence. In most other
circumstances, such reports are discretionary.
In England and Wales revised national
standards for the supervision of offenders in
the community require that pre-sentence
reports include a new section in which the
impact of the offence on the victim is
explained to the court.
The Criminal Justice and Public Order
Act 1994 provides for sentence discounts for
those pleading guilty at an early stage in the
court process in England and Wales.
In Scottish cases it is mandatory for a
court to obtain a social enquiry report before
imposing a custodial sentence if the accused
is under 21 or has not previously served a
custodial sentence. A report is also required
before making a probation or community
service order (see p. 96), or in cases
involving people subject to supervision. In
other cases the judge decides whether to
obtain such a report.
The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995
makes provision for the High Court to issue
guidelines on sentencing to the lower courts,
encouraging consistency in sentencing in
similar cases. The legislation also enables
courts to take into account, when deciding
the appropriate sentence, the fact that an
accused person pleaded guilty, and the timing
and circumstances in which the plea was made.
Appeals
England and Wales
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court
may appeal to the Crown Court against the
sentence if he or she has pleaded guilty. An
appeal may be made against both conviction
and sentence, or sentence alone, if a ‘not
guilty’ plea has been made. The High Court
hears appeals on points of law and
procedure—by either prosecution or
defence—in cases originally dealt with by
magistrates. If convicted by the Crown
Court, a defendant may seek leave to
appeal to the Court of Appeal (Criminal
Division) against both the conviction and
the sentence imposed. The House of Lords
is the final appeal court, but it will only
consider cases that involve a point of law of
general public importance and where leave
to appeal is granted.
The Attorney General (see p. 105) may
seek a ruling of the Court of Appeal on a
point of law which has been material in a
case where a person is tried on indictment.
The Court has power to refer the point to
the House of Lords if necessary. The ruling
will constitute a binding precedent, but an
acquittal in the original case is not affected.
The Attorney General has the power to
apply for leave to refer to the Court of
Appeal for reconsideration a sentence
imposed in the Crown Court if it is, in his or
her view, unduly lenient. Originally, only a
sentence imposed in respect of offences
triable only on indictment could be reviewed.
However, the Attorney General’s power has
been extended. Although any sentence must
still have been passed by the Crown Court,
93
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
certain offences triable either way are now
covered. These are indecent assault, making
threats to kill, and cruelty to, or neglect of, a
child. The Attorney General’s power has
been further extended to cover certain types
of serious or complex fraud. The Court of
Appeal may, if it is minded to quash the
original sentence, impose in its place any
sentence which the original sentencing court
had the power to impose.
On the basis of recommendations of
the Royal Commission on Criminal
Justice and subsequent consultations,
new legislation has been passed on
criminal appeals. The Criminal
Appeal Act 1995 provides for the
creation of a Criminal Cases Review
Commission to operate in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. This
body, independent of both
Government and the courts, will
examine possible miscarriages of
justice in cases tried on indictment or
summarily and decide whether to
refer them to the courts on the
grounds of sentence and conviction. It
will direct and supervise
investigations undertaken on its
behalf and approve the appointment
of investigating officers. Referral of a
case will require some new argument
or evidence not previously raised at
the trial or on appeal.
The final decision on any case referred will
rest with the respective Courts of Appeal in
England and Wales and Northern Ireland (if
the case was tried originally on indictment) or
with the Crown Court following a referral in
a summary case. The power of the Home
Secretary (and the Secretary of State in
Northern Ireland) to investigate and refer
possible miscarriages of justice to the Court
of Appeal will be relinquished.
Scotland
All appeal cases are dealt with by the High
Court of Justiciary. In both solemn and
summary procedure, the accused may appeal
against conviction, or sentence, or both. The
Court may authorise a retrial if it sets aside a
conviction. There is no further appeal to the
House of Lords. In summary proceedings the
prosecutor may appeal on a point of law against
acquittal or sentence. The Lord Advocate
may seek the opinion of the High Court on a
point of law in a case where a person tried on
indictment is acquitted. The acquittal in the
original case is not affected. The Crown has a
right of appeal against lenient sentences in
both solemn and summary procedure.
The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995
provides for the introduction of a
requirement for leave to appeal. This will
involve a single judge assessing whether there
are arguable grounds for an appeal. The
legislation will also reduce the number of High
Court judges required to consider appeals
against sentence only from three to two.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, appeals from
magistrates’ courts against conviction or
sentence are heard by the county court. An
appeal on a point of law alone can be heard by
the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal, which
also hears appeals from the Crown Court
against conviction and/or sentence.
Procedures for a further appeal to the House
of Lords are similar to those in England
and Wales.
A person convicted of a terrorist offence
in a non-jury court has an automatic right of
appeal against conviction and/or sentence.
The new Criminal Cases Review
Commission (see above) will operate in
Northern Ireland as well as in England
and Wales.
Coroners’ Courts
In England and Wales the coroner must hold
an inquest if the deceased died a violent or
unnatural death, a sudden death where
the cause is unknown, or in prison or in
other specified circumstances. In Northern
Ireland in such circumstances the coroner
investigates the matter to decide whether an
inquest is necessary. The coroner’s court
establishes how, when and where the
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
deceased died. A coroner may sit alone or, in
certain circumstances, with a jury.
In Scotland the local procurator fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and
suspicious deaths and may report the findings
to the Crown Office. In a minority of cases a
fatal accident inquiry may be held before the
sheriff; this is mandatory in cases of death
resulting from industrial accidents and of
deaths in custody.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The Government believes that prison is the
right response for the most serious, dangerous
and persistent offenders. It also considers that
there should be effective and demanding
punishment within the community to deal
with offenders for whom a prison sentence is
not appropriate. Tough new national standards
for community sentences were announced in
March 1995. Fines continue to represent a
proper penalty for other less serious offences.
Legislation sets the maximum penalties for
offences, the sentence being entirely a matter
for the courts, subject to these maxima. The
Court of Appeal issues guidance on
sentencing to the lower courts when points of
principle have arisen on individual appeal cases.
In Scotland, where many offences a're not
created by statute, the penalty for offences at
common law ranges from absolute discharge
to life imprisonment.
Custody
England and Wales
A custodial sentence is the most severe
penalty available to the courts. Under the
Criminal Justice Act 1991, a custodial
sentence can be imposed only where the
offence is so serious that only such a sentence
would be appropriate, or where there is a
need to protect the public from a sexual or
violent offender. A court is required to
explain to the offender why it is passing a
custodial sentence. The length of the sentence
must reflect the seriousness of the offence.
A magistrates’ court cannot impose a term
of more than six months’ imprisonment for
an individual offence tried summarily. It can
impose consecutive sentences for ‘either way’
offences (see p. 90), subject to an overall
maximum of 12 months’ imprisonment. If an
offence carries a higher maximum penalty,
the court may commit the offender for
sentence at the Crown Court. The Crown
Court may impose a custodial sentence for
any term up to life, depending on the
seriousness of the offence and the maximum
penalty available.
If a court decides that an offence is
sufficiently serious to justify an immediate
custodial sentence of not more than two
years, the sentence may be suspended for a
period of at least one year and not more than
two years if exceptional circumstances justify
the suspension. If the offender commits
another imprisonable offence during the
period of suspension, the court may order the
suspended sentence to be served in addition
to any punishment imposed for the second
offence. When passing a suspended sentence,
the court must consider whether it would
also be appropriate to impose a fine or make
a compensation order. The court may also
order supervision of the offender by a
probation officer if the suspended sentence is
for more than six months.
There is a mandatory sentence of life
imprisonment for murder throughout Britain.
Life imprisonment is the maximum penalty
for a number of serious offences such as
robbery, rape, arson and manslaughter.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the position is generally
the same as for England and Wales. A
magistrates’ court, however, cannot commit
an offender for sentencing at the Crown
Court if it has tried the case.
Scotland
In Scottish trials on indictment the High
Court of Justiciary may impose a sentence of
imprisonment for any term up to life, and the
sheriff court any term up to three years. The
latter may send any person to the High Court
for sentence if the court considers its powers
are insufficient. In summary cases the sheriff
or stipendiary magistrate may normally
95
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
impose up to three months’ imprisonment or
six months’ for some repeated offences. The
district court can impose a maximum term of
imprisonment of 60 days.
Non-custodial Treatment
Non-custodial sentences include:
• fines;
• compensation orders;
• probation and supervision orders;
• community service orders; and
• a combination order, which includes
elements of probation and community
service.
Fines
About 80 per cent of offenders are punished
with a fine. There is no limit to the fine
which the Crown Court (and High Court of
Justiciary and the sheriff court in Scotland
under solemn procedure) may impose on
indictment. The maximum fine that can be
imposed by a magistrates’ court in England
and Wales (and a sheriff court in Scotland
under summary procedure) is £5,000. When
fixing the amount of a fine, courts are
required to reflect the seriousness of the
offence and to take into account the financial
circumstances of the offender.
Probation
The locally organised probation service in
England and Wales supervises offenders in
the community under direct court orders and
after release from custody. It also provides
offenders in custody with help and advice.
A court probation order can last between
six months and three years; if the offender
fails to comply with any of the requirements
of the order, he or she can be brought before
the court again. A probation order can be
combined with a community service order.
A probation order requires the offender to
maintain regular contact with the probation
officer, who is expected to supervise the
offender and to confront him or her with the
consequences of his or her offence. Special
conditions attached to the order may require
the offender to attend a day centre for up to
60 days. Probation is intended as a
punishment, although the time spent by
offenders under supervision in the community
offers an opportunity for constructive work to
reduce the likelihood of reoffending.
In England and Wales the probation
service also administers supervision orders, the
community service scheme and supervises
those released from prison on parole.
The statutory Probation Inspectorate
monitors the work of the voluntary and
private sectors with the probation service in
addition to its inspection and advisory duties.
In Scotland local authority social work
departments supervise offenders on
probation, community service and other
community disposals, and offenders subject
to supervision on release from custody.
In Northern Ireland the service is
administered by the government-funded
Probation Board, whose membership is
representative of the community.
Community Service
Offenders aged 16 or over convicted of
imprisonable offences may, with their
consent, be given community service orders.
The court may order between 40 and 240
hours’ unpaid service to be completed within
12 months. Examples of work done include
decorating the houses of elderly or disabled
people and building adventure playgrounds.
In England and Wales the court may make
an order combining community service and
probation. The maximum term for the
probation element is the same as a probation
order and the maximum period of community
service is 100 hours (240 hours in Scotland).
Curfew Order
The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994 provides for the use of curfew orders
with electronic monitoring in trial areas.
Courts in the trial areas can require offenders
to remain at home for periods of between two
and 12 hours a day. The order can be
combined with probation or community
service. A decision on whether to extend the
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
order to courts throughout England and
Wales will be taken in the light of the trials.
Compensation
The courts may order an offender to pay
compensation for personal injury, loss or
damage resulting from an offence. In England
and Wales courts are required to give reasons
for not awarding compensation to a victim.
Compensation takes precedence over fines.
Other Measures
A court in England and Wales may discharge a
person either absolutely or conditionally if it
believes that it is not necessary to inflict
punishment. If he or she is conditionally
discharged, the offender remains liable to
punishment for the offence if convicted of
another offence within a period specified by
the court (not more than three years).
Courts may also require an offender to
keep the peace and/or be of good behaviour.
If this requirement is not complied with, the
offender is liable to forfeit a sum of money.
Similar powers are available to courts in
Northern Ireland.
Courts have the power to defer sentence,
for the purpose of enabling the court, in
dealing with the offender subsequently, to
have regard to his or her conduct or any
changes in his or her circumstances.
The police have discretion whether to
charge an offender or formally to caution him
or her. Cautioning is a form of warning and
no court action is taken. New guidelines
designed to stop the use of cautions for serious
offences and to cut the number of repeated
cautions were published by the Government in
1994. Cautioning is not available in Scotland.
Prisons
The Prison Service in England and Wales,
the Scottish Prison Service and the Northern
Ireland Prison Service are all executive
agencies. Government ministers remain
accountable for policy but the Chief Executives
are responsible for the delivery of services.
Prisoners are housed in accommodation
ranging from open prisons to high security
establishments. In England, Scotland and
Wales sentenced prisoners are classified into
groups for security purposes. There are
separate prisons for women. There are no
open prisons in Northern Ireland, where the
majority of offenders are serving sentences
for terrorist offences. People awaiting trial in
custody are entitled to privileges not
granted to convicted prisoners. Those under
21 are, where possible, separated from
convicted prisoners.
There are about 130 prison establishments
in England and Wales and 22 in Scotland,
many of which were built in the 19th
century. Improvements are in progress to
eliminate cells without access to integral
sanitation, and a prison building programme
is alleviating overcrowding.
In Northern Ireland there are four prisons
and a young offenders’ centre. Four of these
establishments have been built since 1972.
The average prison population in 1994 was
48,000 in England and Wales, 1,920 in
Northern Ireland, and 5,600 in Scotland.
Since 1991 the Government has been
implementing a programme of reforms for
the prison services in England and Wales
and in Scotland. It is designed to provide a
better prison system, with more effective
measures for control, more constructive
relationships between prisoners and staff,
and more stimulating and useful programmes
for prisoners.
In 1995-96 the key priority of the Prison
Service in England and Wales is to
strengthen physical security and security
procedures, particularly at establishments
holding high security prisoners.
Private Sector Involvement
Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, the
Home Secretary is empowered to contract out
the management of prisons in England and
Wales to the private sector, as well as escort
and guarding functions.
The Court Escort and Custody Service is
being progressively contracted out throughout
the country. All escort services will be
provided by the private sector by 1997,
leaving police and prison officers free to
concentrate on their own core duties.
97
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Four prisons (which remain part of the
Prison Service) are now managed by private
contractors: The Wolds in Humberside
opened in April 1992, Blakenhurst prison in
Worcestershire opened in May 1993, and
Doncaster prison and Buckley Hall prison in
Rochdale opened in June and December
1994 respectively.
The Government has announced that six
new prisons to be built will, for the first
time, be designed, constructed, managed and
financed by the private sector. The first two
are expected to open in 1997-98 in
Merseyside and South Wales.
The Prison Service is also continuing to
contract out services both nationally and
locally, including education services in prison
and catering.
Provision for the further contracting out
of prisons and prisoner escort services is
included in the Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994.
Early Release of Prisoners
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 reformed the
remission and parole systems in England and
Wales, with revised arrangements for the
early release of prisoners and for their
supervision and liabilities after release. The
Parole Board continues to advise the Home
Secretary on the early release or recall of
long-term prisoners.
Prisoners serving terms of less than four
years may be released once they have served
half of their sentences in custody. Long-term
prisoners (those serving more than four years)
may be released once they have served two-
thirds of their sentence; the Parole Board
may release them on licence half-way through
their sentence if they are serving between
four and seven years. The Home Secretary
has to give final consent to such parole if the
prisoner is serving more than seven years. All
prisoners sentenced to a year or more may be
supervised on release until three-quarters of
their sentence has passed. Certain sex
offenders may be supervised to the end of
their sentence.
If convicted of another offence punishable
with imprisonment and committed before the
end of the original sentence, a released
prisoner may be liable to serve all or part of
the original sentence outstanding at the time
the fresh offence was committed.
Similar changes have been adopted
in Scotland.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving a
sentence of more than five days are eligible
for remission of half their sentence. A
prisoner serving a sentence of more than 12
months who is given remission is liable to be
ordered to serve the remainder of this
sentence if convicted of fresh imprisonable
offences during this period.
Remission for those convicted of terrorist
offences and serving sentences of five years
or more is one-third. Any released prisoners
convicted of another terrorist offence before
the expiry of the original sentence must
complete that sentence before serving any
term for the second offence.
Life Sentence Prisoners
Arrangements for the early release of
prisoners serving life sentences for offences
other than murder are set out in the Criminal
Justice Act 1991. The Home Secretary is
required to release such prisoners after an
initial period set by the trial judge if so
directed by the Parole Board, which has to be
satisfied that the protection of the public
does not require their further confinement.
These provisions conform with the
requirements of the European Convention on
Human Rights. Similar procedures have been
adopted in Scotland.
The release on licence of prisoners serving
mandatory life sentences for murder may
only be authorised by the Home Secretary on
the recommendation of the Parole Board. A
similar policy applies in Scotland.
On release, life sentence prisoners remain
on licence for the rest of their lives and are
subject to recall if their behaviour suggests
that they might again be a danger to
the public.
People serving life sentences for the
murder of police or prison officers, terrorist
murders, murder by firearms in the course of
98
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
robbery and the sexual or sadistic murder of
children are normally detained for at least
20 years.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of
State reviews life sentence cases on the
recommendation of an internal review body.
Repatriation
Sentenced prisoners who are nationals of
countries which have ratified the Council of
Europe Convention on the Transfer of
Sentenced Persons or similar international
arrangements may apply to be returned to
their own country to serve the rest of their
sentence there.
Independent Oversight of the Prison System
Every prison establishment has a Board of
Visitors—a Visiting Committee in Scotland—
drawn from the local community. In order to
see that prisoners are being treated fairly,
members may go to any part of the prison
and interview any inmate at any time.
The independent Prisons Inspectorates
report on the treatment of prisoners and
prison conditions. Each establishment is
visited about every three years.
Prison Industries
Prison industries aim to give inmates work
experience which will assist them when
released and to secure a return which will
reduce the cost of the prison system. The
main industries are clothing and textile
manufacture, engineering, woodwork,
laundering, farming and horticulture. In
England and Wales most production caters
for internal needs and for other public
services, whereas in Scotland a greater
proportion is sold to the private sector. A few
prisoners are employed outside prison, some
in community service projects.
Prison Education
Full-\ime education of 15 hours a week is
compulsory for young offenders below school
leaving age. For older offenders it is
voluntary. Some prisoners study for public
examinations, including those of the Open
University. Competitive tendering for the
provision of education services in prisons in
England and Wales has taken place and
contracts have been awarded, many to further
and higher education establishments. In
England, Wales and Scotland increased
emphasis is being placed on the development
and implementation of National and
Scottish Vocational Qualifications (see
p. 442) for inmates.
Physical education is voluntary for adult
offenders but compulsory for young
offenders. Practically all prisons have physical
education facilities, some of which are
purpose-built. Opportunities are given for
inmates to obtain sporting proficiency awards.
Inmates also compete against teams in the
local community.
Health Care
The Health Care Service for Prisoners in
England and Wales is responsible for the
physical and mental health of all those in
custody. A Health Advisory Committee
provides independent medical advice to
government ministers, the Prison Service Chief
Executive and the Director of Health Care.
A greater emphasis is being placed on
‘buying in’ health care services either
from the National Health Service (NHS—
see p. 385) or the private sector. The Prison
Service is also committed to transferring
mentally disordered offenders to the care and
treatment of the NHS and social services
where possible.
In Scotland general medical services are
provided mainly by visiting general
practitioners. Psychiatric and psychological
services are bought in from local health boards
responsible for the NHS.
Privileges and Discipline
Prisoners may write and receive letters and be
visited by relatives and friends, and those in
all establishments in England, Wales and
Scotland may make telephone calls. Privileges
include a personal radio; books, periodicals
and newspapers; watching television; and the
opportunity to make purchases from the
99
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
prison shop with money earned in prison.
Depending on the facilities available, prisoners
may be granted the further privileges of
dining and recreation in association.
To maintain discipline, control and order
the Prison Service in England and Wales is:
• developing incentive-based regimes, so
that prisoners must earn privileges
through responsible behaviour and will
lose them for misbehaviour;
# increasing the penalties available to
governors to deal with disciplinary
offences;
# providing special units with facilities for
dealing with violent or disruptive
prisoners; and
• implementing a comprehensive strategy
on drug misuse, including manadatory
urine testing.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the
prison governor. A Prisons Ombudsman for
England and Wales has been appointed as a
final appeal stage for prisoners’ grievances.
In Scotland, prisoners who exhaust the
internal grievance procedure may make
application to the Scottish Prisons Complaints
Commission, which is independent of the
Scottish Prison Service.
Religion
Anglican, Church of Scotland, Roman
Catholic and Methodist chaplains provide
opportunities for worship and spiritual
counselling, supported by visiting ministers of
other denominations and faiths as required.
Preparation for Release
The prison services in England and Wales
and in Scotland have a duty to prepare
prisoners for release. Planning for safe release
starts at the beginning of an offender’s
sentence and ties in with all the training,
education and work experience provided. It is
directed at equipping prisoners to fit back
into society and to cope with life without
reoffending. Risk assessment and confronting
offending behaviour are essential elements of
this process. Sentence planning is being
extended progressively to all prisoners serving
substantial sentences, in conjunction with
extended arrangements for aftercare.
Prisoners may be granted temporary
licence for short periods, but they are subject
to a rigorous risk assessment and are released
only for very specific reasons.
The Pre-Release Employment Scheme in
England and Wales and the Training for
Freedom Scheme in Scotland enable selected
long-term prisoners to spend their last six
months before release in certain hostels
attached to prisons in order to help them
readapt to society. Hostellers work in the
outside community and return to the hostel
each evening. Frequent weekend leave allows
hostellers to renew ties with their families.
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving
fixed sentences may have short periods of
leave near the end of their sentences and at
Christmas. Life sentence prisoners are given
a nine-month pre-release programme which
includes employment outside the prison.
Aftercare
Professional support is given to offenders
following their release. All young offenders
and all adult offenders in England and Wales
sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and
over are supervised on release by the
probation service—or, in the case of certain
young offenders, by local authority social
services departments. In Scotland this
support is provided by local authority social
work services, although not all adult offenders
are subject to supervision on release.
Young Offenders
England and Wales
Criminal proceedings cannot be brought
against children below the age of 10 years.
Offenders between the ages of 10 and 18 fall
within the jurisdiction of youth courts.
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may be given the
same probation, curfew and community
service orders as older offenders; also
available to the court are the same
supervision orders or attendance centre
orders as are given to younger offenders.
Under a supervision order—which may
100
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
remain in force for not more than three
years—a child (10-13 years old) or young
person (14—17 years old) normally lives at
home under the supervision of a social worker
or a probation officer. The order may require
the offender to live in local authority
accommodation and/or participate in
specified activities at specified times.
Anyone under 21 years of age found guilty
of an offence for which an adult may be
imprisoned can be ordered to go to an
attendance centre, as can an offender who
refuses to comply with another order (for
example, default in paying a fine or breach of
a probation order). The maximum number of
hours of attendance is 36 (or 24 if the
offender is aged under 16) spread over a
period; the minimum is 12 hours. The order
aims to encourage offenders to make more
constructive use of their leisure time.
Crown Court powers to order long periods
of detention for young offenders who commit
serious crimes are extended under the
provisions of the Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994 to include 10- to 13-year-
olds. The courts may detain 10- to 13-year-
olds convicted of an offence for which an
adult can be jailed for 14 years or more
(including rape, arson, domestic burglary and
robbery). Previously they could be given long
terms of detention only if they had been
convicted of murder or manslaughter. Courts
may also detain any 10- to 15-year-old
convicted of indecent assault on a woman,
where previously only 16- and 17-year-olds
could be detained for this offence. Any
offender aged 14 or over who is convicted of
causing death by dangerous or drunken
driving may also be detained. Detention may
be in a local authority secure residential unit,
a centre managed by the Youth Treatment
Service or a young offender institution.
The basic custodial sentence for those aged
15 to 21 is detention in a young offender
institution. Alternatives include fines and
compensation, attendance centre orders (for
up to 36 hours) and community service orders
(for between 40 and 240 hours).
In the area of parental responsibility, the
Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994
extends the powers given to the courts by the
Criminal Justice Act 1991. The 1991 Act:
• strengthened courts’ powers to make
parents attend hearings in cases involving
offenders up to the age of 18;
• strengthened the liability on parents to
pay fines and compensation arising from
the crimes committed by their children;
• contained greater power for courts to
order parents to take proper care and
control of their children if necessary to
prevent further offences; and
• allowed such orders to be imposed for up
to three years, or until the offender’s
18th birthday.
Where local authorities have assumed
parental responsibility, the duty to attend
court and pay any fines also applies.
Under the 1994 legislation, courts can
order parents to ensure their children comply
with community sentences. In every case
when an offender aged between 10 and 15
years receives a community sentence, the
court is under a duty to consider such an
order. Courts have a power, as opposed to a
duty, in the case of 16- and 17-year-olds.
Courts are also empowered to impose a
secure training order on persistent offenders
aged between 12 and 14. The order means a
period of detention in a secure training centre
followed by a period of supervision; it is
available for young offenders who have
committed three or more imprisonable
offences and who have failed to respond to
punishment in the community. A further
provision doubles the maximum sentence for
15- to 17-year-olds in a young offender
institution from one to two years.
Scotland
Criminal proceedings may be brought against
any child aged eight years or over, but the
instructions of the Lord Advocate are
necessary before anyone under 16 years of
age is prosecuted.
Children under 16 who have committed an
offence or are considered to be in need of
care and protection may be brought before a
children’s panel. The panel, consisting of
three lay people, determines in an informal
setting whether compulsory measures of care
are required and, if so, the form they should
take. An official known as the reporter decides
101
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
whether a child should come before a hearing.
If the grounds for referral are not accepted by
the child or parent, the case goes to the sheritl
for proof. If he or she finds the grounds
established, the sheriff remits the case to the
reporter to arrange a hearing. The sheriff also
decides appeals against a hearing’s decision.
Young people aged between 16 and 21
serve custodial sentences in a young offender
institution. Remission of part of the sentence
for good behaviour, release on parole and
supervision on release are available.
Northern Ireland
Those aged between 10 and 16 who are
charged with a criminal offence are normally
brought before a juvenile court. If found
guilty of an offence punishable in the case of
an adult by imprisonment, the court may
order the offender to be placed in care, under
supervision or on probation. The offender
may also be required to attend a day
attendance centre, be sent to a training school
or committed to residence in a remand home.
Non-custodial options are the same as in
England and Wales.
Offenders aged between 16 and 24 who
receive custodial sentences of less than three
years serve them in a young offenders’ centre.
Civil Justice
The Civil Law
The civil law of England, Wales and
Northern Ireland covers business related to
the family, property, contracts and torts
(non-contractual wrongful acts suffered by
one person at the hands of another). It also
includes constitutional, administrative,
industrial, maritime and ecclesiastical law.
Scottish civil law has its own, broadly similar,
branches.
CIVIL COURTS
England and Wales
Civil cases are heard in county courts and the
High Court. Magistrates’ courts have a
concurrent jurisdiction with the county courts
and the High Court in cases relating to children.
The jurisdiction of the 270 county
courts covers:
• actions founded upon contract and tort;
• trust and mortgage cases;
• actions for the recovery of land;
• cases involving disputes between
landlords and tenants;
• complaints about race and sex
discrimination;
• admiralty cases (maritime questions and
offences) and patent cases; and
• divorce cases and other family matters.
Specialised work is concentrated in certain
designated courts. In some types of cases, for
example admiralty cases, a county court is
restricted to an upper financial limit.
For small claims, there are special
arbitration facilities and simplified procedures.
There are also special care centres and family
hearing centres which deal with contested
family matters involving children.
The High Court, which is divided into
three divisions, deals with the more
complicated civil cases. Its jurisdiction covers
mainly civil and some criminal cases; it also
deals with appeals from tribunals and from
magistrates’ courts in both civil and criminal
matters. The three divisions are:
• the Family Division, which is concerned
with family law, including adoption and
wills;
• the Chancery Division, which deals with
corporate and personal insolvency;
disputes in the running of companies,
between landlords and tenants and in
intellectual property matters; and the
interpretation of trusts and contested
wills; and
• the Queen’s Bench Division, which is
concerned with contract and tort cases,
and deals with applications for judicial
review. Maritime law and commercial law
are the responsibility of the Division’s
admiralty and commercial courts.
In the event of overlapping jurisdiction
between the High Court and the county
102
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
courts, cases of exceptional importance,
complexity or financial substance are reserved
or transferred for trial in the High Court.
Appeals
Appeals in matrimonial, adoption,
guardianship and child care proceedings heard
by magistrates’ courts go to the Family
Division of the High Court. Appeals from the
High Court and county courts are heard in
the Court of Appeal (Civil Division), and may
go on to the House of Lords.
The Law Lords deal with cases submitted
to the House of Lords. They are professional
judges who have been given life peerages. In
addition, peers who have held high judicial
office are qualified to sit as Lords appeal
judges. A group of five judges usually deals
with cases. The Lord Chancellor is President
of the House in its judicial capacity.
Scotland
The civil courts in Scotland are the Court of
Session and the sheriff court, which have the
same jurisdiction over most civil litigation,
although cases with a value of less than
£1,500 are dealt with only by the sheriff
court. Appeals from the sheriff court may be
made to the sheriff principal or directly to the
Court of Session in ordinary actions.
In cases where the value of the claim is
between £750 and £1,500, the case may be
appealed to the sheriff principal on a point of
law and to the Court of Session thereafter
only if the sheriff principal certifies the case
as suitable for such an appeal. In small claims
cases where the value of the claim does not
exceed £750 there may be an appeal to the
sheriff principal on a point of law.
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh,
and in general has jurisdiction to deal with all
kinds of action. It is divided into the Outer
House (a court of first instance) and the
Inner House (mainly an appeal court).
Appeals to the Inner House may be made
from the Outer House and from the sheriff
court, f rom the Inner House an appeal may
go to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court deals exclusively
with matters concerning agriculture. Its
chairman has the status and tenure of a
judge of the Court of Session and its other
members are lay specialists.
Northern Ireland
Civil cases up to a limited and specified
monetary value are dealt with in county
courts. The magistrates’ court in Northern
Ireland also deals with certain limited
classes of civil case. The superior civil law
court is the High Court of Justice, from
which an appeal may be made to the Court
of Appeal. The House of Lords is the final
civil appeal court. Appeals from county
courts are dealt with by the High Court or
the Court of Appeal.
Civil Proceedings
England and Wales
Civil proceedings are started by the
aggrieved person. Actions in the High
Court are usually begun by a writ served
on the defendant by the plaintiff, stating
the nature of the claim. Before the case is
tried, documents (pleadings) setting out the
scope of the dispute are filed with the
court; the pleadings are also served on the
parties. County court proceedings are
initiated by a summons, usually served on
the defendant by the court. Child care
cases are initiated by an application in the
magistrates’ courts.
In order to encourage parties to confine
the issues in dispute, the High Court and
the county courts have power to order pre¬
trial exchange of witness statements. Courts
may impose penalties in costs on parties
who unreasonably refuse to admit facts or
to disclose documents before trial.
Civil proceedings, as a private matter,
can usually be abandoned or ended by
settlement between the parties at any time.
Actions brought to court are usually tried
without a jury, except in defamation, false
imprisonment or malicious prosecution
cases or where fraud is alleged, when either
party may apply for trial by jury. The jury
decides questions of fact and determines
the damages to be paid to the injured
103
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
party; majority verdicts may be accepted. The
Court of Appeal is able to increase or reduce
damages awarded by a jury if it considers
them inadequate or excessive.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced
in open court, but a procedure for most
undefended cases dispenses with the need to
give evidence in court and permits written
evidence to be considered by the county
court district judge.
In civil cases heard by a magistrates’ court,
the court issues a summons to the defendant
setting out details of the complaint and the
date on which it will be heard. Parties and
witnesses give their evidence at the court
hearing. Family proceedings are normally
heard by not more than three lay justices,
including both men and women. Members of
the public are not allowed to be present. The
court may make orders concerning residence,
contact and supervision of children, and in
some cases maintenance payments for spouses
and children.
A two-year review of rules and
procedures of the civil courts of
England and Wales began in March
1994, and an interim report was
published in June 1995. The report
recommends a fundamental transfer
in the responsibility for the
management of civil cases from
litigants and their legal advisers to
the courts.
Most judgments are for sums of money
and may be enforced, in cases of non-payment,
by seizure of the debtor’s goods or by a court
order requiring an employer to make periodic
payments to the court by deduction from the
debtor’s earnings. Other court remedies may
include an injunction restraining someone
from performing an unlawful act. Refusal to
obey a court order may result in a fine or
imprisonment for contempt.
Normally the court orders the costs of an
action to be paid by the party losing it, but,
in the case of family law maintenance
proceedings, a magistrates’ court can order
either party to pay the whole or part of the
other’s costs.
Scotland
Proceedings in the Court of Session or
ordinary actions in the sheriff court are
initiated by serving the defender with a
summons—or, in sheriff court cases, an initial
writ. A defender who intends to contest the
action must inform the court; if he or she
fails to do so, the court normally grants a
decree in absence in favour of the pursuer.
Where a case is contested, both parties must
prepare written pleadings. Time is allowed
for either party to adjust their pleadings in
the light of what the other has said. At the
end of this period a hearing will normally
be arranged.
In cases involving sums between £750 and
£1,500 in the sheriff court, a statement of
claim is incorporated in the initial writ. The
procedure is designed to enable most actions
to be settled without the parties having to
appear in court. Normally they, or their
representatives, need appear only when an
action is defended.
Northern Ireland
There are differences between proceedings
in Northern Ireland and in England and
Wales—for example, procedures in the
county court start with the issue of a civil
bill, which is served by the plaintiff on
the defendant.
Tribunals
Tribunals exercise judicial functions separate
from the courts and are intended to be more
accessible, less formal and less expensive.
They are normally set up under statutory
powers, which also govern their constitution,
functions and procedure. Tribunals often
consist of lay people, but they are generally
chaired by a legally qualified person.
Some tribunals settle disputes between
private citizens. Industrial tribunals, for
example, have a major role in employment
disputes. Others, such as those concerned
with social security, resolve claims by private
citizens against public authorities. A further
group, including tax tribunals, decide
disputed claims by public authorities against
104
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
private citizens. Tribunals usually consist of
an uneven number of people so that a
majority decision can be reached.
In the case of some tribunals a two-tier
system operates, with an initial right of appeal
to a lower tribunal and a further right of
appeal, usually on a point of law, to a higher
one, and in some cases to the Court of
Appeal. Appeals from single-tier tribunals can
usually be made only on a point of law to the
High Court in England and Wales, to the
Court of Session in Scotland, and to the
Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland.
The independent Council on Tribunals
exercises general supervision over many
tribunals. A Scottish Committee of the Council
exercises the same function in Scotland.
Administration of the Law
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
England and Wales
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the
judiciary and is responsible for the
administration of all courts other than
coroners’ courts, and for a number of
administrative tribunals. The highest judicial
appointments are made by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister. The Lord
Chancellor recommends all other judicial
appointments to the Crown and appoints
magistrates. He has general responsibility for
the legal aid and advice schemes and for the
administration of civil law reform.
The Home Secretary has overall
responsibility for:
• criminal law;
• the police service;
• the prison system;
• the probation and after-care service;
and
• advising the Queen on the exercise of
the royal prerogative of mercy to pardon
a person convicted of a crime or to
remit all or part of a penalty imposed
by a court.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor
General are the Government’s principal legal
advisers and represent the Crown in
appropriate domestic and international cases.
They are senior barristers, elected members
of the House of Commons and hold
ministerial posts. The Attorney General is
also Attorney General for Northern Ireland.
As well as exercising various civil law
functions, the Attorney General has final
responsibility for enforcing the criminal law.
The Solicitor General is the Attorney’s
deputy. As head of the Crown Prosecution
Service, the Director of Public Prosecutions
is subject to superintendence by the Attorney
General, as are the Director of the Serious
Fraud Office and the Director of Public
Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.
Scotland
The Secretary of State for Scotland is
responsible for Scottish criminal law, crime
prevention, the police, the penal system and
legal aid; he or she is advised on parole
matters by the Parole Board for Scotland. He
or she is also responsible for the substantive
civil law.
The Secretary of State recommends the
appointment of all judges other than the most
senior ones, appoints the staff of the High
Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session,
and is responsible for the administration and
staffing of the sheriff courts. (The district
and islands local authorities are responsible
for the district courts.)
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish
questions and the principal representatives of
the Crown for the purposes of prosecutions
and other litigation in Scotland. Both are
government ministers.
Northern Ireland
Court administration is the responsibility of the
Lord Chancellor, while the Northern Ireland
Office, under the Secretary of State, deals with
policy and legislation concerning criminal law,
the police and the penal system. The Lord
Chancellor has general responsibility for legal
aid, advice and assistance.
105
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
JUDGES AND LAWYERS
Judges are not subject to ministerial direction
or control. They are normally appointed from
practising barristers, advocates (in Scotland),
or solicitors (see below). Lay magistrates in
England and Wales and Scottish district
court justices are trained in order to give
them sufficient knowledge of the law,
including the rules of evidence, and of the
nature and purpose of sentencing.
In Northern Ireland members of a lay
panel who serve in juvenile courts undertake
training courses; resident magistrates are
drawn from practising solicitors or barristers.
The Legal Profession
The legal profession is divided into two
branches: barristers (advocates in Scotland)
and solicitors. Barristers and advocates advise
on legal problems submitted through solicitors
or other recognised professional bodies and
present cases in all courts. Solicitors undertake
legal business for individual and corporate
clients; they can also, after appropriate
training, present cases in all courts. Although
people are free to conduct their own cases,
most people prefer to be legally represented,
especially in more serious cases.
Complaints systems against solicitors,
barristers and licensed conveyancers are
backed up by the Legal Services Ombudsman
for England and Wales, who conducts
investigations into the way the professional
bodies handle these complaints. There is a
separate Ombudsman for Scotland.
LEGAL AID
A person who needs legal advice, assistance
or representation may be able to get help
with his or her legal costs from the legal aid
scheme. A person who qualifies for help may
have all his or her legal costs paid for, or may
be asked to make a contribution towards
them, depending on his or her means.
Legal Advice and Assistance
Legal advice and assistance is available under
the Green Form Scheme in England and
Wales. People whose income and capital are
within certain limits are entitled to free advice
from a solicitor on certain legal matters. The
scheme provides for up to three hours’ work
for matrimonial cases where a petition is
drafted and two hours for other work. A
similar scheme operates in Northern Ireland.
Legal Aid in Civil Proceedings
Civil legal aid may be available for most civil
proceedings to those who satisfy the financial
eligibility conditions. An applicant for legal
aid must also show that he or she has
reasonable grounds for taking, defending or
being a party to proceedings. In England and
Wales payments to lawyers are made through
the Legal Aid Fund, administered by the
Legal Aid Board. Scotland has a separate
Legal Aid Fund, administered by the
Scottish Legal Aid Board. Legal aid in
Northern Ireland is administered by the Law
Society for Northern Ireland.
In certain limited circumstances the
successful unassisted opponent of a legally
aided party may recover his or her costs in
the case from the Legal Aid Board. Where
the assisted person recovers or preserves
money or property in the proceedings, the
Legal Aid Fund will usually have a first
charge on that money or property to recover
money spent on the assisted person s behalf.
Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings
In criminal proceedings in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland legal aid may be
granted by the court if it appears to be in the
interests of justice and if a defendant is
considered to require financial assistance. A
legal aid certificate must be granted (subject
to means) when a person is committed for
trial on a murder charge or where the
prosecutor appeals or applies for leave to
appeal from the Court of Appeal to the
House of Lords. In England and Wales a
financial contribution may be payable.
The Legal Aid Board in England and
Wales makes arrangements for duty solicitors
to assist unrepresented defendants in the
magistrates’ courts. Solicitors are available, on
a 24-hour basis, to give advice and assistance
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
to those being questioned by the police. The
services of a solicitor at a police station and of
the duty solicitor at court are free.
Where legal aid is granted for criminal
cases in Northern Ireland it is free. There is a
voluntary duty solicitor scheme at the main
magistrates’ court in Belfast.
Scotland
A duty solicitor is available to represent people
in custody on their first appearance in the
sheriff courts and the district courts without
enquiry into the person’s means. In other cases,
a person seeking legal aid in summary criminal
proceedings must apply to the Scottish Legal
Aid Board, which must be satisfied that the
costs of the case cannot be met by the applicant
without undue hardship, and that it is in the
interests of justice that legal aid is awarded.
In solemn proceedings the court decides on
the availability of legal aid and must be satisfied
that the accused cannot meet the costs of the
defence without undue financial hardship.
Where legal aid is granted to the accused in
criminal proceedings, he or she is not required
to pay any contribution towards expenses.
Free Representation Unit
The Bar Council, the barristers’ professional
body, runs the Free Representation Unit in
England and Wales for clients at a variety of
tribunals for which legal aid is not available.
Most of the representation in London is
carried out by Bar students supported and
advised by full-time case workers. Elsewhere
the work is carried out by barristers.
Law Centres
In some urban areas law centres provide
free legal advice and representation. They
may employ a salaried lawyer and many
have community workers. Much of their
time is devoted to housing, employment,
social security and immigration problems.
Although there is a restriction on cases they
will accept, most law centres will give
preliminary advice.
Advice at minimal or no cost may be
available in Citizens Advice Bureaux,
consumer and housing advice centres and
in specialist advice centres run by
voluntary organisations.

British foreign policy aims to make Britain more influential in the world
and to contribute to a safer and fairer international order. To these ends,
Britain is a member of some 120 international organisations, including the
United Nations (UN), the Commonwealth, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO) and the European Union (EU). Britain is pledged to
increased co-operation among EU member states. It also plays an active part
in maintaining international peace and security and has been fully involved
in efforts to bring about peace in former Yugoslavia. Britain also protects
the interests of its dependent territories, which include Hong Kong, the
Falkland Islands and Gibraltar. The British aid programme is centred on the
needs of the poorest countries.
ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN
POLICY
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO)
is in charge of overall foreign policy and is
headed by the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary, who is assisted by four ministers
without Cabinet rank. One of these is the
Minister for Overseas Development, who is
responsible for the Overseas Development
Administration (ODA). The FCO’s
Permanent Under-Secretary of State is a civil
servant who is head of the Diplomatic
Service and provides advice to the Foreign
and Commonwealth Secretary on all aspects
of foreign policy.
Of about 6,000 staff of the FCO’s
Diplomatic Wing appointed in the UK, some
2,500 serve overseas, of whom 167 are
seconded from other government departments
and other public and private organisations.
British diplomatic missions also employ about
7,400 locally engaged staff.
Some 25 per cent of frontline staff
overseas deal with political and economic
work, while 30 per cent are engaged on
commercial work, 14 per cent on entry
clearance to Britain, 9 per cent on consular
work, 5 per cent on aid administration,
9 per cent on information and 8 per cent
on other activities, such as culture, science
and technology.
The FCO administers pre-entry control
111
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
overseas for people wishing to enter Britain.
Applications for entry clearance are dealt
with by the visa section or consulate of a
British mission.
Britain is committed to maintaining a
worldwide diplomatic presence. Diplomatic
or consular relations are maintained with
183 countries and there are missions at nine
international organisations or conferences.
The FCO’s only executive agency, Wilton
Park International Conference Centre,
contributes to the solution of international
problems by organising conferences in
Britain, attended by top politicians, officials,
business people, academics and other
professionals from all over the world. Its
home is the Wilton House Conference
Centre in West Sussex.
Other Departments
Other government departments, too, are
concerned with overseas relations and
foreign policy. The Ministry of Defence
maintains military liaison with Britain’s
allies and with NATO, and also controls
and administers the armed forces (see
p. 138). The Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) has an important say on
international trade policy and commercial
relations with other countries, including
EU member states. The FCO and DTI
have a joint export promotion
organisation—Overseas Trade Services
(see p. 175). The Treasury is involved in
British international economic policy and is
responsible for Britain’s relations with the
World Bank and other international
financial institutions.
When other departments are involved,
the FCO decides policy in consultation with
them. The department with the main
interest usually takes the lead, particularly
in EU matters and international economic
policy. The FCO co-ordinates British
EU policy through the Cabinet Office
European Secretariat.
The British Council is responsible for
British cultural relations with other countries
(see p. 134). These are further enhanced by
the BBC World Service (see p. 489), which is
partly funded by the FCO.
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
United Nations
Britain is a founder member of the United
Nations and one of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, along with
China, France, Russia and the United States.
In 1994 it was the sixth largest contributor to
the UN regular budget. It is also one of the
leading contributors to UN peacekeeping
operations (see p. 122). Britain is fully
committed to the purposes and principles of
the UN Charter. Those purposes are the
maintenance of international peace and
security, the development of friendly relations
among nations, the achievement of
international co-operation on economic,
social, cultural and humanitarian issues and
the protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
European Union
Britain is a committed member of the
European Union, which comprises the
European Community (EC) and
intergovernmental co-operation on foreign
and security policy, and on justice and
home affairs (see p. 118).
As one of the larger countries, Britain
provides two of the 20 members ot the
European Commission, which puts forward
policy proposals, executes decisions taken by
the Council of the European Union and
ensures that European Union rules are
correctly observed. Britain is represented at
each meeting of the Council, which is the
main decision-making body. Each Council
consists of government ministers from the
15 member states, representing national
interests in the subjects under discussion
for example, trade, agriculture or
transport. When a member state has the
Presidency of the Union its ministers are
responsible for chairing meetings of the
Council. The Committee of Permanent
Representatives, consisting of member states’
ambassadors to the European Union, prepares
the work of the Council.
The European Council, which meets at
least twice a year, comprises the heads of state
112

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
or government accompanied by their foreign
ministers and the President of the Commission
accompanied by one other Commissioner.
There are 626 members of the directly
elected European Parliament, which is
consulted about major decisions and has
substantial shared power with the Council
over the European Community budget.
Britain has 87 seats. The fourth election to
the Parliament took place in June 1994.
Each member state provides one of the
judges to serve on the European Court of
Justice, which is the supreme authority in the
field of Community law. Its rulings must be
applied by member states, and sanctions can
be imposed on those failing to do so. The
Court is assisted by a Court of First Instance,
which handles certain cases brought by
individuals and companies.
Britain is also represented on the Court of
Auditors, which examines Community
revenue and expenditure to see that it is
legally received and spent.
European Community policies are
implemented by various forms of Community
legislation. The Community also enters into
trade agreements with third countries and has
a number of substantial aid programmes.
Under the common foreign and security
policy, member states agree common positions
and take joint action on foreign policy issues.
Member states also co-operate on justice and
home affairs, including issues such as asylum,
immigration and the fight against crime.
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
Membership of NATO is the keystone of
British defence policy (see p. 136). NATO is
based on the principle of collective security
and its core functions are:
• to provide a foundation for security in
Europe;
• to deter aggression and defend member
states against it; and
• to provide a forum for allied transatlantic
consultation.
Each of the 16 member states has a
permanent representative in NATO
headquarters in Brussels. The main decision¬
taking body is the North Atlantic Council, at
which foreign ministers meet at least twice a
year. Permanent representatives meet on a
weekly basis at the other meetings of the
Council. Defence ministers attend meetings
of the Defence Planning Committee and the
Nuclear Planning Group.
Western European Union
Britain is one of ten members of the Western
European Union (WEU), which is the main
forum for co-operation and consultation on
defence issues for NATO’s European
members. Current WEU members are
Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Greece,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal
and Spain. Iceland, Norway and Turkey are
associate members; Austria, Denmark,
Finland, the Irish Republic and Sweden are
observer members.
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
Britain is a signatory to the 1975 Helsinki
Final Act, which established a framework for
co-operation between OSCE states on
European security (see p. 128), respect for
human rights and economic matters. It was
agreed that the Helsinki commitments should
be reviewed at regular follow-up conferences.
The 1990 Charter of Paris committed the
signatories to democracy, human rights and
market economies. The OSCE has a
Secretariat in Vienna, where Britain has a
permanent delegation. Day-to-day business is
conducted in the Permanent Council. A
Prague office organises the twice-yearly
meetings of senior officials.
The OSCE has 52 members, including
every country in Europe (except the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), the states
of the former Soviet Union, and the United
States and Canada. The Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia was suspended in 1992. All states
participate on an equal basis, and decisions
are taken by consensus.
The main areas of OSCE work are:
• early warning of potential conflict
through preventive diplomacy missions
and the work of the OSCE High
Commissioner on National Minorities;
114
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
• providing advice on human rights,
democracy and law through the OSCE
Office for Democratic Institutions and
Human Rights, in Warsaw (see p. 129);
and
• promoting security through arms control
and military confidence building.
Council of Europe
Britain is a founding member of the Council
of Europe, which is open to any European
democracy accepting the rule of law and the
protection of fundamental human rights and
freedoms. The 36 member states co-operate
on culture, education, sport, health, anti¬
crime policy, measures against drug
trafficking, youth affairs and the
improvement of the environment. In 1950 the
Council adopted its European Convention on
Human Rights (see p. 129).
The Commonwealth
There are 52 members of the
Commonwealth, including Britain. It is a
voluntary association of states, nearly all of
which were British territories but are now
independent. The members are Antigua and
Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh,
Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Britain, Brunei
Darussalam, the Cameroon, Canada, Cyprus,
Dominica, The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada,
Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati,
Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives,
Malta, Mauritius, Namibia, Nauru,
New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua
New Guinea, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia,
St Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles,
Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands,
South Africa, Sri Lanka, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago,
Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Western Samoa,
Zambia and Zimbabwe. Nauru and Tuvalu
are special members, entitled to take part
in all Commonwealth meetings and
activities, with the exception of the biennial
Commonwealth heads of government
meetings. South Africa rejoined in June 1994
after an absence of 33 years.
Consultation between member states takes
place through:
• meetings of heads of government;
• specialised conferences of other ministers
and officials;
• diplomatic representatives known as high
commissioners; and
• non-governmental organisations.
The Queen is recognised as head of the
Commonwealth and is head of state in Britain
and 15 other member countries.
The Commonwealth Secretariat in London
promotes consultation, disseminates
information, and organises heads of
government meetings, ministerial meetings
and other conferences. It administers
co-operative programmes agreed at these
meetings, including the Commonwealth
Fund for Technical Co-operation, which
provides experts, consultancy services and
training awards to Commonwealth
developing countries.
Membership of the Commonwealth
enables Britain to play a responsible part
alongside other nations in aiding the
democratisation and development of the
developing world. About 55 per cent of
British direct aid (see p. 131) goes to
Commonwealth countries. The British
Government participates fully in all
Commonwealth activities and welcomes it as
a means of consulting and co-operating with
peoples of widely differing cultures.
Other International Bodies
Britain is a member of many other
international bodies, including the
International Monetary Fund, which
regulates the international financial system
and provides a source of credit for
member countries facing balance-of-
payments difficulties.
In addition, Britain, along with 24 other
industrialised countries, belongs to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), which promotes
economic growth, support for less developed
countries and worldwide trade expansion.
Other organisations to which Britain
belongs or extends support include the
regional development banks in Africa, the
Caribbean, Latin America and Asia.

BRITAIN’S DEPENDENT
TERRITORIES
Britain’s dependent territories have a
combined population of over 6 million, of
whom 6 million live in Hong Kong. Most
territories have considerable self-government,
with their own legislatures. Governors
appointed by the Queen are responsible
for external affairs, internal security
(including the police) and the public service.
Certain responsibilities are delegated to
locally elected ministers but the ultimate
responsibility for all government affairs rests
with the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary. The British Indian Ocean
Territory, the British Atlantic Territory, and
South Georgia and the South Sandwich
Islands have commissioners, not governors; a
commissioner is not responsible for external
affairs. Britain seeks to provide the territories
with security and political stability, ensure
efficient and honest government and help
them achieve economic social development on
a par with neighbouring countries.
The territories are:
• Anguilla;
• Bermuda;
• British Antarctic Territory;
• British Indian Ocean Territory;
• British Virgin Islands;
• Cayman Islands;
• Falkland Islands;
• Gibraltar;
• Hong Kong;
• Montserrat;
• Pitcairn, Ducie, Henderson and Oeno;
• St Helena and St Helena Dependencies
(Ascension and Tristan da Cunha);
• South Georgia and the South Sandwich
Islands; and
• Turks and Caicos Islands.
Few are rich in natural resources, and
some are scattered groups of islands.
British policy is to help the inhabitants of
the dependent territories to take
independence if they want it and where it is
practicable, and in accordance with treaty
obligations, to do so. The reasonable needs
of the dependent territories are a first call
on the British aid programme.
Hong Kong
In 1984 Britain and China signed the Sino-
British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong, 92
per cent of which is leased from China until
1997. Under this agreement, Britain is
responsible for the administration of Hong
Kong until 30 June 1997. After this date, the
agreement says, Hong Kong will become a
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China, with its capitalist system and way of
life remaining unchanged for at least 50
years. With the exception of foreign affairs
and defence, the Hong Kong SAR will enjoy
a high degree of autonomy and its
government and legislature will be composed
of Hong Kong people.
Britain is pledged to co-operate with
China in bringing about a smooth transition
to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Recent
agreements cover measures to set up a Court
of Final Appeal and the financial
arrangements for the new airport, one of the
world’s largest construction projects.
In September 1991 direct elections took
place for the first time for 18 seats in the
Legislative Council. Another 21 of the 60
seats were elected indirectly from functional
constituencies. The remaining members were
appointed. Elections have also been held for
district boards and municipal councils under
proposals which were discussed by the British
and Chinese governments in 1993 and 1994,
although no agreement was reached.
The most recent Legislative Council
elections took place in September 1995, when
20 members were directly elected, 30
indirectly elected and the remaining ten
chosen by an election committee.
Falkland Islands
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a
territorial claim by Argentina but the
inhabitants wish to remain under British
sovereignty. The British Government does
not accept the Argentine claim and is
committed to defending the Islanders’ right
to live under a government of their own
117
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
choice. This right of self-determination is set
out in the 1985 Falkland Islands Constitution.
In 1982 Argentina invaded and occupied
the Islands, but its forces were expelled by
British troops following Argentina’s failure to
abide by United Nations resolutions
requesting its forces to withdraw. Britain and
Argentina, while sticking to their respective
positions on sovereignty, maintain diplomatic
relations and continue to discuss their common
interests in the South Atlantic region, such as
fisheries conservation and oil exploration.
Gibraltar
Gibraltar was ceded to Britain in 1713 by the
Treaty of Utrecht. It is the subject of a
territorial claim by Spain. Under the Treaty,
Spain has the right of first refusal should
Britain ever decide to relinquish sovereignty.
Britain is committed to honouring the
wishes of the people of Gibraltar on their
future, as set out in the 1969 Gibraltar
Constitution.
Over the years, Spain has used pressure at
the border with Gibraltar to pursue its
national objectives. Strict controls, which
caused severe delays and substantial damage
to Gibraltar’s economy, were applied, for
example, in autumn 1994 and in spring/
summer 1995.
Gibraltar is part of the European Union,
although it is outside the common customs
system and does not participate in the
Common Agricultural Policy.
Gibraltar has recently introduced strict
anti-money laundering legislation and has
taken action to combat drug smuggling from
Morocco to Spain, although most of this has
not involved Gibraltar.
Caribbean Territories
The Dependent Territories Regional
Secretariat in Barbados administers aspects of
British government policy towards the
Caribbean territories. Jointly agreed country
policy plans for each territory receiving
British aid have been introduced.
An FCO minister chairs a ministerial
group for the Caribbean territories, drawn
from a number of government departments
and agencies and benefiting from wider
expertise than the FCO or the ODA alone
can offer. It meets two or three times a year.
EUROPEAN UNION POLICY
As a European power, Britain is concerned
first of all with the prosperity and security of
this area of the world.
The main instrument for achieving
European prosperity is the European
Union, an association of 15 democratic
nations—^Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Irish
Republic, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
Britain is confident that new
members will strengthen the
European Union. It welcomed the
accession of Austria, Finland and
Sweden on 1 January 1995, and
supports the opening of membership
to the associated countries of Central
and Eastern Europe. Cyprus and
Malta will also be involved in the next
phase of enlargement.
Britain regards the Union as a means of
strengthening democracy and reinforcing
political stability in Europe, and of increasing
the collective strength of member states in
international negotiations. The Government
wants Britain to be at the heart of a Union in
which member states work effectively
together by pooling their ideas and resources
for shared purposes, where such objectives
cannot be achieved by member states acting
on their own.
Background
The Union had its origins in the post-Second
World War resolve by Western European
nations, particularly France and Germany, to
prevent wars breaking out again between
themselves. The 1957 Rome Treaty, which
established the European Community,
defined its aims as the harmonious
development of economic activities, a
continuous and balanced economic expansion
and an accelerated rise in the standard of
118
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
living. These objectives were to be achieved
by the creation of a common internal market
and progressive harmonisation of economic
policies, involving:
• the elimination of customs duties between
member states;
• free movement of goods, people, services
and capital;
• a common commercial policy towards
other countries;
• the elimination of distortions in
competition within the common market;
• the creation of a Social Fund to
improve job opportunities for workers
and raise their standard of living;
• the adoption of common agricultural and
transport policies; and
• the association of overseas developing
countries with the Community in order
to increase trade and promote economic
and social development.
These objectives were confirmed and
augmented by the Single European Act of
1986 and the 1992 Maastricht Treaty on
European Union.
Maastricht Treaty
The Maastricht Treaty amended the
Rome Treaty and made other new
commitments. It:
• established the European Union and
introduced the concept of European
Union citizenship as a supplement to
national citizenship, provided some
measure of institutional reform and
strengthened control of the Community’s
finances;
• provided an intergovernmental basis for a
common foreign and security policy (see
p. 122) and for greater co-operation on
issues concerned with interior/justice
policy (see p. 130);
• clarified and codified Union competences
in areas such as regional strategy,
consumer protection, education and
vocational training, the environment and
public health;
• provided for moves towards economic
and monetary union; and
• embodied the principle of subsidiarity,
under which action is taken at the
European level only if its objectives
cannot be achieved by member states
acting alone.
Under an agreement reached in 1992 a
subsidiarity test is applied to all European
Commission proposals for action.
The Treaty was ratified by Britain and the
other member states and came into force in
November 1993. An operational review will
be undertaken by an intergovernmental
conference beginning in 1996.
Economic and Monetary Union
During the negotiations on those parts of the
Maastricht Treaty relating to economic and
monetary union (EMU), the Government
sought to ensure that:
• there would be no commitment by
Britain to move to a single monetary
policy or single currency;
• monetary matters would remain a
national responsibility until the Union
moved to a single currency and
monetary policy;
• member states would retain primary
responsibility for their economic policies;
and
• there were clear and quantifiable
convergence conditions which member
states would have to satisfy before
moving to a single currency.
The Maastricht Treaty provides for
progress towards EMU in three stages: the
first—completion of the single market—
ended at the end of 1993. The second stage,
which began on 1 January 1994, includes
the establishment of a European Monetary
Institute with a largely advisory and
consultative role. Although the Institute will
prepare for stage 3, monetary policy will still
be a national responsibility. Member states
will co-ordinate economic policies in the
context of agreed non-binding policy
guidelines. The British Government is
participating in stage 2.
Under the Treaty, a single currency is
119
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
envisaged by 1 January 1999, although
member states will have to satisfy certain
criteria on inflation rates, government deficit
levels, currency fluctuation margins and
interest rates. A special protocol recognises
that Britain is not obliged or committed to
move to this final stage of EMU without a
separate decision to do so by the Government
and Parliament at the appropriate time.
The Community Budget
The Community’s revenue consists of:
• levies on agricultural imports;
• customs duties;
• the proceeds of a notional rate of value
added tax of up to 1.4 per cent on a
standard ‘basket’ of goods and services,
and
• contributions from member states based
on gross national product (GNP).
Britain has an annual rebate worth some
£2,000 million because of the fact that,
without it, the British net contribution would
be far greater than that justified by its share
of Community GNP.
An agreement on future finance was
reached at the European Council summit in
Edinburgh in 1992. Under the agreement, the
overall revenue ceiling was to be maintained
at 1.2 per cent of Community GNP until
1995. It will then rise in steps, reaching 1.27
per cent in 1999. Agricultural spending will
be less than half the budget by the end of the
century, compared with 80 per cent in 1973
and 60 per cent at present. It was also agreed
that more resources would be allocated to the
poorer regions of the Union.
Single Market
The single market, providing for the free
movement of people, goods, services and
capital, is largely complete in legislative
terms. It covers, among other benefits, the
removal of customs barriers, the liberalisation
of capital movements, the opening of public
procurement markets and the mutual
recognition of professional qualifications. The
single market is designed to reduce business
costs, stimulate efficiency, increase consumer
choice and encourage the creation of jobs and
wealth. The British Government is
supporting continuing work on extending the
single market to important areas such as
telecommunications and energy.
Transport
The concept of a common transport policy
was laid down in the Treaty of Rome, and
Britain fully supports the extension of
competition and deregulation in transport.
Liberalisation measures relating to civil
aviation, shipping, and road haulage and
passenger services are described in Chapter 19.
Trans-European Networks
The EU is working towards the completion
of trans-European networks in the fields of
transport, energy and telecommunications.
The aim is to improve the interconnection
and interoperability of national networks. Of
the 14 priority transport projects which have
been endorsed by the European Council,
Britain has an interest in four. One of these
is the planned construction of a new rail
link between London and the Channel
Tunnel (see p. 302). Ten priority energy
projects have been endorsed, but none with a
British interest.
European Economic Area
The European Economic Area (EEA)
Agreement, in force since 1 January 1994, has;
extended most of the single market measures
beyond the EU member states to Iceland,
Norway and Liechtenstein.
Trade
Britain is the world’s fifth largest trading
nation. EEA member states comprise the
world’s largest trading bloc, accounting for
about 40 per cent of all trade. The British
Government fully supports an open world
trading system, on which EU member states
depend for future economic growth and jobs.
Under the Rome Treaty, the European
Commission speaks on behalf of Britain and
the other member states in international
120
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
trade negotiations, such as the recently
concluded GATT Uruguay Round which led
to the creation of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO). The Commission
negotiates on a mandate agreed by the
Council. For further information on trade,
see Chapter 12.
The Environment
European Union member states are at the
forefront of many international measures on
environmental issues, such as air quality
standards and the depletion of the ozone
layer. For further information, see p. 365.
Agriculture and Fisheries
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is
designed to secure food supplies and to
stabilise markets. It has also, however,
created overproduction and unwanted food
surpluses, placing a burden on the
Community’s budget.
The Common Fisheries Policy is
concerned with the rational conservation and
management of fishery resources.
The operation of these policies, and
Britain’s advocacy of CAP reform, are
described in Chapter 18.
Regional and Infrastructure
Development
There are a number of Structural Funds
designed to:
• promote economic development in
underdeveloped regions;
• regenerate regions affected by industrial
decline;
• combat long-term unemployment and
facilitate the entry of young people into
the labour market;
• help workers adapt to industrial changes
and to advances in production systems;
• speed up the adjustment of production,
processing and marketing structures in
agriculture; and
• promote development in rural areas.
Infrastructure projects and productive
investments are financed by the European
Regional Development Fund. The European
Social Fund supports training and
employment measures for the unemployed
and young people. The Guidance Section of
the European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund supports agricultural
restructuring and some rural development
measures. The Financial Instrument of
Fisheries Guidance supports the
modernisation of the fishing industry.
A Cohesion Fund was set up under the
Maastricht Treaty to reduce disparities
between levels of development in the poorer
and richer member states.
Other initiatives aim to assist the
development of new economic activities in
regions affected by the restructuring of
traditional industries, such as steel, coal
and shipbuilding.
The European Investment Bank, a non-
profit-making institution, lends at
competitive interest rates to public and
private capital investment projects. Lending
is directed towards:
• less-favoured regions;
• transport infrastructure;
• protection of the environment;
• improving industrial competitiveness; and
• supporting loans to small and medium¬
sized enterprises.
The Bank also provides loans in support
of the Community’s policy of co-operation
with the countries of the Mediterranean
basin; Central and Eastern Europe; and the
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states
(see p. 174).
Employment and Social Affairs
In Britain’s view, Community social policy
should be primarily concerned with job
creation and with maintaining a well-educated
and trained workforce to ensure competitiveness
in world markets.
The Government supports:
• measures to safeguard health and safety
at work, freedom of movement for
workers, mutual recognition of
professional and vocational qualifications,
and equal opportunities at work; and
121
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
# practical measures to increase jobs and
cut unemployment which do not place
more costs on employers.
At Maastricht the Government opposed
the extension of Community social polic\ and
qualified majority voting into new areas of
social affairs on the grounds that the main
responsibility for such policies should remain
with individual member states. It negotiated
the Social Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty,
which allows other member states to agree
social legislation in these areas which is not
applicable in Britain.
Research and Development
Research collaboration among member states
is promoted primarily through a series of
framework programmes defining priorities
and setting out the overall level of funding.
The British Government actively encourages
British companies and organisations to
participate in collaborative research and
development (R & D) with European partners.
The Fourth Framework Programme,
adopted in April 1994, focuses on generic and
precompetitive research which is of use to a
number of industries. It covers information
and communications technologies, industrial
technologies, the environment, life sciences
and technology, energy, transport and socio¬
economic research. The programme also
provides for international co-operation,
dissemination of research, and training and
mobility of researchers.
Common Foreign and Security Policy
The common foreign and security policy
(CFSP) was established by the Maastricht
Treaty as an enhanced form of
intergovernmental co-operation, distinct from
the Community, covering all areas of
common foreign and security policy.
The Treaty differentiates between security
and defence policy, and confirms that defence
issues are a matter for the Western European
Union (see p. 114). There is, however, a
commitment to ‘the eventual framing of a
common defence policy, which might in time
lead to a common defence’.
The CFSP provides for EU member states
to consult each other on issues of general
interest and work together more effectively.
Member states can agree common positions
and take joint actions, and are obliged to
respect agreed positions. All decisions are
reached bv consensus unless it is decided
otherwise, again by consensus.
Examples of joint action taken under the
CFSP include support for the Middle East
peace process; the monitoring of elections in
Russia and in South Africa; support for the
delivery of humanitarian aid in Bosnia (see
p. 123); and backing for the indefinite
extension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (see p. 128). Joint actions may be
funded either by national contributions or
from the European Community budget.
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND
SECURITY
Britain believes that states should not use, or
threaten, force against other sovereign states
and that they should resolve their disputes by
peaceful means. The United Nations has the
authority to seek to resolve disputes which
threaten international peace and stability.
Britain believes that prevention of conflict
is better than cure. It is, therefore,
particularly active in looking for ways of
enhancing the capacity of the UN and other
international organisations to predict and
prevent conflicts before they arise.
Britain and UN Peacekeeping
Britain fully supports UN efforts to increase
the effectiveness of its peacekeeping and has
pressed for the strengthening of the UN’s
Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Tei
British officers are currently serving in the
Department and are performing operational,
financial and other specialist functions.
In 1994 Britain launched an initiative
calling for a system of support running from
early warning and preventive diplomacy
through to humanitarian and peacekeeping
operations on the ground. It has also taken tl
lead in the UN’s efforts to reform the
funding, administration and logistic support <
peacekeeping operations. Together with the
United States, Canada and other member
122
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
states, Britain has made practical proposals for
improving logistic support to UN missions and
modernising the UN’s procurement policies.
Britain pays its own assessed share of the
costs of UN peacekeeping (nearly 6.6 per cent
of the total), contributing about $250 million
in 1994. By July 1995, Britain was contributing
more troops to UN operations than any other
country. There were nearly 9,000 British
military personnel serving with the UN in
former Yugoslavia, 600 in Angola, nearly 400
in Cyprus, 15 observers on the Iraq/Kuwait
border and ten observers in Georgia.
British Contributions to UN Operations
Bosnia
Britain is committed to supporting efforts to
establish a lasting peace in former Yugoslavia
and is deeply involved in efforts to relieve
suffering caused by the fighting in Bosnia and
to prevent it spreading. Since the outbreak of
inter-ethnic hostilities in mid-1991 the
European Union and the UN have sought to
bring peace to the area.
Britain is a major contributor to the UN
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia.
UNPROFOR seeks to support ceasefires,
monitor military activity, safeguard UN-
declared safe areas, such as Sarajevo, and
escort humanitarian convoys. The British
contribution to UNPROFOR consists of two
infantry battalion groups, supported by
logistic groups and a Royal Fleet Auxiliary
based in Split, Croatia. Some 5,000 British
troops are deployed as part of UNPROFOR’s
Rapid Reaction Force. In addition, a 70-
strong mortar-locating radar troop is based in
Sarajevo, and there are a number of British
UN military observers.
The Royal Air Force contributes aircraft to
the airlift of supplies to Sarajevo and to
operations by NATO over former Yugoslavia.
The Royal Navy is participating in
NATO/WEU operations in the Adriatic.
Africa
In August 1994, Britain deployed a 600-
strong logistic battalion to serve with the UN
assistance mission in Rwanda for a period of
three months. Its main task was to provide
logistic support for the mission, including the
repair of over 800 UN vehicles, the
rebuilding of key access bridges and restoring
utilities. Britain also sent a 600-strong logistic
battalion to support the early stages of the
recently expanded UN mission in Angola.
Cyprus
Britain continues to provide the largest
contingent (nearly 400 strong) to the UN
Force in Cyprus, which was established in
1974 to help prevent the recurrence of
fighting on the island between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots. Since the serious hostilities
of 1974, when Turkish forces occupied the
northern part of the island, the Force has
been responsible for maintaining the ceasefire
and control of a buffer zone between the
two communities. It also carries out
humanitarian missions.
Iraq/ Kuwait
In 1991 a Security Council resolution
established a demilitarised zone extending
10 km into Iraq and 5 km into Kuwait (see
p. 141). Britain, along with the other
permanent members of the Security Council,
contributes 15 observers to the 1,000-strong
UN Iraq/Kuwait observer mission, which
was set up in April 1991 to deter violations of
the boundary and to observe hostile or
potentially hostile actions.
Georgia
Ten British officers are deployed as military
observers in Georgia as part of a 136-strong
UN observer mission there. The mission was
established by the Security Council in August
1993 in order to observe and monitor the
ceasefire established following violent conflict
between the Georgian armed forces and the
Abkhaz separatists.
CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION
With the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact
and the formation of democratically
123
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
elected governments in Eastern and
Central Europe and the former Soviet
Union, the European security situation has
been transformed.
In November 1990 NATO Allies and
former Warsaw Pact states signed a joint
declaration in Paris saying that:
• they were no longer adversaries and
would build new partnerships;
• they would maintain only enough
military forces to prevent war and
provide for effective defence; and
• they would form the North Atlantic
Co-operation Council to foster
co-operation and understanding.
In January 1994 a NATO summit
meeting invited the non-NATO states in
Eastern and Central Europe and the former
Soviet Union to join a Partnership for Peace
in order to:
• develop a practical working relationship;
and
• enlist the Partners’ assistance in
peacekeeping operations and guide their
armed forces towards compatibility with
those of NATO countries.
The Partnership is also monitoring matters
such as the Partners’ respect for international
treaties, civilian control of the military and
openness in defence budgeting.
Economic Help
Britain and other Western countries are
taking action to help deal with the vast
economic problems following the fall of
Communism, and to promote the
development of market economies. The
European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development is channelling Western
investment to the region. The European
Community’s PHARE scheme is assisting
Central and Eastern European countries in
the process of reform and the development of
infrastructure. Independent states of the
former Soviet Union receive help through a
parallel programme (TACIS), which
concentrates on financial services, transport,
energy (including nuclear safety) and
humanitarian needs.
Know How Fund
The Know How Fund is Britain’s programme
of bilateral technical assistance to the countries
of Central and Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union. It aims to support their
transition to pluralist democracy and a market
economy by providing British skills and by
encouraging British investment in the region.
In Central and Eastern Europe the Fund’s
main priorities are financial services,
including banking, insurance, audit and
privatisation; management training; small and ;
medium-sized enterprise development; public
administration; and employment services.
Lesser priorities are agriculture, energy,
industrial restructuring and the environment.
In Russia and elsewhere in the former Soviet
Union the Fund concentrates on energy,
small businesses, financial services,
privatisation and restructuring, agricultural
reform and health management.
The Know How Fund also finances
activities promoting good government and
civil society, such as parliamentary exchanges,
police training, development of legal services,
media development and training.
Recent projects include:
• the establishment of four regional centres
for management training and consultancy
in Poland;
• helping to strengthen employment
services in Russia, Poland, the Czech
Republic and Slovakia; and
• advice on the development of a modern
and efficient financial services industry
throughout the former Soviet Union.
The Fund spent over £60 million in
1993_94 ancl since its inception in 1989 about
£158 million has been allocated to some
2,000 projects.
Europe (Association) Agreements
The European Union has strengthened
relations with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Romania and Slovakia by signing Europe
(Association) Agreements with these
countries. The agreements envisage accession
to the European Union when these countries
124
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
are able to assume the obligations of
membership. A strategy to prepare for this
was adopted at the Essen European Council
in December 1994. Negotiations for a similar
agreement with Slovenia have been concluded.
In 1992 the EC agreed to negotiate
Partnership and Co-operation Agreements
with all the states of the former Soviet Union.
Agreements have been signed with Russia,
Ukraine, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan
and Belarus. Trade and Co-operation
Agreements are in force with Albania and
Slovenia. Negotiations are under way with
Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The purpose of all these agreements is to
reduce trade barriers, develop wide-ranging
co-operation and increase political dialogue at
all levels.
OTHER REGIONS
The Middle East
Middle East Peace Process
Britain warmly welcomed the breakthrough in
the Middle East peace process in September
1993, when Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation (PLO) agreed to
mutual recognition and signed a Declaration
of Principles on interim self-government for
the Palestinians in Israeli-held territories
occupied in 1967. The first stage of the
Declaration was implemented in May 1994,
when the Palestinians adopted self-
government in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho
area. In October 1994 a peace treaty between
Israel and Jordan was formally signed. Britain
continues to encourage peace negotiations
between Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
A further major advance was achieved in
September 1995, when Israel and the PLO
reached an interim agreement providing for a
phased Israeli troop withdrawal from
occupied Palestinian areas of the West Bank
and for elections to a new Palestinian
Council with legislative and executive powers.
The British Government applauded the
agreement, recognising the difficult
compromises made on both sides.
Along with its other European Union
partners, Britain has supported peace moves,
politically and economically, and is
committing £85 million over three years on
aid to the Palestinians and the peace process
through bilateral and multilateral channels.
Many programmes are already under way and
are designed to support Palestinian
administration, police training, the Palestinian
Monetary Authority, legal structures and the
judiciary, water management and health care.
The Gulf Conflict
As a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, Britain strongly condemned Iraq’s
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and
supported all the Council’s resolutions
designed to force Iraqi withdrawal and restore
international legality. Because of Iraq’s failure
to withdraw, its forces were expelled in
February 1991 by an international coalition
led by the United States, Britain, France and
Saudi Arabia, acting under a UN mandate.
UN Security Council Resolution 687,
adopted in April 1991, formalised the ceasefire
in the Gulf War and stipulated conditions for
Iraqi acceptance, including measures to prevent
the development of weapons of mass
destruction, recognition of the border with
Kuwait and the payment of compensation to
those who suffered as a result of the invasion
of Kuwait. The resolution, fully supported by
Britain, imposed sanctions on Iraq which
remain in force until the Security Council is
satisfied that Iraq is fully in compliance with it.
As part of the agreement ending
hostilities, the Security Council authorised
the creation of a Special Commission
(UNSCOM) to supervise the elimination of
Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. Britain
has provided considerable support to
UNSCOM and the International Atomic
Energy Authority in the form of personnel,
equipment and information since the first
inspection in May 1991.
The Security Council approved a separate
resolution (688) in response to continued
oppression by the Iraqi regime of the civilian
population in northern Iraq and the marshes
of southern Iraq. ‘No fly’ zones operate over
both areas to monitor Iraqi actions and to
deter air attacks. Britain takes an active part
in both operations.
125
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Iraqi troop movements threatening Kuwait
in September/October 1994 were countered
by swift military reinforcements by Britain
and its coalition partners.
Sub-Saharan Africa
For many years, Britain has been concerned
with the affairs of sub-Saharan Africa,
where positive developments have included
the abolition of apartheid and the
establishment of a non-racial democracy in
South Africa and free elections in Kenya,
Malawi and Zambia.
The British Government has maintained
close relations with all the main parties
associated with political reform in South
Africa and welcomed the first non-racial
elections in April 1994. Britain helped to
assist peacekeeping during the elections
and allocated resources to the training of
election officials and to the monitoring
of election policing.
The British Government is working with
President Mandela and his Government of
National Unity to prepare black South
Africans to play their full part in the
government and the economy of their
country. In addition to a £100 million aid
package over the three years 1994—96, Britain
is supporting South Africa’s development
through trade and investment, and with the
backing of £1,000 million in official export
credit guarantees. Britain is the largest
overseas investor in South Africa, with a
market value of between £8,000 million and
£10,000 million. There is also a British
investment promotion scheme designed to
encourage more small and medium-sized
businesses to invest in South Africa. In
addition, young business people from Soweto
are gaining management experience with
British companies.
In spring 1995 the Queen paid a state
visit to South Africa, thereby setting the
seal on the revival of friendship between
both countries.
Asia-Pacific Region
The dynamic growth of the East Asian
economies has made the Asia-Pacific
region more important in world affairs.
There is also an encouraging trend towards
political liberalisation.
Britain has a long association with the
region and is giving it an even higher priority
in its foreign policy. Close relations are
maintained with Japan, China, India and
Pakistan, the ASEAN countries (Brunei,
Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Singapore), Australia and New Zealand.
Britain has defence links with some countries
in the region. It is also contributing to the
economic development of Vietnam.
The Indo-British Partnership initiative,
established in 1993, has done much to
encourage commercial and investment links
between Britain and India.
Britain has stepped up political dialogue
with countries in the region, developing
British commercial activity through more
trade and investment, and co-operating even
more closely on international problem
solving. It is also taking advantage of growing
opportunities for English language teaching,
co-operation in science and technology, and
educational exchanges.
North and South America
Britain has long-established political, trade
and cultural links with the United States. As
founding members of NATO, both countries i
are deeply involved in Western defence
arrangements (see p. 114) and, as permanent
members of the UN Security Council, work
closely together on major international issues.
Strong links are also maintained with Canada,^
with whom Britain shares membership of the
Commonwealth, NATO and other key
international organisations. All three
countries are members of the Group of
Seven, which meets each year at the annual
Economic Summit.
Important British connections with South
America date from the participation of Britisl
volunteers in the wars of independence in th(
early 19th century. Britain has welcomed the
fact that democratically elected governments
are now the norm in the region; this, togethe
with the trend towards more free market
economies, presents many opportunities for
Britain to strengthen its relations with Latin
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
\merican governments. The British
government is organising a three-year Latin
\merican trade campaign-—Link into Latin
\merica—to promote trade and investment.
There has been considerable British investment
n Latin America as a result of the free market
economic policies and economic growth of the
ast few years. There is a British diplomatic
Dost in every Latin American country.
\RMS CONTROL
Britain and the other members of NATO are
pledged to pursue further progress in arms
:ontrol and confidence-building measures.
Under recent agreements, nuclear forces in
[he former Soviet Union have been reduced
md Russian forces have been withdrawn from
Eastern Europe.
Vuclear Weapons
In 1991 the United States and the former
Soviet Union signed the first Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START), under which an
equal limit of 6,000 nuclear warheads on both
sides was agreed, with an equal sub-limit of
4,900 ballistic missile warheads. The Treaty
required the parties to reduce their strategic
missiles and warheads by about 35 per cent
over 15 years, including a cut of up to 50 per
cent in the most destabilising systems.
In 1993 the United States and Russia signed
a new treaty agreeing to reduce their strategic
nuclear weapons by two-thirds within ten years.
Britain’s position is that it would
respond to the challenge of multilateral talks
on the global reduction of nuclear arms in a
world in which those of the US and
Russian forces were counted in hundreds
rather than thousands.
Britain is committed to early progress in
the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear
test ban treaty. It supports a treaty of
indefinite duration, with effective verification
and the widest possible adherence, in order to
prevent the development of a sophisticated
nuclear weapon by a would-be proliferator.
Britain has announced that it will no longer
take part in any nuclear tests.
Britain is also committed to the early
negotiation of a universally applicable
convention banning the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons and other
explosive purposes.
Conventional Weapons
The 1990 Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe Treaty commits the NATO Allies
and members of the former Warsaw Pact to
reductions in five major classes of offensive
conventional weapons.
The ceilings for both groups of states in
the area between the Atlantic and the Ural
Mountains are 20,000 tanks, 30,000 armoured
combat vehicles, 20,000 artillery pieces, 2,000
attack helicopters and 6,800 combat aircraft.
No individual state may hold more than two-
thirds of the equipment the Treaty allows its
group. Weapons above the agreed ceilings
must be destroyed or rendered permanently
unfit for further military use. Intrusive
arrangements to verify compliance are
included in the Treaty. Weapons have been
reduced by over 30,000 in accordance with
the Treaty’s provisions.
Chemical Weapons
Britain took a leading part in the lengthy
negotiations on a chemical weapons ban,
having abandoned its own chemical weapons
in the late 1950s. These negotiations were
completed in 1992, and 159 countries,
including Britain, have signed a convention
which enters into force six months after
65 states have ratified it. By August 1995,
32 had done so.
The Chemical Weapons Convention will
prohibit the production, stockpiling and use
of chemical weapons. There is a system of
declarations and inspections to verify
compliance, and provisions for the control
and monitoring of the transfer of chemicals
which have been identified as potentially
usable in making weapons. Britain is active in
a preparatory commission which is working
out ways of implementing the Convention.
Biological Weapons
The 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons
Convention prohibits the development,
127
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
production and stockpiling of these weapons
but currently lacks methods of verification. A
1991 review conference introduced
confidence-building measures providing for
exchange of information between the parties
to the Convention and set up an expert group
to identify and examine potential verification
measures. This was followed by a special
conference in September 1994 which agreed
to establish an ad hoc group to take forward
work on arrangements for verification. The
first meetings of the group took place in
Geneva in January and July 1995. Britain is
playing a leading role in the important
discussions on compliance measures.
Non-Proliferation
Britain aims to:
• prevent the proliferation of nuclear
weapons;
• ban the manufacture and possession of
chemical and biological weapons;
• control the transfer of ballistic missiles
and their components and technology; and
• prevent accumulations of conventional
armaments which create regional instability.
Britain has signed a number of agreements
designed to control the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. These include
the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty on nuclear
weapons, the 1972 Biological and Toxin
Weapons Convention and the 1993 Chemical
Weapons Convention (see p. 127). A review
conference was held in New York in April/
May 1995 and agreed unanimously to extend
the Non-Proliferation Treaty indefinitely.
UN Register of Arms Transfers
Following a British initiative a universal and
non-discriminatory register of conventional
arms transfers was set up by the UN. The
register, covering seven categories of
equipment, is designed to introduce greater
openness and make it easier for the
international community to monitor an
excessive arms build-up in any one country.
A total of 91 countries submitted data to the
register for 1992—its first year of operation—
and 88 for 1993.
Confidence-building Measures
Important confidence-building measures
regarding military exercises and other
activities in Europe are in force.
The Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which was
until December 1994 the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE), provides a forum for dialogue on
such matters as arms control. Participants
include the republics of the former Soviet
Union, the other European states and the
United States and Canada.
Under the 1992 Vienna Document, CSCE
participating states agreed on a number of
further confidence-building measures, including:
• annual exchanges of information on
military forces, equipment and budgets;
• prior notification of certain military
activities; and
• challenge inspections and evaluation visits
to military bases.
At a summit in December 1994 new
security measures were agreed, including
military contacts and co-operation, arms
transfers, global exchange of information, and
non-proliferation.
Open Skies Treaty
Britain played an important role in negotiations
leading to the signing in March 1992 of the
Open Skies Treaty, which will allow flights
over the entire territories of its participants by
aircraft to monitor military capabilities and
activity. The Treaty has been signed by all
NATO members, Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Kyrgyzstan,
Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine.
When ratified by 20 signatories, the
Treaty, which is of unlimited duration, will
be phased in over three years; when fully in
force, it will promote military openness and
enhance security. By March 1995 the Treaty
had been ratified by 18 countries.
HUMAN RIGHTS
The protection of human rights is an
important part of British foreign policy.
128
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Universal respect for human rights is an
obligation under the UN Charter, reinforced
by human rights law in the form of UN and
regional human rights treaties. The British
Government played a key role at the 1993
Vienna UN World Conference on Human
Rights, which reaffirmed that human rights
are a legitimate concern of the international
community. The expressions of concern
i about human rights do not, therefore,
| constitute interference in the internal affairs
: of another state.
The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was adopted by the UN General
Assembly in 1948. Since this is not a legally
binding document, the General Assembly
adopted two international covenants in 1966,
placing legal obligations on those states
ratifying or acceding to them. The covenants
came into force in 1976, Britain ratifying both
in the same year. One covenant deals with
economic, social and cultural rights and the
other with civil and political rights. States
which are parties to the covenants undertake
to submit periodic reports detailing
compliance with their terms. Each covenant
has a UN treaty monitoring committee which
examines these reports. Britain recognises the
competence of these committees to receive
and consider state-to-state complaints.
Other international conventions to which
Britain is a party include those on:
• the elimination of racial discrimination;
• the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women;
• the rights of the child;
• torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment;
• prevention of genocide;
• the abolition of slavery; and
• the status of refugees.
The Council of Europe
Britain is bound by the Council of
Europe’s Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,
which covers:
• the right to life, liberty and a fair trial;
• the right to marry and have a family;
• freedom of thought, conscience and
religion;
• freedom of expression, including freedom
of the press;
• freedom of peaceful assembly and
association;
• the right to have a sentence reviewed by
a higher tribunal; and
• the prohibition of torture and inhuman
or degrading treatment.
Complaints about violations of the
Convention are made to the European
Commission of Human Rights in
Strasbourg. Although one state may lodge a
complaint against another, most
complaints are brought against states by
individuals or groups. The Commission
decides whether cases are admissible and, if
so, examines the matter with the parties with
a view to achieving a friendly settlement. If
this fails, the Commission or the state
concerned can refer the case to the
European Court of Human Rights, which
rules on whether the Convention has been
breached. Britain accepts the Court’s
compulsory jurisdiction and the right of
individual petition. Britain has signed and
ratified the 11th Protocol to the Convention,
which concerns the replacement of the
existing Commission and Court with a
full-time Court.
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The OSCE’s human rights body, the Office
for Democratic Institutions and Human
Rights (ODIHR) in Warsaw, is responsible
for furthering human rights, democracy and
the rule of law. It provides a forum for
meetings and expert seminars to discuss the
implementation of commitments in the area
of human rights. The ODIHR shares and
exchanges information on the building of
democratic institutions and the holding of
elections in participating states. It also
co-ordinates the monitoring of elections and
provides expertise and training on
constitutional and legal matters.
129
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Westminster Foundation for Democracy
The Westminster Foundation for Democracy
helps to strengthen pluralistic democratic
institutions in other countries.
The three main political parties (see p. 52)
are represented on the Board of Governors,
who are appointed by the Foreign and
Commonwealth Secretary. There is also a
representative of the smaller political parties,
plus non-party figures drawn from business,
trade unions, the academic world and other
non-governmental organisations. The
Foreign & Commonwealth Office has a
non-voting advisory member. The Foundation
is independent and the British Government
cannot veto projects the Board chooses to
support. Advice is given by the Foundation
on the development of:
• election systems, administration and
monitoring;
• parliaments or other representative
institutions;
• political parties;
• free media;
• trade unions; and
• human rights groups.
The Foundation is concentrating its
efforts initially on Central and Eastern
Europe, the former Soviet Union and on
anglophone Africa. It does, however, consider
sympathetically applications for projects
elsewhere in the world.
INTERNATIONAL CRIME
The British Government attaches importance
to action against international terrorism and
to international co-operation against drug
traffickers and organised crime. Britain and
the other members of the European Union
have agreed not to export arms or other
military equipment to countries clearly
implicated in supporting terrorist activity,
and to take steps to prevent such material
being diverted for terrorist purposes.
It is EU policy that:
• no concessions should be made to
terrorists or their sponsors;
and
• there should be solidarity among member (
states in the prevention of terrorism.
Britain participates actively in international s
forums on co-operation against the illegal
drugs trade, maintains a substantial
programme of overseas assistance in this field i
and stations drug liaison officers in a number
of countries in order to liaise with the host
authorities in the fight against drug
trafficking. In recent years Britain has
contributed over £20 million to the UN
International Drug Control Programme,
which has the leading international role
against the illegal drugs trade.
EU member states are setting up a central
European Police Office (EUROPOL) to
provide Union-wide intelligence about serious
crime. As a step in this process, a
EUROPOL Drugs Unit has already been
established. EU member states also belong to
the International Criminal Police
Organisation (INTERPOL). British liaison
with INTERPOL is provided by the National
Criminal Intelligence Service (see p. 84).
Under the Maastricht Treaty, work in
the areas of justice and home affairs
is being intensified through increased
intergovernmental co-operation. The
first convention agreed under these
arrangements, simplifying extradition
between member states, was signed
in March 1995.
In September 1994 a programme of police i
and judicial co-operation was agreed between .
the European Union and the Central and
Eastern European states to combat
cross-border crime in Europe.
DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION
The aim of Britain’s overseas aid effort is to
improve the quality of life and reduce
poverty, suffering and deprivation in
developing countries.
British aid, which is delivered through the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office s Overseas
Development Administration (ODA), was
£2,172 million in 1993-94. Included in this
was £1,930 million for developing countries,
£181 million for countries in transition in
130
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Central and Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union (see p. 124), and £53 million
spent on administration. About 55 per cent
was given directly to individual countries and
the remainder channelled through
international bodies, such as the European
Union, the United Nations and the World
Bank. In addition, over £240 million was
invested in developing countries by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation
(see below). Some of the aid budget goes to
programmes administered by the British
Council (see p. 134) and by over 120 non¬
governmental organisations.
The British aid programme seeks to:
• promote economic growth and reform;
• promote good government;
• finance activities directly benefiting poor
people;
• promote better education and health;
• improve the status of women in
developing countries; and
• help developing countries to tackle their
environmental problems.
Economic Reform
Britain provides bilateral technical
assistance, including advice on privatisation
and the improvement of essential public
services. Much of Britain’s aid to help
economic reform goes to the World Bank’s
special programme of assistance for 31
African countries. Zambia, Uganda,
Tanzania and Ghana have been among the
principal recipients. Aid includes balance-of-
payments help to enable countries to import
essential goods and meet their other
external payments. It also includes the
provision of personnel, training and
consultancies associated with reforms in areas
such as revenue collection, the civil service,
public expenditure management and the
financial sector.
The Private Sector
The Commonwealth Development
Corporation is the Government’s main
instrument within the aid programme for
encouraging private-sector investment in
developing countries. It provides loans,
equity funds and management services for
financially viable investments in agriculture,
fisheries, minerals, industry, transport,
communications and housing. By the end of
1994 it had investments and commitments
worth over £1,700 million in 52 countries, 39
of which are members of the Commonwealth.
In addition, the ODA supports enterprise
development through schemes such as:
• initiatives to simplify regulations
constraining small firms in Zimbabwe;
• projects supporting various financial and
technical services—for example, in
Bangladesh and Kenya; and
• new projects to support African business
in South Africa.
The ODA has programmes for
encouraging all types of enterprise to
perform better—for example, in developing
exports. In India it is targeting small to
medium-sized companies which are starting
to export. Spending on projects offering
direct support to the private sector was
£123 million in 1993-94.
Good Government
Britain believes that progress in economic
growth and the reduction of poverty can best
be pursued by more open and effective forms
of government and the observance of human
rights and the rule of law. Britain has
supported good government projects, such as
assistance for public sector and civil service
reform, improving tax and audit
administration, reforming legal systems and
helping to organise and monitor elections.
Reducing Poverty
About two-thirds of British bilateral aid goes to
the poorest countries. In India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh projects include rural development,
urban slum upgrading and the provision of
health, family planning and education services
for poor people. Some of the ODA’s projects
helping the poor are carried out in conjunction
with non-governmental organisations. In
Africa, for example, such schemes include a
131
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
clear water sanitation project run by WaterAid,
which is helping over 30,000 people in
Ethiopia, and a maternal health scheme in
Sudan with CARE to improve the health of
100,000 child-bearing women.
Since 1988 Britain has initiated a number
of debt-relief schemes, including debt
reduction of two-thirds of eligible debt for 20
of the poorest, most indebted countries
undertaking economic reform.
Education
ODA-funded education projects cover a
range of areas, such as health, political and
social life, and the environment. Help is
given to education ministries to assist
educational planning and to increase the
access of disadvantaged groups to teaching
facilities. Expenditure on education projects
was £117 million in 1993-94.
In 1993-94 over 10,000 students from
developing countries, mainly
postgraduates, received ODA support
to study in Britain and other
countries. The ODA also provided
more than 2,500 scholarship and
fellowship awards; in addition, over
1,250 Foreign & Commonwealth Office
awards were made, administered by
the British Council. Part of Britain’s
£60 million aid package to South
Africa is a £2 million project that
will provide bursaries and loans to
1,200 university and technical students
from disadvantaged communities
studying science, engineering,
commerce and medicine.
The £30 million primary education project
in Andhra Pradesh, India, is the largest in the
ODA education programme. It has resulted
in the training of 165,000 teachers and the
construction of 3,000 new classrooms and
over 1,000 teacher resource centres. Through
another important scheme, which started in
1980, over 5 million primary school children
in South Africa have learned to read and
write in their own language and in English.
Practical education and training is being
provided to villagers in Senegal through a
scheme run by the British Council and
OXFAM and funded by the ODA. The
villagers are being shown how to cultivate
newly reclaimed dry land.
Health
The ODA invests over £100 million a year
on health care and on improving water
supplies and sanitation. The main aim is to
help bring cheap health care services to the
poorest and more vulnerable sections of the
community. Assistance is focused on about 20
countries, mostly in Africa and South Asia.
Attention is given in particular to:
• helping to establish management systems
to ensure the provision of essential health
care as efficiently as possible;
• increasing the availability of reproductive
health services; and
• improving control of infectious diseases,
including tuberculosis, malaria and
HIV/AIDS.
Status of Women
Thirteen per cent of Britain’s bilateral aid
programme in 1993—94 was committed to
projects targeted at women in developing
countries. The ODA supports activities
which help women to gain greater access to
education and health services; earn an
income; play a greater role in managing
public services; gain access to legal training,
and learn and develop business skills.
The Environment
Britain helps countries to address their
national environmental problems and to take
action on global environmental concerns
shared by all countries.
Britain has committed about £130 million
to the Global Environmental Facility (GEF),
which helps developing countries and the
countries of Eastern and Central Europe and
the former Soviet Union to finance the costs
of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases,
conserving biological diversity, reducing
ozone depletion and tackling international
water pollution.
132
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Climate Change
Britain signed the Convention on Climate
Change at the 1992 Earth Summit and ratified
it in December 1993. The aim of the
Convention is to stabilise atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level
which will prevent dangerous climate change. It
commits all parties to prepare national
programmes identifying sources of such gases
and steps to limit emissions. Britain believes
that the best way of assisting developing
countries to reduce greenhouse gas emission is
through energy efficiency programmes. Between
1991 and 1994 Britain spent over £140 million
on projects that promote energy efficiency.
Ozone Depletion
Britain had, by the end of 1994, committed
£27 million to the Montreal Protocol’s
Multilateral Fund, set up to meet the extra
costs to developing countries of phasing out
ozone-depleting substances.
Biodiversity
The Rio Biodiversity Convention, which
Britain signed in June 1992 and ratified a
year later, requires countries to take action to
halt the loss of animal and plant species and
genetic resources, and to produce plans for
conserving them.
Britain is helping countries to fulfil their
obligations under the Biodiversity Convention
through its contributions to the GEF, the
British bilateral aid programme and the
Darwin Initiative for the Survival of Species,
launched at the Earth Summit in 1992.
Saving Forestry
The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation
has estimated that during the 1980s an area of
tropical forest nearly the size of England and
Wales was destroyed each year. Forests are
important for the world’s climate since trees
absorb C02, a gas which contributes to global
warming. Forests are also a major habitat for
biological diversity.
The ODA has about 200 forestry projects
under way or under preparation, costing
£157 million. They are designed to help
developing countries use their forests
sustainably and to reduce the rate of
deforestation.
Britain is providing over £23 million to
support a project in the Western Ghats in
India which aims to enable local people to
provide for their needs from the forests
while ensuring that the forests are
managed sustainably.
Renewable Natural Resources Research
Nearly £160 million was spent between 1991
and 1994 on research programmes in Britain
and overseas for the benefit of developing
countries. Programmes have covered
agriculture, fisheries and aquatic resources,
forestry, livestock, natural resources systems,
pest management and post-harvest
technology. The ODA introduced a revised
renewable natural resources research strategy
in April 1995.
Britain is also a founder member of, and
substantial contributor to, the institutions of
the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research, which carry out
research into the conservation of food and
fodder crops.
The Natural Resources Institute, the
ODA’s scientific executive agency, helps
developing countries to improve the
productivity and sustainable management of
their natural resources through the
application of science and technology.
Programmes include:
• pest control which relies less on chemical
pesticides and minimises the disturbance
of wildlife habitats; and
• the use of artificial structures to
rehabilitate the graded reefs in the south
Pacific and so increase their ability to
support the fish population.
Emergency Relief
The ODA’s Disaster Unit co-ordinates the
British Government’s response to natural
and man-made disasters overseas and to
emergencies involving refugees. The ODA is
able to send trained assessors to the disaster
133
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
area quickly to assist the United Nations in
providing vital information on what needs
to be done.
Following a British-German initiative, the
UN Department for Humanitarian Affairs
was established in 1992. The Department is
responsible for co-ordinating prompt UN and
international reaction to emergencies.
The ODA also funds disaster mitigation
projects, such as a ‘risk-mapping’ programme
run by the Save the Children Fund in
Malawi, which aims to identify areas most
prone to drought.
In 1993-94 Britain spent nearly £180
million on 135 emergencies. In addition, the
British public sends substantial sums for
emergency relief overseas through non¬
governmental organisations.
CULTURAL RELATIONS
The British Council is Britain’s principal
agency for cultural relations overseas,
working in 228 towns and cities in 109
countries. The Council:
• helps people to study, train or make
professional contacts in Britain;
• enables British specialists to teach, advise
or establish joint projects abroad;
• teaches English and promotes its use;
• provides library and information services;
and
• makes British arts and literature more
widely known.
The Council runs 185 libraries, resource
centres and information centres, and 83
English language teaching centres, including
34 in Central and Eastern Europe. In
1993_94 about 8.2 million loans of books
and other materials were made to 440,000
library members. About 100,000 people in
40 countries take part in the Council’s
English courses.
The Council is financed partly by a grant
from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office.
The training and education programmes
organised by the Council as part of the
British aid programme are another important
source of income. Well over a quarter of the
Council’s income comes from other earnings.
Educational Exchanges
The British Council recruits teachers for
work overseas, organises short overseas visits
by British experts, encourages cultural
exchange visits and organises academic
interchange between British universities and
colleges and those in other countries. The
Council arranges over 50,000 visits to and
from Britain a year.
The ODA helps fund certain Council
programmes, such as:
• recruitment of staff for overseas
universities;
• secondment of staff from British higher
education establishments; and
• organisation of short-term teaching and
advisory visits.
The Central Bureau for Educational Visits
and Exchanges, which is part of the British
Council, promotes partnerships and
exchanges between schools, teachers, students
and pupils throughout Europe. Opportunities
for young people include school and class
links and English language summer camps.
For the post-16 age group, there are work
placements and English language assistants’
posts as well as other exchange programmes.
The Arts
The British Council initiates or supports
more than 1,400 arts and literature events a
year. These activities include tours by British
theatre companies, orchestras, choirs, opera
and dance companies, and jazz, rock and folk
groups, as well as visits by individual actors,
musicians and artists. The Council also
arranges for directors, designers,
choreographers and conductors to work in
other countries. In addition, it organises and
supports literature, fine arts and other
cultural exhibitions and British participation
in book fairs and international film festivals.

Britain’s defence policy supports its wider security policy, which is to
maintain the country’s freedom and territorial integrity and that of its
dependent territories as well as its ability to pursue its legitimate interests at
home and abroad. As a member of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation), Britain makes a major contribution to maintaining stabi ity
throughout Europe.
INTRODUCTION
With the removal of the strategic threat to
Britain as a result of the end of the Cold
War, progress is being made in security¬
building and co-operation with states in
central and eastern Europe. However, the end
of East-West confrontation has been followed
by problems of instability, nationalism and
extremism within Europe and beyond. These
developments are the major factors shaping
defence policy today. Britain and its allies in
NATO have responded to these changes by
adapting their policies and the structure of
their armed forces to meet the defence
requirements of the future.
NATO remains the foundation of Britain’s
defence and security policies. In addition,
Britain works to increase security through its
membership of the Western European Union
(WEU), the European Union (EU), the
Organisation for (formerly Conference on)
Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE—see p. 129) and the United Nations
(UN—see p. 112). These organisations have
been involved in activities such as negotiating
an end to conflicts, peacekeeping
deployments and humanitarian missions.
Britain and the other WEU member states
are developing the WEU as the defence
component of the European Union and as a
means of strengthening the European pillar of
the Atlantic Alliance. In co-operation with
NATO, Britain and the WEU are supporting
the implementation of conflict prevention and
crisis management measures. At a NATO
summit in January 1994 it was decided that
NATO assets could be made available for
European/WEU operations.
The current fundamental restructuring of
Britain’s armed forces recognises the need for
flexibility in the face of future uncertainty.
The armed forces are, therefore, equipped to
take part in integrated operations, ranging
from small-scale peacekeeping or
humanitarian missions to large-scale
136

i high-intensity conflict. A new permanent
headquarters for joint operations is to be set
I up at North wood, London, by April 1996.
This will include the core of a deployable
headquarters that could be established in a
theatre of operations. Britain’s nuclear forces
(see pp. 141-2) provide the ultimate
guarantee for its security.
By April 1996, the strength of the
armed forces will be around 117,000
in the Army, about 66,500 in the
Royal Air Force (RAF) and about
48,000 in the Royal Navy. Under plans
outlined in the Defence Costs Study,
there will be a net reduction of just
under 19,000 defence jobs by the year
2000—2,200 in the Army, 7,500 in the
Rz^F, 1,900 in the Royal Navy and
7,100 British-based civil servants.
The highest priority continues to be
placed on maximising the cost-effectiveness
and military capabilities of the armed forces.
Launched in December 1993, the Defence
Costs Study—Front Line First (see p. 144)—
examined all areas of administration and
support to the front line to ensure that the
money spent contributes directly or indirectly
I to fighting capability.
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ORGANISATION
NATO has provided Britain’s main means
of defence against a major external threat for
the past 45 years. It is the only security
organisation with the military means to
back up its security guarantees and has
consequently undertaken action on behalf of
the UN. NATO unites the interests of
Europe and North America in the pursuit
of peace, stability and well-being in the
whole of Europe. All Britain’s nuclear forces
and most of its conventional forces are
committed to NATO.
NATO is continuing the process of
adaptation that began with the 1991 Rome
Declaration and the resulting new Strategic
Concept to allow it to play a wider role in
maintaining stability throughout Europe.
January 1994 NATO Summit
The January 1994 NATO Summit marked
an important step in the Alliance’s post-
Cold War evolution. It launched a major
initiative called Partnership for Peace, which
seeks to deepen political and military ties
between NATO and the central and eastern
European countries in areas such as
peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.
By July 1995, 26 states had signed the
Partnership for Peace, including Russia,
almost all the central and eastern European
states, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Malta and
most of the central Asian and Trans-
Caucasian states of the former Soviet Union.
In addition to its work within NATO on
Partnership for Peace, Britain has signed
formal Memoranda of Understanding on
bilateral defence contacts with Albania,
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Sweden and the Ukraine. The Memoranda
are designed to promote stability in central
and eastern Europe, exchange military
information and encourage co-operation on
defence equipment. Britain provides advice
on civil-military relations, including
democratic control and accountability, English
language training, defence budgeting and
management. These contacts are
complementary to those within NATO.
The 1994 NATO Summit also:
• committed the Alliance to continued
adaptation of its political and military
structures in order to reflect all its roles
and the development of the emerging
European security and defence identity;
• endorsed the concept of joint task
forces which will allow a flexible and
effective response to a broad range of
missions and for the inclusion of
non-NATO forces and operations under
WEU auspices;
• reaffirmed that the Alliance remains
open to the membership of other
European countries; and
• declared NATO’s intentions to intensify
its efforts against the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.
137
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
NATO Force Structures
The size, availability and deployment of
NATO forces continue to reflect the
Alliance’s defensive nature. Current
NATO strategy involves:
• deployment in Europe of smaller and
highly mobile forces;
• a move away from the concept of
forward presence;
• a reduced reliance on nuclear
weapons;
• the scaling back of the state of
readiness of allied armed forces; and
• a reduction in training requirements
and exercises.
NATO’s Strategic Concept recognises
that the far-reaching changes in the
strategic setting, together with the growth
of new risks to international order and
stability, require an active response from
the Alliance. While the primary role of
Alliance military forces remains to
guarantee the security and territorial
integrity of its members, force levels are
being reduced and restructured while
missions are being broadened. Force
structures comprising reaction, main
defence and augmentation forces have been
established and are intended to be
mutually supporting.
NATO Command Structures
The NATO command structure has been
adapted to the changing environment.
At the highest level, the number of
Commands has been cut back from three
to two—Allied Command Europe and
Allied Command Atlantic.
There have been considerable
modifications in Allied Command Europe.
Of importance to Britain is the formation
of Allied Forces North West Europe,
which incorporates the land mass of
Britain and Norway, the United Kingdom
air defence region and the North Sea; it is
commanded from headquarters at RAF
High Wycombe, in Buckinghamshire.
UNITED KINGDOM DEFENCE
POLICY
Defence Roles and Military Tasks
British defence policy is defined in terms of
overlapping Defence Roles One, Two and
Three, which are:
• to ensure the protection and security of
Britain and its dependent territories,
even when there is no major external
threat;
• to insure against any major external
threat to Britain and its allies; and
• to contribute to promoting Britain’s
wider security interests through the
maintenance of international peace and
stability.
Within these three defence roles are a
range of tasks which define the military
activities to be undertaken by the
Ministry of Defence and the armed forces
in order to give effect to defence and
security policy.
Britain and Its Dependencies
The armed forces continue to have day-to-
day responsibility for safeguarding Britain’s
territory, airspace and territorial waters.
They also provide for the security and
reinforcement, as necessary, of the
dependent territories and, when required,
support for the civil authorities in Britain
and the dependent territories.
Maritime Defence
The Royal Navy ensures the integrity of
British territorial waters and the protection
of British rights and interests in the
surrounding seas. The maintenance of a
24-hour-a-day, year-round presence in
British waters provides considerable
reassurance to merchant ships and other
mariners. The Royal Air Force (RAF) also
contributes to maritime requirements,
including the Nimrod MR2 force, which
provides surveillance of surface vessels
and submarines.

the announcement of a ceasefire by the IRA and the loyalist paramilitary
organisations. The process was further enhanced by the publication in February
of Frameworks for the Future, which outlines the British and Irish 8°vernme
view on where agreement might be found on a political settlement for Northern Ireland.

DEFENCE
Land Defence
There are 24 regular infantry battalions
committed for activities in Defence Role
One. These are augmented by the
Territorial Army (see p. 143). Tasks include
contributing to national and NATO nuclear
forces and maintaining the security of the
dependent territories.
Air Defence
Air defence of Britain and the surrounding
seas is maintained by a system of layered
defences. Continuous radar cover is provided
by the Improved United Kingdom Air
Defence Ground Environment (IUKADGE),
supplemented by the NATO Airborne Early
Warning Force, to which the RAF contributes
six E—3D aircraft. The RAF also provides six
squadrons of all-weather Tornado F3 air
defence aircraft, supported by tanker aircraft
and, in wartime, an additional F3 squadron
and armed Hawk trainer aircraft. Royal Navy
air defence destroyers are also linked to the
IUKADGE, providing radar and electronic
warfare coverage and surface-to-air missiles.
Ground-launched Rapier missiles defend the
main RAF bases. Naval aircraft also
contribute to British air defence.
Overseas Garrisons
Britain maintains garrisons in Hong Kong,
Gibraltar, the Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus
and the Falkland Islands. The Hong Kong
garrison is being reduced in stages until 1997,
when the territory will revert to Chinese
sovereignty (see p. 117). Gibraltar provides
headquarters and communications facilities
for NATO in the western Mediterranean,
and Cyprus acts as a base for operations in
the Middle East and North Africa.
British forces are stationed in the Falkland
Islands to deter possible aggression from
Argentina, which maintains its claim to the
Islands (see p. 117).
Northern Ireland
The armed forces continue to provide
support to the Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC) in maintaining law and order. There
are currently 18 Army infantry units,
including six Home Service battalions of the
Royal Irish Regiment. The Royal Navy
patrols territorial waters around Northern
Ireland and its inland waterways in order to
deter and intercept the movement of terrorist
weapons, although on a much reduced scale
following the ceasefire. The Royal Marines
provide troops to meet Navy and Army
commitments, while RAF helicopters provide
support to ground forces.
The absence of large-scale terrorist
attacks since the ceasefire announcements by
the Provisional IRA (Irish Republican Army)
in August 1994 and by loyalist terrorist
organisations in the following October (see
p. 14) has enabled the RUC to operate with a
decreasing level of military support and to
make progress towards normal civilian
policing. The ceasefire has allowed greater
flexibility in the deployment of the armed
forces. A number of resident battalions on
two-year tours have been released from all
routine commitments in support of the
RUC, while the armed forces continue to
accompany RUC patrols in areas where they
may encounter hostility. In addition, two
major units have been relocated to their
bases in mainland Britain and Germany;
they can return to the province at short
notice if so required.
Other Tasks
Other Defence Role One tasks include the
provision of:
• military support to the machinery of
government in war;
• military assistance to government
departments, including assistance to
maintain the essentials of life in the
community and carrying out work of
national importance;
• military aid to the civil community,
including during emergencies;
• military search and rescue;
• military intelligence and surveillance;
• physical protection and security; and
• state ceremonial and routine public duties.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain and Its Allies
This second major defence role is discharged
through Britain’s membership of NATO.
Maritime Forces
Most Royal Navy ships are committed to
NATO. Permanent contributions are made
to NATO’s standing naval forces in the
Atlantic, the English Channel and the
Mediterranean. The main components of the
Fleet consist of:
• three aircraft carriers operating Sea
Harrier aircraft and Sea King anti¬
submarine warfare helicopters;
• 35 destroyers and frigates;
• 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines; and
• amphibious forces, including two assault
ships and a helicopter carrier which is
currently under construction.
Land Forces
The multinational Allied Command Europe
Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) is the key land
component of NATO’s rapid reaction forces.
Britain is the lead nation of the Corps, which
became fully operational in 1995.
Britain provides the Corps headquarters
and an armoured division based in Germany
in peacetime. In addition, it provides a
second, more lightly armoured division, based
in Britain and comprising two mechanised
brigades and an airborne brigade. An
airmobile brigade, also based in Britain, will
join one of the two multinational divisions in
the Corps. Some 55,000 regular British
soldiers are assigned to ARRC, together with
a substantial number of Territorial Army
(see p. 143) and individual reservists.
Air Forces
The RAF makes a major contribution to
NATO’s Immediate and Rapid Reaction
Forces. In all around 100 fixed wing aircraft
and 40 helicopters are allocated to support
these Reaction Forces. Tornado F3 and
Rapier surface-to-air missiles form part of the
Supreme xMlied Commander Europe s
Immediate Reaction Force, while Harrier,
Tornado GR1 and GRla provide offensive
support and tactical reconnaissance to the
Rapid Reaction Force. Chinook and Puma
helicopters provide troop airlift facilities for
the ARRC (see above) or other deployed land
forces. Tornado F3 and Tornado GRlb
aircraft provide air defence or anti-surface
attack in support of NATO’s maritime
reaction forces.
Modified RAF Tornado GR1 aircraft
(designated GRlb), equipped with the Sea
Eagle missile, have the task of maritime
attack. The Tornado GRlb force entered
service in 1995. The RAF will continue to
provide Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft and
search and rescue helicopters.
Since 1991, the number of RAF squadrons
in Germany has been reduced to four
Tornado GR1 strike/attack squadrons, two
Harrier offensive support squadrons and a
Puma/Chinook support helicopter squadron
at RAF Bruggen and RAF Laarbruch. It is
intended that RAF Laarbruch will close in
1999, subject to consultation with the
German authorities; the two Harrier
squadrons and the support helicopters
currently based there will be withdrawn to
existing air bases in Britain. The four
squadrons of Tornados, however, will remain
at RAF Bruggen. These aircraft and
personnel, alongside the continuing and
significant Army presence in Germany, are a
visible sign of Britain’s continuing
commitment to the defence of Europe.
Other Forces
Britain contributes to NATO’s maritime
augmentation forces. These are held at the
lowest state of readiness and in peacetime
comprise ships mainly in routine refit or
maintenance. It also contributes special forces
to support reaction and main defence force
deployments for surveillance, reconnaissance,
offensive action and military assistance
operations. The United Kingdom
Amphibious Force, together with its Dutch
counterpart, is assigned to the Supreme
Allied Commander Atlantic for the
reinforcement of Norway and could be
deployed by the Supreme Allied Commander
140
DEFENCE
Europe, for example, with the ARRC. The
Force is also a candidate for a range of
WEU operations. Assisting these forces are
RAF fighter aircraft and a strengthened air
transport force.
Wider Security Interests
Military tasks within Defence Role Three
are carried out to promote Britain’s
wider security interests. They may be
undertaken unilaterally or multilaterally with
support from NATO or directly for UN or
OSCE operations.
United Nations Operations
Britain remains a major contributor to UN
operations. Contingents are currently
deployed in former Yugoslavia (see p. 123),
Cyprus, Iraq/Kuwait and Angola; Britain
has previously deployed contingents in
Cambodia, the Western Sahara and Rwanda.
The British manpower contribution to the
UN force in Cyprus has been reduced by
50 per cent since 1992, although Britain
remains the largest contributor.
Other Operational Deployments
Royal Navy ships of the Armilla Patrol
continue to provide reassurance and
assistance to entitled merchant shipping in
the Gulf area and regularly participate in
maritime exercises with navies of Gulf states
and coalition allies. The Patrol also conducts
interception and boarding operations to
ensure that ships do not breach UN
sanctions against Iraq (see p. 123).
The number of operations against
trafficking in illicit drugs has increased in
recent years, especially in the Caribbean,
where the West Indies Guardship and other
Royal Navy ships work closely with the
authorities of the United States, the
Dependent Territories and the Regional
Security System to combat drug trafficking.
Primary responsibility for this work rests
with other government departments but the
armed forces assist where this can be done
without detriment to the performance of
other military tasks.
British Garrisons
A British garrison is maintained in Brunei,
South-East Asia, at the request of the Brunei
Government. The withdrawal of the British
garrison in Belize, Central America—
originally maintained to deter, and if
necessary defend against, possible
Guatemalan aggression—was completed at
the end of September 1994. This was made
possible by Guatemalan recognition of Belize
as a sovereign and independent state in 1991
and the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries. However, a
British military presence is maintained in
Belize in the form of a jungle training unit.
Military Assistance
During 1994-95, some 4,100 students from
100 countries attended military training
courses in Britain. On 1 January 1995, 395
British Service personnel (53 Royal Navy and
Royal Marines, 232 Army and 110 Royal Air
Force) were on loan in 24 countries. Their
duties include assisting, advising and training
the armed forces of the country or territory
to which they are loaned.
NUCLEAR FORCES
The Royal Navy’s independent nuclear
deterrent remains the ultimate guarantee of
Britain’s security. The current submarine-
launched Polaris strategic force is assigned to
NATO but remains at all times under the
control of the British Government; it enables
Britain to provide a second independent
centre of decision-making within NATO,
thereby enhancing deterrence.
The Polaris force now comprises two
nuclear submarines, each capable of carrying
16 Polaris missiles armed with improved
British nuclear warheads. The Polaris force is
being replaced by four British-built
submarines, each of which will carry Trident
missiles purchased from the United States. A
four-boat force will ensure that one boat is
always at sea, invulnerable to pre-emptive
attack. Trident’s nuclear warheads are
British-designed and built. The first
Trident submarine, HMS Vanguard, began
141
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
operations in 1995; the second and third,
HMS Victorious and HMS Vigilant,
are planned to enter service in 1996 and
1998 respectively.
The Government is committed to
maintaining only the minimum deterrent level
required for Britain’s security. Each Trident
submarine will deploy no more than 96
warheads and possibly significantly fewer. On
current plans, the explosive power ot each
submarine will not be much changed from
Polaris. When Trident is fully in service, the
explosive power of Britain’s operational
nuclear inventory will be over 25 per cent
lower than it was in 1990.
The armed forces also possess sub-
strategic nuclear weapons, which provide a
link between strategic and conventional
forces. Following the end of the Cold War,
Britain has made substantial reductions in
these weapons, including the elimination of
tactical maritime nuclear weapons and a
reduction of over 50 per cent in the stockpile
of WE177 free-fall nuclear bombs. The
remaining WE 177s are deployed on
dual-capable Tornado aircraft, all of which
are available to NATO. In addition, Britain
plans to exploit the flexibility and capability
of Trident to provide the vehicle for delivery
of its sub-strategic deterrent, once the WE 177
is withdrawn from service in 1998.
UNITED KINGDOM FORCE
STRUCTURES
Defence Equipment Programme
Modern equipment is essential if one of the
key aims of Britain’s force restructuring
programme is to be achieved, namely that ot
increasing the flexibility and mobility of the
armed forces. The successful outcome of the
Defence Costs Study (see p. 144) has enabled
the British Government to preserve the front
line (and its essential operational support) and
to make a number of important improvements
to its capability.
Current and planned front line
improvements for the Royal Navy equipment
programme include:
• introduction of Trident submarines to
replace Polaris;
• substantial updating of existing
nuclear-powered submarines and an
invitation to tender for the design and
building of a second batch of Trafalgar
Class submarines;
• a substantially modernised destroyer and
frigate fleet;
• a follow-on batch of 7 Sandown Class

THE ARMED FORCES
Commissioned Ranks
Commissions, either by promotion from the
ranks or by direct entry based on educational
and other qualifications, are granted for short
medium and long terms. All three Services
DEFENCE
have schemes for school, university and
college sponsorships.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training
at the Britannia Royal Naval College,
Dartmouth; the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst; or the Royal Air Force College,
Cranwell. This is followed by specialist
training, which may include degree courses at
service establishments or universities.
Higher training for officers is currently
provided by the Royal Naval College and
Joint Services Defence College, Greenwich;
the Army Staff College, Camberley; and the
Royal Air Force Staff College, Bracknell.
The Defence Costs Study (see p. 144)
concluded that courses should be subsumed
into a tri-Service course which will reinforce
the joint approach to the tactical and
operational levels of conflict. As such, the
Joint Services Command and Staff College
will be established in 1997 at Camberley.
The Higher Command and Staff Course,
conducted at Camberley, will remain as a
focus for the study of the operational level of
command, but will be expanded from 24 to
30 officers to increase the joint aspect.
Non-commissioned Ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks in
the Army and the RAF range from six
months to 22 years; they can be for a
maximum of 37 years in the Royal Navy and
32 years in the Royal Marines. There is a
wide choice of engagement length and terms
of service. Subject to a minimum period of
service, entrants may leave at any time, at 18
months’ notice (12 months for certain
engagements). Discharge may also be granted
on compassionate or medical grounds, by
purchase or on grounds of conscience.
Throughout their Service careers, non¬
commissioned personnel receive basic training
supplemented by specialist training. Study for
educational qualifications is encouraged and
Service trade and technical training lead to
nationally recognised qualifications.
Reserve Forces
Reserve forces are a central component of
Britain’s armed forces. They include
members who become reservists following a
period of regular service (regular reserve);
others are volunteers who train in their spare
time. Volunteer reserve forces include the
Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines
Reserve, the Territorial Army, the Royal
Auxiliary Air Force and the Royal Air Force
Volunteer Reserve. Reserves are available to
support regular forces, either as units or as
individuals, in time of tension or war. In
particular, reserves can provide skills and
units not available or required in peacetime.
Reserves are also a valuable link between the
Services and the civil community. The role
of the reserves is likely to increase in
importance in the future to include, for
example, a role in the range of lesser
contingencies in which British forces are
liable to be involved.
In April 1995 regular reserves totalled
around 262,900 and volunteer reserves and
auxiliary forces some 65,800.
ADMINISTRATION
The Defence Budget
The estimated defence budget for 1995-96
is £21,720 million, with expenditure plans
for 1996-97 and 1997-98 of £21,920 million
and £22,320 million respectively. The
Government anticipates a reduction of
14.5 per cent in real terms between 1992-93
and 1997-98. Britain spent 3.8 per cent of
Gross Domestic Product on defence in
1992-93; this is expected to fall to 2.8 per
cent by 1997-98.
Defence Management
The Ministry of Defence has a dual role as a
Department of State and the highest military
headquarters of the armed forces. A unified
Central Staff made up of military officers and
civilians was formed within the Ministry of
Defence in 1994 through the abolition of the
former Defence Staff and the Office of
Management and Budget, continuing a long
process of civilian/military integration. It is
responsible for defence policy, resource
allocation and equipment requirements,
direction of operations at the highest level,
143
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and management policy tor the armed forces
and the Ministry of Defence.
Department support services are provided
to the Head Office, Commands and budget-
holders by, among others, the Procurement
Executive, the Defence Intelligence Service,
the Defence Estates Organisation, and the
Defence Export Services Organisation.
Each Service’s Chief of Staff is
responsible, through the Chief of the
Defence Staff and the Secretary of State for
Defence, for the fighting effectiveness,
efficiency and morale of his Service. They
and the other senior officers and officials at
the head of each of the Department’s mam
functions form a single body responsible for
all the activities of the Ministry of Defence
and the armed forces. This corporate
board is chaired by the permanent civilian
head of the Department, the Permanent
Under-Secretary.
Since 1991, military and civilian managers
have been given ever greater authority and
responsibility for fulfilling their objectives
through the most efficient use of the
resources allocated to them. This is aimed at
achieving greater value for money and
clearer direction and accountability. The
recent Defence Costs Study was a radical
and comprehensive examination of all
aspects of the Ministry of Defence other
than the front line itself. Its aim was to
identify cost savings that could be made in
the support area without reducing front-line
effectiveness, and the study teams examined
over 30 functional areas. As a result, in
July 1994 a coherent package of proposals
was announced for savings of over £700
million in 1996-97, rising to £1,000 million
a year by the end of the decade, together
with a number of enhancements to the
equipment programme.
Wherever possible the Study sought to
identify and implement changes designed to
achieve greater working efficiency rather than
financial savings. Major emphasis was placed
on a clearer definition of the role of the
Head Office, further delegation of
responsibility to Commands and budget-
holders outside London and the
rationalisation of many Commands, training
and support activities on a joint-Service basis.
Defence Procurement
About 40 per cent of the defence budget is
spent on military equipment, including the
procurement of spares and associated costs.
The aim is to meet the operational
requirements of the armed forces by
procuring equipment, works and services
from the suppliers offering the best value for
money, taking all relevant factors into
account. When assessing options, particular
consideration is given not just to the initial
procurement cost of a project, but also to the
costs that could be necessary to support it
through its Service life. Competition is
fundamental to obtaining value for money
and takes place wherever possible. In
general, competitions are open to prime and
sub-contractors from overseas. Britain also
seeks to promote the creation of an open
market for defence equipment within Europe.
International Procurement Collaboration
International collaborative projects are
becoming increasingly important as
equipment development and production costs
increase and defence budgets reduce. Britain
favours such co-operation wherever it makes
economic and military sense by reducing
costs and improving standardisation. It ^
therefore plays an active role in NATO’s
Conference of National Armaments
Directors, which promotes equipment
collaboration between NATO members.
Britain is also a member of the WEU’s
Western European Armaments Group, which
is the main European forum for consultations
about armaments.
Current collaborative programmes include:
• the Eurofighter 2000 development (with
Germany, Italy and Spain);
• anti-tank guided weapons (with Belgium,
France, Germany and the Netherlands),
• a new air defence frigate (with France
and Italy);
• the Multiple Launch Rocket System
(with the United States, Germany,
France and Italy); and
• the EH 101 helicopter (with Italy).

Following the recession which began in 1990, the British economy has been
growing since 1992, with inflation remaining at historically low levels. Growth
has taken place across a broad front with a major contribution coming from
exports and more recently investment. The current economic climate is also
characterised by a revitalised manufacturing sector, coupled with falling
unemployment, low average earnings growth and increased business
confidence. The prime objective of government economic policy is to
maintain sound public finances by exerting tight control over public
expenditure.
National Economy
During the 1980s the British economy
expanded faster than those of France and
Germany. From 1981 to 1989 it experienced
eight years of sustained growth at an annual
average rate of over 3 per cent. Subsequently,
Britain, in common with other major
industrialised nations, was severely affected
by recession. In 1990 growth in Britain
slowed to 0.6 per cent, and in 1991 gross
domestic product (GDP) fell by 2.1 per cent.
GDP rose slightly in the second half of 1992
as economic recovery began and has now
been growing for three years. Output is
presently 9 per cent above the trough of the
recession and 5 per cent higher than the
previous peak. In the second quarter of 1995
it reached a level 2.9 per cent higher than a
year earlier.
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
The economy is based primarily on private
enterprise; the private sector accounts for
79 per cent of output and 85 per cent of
employment. Government policy is directed
at providing the stability needed by business
to plan ahead.
Values for some of the main economic
indicators in selected years since 1984 are
shown in Table 11.1. For further information
see the Statistical Annex on pp. 534-5.
Inflation
During most of the 1950s and the 1960s the
inflation rate in Britain rarely rose above
5 per cent. However, in 1971 inflation
reached double figures, climbing to 27 per
cent in 1975. Contributory factors included
oil price rises in 1973 and increases in the

money supply and public spending. Inflation
fell in the early 1980s and stayed low for a
number of years. However, it picked up towards
the end of the decade and the annual rate rose
to 10.9 per cent towards the end of 1990.
Inflation has declined substantially since this
peak. For the Retail Prices Index (RPI—
which records the price of goods and services
purchased by households in Britain), the
annual rate was 3.6 per cent in August 1995.
The RPI excluding mortgage interest
payments (‘underlying’ inflation) was 2.9 per
cent in August 1995; it has now been below
3 per cent for almost two years, the longest
period since the early 1960s.
Output
The economy grew by 3.9 per cent in 1994.
The Government forecasts that GDP
growth will slow to a more sustainable rate
in 1995 and 1996—coming down to 3.25 per
cent in 1995 and 2.75 per cent in 1996,
particularly as North Sea oil output increases
more slowly.
After the oil price rises of 1973-74,
manufacturing output dropped sharply. It
later increased, but, in the wake of another
oil price rise and stagnation in the world
economy, it fell back again in the late 1970s
and early 1980s. A period of growth
occurred until 1990, but manufacturing
output fell significantly during the
subsequent recession. Following a rise of 4.2
per cent in 1994, manufacturing output in
the three months to July 1995 showed growth
of 1.9 per cent, compared with the same
period a year earlier.
Oil and gas output passed its peak of the
mid-1980s and fell back until 1991, when it

increased by about 2 per cent. In 1993 and
1994 output of oil and gas was exceptionally
high, rising by 15 and 27 per cent respectively.
Recent decades have generally seen the
fastest growth in the services sector. Services
now account for around two-thirds of GDP,
compared with about one-half in 1950.
Manufacturing contributes less than one-
quarter of GDP, compared with over a third
in 1950. Table 11.2 compares output and
employment in 1993 and 1994, and Table 11.3
compares GDP by industry in 1984 and 1994.
Productivity
Growth in manufacturing output per head in
Britain in the 1980s was faster than in all
other leading industrialised countries:
between 1980 and 1990 it increased by an
average of 4.6 per cent a year. In the three
months to July 1995, it was up 1.9 per cent
on a year earlier, following a 4.8 per cent
increase in 1994. Output per head in the
whole economy rose by 3.5 per cent in 1994.
Investment
From 1983 until 1989 fixed investment
increased by about 8 per cent a year on
average, with particularly rapid growth of
over 10 per cent a year between 1986 and
1988. Investment declined between 1990 and
1992, but since 1993 it has recovered, rising
by 3.2 per cent in 1994; in the second quarter
of 1995 investment grew by 2.6 per cent,
compared with a year earlier.
Between 1980 and 1994 the private
sector’s share of fixed investment grew from
73 to 87 per cent, due in part to privatisation
(see p. 200). In the same period, there was a
rise in the share of investment undertaken by
the services sector and a fall in that carried
out by manufacturing. Table 11.4 shows
investment by business sector.

An improvement in the quality of
investment contributed to a rise in the late
1980s in the net real rate of return on capital
employed in non-oil industrial and commercial
companies to the highest levels for 20 years.
Profitability declined in 1990 and 1991, but
since 1992 it has recovered. Non-oil corporate
earnings grew strongly in 1994, when net
profitability reached 9.5 per cent.
Employment
The workforce in employment fell by around
2 million in the early 1990s following an
increase of over 3 million between 1983 and
1990. With economic recovery, employment
levels have stabilised at an earlier stage than
in previous cycles and are now rising.
Unemployment increased during the early
1990s, and it reached nearly 3 million on a
seasonally adjusted basis in late 1992. Since
then unemployment has fallen by 680,000
and in August 1995 it was 2.3 million—8.2
per cent of the workforce—the lowest since
1991 (see p. 182).
Overseas Trade
Britain has an open economy in which
international trade plays a vital part. The
Government welcomed the successful outcome
of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (see
p. 173). The share of GDP accounted for by
exports of goods and services has increased
from 14 per cent in the early 1960s to 26 per
cent. Similar rises have occurred in most other
developed countries, reflecting the growing
importance of international trade in an
increasingly interdependent world economy.
Membership of the European Union (EU)
has had a major impact on Britain’s pattern
of trade. Between 1972 and 1994 the share of
Britain’s exports of goods going to other EU
members rose from a third to over a half.
Imports followed a similar trend, growing from
about a third to over one-half. The United
States accounts for 13 per cent of Britain s
exports and 12 per cent of its imports.
For the last 12 years Britain has had a
deficit on visible trade. In 1994 it stood at
£10,594 million on a seasonally adjusted
basis, £2,784 million below the 1993 deficit.
Exports continue to perform strongly as a
result of improved competitiveness and a
sharp recovery in world trade.
The deficit on the balance of payments
current account was down from £11,042
million in 1993 to £1,684 million in 1994, its
lowest level for nearly a decade. Substantial
net earnings on invisible transactions,
particularly from financial services, kept the
current account in surplus in most years up
to 1985, but it has been in deficit since then.
The surplus on invisibles was £8,910 million
in 1994. In that year exports of services
amounted to 29 per cent of exports of goods.
152
ECONOMY
Inward Investment
Britain is recognised as an attractive location
for inward direct investment and 13,000
overseas companies are currently operating in
Britain, including more than 4,000 from the
United States, over 1,000 from Germany and
200 from Japan. This reflects its membership
of the EU and proximity to other European
markets, its open trading system and
‘enterprise culture’, stable labour relations
and comparatively low personal and corporate
taxation. Overseas-owned firms are offered
the same incentives as British-owned ones.
In recent years Britain has attracted the
greatest share of inward investment into the
European Union, including about 40 per
cent of Japanese investment and of US
investment. It is second only to the United
States as a destination for international
direct investment.
Energy
With the exploitation of oil and natural gas
from the Continental Shelf under the North
Sea, Britain is self-sufficient in energy in net
terms and expects to remain so for some
years. In 1994 it was the world’s eighth
largest oil producer. The extraction of oil and
gas accounted for 2.5 per cent of GDP in
1994, while crude oil and petroleum products
made up 6.5 per cent of visible exports.
The benefits to the balance of payments
began to appear in the second half of the
1970s and in 1980 Britain had its first surplus
on oil trade. Exports, mainly to other EU
countries, are equivalent to 65 per cent of
domestic oil production. They are partly
offset in balance-of-payments terms by
imports of other grades of crude oil from the
Middle East and elsewhere.
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
The objective of the Government’s economic
policy is to promote sustained growth and
rising prosperity. It seeks to do this by means
of structural policies to improve the long¬
term performance of the economy and by
creating a stable macroeconomic environment
with low inflation and sound public finances.
Following the suspension in 1992 of sterling’s
membership of the exchange rate mechanism
(ERM) of the European Monetary System,
the Government set out a new monetary
policy framework for its counter-inflation
strategy. This includes a target of keeping
underlying inflation within a range of 1 to 4
per cent, bringing it down to the lower half of
this range by the end of the present Parliament.
The Government’s economic policy is set
out in the medium-term financial strategy,
which is published each year at the time of
the Budget. Within this strategy, the role of
monetary policy is to help secure permanently
low inflation, while fiscal policy is designed
to bring about sound public finances.
Macroeconomic policy is directed towards
creating a stable economic environment.
Microeconomic policies seek to improve the
working of markets and encourage enterprise,
efficiency and flexibility through measures
such as privatisation, deregulation, cutting
out waste and tax reforms (see below).
Monetary Policy
Short-term interest rates remain the key
instrument of monetary policy. Monetary
policy takes time to influence inflation: hence,
interest rate decisions are based on an
assessment of the prospects for underlying
inflation in one to two years’ time. That
assessment is based on a wide range of
information including monetary and other
financial indicators, activity indicators and
measures of costs. The main monetary
indicators are the growth of ‘narrow money’,
as measured by M0, and ‘broad money’, M4.1
Medium-term target ranges have been set at
0 to 4 per cent for M0 and 3 to 9 per cent
for M4. Movements in the exchange rate and

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL FIANDBOOK
together with the Bank’s Quarterly Inflation
Report—which is prepared independently of
the Treasury—and full explanations whenever
interest rates are changed, is designed to
make Britain’s monetary policy framework
one of the most open in the world.
Fiscal Policy
The objective of fiscal policy is to ensure
sound public finances, bringing the budget
back to balance over the medium term. The
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement is
projected to return to balance by the end of
the decade, with public sector borrowing at a
level no higher than is required to finance
capital spending from 1997-98. The
Government is committed to reducing the
share of public expenditure in national income,
while value for money is constantly improved.
Within the overall policy of moving
towards a balanced budget over the medium
term, the Government aims to reduce taxes
when possible so as to leave people with more
of their own money. The basic rate of income
tax has been cut from 33 to 25 per cent, and
a lower rate of 20 per cent now applies on the
first £3,200 of taxable income (see p. 163).
Supply-side Policies
While macroeconomic policy is directed
towards ensuring sustainable growth through
low inflation and sound public finances, the
Government has sought to improve the
supply response, and thus the efficiency, of
the economy through microeconomic policies.
Action has been taken to expose more of the
economy to market forces. Direct controls
for example, on pay, prices, foreign exchange,
dividend payments and commercial credit
have been abolished and competition in
domestic markets strengthened.
Measures have been implemented to
reduce regulatory burdens on business and
the number of administrative obstacles facing
small firms and self-employed people (see
p. 200). Where there is evidence of market
failure, and government intervention can be
cost-effective and is likely to cause minimal
distortion, efforts have been made to increase
the flow of investment funds to small firms,
help facilitate innovation in industry and
attract industry to the inner cities. Measures
have been taken to encourage saving and
share ownership; TESSAs (Tax Exempt
Special Savings Accounts) and Personal
Equity Plans are recent examples (see p. 223).
A White Paper issued in 1994, designed to
improve business competitiveness, contains
over 60 new measures, many relating to
improving education and training and the
performance of small businesses (see p. 200).
A follow-up White Paper was released in
May 1995.
A substantial number of activities have
been transferred from the public sector to the:
private sector by privatisation and contracting
out. In addition, the Government is seeking
greater efficiency and value for money in the
public sector through market testing and
competitive tendering, efficiency reviews and
scrutinies, and better financial management.
Labour Market
The Government has sought to improve
work incentives by reducing personal income
tax rates whenever possible, raising tax
thresholds and reforming the benefits system
It has also, through the tax system,
encouraged the extension of share ownership
among employees. A scheme of income tax
relief has been introduced to encourage the
spread of profit-related pay. The
Government has taken steps to achieve a
more balanced legal framework for industrial
relations. It has expanded training
opportunities and put in place a new traininj
framework, with a greater role for employers
so that training better reflects labour market
needs. Obstacles to the mobility of labour
have also been reduced.
Economic Management
HM Treasury has prime responsibility for
the formulation and conduct of economic
policy, which it carries out in conjunction
with the Bank of England (the central
bank—see p. 215) and other government
departments—Trade and Industry, Educatid
and Employment, the Environment,
Transport, and the Ministry of Agriculture,

Fisheries and Food. While the Chancellor of
the Exchequer makes the decisions about
whether to change interest rates, the
Governor of the Bank of England is
responsible for deciding the precise timing of
any interest rate change.
Several other bodies deal with specific
aspects of economic policy and the regulation
of certain sectors of the economy. These
include the Office of Fair Trading and the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (see
p. 202).
The Government makes known its
economic policies and keeps in touch with
developments throughout the economy by
means of informal and continuous links with
representatives from industrial, financial and
commercial sectors as well as other
interested parties. Final responsibility for
the broad lines of economic policy rests with
the Cabinet.
In order to improve economic forecasting,
the Government set up a Panel of Independent
Forecasters in 1992. The Panel reports to the
Chancellor on the current position of, and
future prospects for, the economy.
NATIONAL INCOME AND
EXPENDITURE
The value of all goods and services produced
in the economy is measured by GDP. This
may be expressed either in terms of market
prices (the prices people pay for the goods
and services they buy) or at factor cost (the
cost of the goods and services before adding
taxes and subtracting subsidies). It can also
be expressed in current prices or in constant

prices (that is, removing the effects of
inflation to measure the volume of growth in
the economy). In 1994 GDP at current lactor
cost totalled £579,140 million. Between 1984
and 1994 the index of GDP at constant factor
cost increased by 27 per cent.
Table 11.5 gives figures for GDP, at both
current market prices and current factor cost.
It also shows the components of two other
main aggregates, gross national product and
national income.
Table 11.6 shows the categories of total
final expenditure in 1994. Consumers’
expenditure accounted for 50 per cent of total
final expenditure, and exports of goods and
services for 20 per cent.
Personal Incomes and Expenditure
Personal disposable income consists of
personal incomes after deductions mainly
taxation and social security contributions.
This rose fairly steadily from £223,642
million in 1984 to £472,574 million at
current prices in 1994. Personal disposable
income in 1994 was just under 1 per cent
higher in real terms than in 1993.
Consumers’ expenditure amounted to 91 per
cent of post-tax personal income in 1994,
compared with 89 per cent in 1993.
Consumers’ expenditure rose by 3 per cent
in real terms between 1993 and 1994. Table
11.7 shows the changing pattern of
consumers’ expenditure from 1984 to 1994.
Declining proportions are being spent on
food and alcoholic drink, tobacco, clothing
and footwear, and fuel and power. Over the
longer term, as incomes rise, people tend to
spend increasing proportions on services.
Spending on leisure pursuits and tourism,
health and financial services have all shown
significant growth in recent years. Housing,
food, alcoholic drink, tobacco, clothing and
footwear, and fuel and power together
accounted for about 32 per cent of the total
in 1994.
The ratio of saving to personal
disposable income declined substantially
during the 1980s. However, in 1992 it
increased to 12.2 per cent, falling to 9.4 per
cent by 1994.
Sources of Income
The proportion of total personal pre-tax
income accounted for by income from
employment was 61 per cent in 1994; averagj
gross weekly earnings in April 1995 in Great
Britain were £375 for full-time male workers:
and £270 for full-time female workers. The

“\ number of adjustments are needed to relate the Government’s forecast for public expenditure to the broader concepts
of general government expenditure.
The Government’s objective for public expenditure is now expressed in terms of general government expenditure (X)—that is,
excluding privatisation proceeds and Lottery-financed spending, and net of interest and dividend receipts.

three other main sources of personal income
were self-employment (11 per cent), rent,
dividends and interest (12 per cent), and
social security benefits and other current
grants from government (16 per cent).
Public Finance
Public expenditure covers expenditure by
both central and local government. Central
government expenditure includes money
| spent on goods and services, and on
payments to people, for example, social
security and pensions.
General government expenditure (see
p. 158) is expected to be around £301,900
I million in 1995-96 (see Table 11.8). The
Government’s policy is to maintain tight
control of public spending, so that general
government expenditure as a share of GDP
declines. Current public expenditure plans
provide for ‘Control Total’ spending (see
p. 158) to rise at less than 3 per cent a year
in cash terms over the three years to 1997-98.
The diagram on p. 160 shows the main
categories of expenditure, together with the
main sources of revenue. The government
departments with the largest spending
programmes are:
• the Department of Social Security (with
expenditure estimated at £70,840 million
in 1994-95, excluding cyclical social
security);
• the Department of the Environment
(£39,400 million, of which £29,930
million was on local government);
• the Department of Health (£31,770
million); and
• the Ministry of Defence (£22,170
million).
Tough controls on public expenditure
have included cutting waste in government,
and reducing spending programmes where
possible. Savings have been made in a
number of areas, such as defence, housing,
roads and social security. Resources are being
devoted to priority areas, such as health and
education, while additional resources have
been made available for science, urban
regeneration projects and overseas aid. Private
finance (see p. 158) is making a growing
contribution, especially in transport.
Education accounts for about 17 per
cent of local authority spending; law and
order, housing and other environmental
services, personal social services, social
security, and roads and transport take up
most of the remainder.
157
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
General government expenditure (excluding
privatisation proceeds), as a proportion of
GDP, fell from over 47 per cent in 1982-83 to
under 40 per cent in 1989-90. The recession
in the early 1990s led to a rise in the ratio, to
over 44 per cent in 1992-93 and 1993-94, but
it is forecast to decline to under 41 per cent by
1997-98 and to 39 per cent by 1999-2000.
Between 1987-88 and 1990-91 the public
sector was in surplus, so that the Government
repaid debt. The Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement (PSBR) rose rapidly during the
early 1990s, largely reflecting the impact of
the recession, but since then it has fallen and
in 1994—95 amounted to £35,300 million, 5.25
per cent of GDP. The PSBR is forecast to
continue to fall to £23,600 million in 1995—96
(see Table 11.9), 3.25 per cent of GDP, and
to be close to zero by the end of the 1990s.
Private Finance Initiative
The private finance initiative was launched in
1992. Its aim is to utilise private sector
efficiency, management expertise and
resources in the provision of capital assets and
the supply of services traditionally regarded
as being exclusively handled by the public
sector. The initiative follows on from
privatisation, market testing and contracting
out. It reflects the shift in the role of the
public sector from a provider to a purchaser
of services. The Government believes that
this will result in projects being better
designed and managed, as well as stimulating
new investment. Contracts involving capital
investment of about £5,000 million are
expected to be awarded in 1995 under the
initiative. Several transport projects, such as
the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (see p. 302),
the upgrading of the West Coast main line
railway between London and Glasgow (see p.
300) and the extension of the Docklands
Light Railway to Lewisham (see p. 303), are
being taken forward under the initiative.
Other schemes include:
• new prisons in Bridgend and Merseyside
(see p. 98);
• over 50 projects, completed or approved,
bringing in several hundred million
pounds of investment to the National
Health Service; and
• about £1,000 million of information
technology projects which are in progress
or being considered.
The Government has set up the Private
Finance Panel (containing high-level
representatives from the public and private
sectors) to encourage greater participation in
the initiative and seek solutions to any
problems which might arise. It will not
approve capital projects unless private finance
options have been explored.
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE TERMS
The three main public expenditure totals are
general government expenditure, the Control
Total’ and Supply expenditure.
General Government Expenditure
General government expenditure, excluding
privatisation proceeds, is the total spending of
central and local government, including
central government support for nationalised
industries and other public corporations. It is
a key public spending aggregate and is
used in the medium-term financial
strategy (see p. 153), where public spending
is set in the context of broader economic
policy. As it is usually less affected by
institutional differences, it is considered the
most appropriate measure for making
international comparisons.
Control Total
The Control Total is used by the
Government for the purposes of planning am
control. The Government seeks to achieve its
wider medium-term objective expressed in
terms of general government expenditure
excluding privatisation proceeds—by
controlling spending within this total. The
Control Total, which covers over 80 per ceni
of government expenditure, includes.
• expenditure for which central
government is itself responsible;
• the support it provides or approves for
local authority expenditure;
• local authority self-financed
expenditure;

nationalised industries; and
• a reserve to cover unanticipated
expenditure.
It excludes accounting adjustments and the
two main items of expenditure most affected
by the economic cycle—debt interest and
i cyclical social security.
Supply Expenditure
Supply expenditure is financed out of money
| voted by Parliament in the Supply Estimates
(see p. 160). About 69 per cent of all Supply
i expenditure counts in the Control Total. The
main element of the Control Total not
| funded through Supply Estimates is
i expenditure financed from the National
i Insurance Fund.
CONTROL OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
The Government’s objective is that public
expenditure (measured by general government
expenditure, excluding privatisation proceeds)
should grow by less than the economy as a
whole over time, while value for money is
constantly improved.
In 1992 it announced a new system of
public expenditure control aimed at reducing
the share of national income taken by public
spending. Annual ceilings are set for the
growth of the Control Total, in line w ith the
Government’s medium-term objectives.
This ‘top-down’ approach separates
decisions on overall public expenditure levels
from the allocation between programmes.
Departmental spending decisions are based
on allocating available resources within agreed
ceilings for aggregate spending; resources are
devoted to priority areas, with an emphasis
on obtaining maximum value for money.
Together with the move to a unified Budget
(see below), the new framework represents an
important reform of fiscal planning procedures.
Fundamental Expenditure Reviews
The Government announced in 1993 that it
would conduct in-depth reviews of all public
expenditure by each government department.
These reviews examine long-term trends in
expenditure, the ways in which services could
be delivered more economically and
effectively, and areas from which the State
could withdraw. Results of the reviews
conducted so far, in areas such as social
security, health and employment, have
identified savings and contributed to some of
the increases in efficiency reflected in plans
for future spending.
Planning Cycle and the Unified Budget
A new planning cycle took effect with the
introduction of the unified Budget
arrangements in November 1993, under
which the Government presents taxation and
spending proposals to Parliament at the same
time to allow comparison. The Budget now
covers both the Government’s taxation plans
for the coming financial year and its spending
159
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
plans for the next three years. The proposals
are announced to the House of Commons b\
the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the
Budget statement and are published in the
Financial Statement and Budget Report. This
report also contains a review of recent
developments in the economy, together with
an economic forecast, and sets out the fiscal
and monetary framework within which
economic policy operates. This is the
medium-term financial strategy.
The Budget statement is followed by the
moving of a set of Budget resolutions in
which the tax proposals are embodied. These
resolutions are the foundation of the Finance
Bill, published in January. The Provisional
Collection of Taxes Act 1968 allows the tax
authorities to collect taxes provisionally, at
the levels provided by the Budget proposals,
pending enactment of the Finance Bill.
Estimates
The annual Public Expenditure Survey
conducted by HM Treasury provides the
basis for the Estimates which each
government department submits to the
Treasury, giving details of its cash
requirements for the coming financial year.
After Treasury approval, these Supply
Estimates are presented to Parliament.
Parliamentary authorisation is required for
the major part of the new spending plans for
the year ahead announced in the unified
Budget. Parliament approves them as part of
the annual Appropriation Act. Supplementary
Estimates may also be presented to
Parliament during the course of the year.
Individual reports setting out expenditure
plans for government departments are
published in February or March.
If any Supply Estimate is overspent, the
Committee of Public Accounts (see p. 161)
may investigate before Parliament is asked to
approve any Excess Vote to balance the
account. In each parliamentary session, up to
three ‘Estimates days’ are available for
debates on the Supply Estimates, following
scrutiny by select committees of the House
of Commons.

ECONOMY
Cash Limits
The Government sets cash limits on just over
60 per cent of Supply expenditure and is
extending the coverage of limits whenever
possible. The imposition of cash limits
indicates that the Government intends to
avoid extra provision for programmes even in
the event of unexpected increases in costs.
They cover the major part of grants to local
authorities, which are financed out of Supply
expenditure. Cash limits also apply to some
■ expenditure not voted in the Estimates.
Running cost limits are imposed on the
administrative costs of central government,
which are identified separately in the
Estimates. Any overspending of cash or
running cost limits leads to an investigation
into the causes and, where appropriate, a
reduction in the limits in the following year.
Those Estimates not subject to cash limits
mainly finance demand-led services like
income support from the Department of
Social Security. In such cases, once policy
and rates of payment are determined,
expenditure depends on factors beyond the
direct control of government, such as the
number of eligible recipients.
Proposed Changes in Government
Accounting Procedures
In July 1994 the Government issued a Green
Paper containing proposals to change
accounting and budgeting procedures by
government departments, which were confirmed
in a White Paper published in July 1995. The
proposals would involve the replacement of
cash-based government accounts by more
commercial ‘resource accounting’ and budgeting
methods, a process already adopted in executive
agencies and the National Health Service. The
new methods are expected to bring improved
efficiency and to focus more on departmental
objectives and outputs rather than the money
available for spending. Departments would have
their own balance sheets showing assets and
liabilities. Resource accounting is expected to be
introduced for most departments in April 1997
and the remainder in April 1998. The first
resource-based Public Expenditure Survey is
expected to be produced in 2000.
Examination and Audit of Public
Expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is
carried out by select committees of the
House of Commons. These study in detail
the activities of particular government
departments and require the attendance of
ministers and officials for cross-examination.
Audit of the Government’s spending, which
follows up the control inherent in
parliamentary approval of the Estimates, is
exercised through the functions of the
Comptroller and Auditor General, the head
of the National Audit Office.
Comptroller and Auditor General
The Comptroller and Auditor General, an
officer of the House of Commons appointed
by the Crown, has two distinct functions. As
Comptroller General, he or she is responsible
for ensuring that all revenue and other public
money payable to the Consolidated Fund and
the National Loans Fund (see p. 162) is duly
paid and that all payments from these funds
are authorised by statute. As Auditor
General, he or she must certify the accounts
of all government departments and executive
agencies and those of a w ide range of other
public sector bodies; scrutinise the economy,
efficiency and effectiveness of their
operations; examine revenue accounts and
inventories; and report the results of these
examinations to Parliament.
Committee of Public Accounts
The Committee of Public Accounts considers
the accounts of government departments,
executive agencies and other public sector
bodies, and the Comptroller and Auditor
General’s reports on them and on
departments’ use of their resources. The
Committee takes evidence from heads of
departments, agencies and other public sector
bodies and submits reports to Parliament.
The Government’s formal replies to the
reports are presented to Parliament in the
form of Treasury minutes, and the reports
and minutes are usually debated annually in
the Commons.

largely met out of the Consolidated F und, an
account at the Bank of England into w hich
tax receipts and other revenues are paid. Any
excess of expenditure over receipts is met by
the National Loans Fund, wTich is another
official sterling account at the Bank of
England and is the repository for funds
borrowed by the Government. The National
Insurance Fund, into which contributions are
paid by employers and employed people, is
used mainly to pay for social security benefits.
MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE
The main sources of revenue are:
• taxes on income (including profits), which
include personal income tax, corporation
tax and petroleum revenue tax;
• taxes on expenditure, which include
VAT and customs and excise duties; and
• National Insurance contributions, which
give entitlement to a range of benefits.
Other sources are stamp duties,
inheritance tax, capital gains tax, and the
council tax and business rates.
Taxation Policy
The Government’s programme of tax reform
has sought to create a climate in which
business can thrive and individual initiative is
rewarded. Its aims include:
• keeping the overall tax burden as low as
possible through firm control over public
expenditure;
• reducing marginal tax rates of income
and profits to sharpen incentives to work
and create wealth;
• maintaining a broad tax base, which helps
to keep tax rates low and avoids
distorting commercial decisions; and
• shifting the balance of taxation from
taxes on income to taxes on expenditure.
The Government also aims to simplify the
administration of the tax system and
minimise the burdens which compliance places
on the taxpayer, and to close tax loopholes.
Tax Measures in the 1994 Budget
The November 1994 Budget contained a
number of tax changes designed to
maintain the tax base and close tax loopholes,
while supporting government policy
objectives on health and the environment.
Measures included:
• increases in the main personal allowances
and income tax thresholds in line with
price changes;
• support for environmental and health
objectives by raising in real terms road
fuel duties by 5 per cent and tobacco
duties by 3 per cent, continuing the
policy announced in the November 1993
Budget; and
• halting a number of tax avoidance schemes.
In addition, the Budget contained
proposals to make it cheaper to employ new
staff, encourage investment in small and
growing businesses, and help businesses
facing higher non-domestic rates bills from
1995-96 (see p. 166).
A new landfill tax was announced in
the Budget. The tax, due to be
introduced in 1996, is intended to help
protect the environment by increasing
the cost of disposing of waste in
landfill sites and by providing an
additional incentive for recycling.
To avoid imposing additional costs
on business, cuts in employers’
National Insurance contributions are
planned at the time of the
introduction of the new tax.
A package of tax and spending measures
to make good the revenue lost as a result of
Parliament’s subsequent decision to hold the
rate of VAT on domestic fuel and power to
8 per cent rather than raising it to 17.5 per
cent was announced in December 1994.
These included further increases in duties on
road fuel and tobacco.
Collection of Taxes and Duties
The Inland Revenue assesses and collects
taxes on income, profits and capital, and
162
ECONOMY
stamp duty. HM Customs and Excise collects
the most important taxes on expenditure (VAT
and most duties). Vehicle excise duty is the
responsibility of the Department of Transport.
National Insurance contributions are the
responsibility of the Department of Social
Security, although they are mainly collected by
the Inland Revenue. The council tax and
business rates are collected by local authorities.
Taxes on Income
Income Tax
I Taxes on individual incomes are generally
progressive in that larger incomes bear a
proportionately greater amount of tax. Income
: tax is imposed for the year of assessment
beginning on 6 April. From April 1995 the
lower rate of 20 per cent was widened to the
j first £3,200 of taxable income. The basic rate
I of 25 per cent applies to the next £21,100 of
•s taxable income. A rate of 40 per cent is levied
on taxable income above £24,300. These rates
j apply to total income, including earned and
I investment income. Of nearly 26 million
j income taxpayers, 5 million pay only lower
rate tax, about 18 million are basic rate
j taxpayers and over 2 million are in the higher
rate tax band.
A number of allowances and reliefs reduce
an individual’s income tax liability. All
taxpayers, irrespective of sex or marital status,
are entitled to a personal allowance against
income from all sources. Married women pay
their own tax on the basis of their own
income. In addition, there is a married
couple’s allowance, which may be allocated to
either partner or they may receive half each.
Wives can elect to receive half of the
allowance as of right. For 1995-96 the values
of the main allowances are £3,525 for the
personal allowance and £1,720 for the
married couple’s allowance. From April 1994
tax relief for some allowances, including the
married couple’s allowance, was restricted to
20 per cent, and this was reduced to 15 per
cent in April 1995.
Among the most important of the reliefs is
that for mortgage interest payments on
borrowing for house purchase up to the
statutory limit of £30,000. From April 1994
relief was reduced from the basic rate to 20
per cent, and this was limited to 15 per cent
in April 1995. Relief is usually given ‘at
source’, that is, repayments which the
borrower makes to the lender are reduced to
take account of tax relief at the appropriate
rate and the tax refund is then passed
directly by the tax authorities to the building
society or bank making the loan rather than
to the individual borrower.
Employees’ contributions to their pension
schemes also qualify for tax relief within
limits laid down by Parliament.
Most wage and salary earners pay their
income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn
(PAYE) system whereby tax is deducted and
accounted for to the Inland Revenue by the
employer, in a way which enables most
employees to pay the correct amount of tax
during the year.
The assessment and collection of
personal taxation will be simplified
from 1996-97. The option of self-
assessment will be extended to all
who fill in tax returns (about 9
million people). The changes will
allow taxpayers to calculate their own
liability to tax, and will introduce a
uniform set of dates for the payment
of income tax and capital gains tax.
They will also replace the ‘preceding
year’ basis of income tax for the self-
employed by a simpler ‘current year’
basis; people becoming self-employed
from April 1994 are already being
taxed on the latter basis.
In general, income tax is charged on all
income which originates in Britain—although
some forms of income are exempt, such as
certain social security benefits—and on all
income arising abroad of people resident in
Britain. Interest on certain British
government securities belonging to people not
ordinarily resident in Britain is exempt.
Britain has entered into agreements with
many countries to provide relief from double
taxation; where such agreements are not in
force unilateral relief is often allowed. British
residents working abroad for the whole year
may benefit from 100 per cent tax relief.
163
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Corporation Tax
The rates of company tax in Britain are lower
than in most other industrialised countries.
Companies pay corporation tax on their
income and capital gains after deduction of
certain allowances and reliefs. A company
which distributes profits to its shareholders is
required to pay advance corporation tax
(ACT) on these distributions to the Inland
Revenue. This ACT can be set against the
company’s liability to corporation tax,
subject to a limit. If resident in Britain, a
shareholder receiving dividends from
companies resident in Britain is entitled to
a tax credit. This satisfies some or all of
the shareholder’s liability to income tax on
his or her dividend income, or is paid to
shareholders not liable to tax.
The main rate of corporation tax is 33 per
cent, with a reduced rate of 25 per cent for
small companies (those with profits below
£300,000 in a year). Marginal relief is allowed
for companies with profits between £300,000
and £1.5 million, so that the company’s
overall rate is between the main rate and the
small companies’ rate. Capital expenditure on
plant and machinery, on scientific research
and on industrial buildings qualifies for
annual allowances, which are deducted from
profits to recognise the depreciation of the
items concerned.
Petroleum Revenue Tax
Petroleum revenue tax (PRT), deductible in
computing profits for corporation tax, is
charged on profits from the production as
opposed, for example, to the refining of oil
and gas in Britain and on its Continental
Shelf under licence from the Department of
Trade and Industry. Each licensee of an
oilfield is charged at a rate of 50 per cent on
the profits from that field after deduction of
certain allowances and reliefs. New fields
given consent for development on or after
16 March 1993 are not liable to PRT.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is charged on the value of
estates at the time of death and is also
immediately chargeable on certain lifetime
transfers. The majority of business assets are
now exempt from inheritance tax, so that
most family businesses can be passed on
without a tax charge. Tax is charged at a
single rate of 40 per cent above the
threshold for inheritance tax of £154,000.
There are several important exemptions.
Generally, transfers between spouses are
exempt, and gifts and bequests to British
charities, major political parties and heritage
bodies are also normally exempt.
Capital Gains Tax
Capital gains realised on the disposal of
assets are liable to capital gains tax or, in the
case of companies, to corporation tax. For
1995-96 individuals are exempt from tax in
respect of total net gains of up to £6,000 in
any one year and most trusts on gains of up
to £3,000. Gains are treated as the
taxpayer’s top slice of income, and are
therefore charged at the individual s highest
income tax rate or the company’s
corporation tax rate.
Only gains arising since March 1982 are
subject to tax and the effects of inflation
are allowed for when measuring gains.
Some assets, including the principal
private residence, are normally exempt.
Gains on government securities and certain
corporate bonds are exempt from the tax,
as are gains on shares owned under Personal
Equity Plans (see p. 223). This last
exemption is designed to encourage wider
share ownership.
Taxes on Expenditure
Value Added Tax
VAT is a broadly based expenditure tax,
chargeable at 17.5 per cent, except on
domestic fuel and power, where the rate is
8 per cent. It is collected at each stage in the
production and distribution of goods and
services by taxable persons. The final tax is
borne by the consumer. When a taxable
person purchases taxable goods or services,
the supplier charges VAT—the taxable
person’s input tax. When the taxable person
164
ECONOMY
supplies goods or services, the customers are
then in turn charged VAT, which is the
taxable person’s output tax. The difference
between the output tax and the input tax is
paid to, or repaid by, Customs and Excise.
The annual level of turnover above which
traders must register for VAT is £46,000.
Certain goods and services are relieved from
VAT, either by being charged at a zero rate
or by being exempt.
• Under zero rating, a taxable person does
not charge tax to a customer but reclaims
any input tax paid to suppliers. Among
the main categories where zero-rating
applies are goods exported to other
countries, and goods shipped as stores on
ships and aircraft; most food; water and
sewerage; domestic and international
passenger transport; books, newspapers
and periodicals; construction of new
residential buildings; young children’s
clothing and footwear; drugs and
medicines supplied on prescription;
specified aids for handicapped people;
and certain supplies by or to charities.
• For exempt goods or services, a taxable
person does not charge any output tax
but is not entitled to reclaim the input
tax. The main categories where
exemption applies are many supplies of
land and buildings; insurance; postal
services; betting; gaming (subject to
certain important exceptions); lotteries;
finance; much education and training;
and health and welfare.
In the November 1994 Budget a number
of changes were introduced to reduce the
scope for avoiding payment of VAT and to
ease burdens on business.
Customs Duties
Customs duties are chargeable on goods from
outside the EU in accordance with its
Common Customs Tariff. Goods can move
freely across internal EU frontiers without
making customs entries at importation or
stopping for routine fiscal checks. For
commercial consignments, excise duty and
VAT are charged in the member state of
destination, at the rate in force in that state.
Excise Duties
Hydrocarbon oils used as road fuel bear
higher rates of duty than those used for other
purposes, although the rate of duty on
unleaded petrol is lower than that on leaded.
Kerosene, most lubricating oils and other oils
used for certain industrial processes are free
of duty. There are duties on spirits, beer,
wine, made-wine (wine with added
constituents, such as fruit juice), cider and
perry, based on alcoholic strength and
volume. Spirits used for scientific, medical,
research and industrial processes are generally
free of duty. Cigarette duty is charged partly
as a cash amount per cigarette and partly as a
percentage of retail price. Duty on other
tobacco products is based on weight.
Duties are charged on off-course betting,
pool betting, gaming in casinos, bingo and
gaming machines. Rates vary with the particular
form of gambling. Duty is charged either as a
percentage of gross or net stakes or, in the case
of gaming machines, as a fixed amount per
machine according to the cost of playing it and
its prize level. A 12 per cent duty on gross
stakes is levied on the National Lottery (see
p. 460), but there is no tax on winnings.
Vehicle excise duty (VED) on a privately-
owned motor car, light van or taxi with fewer
than nine seats is £135 a year. The duty on
goods vehicles is levied on the basis of gross
weight and, if over 12 tonnes, according to
the number of axles; the duty is designed to
ensure that such vehicles at least cover their
share of the full costs of road use through the
tax paid (VED and fuel duty). Duty on taxis
and buses varies according to seating
capacity, and duty on motor cycles according
to engine capacity.
Two new duties introduced in 1994 were a
2.5 per cent tax on most general insurance
premiums paid from 1 October, and a duty
on air passengers, which took effect in
November, of £5 for flights to internal and
EU destinations and £10 elsewhere.
Stamp Duty
Certain kinds of transfer are subject to stamp
duty. These include purchases of houses, at
1 per cent of the total price if this exceeds
165
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
£60,000, and instruments such as declarations
of trust. Transfers by gift and transfers to
charities are exempt.
Taxpayer’s Charter
The Taxpayer’s Charter sets out the standard
of service that people can expect from the
Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise.
Both departments should be fair, helpful,
courteous, efficient and accountable, and keep
taxpayers’ financial affairs private.
Other Revenue
National Insurance Contributions
There are five classes of National Insurance
contribution:
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers;
• Class 1A—paid by employers on the cash
equivalent of the benefit of cars and fuel
provided to their employees for private
use;
• Class 2—paid by the self-employed;
• Class 3—paid voluntarily for pension
purposes; and
• Class 4—paid by self-employed people on
their taxable profits between £6,640 and
£22,880 a year (in addition to their
Class 2 contribution).
Details of the rates of contribution are given
in Chapter 25, Social Security, on p. 415.
Local Authority Revenue
Local authorities in Great Britain have four
main sources of revenue income: grants from
central government; non-domestic rates; council
tax; and sales, fees and charges. About 55 per
cent of expenditure (excluding sales, fees and
charges) is financed by government grants.
Non-domestic rates are a tax on the
occupiers of non-domestic property. The
rateable value of property is assessed by
reference to annual rents and reviewed every
five years; the most recent revaluation in
Great Britain took place in April 1995. As
there are some very large local and sectoral
variations in the changes in rateable values, a
transitional scheme has been introduced to
limit the maximum real increases and
reductions in rates bills which would
otherwise arise from revaluation. In England
and Wales the non-domestic rate is set
nationally by central government and collected
by local authorities. It is paid into a national
pool and redistributed to local authorities in
proportion to their population. In 1995-96 a
similar system is being introduced in Scotland
involving a unified business rate at the same
level as in England. In Northern Ireland rates
are not payable on industrial premises or on
commercial premises in enterprise zones.
Certain other properties in Northern Ireland,
such as freight transport and recreational
premises, are partially derated.
Domestic property is generally subject to
the council tax, which replaced the
community charge in April 1993. Each
dwelling is allocated to one of eight valuation
bands, based on its capital value in April
1991. Capital values are based on the amount
each dwelling might have sold for on the
open market, subject to certain assumptions,
if it had been sold on 1 April 1991.
Discounts are available for dwellings with
fewer than two resident adults. A council tax
payer on a low income may receive council
tax benefit of up to 100 per cent of his or her
tax bill (see p. 423).
In Northern Ireland, rates—local domestic
property taxes based on the value of the
property—are collected by local authorities.
PUBLIC SECTOR FINANCIAL
OPERATIONS
Debt Management
The Government funds its borrowing
requirement by selling debt to the private
sector. Public sector borrowing, or debt
repayment, each year represents an addition
to, or subtraction from, the net debt of the
public sector. This debt is the consolidated
debt of the public sector less its holdings of
liquid assets. Net public sector debt held
outside the public sector amounted to
£252,000 million at the end of March 1994,
representing 38.25 per cent of GDP in
1993_94. This is expected to rise to 42.75 per
ECONOMY
cent of GDP by the end of March 1996, but
thereafter to fall steadily as the PSBR is
brought towards balance.
The funding requirement for 1995-96 is
| forecast to be about £25,600 million, of which
National Savings products (see p. 220) are
assumed to contribute about £2,500 million,
with gilt-edged stock contributing the balance.
Gilt-edged Stock
The major debt instrument is known as
gilt-edged stock (‘gilts’) as there is no risk of
default. Gilts are marketable and widely
traded. Pension funds and life insurance
companies have the largest holdings. The
Government publishes an annual debt
management report which sets out the
framework for issuing gilts in the coming
year. Gilts are sold by the Bank of England
on the Government’s behalf. Issues are
primarily by auction (broadly monthly),
supplemented by ad hoc ‘tap’ sales. Gilts
include ‘conventionals’, which pay fixed rates
of interest and redemption sums; index-
linked stocks, on which principal and interest
are linked to the movement in the Retail
Prices Index; and floating-rate gilts, with
payments linked to short-term interest rates.
The Government has announced that an
open sale and repurchase (‘repo’) market in gilts
will be created, and the necessary legislative
changes were incorporated in the Finance Act
1995. The new market, which is planned to
start in January 1996, is intended to improve
the liquidity and efficiency of the gilts market,
reducing yields and thus lowering the cost of
financing government debt.
Bills
Sterling Treasury bills are sold at a weekly
tender; the majority have a maturity of
three months. These are used to manage the
money markets, rather than to meet the
Government’s borrowing needs. The
Government has also issued bills
denominated and payable in European
Currency Units (ECUs) since 1988 and
longer-dated ECU notes since 1992. The
proceeds have been added to the official
foreign exchange reserves rather than being
used to finance public expenditure.
Other Public Sector Borrowing
The bulk of public corporations’ borrowing
is funded by central government, although
their temporary borrowing needs are met
largely from the market, usually under
Treasury guarantee. That part of local
authority borrowing met by central
government is supplied by authorisation of
Parliament through the Public Works Loan
Board from the National Loans Fund. The
Board remains an independent body even
though it is merged for administrative
purposes with the former National Debt
Office, forming the National Investment and
Loans Office.
Local authorities may also borrow'
directly from the market, both short-term
and long-term, through a range of
instruments. Some public corporations and
local authorities borrow' on occasion, under
special statutory power and with Treasury
consent, in foreign currencies.

Overseas trade has been of vital importance to the British economy for
hundreds of years. Although small in area and accounting for only about
1 per cent of the world’s population, Britain is the fifth largest trading
nation in the world. As a member of the European Union (EU), it is part ol
the world’s largest established trading group, responsible for 40 per cent ol
world exports.
The British Government is a strong
supporter of an open multilateral trading
system and advocates further trade
liberalisation. World trade is set to grow by 5
to 10 per cent a year in the next ten years,
due in part to the successful conclusion of
the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) in 1993. This led to the creation on
1 January 1995 of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO), of which Britain is a
founder member.
Britain exports more per head than the
United States and Japan; its overseas sales of
goods and services are equivalent to about a
quarter of gross domestic product (GDP).
Invisible earnings of British companies place
Britain in the top three countries in the
international league table of overseas
invisibles earners. It is the world’s second
biggest overseas investor and the leading
destination for inward direct investment
into the EU.
VISIBLE TRADE
In 1994 Britain’s exports of goods were
valued at about £134,500 million and its
imports of goods at £145,000 million on a
balance-of-payments basis (see Table 12.1).
Between 1993 and 1994 the volume of
exports of goods rose by 10 per cent and
their value by 11 per cent. Over the same
period, imports grew by 5 per cent by
volume and 8 per cent in terms of value. Re¬
exporting plays a prominent role in trade: a
recent Confederation of British Industry/
Lloyds Bank survey found that 45 per cent of
British importers export products worth up
to £14,000 million a year.
Commodity Composition
Britain has traditionally been an exporter of
manufactured goods and an importer of food
and basic materials. In 1970 manufactures
accounted for 85 per cent of its exports, this
fell to around 67 per cent by the mid-1980s
as North Sea oil exports increased their
share. The proportion of manufactures in
exports has since risen, to 83 per cent in
1994 (see Table 12.2). Britain has not,
however, had a surplus on manufactures
since 1982. Machinery and transport
equipment account for about 41 per cent of
exports and a similar proportion of imports

(see Table 12.3). Aerospace, chemicals and
electronics have become increasingly
significant export sectors, while textiles have
declined in relative importance.
Since the mid-1970s North Sea oil has
made a substantial contribution to Britain’s
overseas trade both in terms of exports and
import substitution. In 1994 exports of fuels
in volume terms were about three times their
1975 level; imports were around two-thirds of
the 1975 figure. The share of fuels in exports \
rose from 4 to 22 per cent in the mid-1980s,
when North Sea oil and gas production was
at its peak, falling back to 7 per cent in 1994. j
The import share decreased from 18 per cent
in 1975 to 13 per cent in the mid-1980s and
to 4 per cent by 1994. In 1994 the surplus
on trade in oil amounted to more than
£4,000 million.

“On an overseas-trade-statistics basis, seasonally adjusted.
In 1970 these accounted for 70 per cent of
exports and imports; by 1994 the shares
were 79 and 83 per cent respectively. The
proportion of Britain’s trade with non-oil
developing nations declined from about
22 per cent in 1970 to 13 per cent in the late
1980s, but has risen since 1992 to 16 per cent
of trade in 1994.
In 1972, the year before Britain joined the
European Community, 35 per cent of
Britain’s visible trade was with the other 14
countries which made up the European
Union in 1995. The proportion rose to 58 per
cent in 1994. Western Europe as a whole took
62 per cent of British exports in 1994.
In 1994 the other 11 countries then
making up the EU with Britain accounted
for seven of Britain’s top ten export markets
and six of the ten leading suppliers of goods
to Britain (see Table 12.4). In 1990 Germany
overtook the United States to become
Britain’s biggest overseas market; Germany is
also Britain’s largest single supplier. In 1994
it took 13 per cent of Britain’s exports and
supplied 15 per cent of its imports.
There have been a number of other
changes in the pattern of Britain s overseas
trade in recent years. Exports to Japan, which
is presently Britain’s tenth largest export
market, rose by 13 per cent in 1994. Japan
has steadily increased its share of Britain’s
imports and now accounts for 6 per cent. In
1994 there was also a sizeable increase—about
20 per cent—in Britain’s exports to other
expanding markets in the Asia-Pacific Rim.
Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea,
Taiwan and Thailand, together with the
People’s Republic of China and the
Philippines, all showed substantial growth in
exports from Britain in 1994.
INVISIBLE TRANSACTIONS
Transactions in invisible trade fall into three
main groups:
• internationally tradeable services;
172
OVERSEAS TRADE
• investment income on external assets; and
• non-commercial transfers.
Services range from banking, insurance
and stockbroking, tourism, and shipping and
aviation to specialist services such as
engineering consultancy, computer
programming and training. Financial services
make a major contribution to overseas
earnings: net overseas receipts from services
rendered and investment income were
£20,400 million in 1994, up from £15,500
million in 1993.
Earnings on external assets and liabilities
have rarely been in deficit; transfers,
however, have almost always been in deficit.
For invisible trade as a whole, the deficit of
general government is more than offset by
the substantial surplus of the private sector
(including public corporations), resulting in
an overall surplus. General government
transactions are relatively unimportant in
either the services or the investment income
accounts but they form the greater part of the
transfers account. In 1994 the private sector
had a surplus of £18,800 million on invisible
trade while government had a deficit of
£9,900 million (see Table 12.5).
Earnings from private sector services rose
in value by 4 per cent in 1994 to £39,000
million; debits, at £33,100 million, were
11 per cent higher than a year previously.
The surplus on private sector investment
income was £13,200 million in 1994, up from
£3,900 million a year earlier, partly as a
result of a large increase in net direct
investment earnings. The deficit on private
sector transfers was £260 million, while that
on government transfers was £5,100 million.
COMMERCIAL POLICY
Britain is an active member of the European
Union. It remains committed to the open
multilateral trading system and to the
further liberalisation of world trade. To
this end it has taken a leading part in the
activities of such organisations as GATT
and its successor the WTO, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD).
GATT/World Trade Organisation
The eighth and last GATT round—the
Uruguay Round—was launched in 1986 and
successfully concluded in 1993. It was the
largest-ever international trade negotiation
and will reduce tariffs on goods and liberalise
trade in services and agriculture. Creation of
the World Trade Organisation—which now
has 125 member states—has put the new

arrangements on a permanent institutional
footing. A GATT report has estimated that
annual world income will be boosted by at
least £330,000 million by 2005, as a result of
the Uruguay agreement.
The main features of the new agreement,
which is likely to be brought into force in
late 1995, are as follows:
• There will be overall tariff reductions
across all countries of about 40 per cent
(tariff reductions by the EU will average
over 33 per cent) and member states
have undertaken not to raise tariffs again
on 95 per cent of world trade.
• With the formation of the General
Agreement on Trade in Services, services
are to be brought within the framework
of GATT multilateral trade rules. Any
remaining restrictions on trade in serv ices
will be made transparent and non-
discriminatory.
• Agriculture will come fully under the
rules of multilateral trade for the first
time; there will be a 36 per cent
reduction in tariffs as well as substantial
cuts in subsidies.
• Agreed multilateral rules will govern
trade-related intellectual property rights,
providing protection for holders of
trademarks, patents, copyrights and
design rights.
• Trade in textiles, where restrictions on
imports have been allowed under the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA—see
p. 248) to balance the interests of
exporters and importers, will be
reintegrated into the rules of the \\ TO
over ten years.
Britain is now focusing on ensuring that
the multilateral trading system of the WTO
works properly in practice; it is also seeking
to make further progress, through the WTO,
in reducing external barriers to trade.
European Union
Austria, Finland and Sweden joined the
European Union on 1 January 1995. The
single European market ‘opened for business
on 1 January 1993, with the essential
legislation in place for the free movement of
goods, services, people and capital within the
EU. Member states are now concentrating on
ensuring that the market operates efficiently
and completing work in energy and
telecommunications liberalisation. Among the
changes from January 1993 were:
• the ending of routine customs clearance
of commercial goods at national frontiers
within the EU;
• the introduction of the right to trade
financial services throughout the EU on
the basis of a single home authorisation
‘passport’ (see p. 215); and
• deregulation of airlines, with national flag
carriers losing preferential treatment.
Special Trading Arrangements
The EU has association and co-operation
agreements with virtually all non-member
countries with a Mediterranean coastline, plus
Jordan; these give preferential access to EU
markets. Non-preferential co-operation
agreements have also been made with
countries in South Asia and Latin America,
as well as with the People’s Republic of
China, the Association of South East Asian
Nations, the Andean Pact and the Central
American states. Trade relations with the
developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean
and the Pacific are governed by the Lome
Convention, which gives these countries
tariff-free access, subject to certain
safeguards, to the EU for industrial and
agricultural products.
Tariff preference is also given to
developing countries under the Generalised
System of Preferences. This applies to
industrial products, including textiles and
certain (mainly processed) agricultural
products. The scheme concentrates benefits
on poorer producers and countries.
Europe Agreements are in place between
the EU and Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania,
such agreements have also been recently
signed with Slovenia and the Baltic states.
They are designed to facilitate closer political
and economic ties and the eventual creation
of a free trade area with a view to those
174
OVERSEAS TRADE
countries becoming full members of the EU.
A trade and economic co-operation agreement
has also been made with Albania and
partnership and co-operation agreements have
been concluded with Russia, Ukraine,
Belarus, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.
CONTROLS ON TRADE
With the completion of the single European
market, all routine internal border controls
and requirements were removed for trade in
EU goods between the members of the EU.
This has substantially cut travel times and
costs; for example, freight journey times by
road from Britain to Italy have been reduced
by up to 24 hours.
Import Controls
Individual national quantitative restrictions
are inconsistent with the single European
market and following the removal of internal
frontiers they have been largely abolished. A
system of Union-wide quotas is under
discussion between the European Commission
and member states. Quantitative restrictions
on textiles stem from the ME A, under which
there is a series of bilateral agreements. A
number of quantitative restrictions are also
maintained against non-WTO countries.
Imports of certain other goods are
prohibited or restricted in order to protect
human, animal or plant life or health. These
include firearms and ammunition; nuclear
materials; certain drugs; explosives;
endangered wildlife and derived products;
and certain agricultural, horticultural and
food products.
Export Controls
The great majority of British exports to
countries outside the EU are not subject to
any government control. Controls on certain
strategic goods are imposed for a variety of
reasons, including foreign policy and non¬
proliferation concerns, the need to comply
with international treaty commitments and the
operation of sanctions. The scope of these
controls is restricted to what is necessary to
meet these requirements. Most controls apply
on a worldwide basis. However, certain
sanctions and embargoes are applied against
specific countries as a result of agreement by
members of bodies such as the United Nations.
There are controls relating to the export
of conventional military equipment and
firearms as well as dual-use industrial goods
that can be used for civil and military
purposes. Most dual-use industrial goods are
allowed to move freely within the EU
without an export licence.
Controls on conventional weapons and
equipment for manufacture stem from an
agreement by members of the Co-ordinating
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls
(COCOM). Although this body was
disbanded in 1994, ex-members are
maintaining the controls in their present
form. Lists of dual-use related goods are
drawn up mainly under agreements of the
Australia Group, the Nuclear Suppliers
Group and the Missile Technology Control
Regime; Britain is a member of all three. The
aim is to help prevent the spread of chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons and missile
systems for their delivery.
GOVERNMENT SER\ ICES
The Government assists exporters by creating
economic conditions favourable to the export
trade and by providing practical help, advice
and financial support. This includes a wide
range of services and assistance to meet the
requirements of exporters, especially small
and medium-sized enterprises.
Export Promotion Services
Overseas Trade Services (OTS) comprises
the leading government departments engaged
in export promotion, including the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI),
the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO),
the Industry Department of the Welsh
Office, Scottish Trade International and the
Industrial Development Board of Northern
Ireland. There are over 2,000 staff
worldwide, based at the DTI in London, in
regional offices and Business Links (see
p. 208) around Britain, and at more than
200 diplomatic posts overseas.
175
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
OTS gathers and disseminates export
intelligence, helps in researching potential
markets, and supports firms participating
in trade fairs and missions. In 199-1—95
around £190 million was spent on support
for exporters.
In England the development of local
Business Links is making OTS more accessible
to potential users. The DTI is financing up
to 70 ‘export development counsellors’ in
Business Links to give advice to exporters and
outward investors at local business level.
OTS works closely with over 100 ‘export
promoters’ seconded from private industry, as
well as with the British Overseas Trade
Board (BOTB), the BOTB’s Area Advisory
Groups and with FCO posts abroad. The
BOTB’s aims are to:
• help guide the Government’s export
promotion efforts, including the provision
of export services; and
# provide advice on policy issues allecting
international trade and exports.
The BOTB’s Area Advisory Groups,
which are made up of business people with
expert knowledge of trade with particular
world markets, provide advice on the world’s
main trading areas. The Overseas Projects
Board advises on major project business
overseas and the Small Firms Committee on
matters relating to small businesses. Nearly
200 businessmen and women are involved in
the Board’s work.
OTS pays special attention to the
promotion of exports to its top priority areas
in Western Europe, North America, and
Japan and the fast-growing countries of the
Asia-Pacific Rim. These three areas contain
the world’s largest and richest markets, and
account for around four-fifths of Britain s
exports. Emerging markets in other areas,
such as Latin America, where some countries
have been achieving rapid growth rates, are
also being targeted.
The Government has set a target of
introducing 30,000 firms to new export markets
by the year 2000. It has also announced:
• an improved programme of trade fair and
mission support;
# a programme of ‘British Excellence fairs
in key markets;
• additional commercial staff abroad and
14 new overseas posts;
• export vouchers for small and medium¬
sized enterprises to help them buy
assistance at Business Links; and
• an ‘Export Challenge’ for trade
associations, to encourage them to
improve the international competitiveness
of the sectors they represent.
British Invisibles
British Invisibles is an organisation which
promotes the international activities of
financial institutions and business services. Its
role is to suggest and, where possible,
implement measures for boosting invisible
earnings in Britain and abroad. It also seeks
to increase aw areness of London as an
international financial centre and of the role
of the service sector in the British economy.
Export Insurance
ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department) is a government department,
responsible to the President of the Board of
Trade. It helps British firms overcome many
of the risks of selling and investing overseas.
ECGD supports British exporters of capital
goods and services sold on medium- and
long-term credit by:
• guaranteeing exporters and financing
banks against the risk of non-payment by
overseas buyers/borrowers;
• giving interest rate support to British
banks, allowing overseas borrowers access
to funds at fixed, often favourable, rates
of interest; and
• providing reinsurance to British private-
sector insurance companies covering
exports sold on short-term credit.
In order to encourage investment in less
developed countries, ECGD also insures
investment earnings against the main
political risks, such as war, expropriation
and restrictions on repatriation of profits.
Particular attention is paid to increasing
cover for exports to ECGD’s main markets,
such as Hong Kong, China, Indonesia,
South Africa and Malaysia. The Middle East
176
J
OVERSEAS TRADE
and East Asia are currently ECGD’s largest
sources of new business.
In the 1994 Budget the Government
announced measures to improve the
competitiveness of capital goods
exporters by increasing support
provided by ECGD. For instance,
average premium rates were cut by
10 per cent. ECGD’s rates have been
reduced by 25 per cent overall since
1992 and cover has been resumed for
more than 20 markets worldwide.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
The balance-of-payments statistics record
transactions between residents of Britain and
non-residents. The transactions are classified
into two groups: current account, and
transactions in Britain’s external assets and
liabilities, sometimes known as the capital
account. The current account records trade in
goods (visible trade) and services, including
finance, tourism and transport, transactions in
investment income, and transfers (invisible
trade). Capital transactions include inward
and outward investment, overseas transactions
by banks in Britain, external borrowing and
lending by residents in Britain and drawings
on and accruals to the official reserves.
Britain has no exchange controls; residents
are free to acquire foreign currency for any
purpose, including direct and portfolio
investment overseas. There are also no
controls on the lending of sterling abroad and
non-residents may acquire sterling for any
purpose. Gold may be freely bought and
sold. Exchange controls were abolished in
1979, and Britain meets in full its obligations
on capital movements under an OECD code
and under EC directives.
The current account has been in deficit
since 1986, although it fell markedly between
1993 and 1994 from £11,000 million to £1,700
million (see Table 12.6). Since 1983 Britain has
had a deficit on visible trade; however, it has
run a surplus on trade in invisibles in all but
five years since 1955. At £10,600 million in
1994, the deficit on visible trade was £2,800
million less than in the previous year. The
invisibles surplus increased from £2,300 million
to £8,900 million between 1993 and 1994. The
surplus on services fell by £1,900 million; that
on investment income increased by £8,600
million; and the deficit on transfers was, at
£5,400 million, virtually the same as in 1993.
Inward and Outward Investment
The Government welcomes both outward and
inward investment.1 Outward investment
helps to develop markets for British exports
while providing earnings in the form of
investment income. Inward investment is
'A distinction needs to be made between capital flows and capital
holdings. Flows comprise transactions resulting in a change of
ownership of financial assets and liabilities between British
residents and non-residents, while holdings are measured by the
total values of British external assets and liabilities at the end of
the year. Income earned on external assets and liabilities is dealt
with in the section on invisibles.

expansions to existing investments. Inward
investment is playing an increasingly
important role in Britain’s economy, with
overseas firms providing 18 per cent of all
manufacturing jobs, 24 per cent of net
output, 32 per cent of manufacturing
investment and about 40 per cent of
manufacturing exports. At present Britain has
around 40 per cent of IjS and Japanese
investment in the EU.
At the end of 1994 the stock of inward
direct investment (investment in branches,
subsidiaries and associated companies which
gives the investor an effective role in their
management) was £139,700 million, compared
with £132,900 million in 1993. The stock of
direct investment overseas by British
residents was £183,300 million at the end of
1994, compared with £171,000 million in
1993. The inflow of portfolio investment into
Britain amounted to £31,800 million in 1994
(£46,800 million in 1993); outward portfolio
investment was reduced by £18,600 million
in 1994 (compared with a rise of £84,500
million in 1993). An analysis of transactions
in Britain’s external assets and liabilities for
1992-94 is given in Table 12.7.
Britain’s identified external assets at the
end of 1994 exceeded liabilities by £17,700
million, compared with £13,200 million a
vear earlier. Net assets of the private sector
and public corporations amounted to
£37,300 million and net liabilities of general
government to £19,600 million.
At the end of 1993, 84 per cent of
outward direct investment was in developed
countries, with 35 per cent in the United
States and 32 per cent in the EU. Investment J
from developed countries accounted for 96
per cent of overseas direct investment in
Britain: 40 per cent originated in the United
States and 31 per cent in the EU.

Britain has a higher proportion of the adult population in work—70 per
cent—than any other major EU country. The labour market has changed
considerably in recent years as a result of the move away from full-time to
part-time employment, the growing proportion of women in the workforce
and higher self-employment. Nearly three-quarters of employees now work in
the service sector, compared with around one-fifth in manufacturing.
Industrial relations have been transformed, and the number of working days
lost in 1994 was the lowest on record.
PATTERNS OF EMPLOYMENT
The total workforce in 1995 was around 28
million. The workforce in employment in
June 1995 totalled 25.7 million (see Table
13.1), of whom 21.9 million (11 million men
and over 10.8 million women) were classed as
employees in employment. Employment is
recovering following the decline as a result of
the recession of the early 1990s. Between
March 1993 (the most recent employment
trough) and March 1995 the workforce in
employment increased by 360,000.
Nearly two-thirds of women aged 15-64
in Britain are in work, compared with
between a third and a half in most other
European countries, and only Sweden and
Denmark have a higher proportion of
women in work. Many employers have
developed policies to help women to return

to the labour market. The Government is
encouraging voluntary action b} emplo} ers to
increase the employment opportunities for
women. It has joined the ‘Opportunity 2000'
campaign and in 1994 launched a new
regional initiative in England, Fair Pla\ for
Women’ (see p. 37).
The long-term trend has been for a fall in
full-time employment and a growth in
part-time employment (see diagram above).
Since 1984 part-time employment in Great
Britain has risen by 1.3 million to 6.1 million
in spring 1995: 5 million women and
1.1 million men. About 44 per cent of
women in employment were w orking
part-time, compared with 8 per cent ot men.
About 1.3 million people had two or more
jobs. ‘Teleworking’—people working from
home using information technology is
becoming more widespread, especial!) in
journalism, consultancy and computer
programming. About 6 per cent of businesses
use teleworking extensively.
Self-employment is increasing again,
following a decline during the recession.
About 3.3 million people are self-employed
in Britain, 19 per cent more than in 1985.
The sectors with the highest concentrations
of self-employed people are agriculture
and construction.
Government Policy
The Government has taken a number of
steps to change the labour market, with the
aim of creating an economic climate in which
business can flourish and create more jobs.
These include:
• increasing the flexibility of the labour
market, for example, encouraging the
adoption of flexible working patterns for
more employees;
180
EMPLOYMENT
• removing burdens on employers and
■ workers, including regulatory barriers
which hinder recruitment; and
• encouraging better training, especially
■ through employer-led Training and
Enterprise Councils and, in Scotland,
| Local Enterprise Companies (see
p. 183).
The Government supports a social
dimension to the European Union (see
p. 112) which gives priority to the creation
and development of jobs and takes into
i account the different employment patterns
I and practices in member states.
Employment by Sector
! As in other industrialised countries, there has
been a marked shift in jobs from
manufacturing to service industries (see Table
13.2). Between 1955 and 1995 the proportion
of employees in employment engaged in
service industries more than doubled, to
nearly 76 per cent. In June 1995, 16.1 million
people were employed in services in Great
Britain, about 2 million more than in 1985
(see Table 13.3). Business activities,
education, medical services, distribution, and
hotels and catering experienced significant
increases. Employment in some services,
however, particularly postal services and
telecommunications, has fallen.
Most other sectors—manufacturing,
construction, agriculture, and mining, energy
and water supply—have experienced lower
levels of employment, although there are
indications that the decline in
manufacturing employment may have halted.
Nevertheless, by 1995 manufacturing
accounted for 18 per cent of employees in
employment, compared with 42 per cent in
1955. Traditional manufacturing industries,
such as steel and shipbuilding, have
recorded particularly large falls in
employment. In June 1995 employment in
the main manufacturing sectors in Great
Britain included:
• 686,000 employees in non-metallic
mineral products, metal and metal
products;
• 469,000 in paper, pulp, printing,
publishing and recording media;
• 445,000 in electrical and optical
equipment;
• 429,000 in food products, beverages and
tobacco; and
• 381,000 in clothing, textiles, leather and
leather products.
Occupational Changes
There has been a gradual move away from
manual occupations towards non-manual
occupations, which now account for nearly
three-fifths of jobs in Great Britain. Self-
employment is highest in craft and related
occupations (29 per cent of those in this
sector in Great Britain in spring 1995),
followed by managers and administrators
(20 per cent).

Unemployment
Unemployment in Britain—as measured by
the number of people claiming
unemployment-related benefits and adjusted
for seasonal variation—has fallen by over
600,000 since the end of 1992 and the level of
unemployment is below the EU average. 1 he
rates of long-term, youth and female
unemployment are well below those in most
other EU countries. Unemployment began to
fall at an earlier stage than in previous
economic cycles, reflecting a number of
factors, including an improvement in the
functioning of the labour market (following
measures such as deregulation), more
young people staying on in education, and
greater efficiency in the placing of
unemployed people into work by the
Employment Service. In August 1995
claimant unemployment totalled 2.3 million,
8.2 per cent of the workforce. It ranged from
6.4 per cent in East Anglia to 11.6 per cent in
Northern Ireland.
The Government has introduced a wide
range of measures to help combat
unemployment. In 1995—96 about 1.5 million
opportunities on employment and training
schemes are being offered to help
unemployed people. The November 1994
Budget included a major £325 million package
of measures targeted on helping the long-term
unemployed back to work. Among the
measures are:
• the extension to 1998 of the Community
Action programme, which provides about
40,000 opportunities a year for people to
do voluntary work of benefit to the
community on a part-time basis while
they actively look for work;
• a doubling to 40,000 of the number of
places on the Work Trials scheme,
which enables employers to take on
unemployed people for up to three weeks
on a trial basis;
• the extension throughout Great Britain o
the Jobfinder’s Grant, available to those
out of work for over two years to help
fund their costs on returning to work;
182
EMPLOYMENT
• a new national programme, ‘Workwise
and 1-2-1’ providing 133,000 places in
1995-96, designed to provide intensive
help with looking for jobs for those aged
18 to 24 who have been unemployed for
over a year; and
• further pilot Workstart schemes, under
which employers receive a financial
incentive for recruiting long-term
unemployed people.
A new Jobseeker’s Allowance (see p. 422),
expected to be introduced in October 1996,
will replace unemployment benefit and
income support for unemployed people. It is
intended to improve the operation of the
labour market by helping people in their
search for work. To receive the allowance
each unemployed person will have to
complete a jobseeker’s agreement, which will
include the steps agreed by the jobseeker to
be taken to find work.
TRAINING, EDUCATION AND
ENTERPRISE
Employers in Britain spend over £20,000
million a year on employee training and
development. The Government funds a
number of training, enterprise and vocational
education programmes. Its training strategy is
designed to increase Britain’s prosperity by
stimulating enterprise and developing
excellence in skills. Individuals are
encouraged to train by employers through a
number of government initiatives such as
Investors in People (see p. 184) and National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs, see p. 442),
and by means of tax reliefs and loan schemes.
Britain is acknowledged as an innovative
world leader in open and flexible learning, for
example, through the Open University.
Training and Enterprise Councils
There are 81 Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) in England and Wales.
They are independent companies run by local
business leaders. They are accountable to
Government through their contracts and are
subject to regular monitoring by the
Government Offices for the Regions.
The objective of TECs is to develop the
skilled workforce necessary for sustaining
economic growth and prosperity within their
area. Their special focus is to strengthen the
skill base and assist local enterprise to
expand and compete effectively. As well as
managing the provision of training and
enterprise programmes previously run by the
Government, TECs promote the importance
of training as a business strategy—in
particular through the Investors in People
standard—and foster education-business links.
For 1995-96, £1,434 million is being
provided by the Department for Education
and Employment to TECs in England to
deliver its programmes. TECs also contract
with other government departments, in
particular the Department of Trade and
Industry, to deliver enterprise programmes
(see Chapter 14) and can compete for
contracts under the Government’s Single
Regeneration Budget (see p. 345).
Local Enterprise Companies
A separate network of 22 Local Enterprise
Companies (LECs) exists in Scotland. These
have wider-ranging responsibilities than the
TECs, covering economic development and
environmental improvement. LECs operate
the same major training programmes as
TECs, but, unlike them, have no
responsibility for work-related further
education. They run under the supervision of
the two enterprise bodies: Scottish Enterprise
and Highlands and Islands Enterprise
(see p. 209).
Industry Training Organisations
Industry Training Organisations (ITOs) act
as the focal point for training matters in their
particular sector of industry, commerce or
public service. Their role is to ensure that
the skills needs of their sectors are being met
and that occupational standards are being
established and maintained for key
occupations. There are over 120 independent
ITOs, covering sectors employing about 85
per cent of the civilian workforce. The
National Council of Industry Training
Organisations, a voluntary body set up to
183
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
represent the interests of ITOs, aims to
improve their effectiveness, for example, by
encouraging good practice.
National Targets for Education and
Training
The National Targets for Education and
Training were launched by the Confederation
of British Industry in 1991 and were
supported by over 100 national and local
organisations, including all TECs, LECs
and ITOs, and other major education, training
and employer bodies. The principal aim of the
targets is to improve Britain’s international
competitiveness by raising standards and
attainment levels in education and training
through ensuring that:
• all employers invest in employee
development to achieve business success;
• evervone has access to education and
training opportunities, leading to
recognised qualifications which meet their
needs and aspirations; and
• all education and training develops self-
reliance, flexibility and breadth, through
fostering competence in core skills.
The Government supports the targets and
in 1993 established the independent National
Advisory Council for Education and Training
Targets (NACETT) to monitor progress
towards them; a parallel body, the Advisory
Scottish Council for Education and Training
Targets, operates in Scotland.
The targets cover both young people and
the workforce as a whole. Following a review
bv NACETT, new, more challenging targets
were set in May 1995, relating to the year 2000.
The ‘Foundation Learning’ targets are that:
• by the age of 19, 85 per cent of young
people should achieve Five GCSEs at
grade C or above, an intermediate GNVQ_
or NVQ. level 2;1
• 75 per cent of young people should
achieve level 2 competence in
communication, numeracy and information
technology by the age of 19, with 35 per
cent reaching level 3 by the age of 21; and
'For information on General National \ ocational Qualifications
(GNVQs) and examinations, see Chapter 26.
• by 21, 60 per cent of young people
should achieve two GCE A levels, an
Advanced GNVQ_or NVQ_ level 3.
The ‘Lifetime’ targets are that:
• 60 per cent of the workforce should
attain NVQ_ level 3, an Advanced GNVQ.
or two GCE A levels;
• 30 per cent of the workforce should have
a vocational, professional, management or
academic qualification at N\ Q_ level 4 or
above; and
• 70 per cent of organisations employing
200 or more people and 35 per cent of
those employing 50 or more should be
recognised as Investors in People.
Separate targets, set within the framework
of the national targets, are in force in
Scotland.
Training for Work
The Government’s Training for Work
programme has the objective of helping long¬
term unemployed adults to find jobs through
training and work experience. Training is
carried out by training providers under
contract with the local TEC or LEC. Each |
new trainee receives an individually adapted
package of training and/or structured work
activities. The programme is being reformed
during 1995-96 to become more efficient and
to improve the proportion of people obtaining
a job when leaving the programme, to 50 per
cent by 1997-98. About 112,000 places are
available in Great Britain in 1995—96, when
the programme is expected to help up to
270,000 people.
Investors in People
Investors in People is the main initiative in
support of employers’ investment in people. 11
is based on a rigorous national standard whicl
helps companies to improve their performano
by linking the training and development of al
employees directly to the achievement of
business objectives. TECs and LECs prov ide
advice and information to help organisations
to work towards the standard. By mid-1995
nearly 2,100 had achieved the Investors in
People standard, and over 18,900 had made a
EMPLOYMENT
formal commitment to work towards it. Over
80 per cent of employers surveyed who had
achieved the standard believed that this had
improved the quality of their workforce, while
three-quarters of employers involved had
changed their training practices.
National Training Awards
The National Training Awards are an annual
competition designed to promote good training
practice by example, rewarding companies
which have carried out exceptionally effective
training. In 1994 around 80 corporate awards
and 20 individual awards were presented to
national winners, who were selected from
about 250 regional winners.
Career Development Loans
People who live, or intend to undertake
vucational training, in Great Britain can apply
to one of four major banks for a Career
Development Loan. Deferred repayment loans
of £200 to £8,000 can help to pay for
vocational courses lasting up to tw o years, or
tw o years of a longer course. More than 67,000
people have borrowed over £192 million
through the programme to pay for training.
Small Firms Training Loans
Small Firms Training Loans were introduced
in June 1994. The programme helps firms
with 50 or fewer employees to meet a range
of training-related expenses, including
training consultancy. Loans of between £500
and £125,000 are available and repayments
can be deferred for up to 13 months.
Skills for Small Businesses
In April 1995 Skills for Small Businesses, a
three-year initiative, was introduced. It will
help firms w ith fewer than 50 employees to
provide modern skills training. It is
designed to help companies by training
selected key workers—one per company—
who would then pass on their knowledge and
expertise to other employees. Under the
£63 million programme run by TECs, there
" ill be provision for training of up to
24,000 key employees. A similar programme
will be run in Scotland.
Improving the Training Market
The Improving the Training Market
programme covers a range of activities
funded by the Department for Education
and Employment aimed at improving the
quality, impact and cost-effectiveness of
vocational education and training. Priority is
being given to encouraging investment by
individuals in learning, supporting the
implementation of new qualifications and
developing frameworks for the new Modern
Apprenticeships (see below).
Training for Young People
The Government is committed to ensuring
that high-quality further education or training
is available for all young people who can
benefit from it. All those aged 16 or 17 who
are not in full-time education, a job or a
Modern Apprenticeship are guaranteed the
offer of a suitable training opportunity.
The objectives of the two main youth
programmes—Modern Apprenticeships and
Youth Training—are to:
• provide participants with training leading
to vocational qualifications at NVQ/SVC£
levels 2 and 3 or above (see p. 442) and
with broad-based skills necessary to
become flexible and self-reliant
employees; and
• to meet the skill needs of the national
and local economies.
The delivery of training is arranged
through TECs and LECs.
Modern Apprenticeships
In 1993 the Government announced its
intention to bring in ‘Modern
Apprenticeships’. Prototype schemes were
introduced in September 1994 in 17 sectors
such as chemicals, engineering and
construction. The number was extended to
around 50 when Modern Apprenticeships
became fully operational in September 1995.
Modern Apprenticeships are designed to
185
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
build on the best features of existing
apprenticeships and to increase significantly
the number of young people trained to
technician, supervisory and equivalent levels.
Accelerated Modern Apprenticeships have
been developed alongside Modern
Apprenticeships and started in September
1995. They will provide high-level training
for school- and college-leavers.
Youth Credits
Youth Credits are intended to offer young
people more individual choice and a greater
sense of personal responsibility when buying
training. Each credit has a financial value and
can be presented to an employer or training
provider in exchange for training. In England
16- and 17-year-old school- and college-
leavers are eligible to obtain access to Youth
Training and Modern Apprenticeships
through Youth Credits. Youth Credits will be
available to all young people in Wales from
April 1996. Under Skillseekers, the
equivalent scheme in Scotland, all young
people leaving full-time education will be
eligible for a Youth Credit by 1996.
Education Initiatives
A major government objective is to raise the
motivation and attainment of young people to
achieve their full potential and develop the
skills needed by the economy. This requires
close working relationships between industrv
and education. Several education initiatives
are being implemented, including Education
Business Partnerships, Compacts and the
National Record of Achievement. Details are
given in Chapter 26.
Vocational Qualifications
The proportion of the workforce with
qualifications, gained either in school or further
education, is growing. Between 1984 and 1994
it rose from 63 per cent to 81 per cent.
The National Council for Vocational
Qualifications (NCVQ), established in 1986,
has been charged with reforming and
rationalising vocational qualifications into a
coherent framework. The NCVQ_has
developed new National Vocational
Qualifications in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland (see p. 442). In Scotland
the Scottish Vocational Education Council
(SCOTVEC) has developed parallel Scottish
Vocational Qualifications (SVQs).
NVQs and SVQ_s are designed for people
in the workplace. They are job-specific, based
on national standards of competence set b)
industry and are assessed in the workplace.
There are five levels within the NVQ_and
SVQ_framework (see p. 442). NVQs and
SVQ_s at levels 1 to 5 to cover at least 90 per
cent of the employed workforce are expected
to be in place by the end of 1995. The 1994
White Paper on competitiveness (see p. 200) !
announced proposals to improve the quality
and take-up of NVQs/SVQs- All NVQs/SVQs
will be reviewed and updated by March 1998.
Northern Ireland
The Training and Employment Agency, an
executive agency within the Department of
Economic Development, has primary
responsibility for training and employment
services. Its overall aim is to assist economic
development and help people to find work
through training and employment services
delivered on the basis of equality of
opportunity. The Agency has encouraged eacl
main sector of industry to form a sector
representative body to advise on employers
training needs and to develop sectoral traimn]
strategies. In addition, the Agency supports
company training through its Company
Development Programme and encourages
management development by providing an
extensive range of training programmes and
seminars for existing and future managers.
Northern Ireland has its own range of
training and employment programmes for
people seeking work. The Agency introducei
a new Jobskills Programme in April 1995. It
is designed to raise the quality of training
available to school-leavers and unemployed
adults, leading to greater achievement of
NVQs. In order to combat the high level of
long-term unemployment in Northern
Ireland, the Agency is running a pilot
Community Work Programme which
enables long-term unemployed adults to
186
EMPLOYMENT
undertake work of benefit to the community
for a period of three years.
RECRUITMENT AND JOB-FINDING
There are a variety of ways in which people
can find jobs. In winter 1993-94, according to
the Labour Force Survey, the main methods
used by people who had found their current
job in the previous three months were:
• hearing from someone else who worked
there (31 per cent);
• replying to advertisements (25 per cent);
• direct approaches to employers (16 per
cent); and
• visiting a Jobcentre (9 per cent).
Government Employment Services
The Government provides a range of services
to jobseekers through the Employment
Service, an executive agency within the
Department for Education and Employment.
These include:
• a network of local offices, at w hich people
can find details of job opportunities;
• advice and guidance so that people can
find the best route back into employment,
for example, by training; and
• a range of special programmes.
The Employment Service has over 1,100
Jobcentres and unemployment benefit offices,
and employs about 42,000 staff. Jobcentres
are being integrated with the benefit offices
to provide a comprehensive service to
unemployed people. By mid-1995 about 970
integrated offices had been established. In
1994—95 the Employment Service placed
nearly 1.9 million unemployed people into jobs
and conducted 8.9 million advisory interviews
to help people find appropriate work or places
on employment and training programmes. A
review of the Employment Service’s functions
has been carried out to ensure that it is
organised as effectively as possible and to see
whether any functions could be undertaken in
the private sector.
The Jobseeker’s Charter contains
provisions governing the standard of service
to users. These include provisions on the
speed of service, and ensuring that vacancies
on display boards at offices are up to date
and are available, and that those entitled to
benefit receive the correct payments promptly.
The Employment Service is an active
participant in the European
Employment Services Network
(EURES). EURES is a partnership
between the employment services in
the member states of the European
Economic Area. It facilitates the
circulation of vacancies in member
states through a computer network.
Advisory Services
Through the main Jobcentre services,
unemployed people have access to vacancies,
employment advice and training
opportunities. Advisers provide unemployed
people with information on employment and
training opportunities available locally. New
Client Advisers interview newly unemployed
people to check their eligibility for benefit.
Together with the unemployed person, they
agree a ‘Back to Work Plan’, which sets out
specific courses of action to improve the
prospects of finding a job. Thereafter
unemployed people are required to attend a
Restart advisory interview every six months.
Restart interviews are intended to offer help
and advice to unemployed people while they
are on the unemployment register.
The Service has a wide variety of
programmes, including several new ones
launched in April 1995. Programmes to help
the long-term unemployed include:
• Jobclubs, where participants are given
training and advice in job-hunting skills
and have access to facilities to help an
intensive job search;
• Restart courses, designed to rebuild self-
confidence and motivation, and including
help with job-hunting skills; and
• Jobplan workshops, which are designed
to enable those unemployed for a year to
assess their skills, qualities and training
needs, and to act as an introduction to
future job and training options.

Help for People with Disabilities
Most disabled people assisted by the
Employment Service are helped through its
‘mainstream’ services, and have priority access
to most of the main programmes for
unemployed people. Services for people with
disabilities who need more specialist help to
get or keep a job are available through
Disability Employment Advisers based in
Jobcentres. The advisers are members of local
integrated specialist teams—Placing
Assessment and Counselling Teams. They are
supported by nine regional Ability
Development Centres. The teams also work
with local employers to encourage them to
recruit and retain disabled people.
Access to Work, a programme to help
people with disabilities to overcome barriers to
employment, was introduced in June 1994,
replacing help formerly available under a
series of different initiatives. It offers flexible
assistance to address a greater range of
disabilities and to enable more people to
be helped.
Through the Supported Employment
Programme, the Employment Service
provides employment opportunities for people
with severe disabilities who are unable to
obtain or retain work in open employment.
Around 21,000 opportunities are provided
through this programme.
Employment Agencies
There are many private employment agencies,
including several large firms with many
branches. The total value of the market has
been estimated at about £8,000 million a year.
The main trade body for the employment
agency industry is the Federation of
Recruitment and Employment Services, which
regulates the activities of its members by
means of a Code of Good Recruitment Practice
and by specialist section codes of practice.
The law governing employment agencies is
less restrictive than that of most other EU
countries. Under the Deregulation and
Contracting Out Act 1994 (see p. 202), the
licensing of employment agencies was
abolished in January 1995. The Act contains
powers to prohibit people from operating
agencies when necessary. Agencies have to
comply with statutory standards of conduct.
This includes a general prohibition on
charging fees to jobseekers, although there
are conditional exceptions for entertainment
and modelling agencies.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
EMPLOYMENT
Employment Rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For
example, most employees have a right to a
written statement setting out details of the
main conditions, including pay, hours of
work and holidays.
Employees with the necessary period of
continuous employment with their employer
(two years) are entitled to lump-sum
redundancy payments if their jobs cease to
exist (for example, because of technological
improvements or a fall in demand) and their
employers cannot offer suitable alternative
work. Where employers are insolvent,
redundancy payments are met directly from
the National Insurance fund.
Many employment rights have long
applied to part-time workers. In
February 1995 the Government
introduced new regulations giving
part-time employees entitlement to
all the same statutory employment
rights as full-time employees by
removing the distinctions in
qualifying conditions between full¬
time employees and part-time
employees (those working between
8 and 16 hours a week).
Minimum periods of notice when
employment is to be terminated are laid
down for both employers and employees.
Most employees who believe they have been
unfairly dismissed have the right to
complain to an industrial tribunal, provided
they have the necessary qualifying period of
employment. If the complaint is upheld, the
tribunal may make an order for
re-employment or award compensation.
188
EMPLOYMENT
New maternity rights were established by
le Trade Union Reform and Employment
Lights Act 1993 and took effect in October
994. They implemented an EC directive and
oincided with increases in maternity pay. All
iregnant employees, regardless of length of
ervice, have the right to 14 weeks’ statutory
aaternity leave with all their non-wage
ontractual benefits maintained, and protection
gainst dismissal because of pregnancy.
Legislation forbids any employment of
hildren under 13 years of age, and
mployment in any industrial undertaking of
Eildren who have not reached the statutory
ninimum school-leaving age, with some
:xceptions for family undertakings.
iqual Opportunities
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it
generally unlawful to discriminate on grounds
)f colour, race, nationality (including
ntizenship) or ethnic or national origin, in
employment, training and related matters. The
Department for Education and Employment
aperates a nationwide Race Relations
Employment Advisory Service. Its objective is
to promote those Government policies aimed
at combating racial discrimination in
employment and promoting fair treatment
and equality of opportunity in employment.
Advisers provide employers with advice and
practical help in developing and implementing
effective equal opportunity strategies.
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, as
amended, makes it generally unlawful in
Great Britain to discriminate on grounds of
sex or marital status when recruiting,
training, promoting, dismissing or retiring
staff. The Equal Pay Act 1970 makes it
generally unlawful to discriminate between
men and women in pay and other terms and
conditions of employment. The Act was
significantly extended in 1984 to meet EU
requirements by providing for equal pay for
work of equal value.
Practical advice to employers and others
on the best arrangements for implementing
equal opportunities policies in Great Britain
is given in codes of practice from the
Commission for Racial Equality and from the
Equal Opportunities Commission (see p. 37),
while the Department for Education and
Employment has also published practical
guidance to employers on how to make
equal opportunities an integral part of
management practice.
New rights for disabled people in
employment in Great Britain are
contained in the Disability
Discrimination Act (see p. 408),
passed in 1995. A new right for
disabled people of non-discrimination
in the labour market is introduced.
Employers with 20 or more employees
will have a duty not to treat a
disabled person less favourably than
other workers unless there are
justifiable reasons, and a duty to
make a reasonable adjustment to the
workplace or working arrangements
where this would help overcome the
practical effects of a disability. A
Code of Practice is planned to give
guidance on the new requirements
and practical advice to employers.
Similar legislation to that in Great Britain
on equal pay and sex discrimination applies
in Northern Ireland; there is at present no
legislation on race relations, but legislation is
to be introduced. Discrimination in
employment on grounds of religious belief or
political opinion is unlawful. The Fair
Employment Commission (see p. 15) has the
task of promoting equality of opportunity and
investigating employment practices, with
powers to issue legally enforceable directions.
Industrial Tribunals
Industrial tribunals have jurisdiction over
complaints on a range of employment rights
including unfair dismissal, redundancy pay,
equal pay, and sex and race discrimination.
They dealt with about 28,000 cases in
1994-95 and the number of cases continues
to grow steadily. In December 1994 the
Government issued a Green Paper containing
proposals to promote the voluntary settlement
of disputes and improve the tribunal system,
so reducing delays and raising the standards
of service.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Earnings
According to the official New Earnings
Survey, the average weekly earnings,
unaffected by absence and including overtime
payments, in Great Britain in April 1995 of
full-time employees on adult rates were £336.
Earnings were higher for non-manual
employees (£372) than for manual employees
(£272). Managerial and professional groups are
the highest paid. The sectors with the highest
average weekly earnings were mining and
quarrying (£444) and financial services (£430).
Overtime and other additional payments
are particularly important for manual
employees, for whom such additional
payments represented over one-fifth of
earnings. About 50 per cent of manual
employees and 18 per cent of non-manual
employees received overtime payments.
In the year to July 1995 the underlying
average increase in earnings in Great Britain
was about 3.25 per cent.
Fringe Benefits
A variety of fringe benefits are used by
employers to provide additional rewards to
their employees, including schemes to
encourage employee financial participation in
their companies, pension schemes, private
medical insurance, subsidised meals, company
cars and childcare schemes.
Many employees are covered by pension
schemes provided by their employers. Such
benefits are more usual among clerical and
professional employees than among manual
workers. Nearly 11 million people in Britain
are members of occupational schemes.
Company cars are provided for employees
in a wide variety of circumstances. It is
estimated that around 1.7 million people have
a company car and around half of these
receive fuel for private motoring in their cars.
The Government has introduced tax
reliefs to encourage employers to set up
financial participation schemes, and give
employees a direct financial stake in the
business they work for.
Profit-related pay (PRP) schemes link part
of pay to changes in a business’s profits. By
the end of March 1995 nearly 9,500 PRP
schemes were registered with the Inland li
Revenue, covering about 2.4 million people.
Employee share schemes allow employees to H
receive low-cost or free shares from their io
employer without paying income tax. By the le
end of March 1993 about 3.1 million n
employees had benefited from all-employee ;e
profit sharing and Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) ic
share option schemes.
A committee of inquiry chaired by Sir
Richard Greenbury examined
executive pay and other benefits, such
as share options, and its report, issued
in July 1995, contained guidelines for
companies. Following the report, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer
announced changes to the tax
treatment of executive share options
so that gains from exercising options
would be taxable as income rather
than as a capital gain.
Hours of Work
Most full-time employees have a basic working
week of between 34 and 40 hours, and work ajj
five-day week. When overtime is taken into
account, average weekly hours worked in
Great Britain in April 1995 were 41.9 for men
and 37.6 for women. Average hours worked bj
full-time and part-time employees and the
self-employed were 39.9 for men and 26.9 for
women in spring 1995. Hours worked tended
to be longest in agriculture, construction and
transport and communications, and shortest in
most service industries. More men than
women work overtime, and those in manual
occupations generally work more overtime
than employees in non-manual jobs. Flexible
working hours were worked by about 15 per
cent of female and 10 per cent of male full¬
time employees in Britain in spring 1994.
In general, there are no limits on hours
worked by adults except in a few occupations
(such as for drivers of goods and public
service vehicles).
The Government is challenging in the
European Court a draft EC directive which
includes proposals for a maximum 48-hour
working week.
190
EMPLOYMENT
lolidays with Pay
"here are no general statutory entitlements to
olidays, and holiday entitlements are
etermined by negotiation. Holiday
ntitlements (excluding public holidays)
enerally provide for at least four weeks’ paid
i oliday a year. Non-manual workers tend to
ave longer holidays than manual workers,
foliday entitlements may also be dependent
pon length of service.
NDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
"he structure of industrial relations in Britain
las been established mainly on a voluntary
tasis. The system is based chiefly on the
irganisation of employees and employers into
rade unions and employers’ associations, and
m freely conducted negotiations at all levels.
Trends in Bargaining and Pay
There has been a considerable reduction in
ihe proportion of employees and workplaces
vhere pay is determined by collective
)argaining. Around 48 per cent of employees
n employment in Great Britain work in firms
vhere trade unions negotiate on pay and
:onditions of employment. Private sector
:mployees are much less likely to be covered
iy collective bargaining than are public sector
imployees.
Where agreements in the private sector are
ndustry-wide, they are often supplemented
)y local agreements in companies or factories
plant bargaining). Where there is no
:ollective bargaining, pay is usually
determined by management at local level.
Most medium and large employers make
>ome use of performance-related pay systems
iuch as merit pay, financial participation (see
p. 190) and individual payment by results.
Private sector organisations are more likely to
ase performance-related pay than public
sector bodies.
The Government is committed to the
further development of performance-related
pay in the public sector as part of its wider
objectives for improving the quality of the
public services as set out in the Citizen’s
Charter (see p. 66). Performance-related pay
is being extended in areas such as the Civil
Service and education. Greater pay flexibility
is also being encouraged in other ways, such
as the delegation of pay determination to self-
governing trusts in the National Health
Service and to grant-maintained schools; from
April 1996 all government departments and
agencies will have responsibility for their own
pay negotiations of staff below senior levels.
‘New-style’ agreements, often associated
with overseas-owned companies, have
become more widespread. Features normally
include flexibility in working practices,
recognition of a single union for all of a
company’s employees and ‘single status’,
involving the elimination of the traditional
distinction between managers, supervisors
and other employees.
Employee Involvement
Employers practise a wide variety of
methods of informing and consulting their
employees, not only through committees
but also through direct communication
between management and employees. These
methods include:
• employee bulletins and reports;
• briefing systems;
• quality circles;
• financial participation schemes; and
• attitude surveys.
The Government is opposed to the EU’s
proposals for statutory requirements for
multinational employers to set up European
works councils or other agreements providing
for the transnational information and
consultation of employees. It believes that
companies should be free to develop
employee involvement arrangements which
are appropriate to their own circumstances
and the needs of their employees.
Trade Unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. They are widely recognised by
employers in the public sector and in large
firms and establishments. As well as
negotiating pay and other terms and
191
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
conditions of employment with employers,
they provide benefits and services such as
educational facilities, financial services, legal
advice and aid in work-related cases. In
recent years many unions have extended
considerably the range of services for members.
At the end of 1993 there were 8.7 million
trade union members in Britain, the lowest
number since 1946. About 60 per cent of
union members were male and 40 per cent
female. The decline reflects the moves away
from manufacturing and public services, both
of which have a relatively high level of
membership, and the growth in part-time
employment. Mergers have resulted in a fall
in the number of unions, and several unions
are discussing possible mergers.
Unison, with about 1.5 million members,
is the biggest union in Britain. It was formed
in 1993 from a merger of three unions: the
Confederation of Health Service Employees,
the National Union of Public Employees and
the National and Local Government Officers’
Association. Other unions with over 500,000
members are:
• the Transport and General Workers
Union (with 949,000 members);
• the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union (835,000);
• GMB (809,000)—a general union with
members in a range of public and private
sector industries; and
• Manufacturing Science and Finance
Union (516,000).
At the end of 1994 there were 267 trade
unions on the list maintained by the
Certification Officer, who, among other
duties, is responsible for certifying the
independence of trade unions. To be eligible
for entry on the list a trade union must
show that it consists wholly or mainly of
workers and that its principal purposes
include the regulation of relations between
workers and employers or between workers
and employers’ associations.
Trade union organisation varies widely,
but there is usually a national executive
council or committee. Many unions also have
regional and district organisations, while local
branches cover one or more workplaces.
Elected workplace representatives are often c
called ‘shop stewards’. Where two or more t
unions have members in the same workplace, (
shop stewards’ committees may be formed to
discuss matters of common concern. t
Trades Union Congress \ 1
In Britain the national body of the trade
union movement is the Trades Union
Congress (TUC), founded in 1868. Its
affiliated membership comprises 68 trade
unions, which together represent some 6.9
million people, or about 80 per cent of all
trade unionists in Britain.
The TUC’s objectives are to promote the
interests of its affiliated organisations and to
improve the economic and social conditions
of working people. It deals with all general
questions which concern trade unions, both
nationally and internationally, and provides a
forum in which affiliated unions can
collectively determine policy. There are six
TUC regional councils for England and a
Wales Trades Union Council. The annual
Congress meets in September to discuss
matters of concern to trade unionists. A
General Council represents the TUC
between annual meetings. In March 1994
the TUC launched a programme of
change designed to promote trade
unionism and increase its influence on the
nation’s affairs.
The TUC plays an active part in
international trade union activity, through its
affiliation to the International Confederation j
of Free Trade Unions and the European
Trade Union Confederation. It also
nominates the British workers’ delegation to
the annual International Labour Conference.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
Trade unions in Scotland also have their ow
national central body, the Scottish Trades
Union Congress, which in many respects is
similar in constitution and function to the
TUC. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are
represented by the Northern Ireland
Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU). Most trade unionists in
Northern Ireland are members of
192
EMPLOYMENT
organisations affiliated to the ICTU, while
the majority also belong to unions based in
Great Britain which are affiliated to the
TUC. The Northern Ireland Committee of
the ICTU enjoys a high degree of autonomy.
Legal Framework
The Government’s reforms of industrial
relations and trade union law have helped to
change the balance of power between trade
unions and employers, and between trade
unions and their own members. For example,
since 1980 employers have been free to decide
whether or not to bargain with a trade union
or continue to do so. Legislation for Great
Britain is consolidated in the Trade Union
and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act
1992, as amended by the most recent Act, the
Trade Union Reform and Employment
Rights Act 1993. There is broad parity of
provision in respect of industrial relations and
trade union law in Northern Ireland.
There were 278,000 working days lost in
205 stoppages of work as a result of industrial
action in 1994 (see Table 13.4), the lowest
numbers since records began in 1891.
Union Membership and Non-membership Rights
All individuals have the right under the law
not to be dismissed or refused employment
(or the services of an employment agency)
because of membership or non-membership
of a trade union. Individuals who believe that
they have been dismissed or refused
employment on such grounds may complain
to an industrial tribunal. All employees who
are union members also have the right not to
have union membership subscriptions
deducted from their pay unless they have
authorised this, and renew this at least every
three years.
The Conduct of Union Affairs
The law requires a trade union to elect every
member of its governing body, its general
secretary and its president. Elections must be
held at least every five years and be carried
out by a secret postal ballot under
independent scrutiny. Any union member
who believes that the union has not complied
with the statutory requirements may complain
to the courts or to the Certification Officer.
A trade union may establish a political
fund if it wishes to use its money for what
the law defines as ‘political objects’. If a
union wishes to set up a political fund, its
members must first agree in a secret ballot a
resolution adopting those political objectives
as an aim of the union. The union must also
ballot its members every ten years to
maintain the fund. Union members have a
statutory right to opt out of contributing to a
political fund.
The law also gives all union members a
statutory remedy if unjustifiably disciplined
by their union, for example, for refusing to
take part in industrial action or for crossing a
picket line. Members also have the right to
inspect their union’s accounting records and
obtain an annual statement from the union
about its financial affairs.
Industrial Action
For most of the 20th century trade unions
enjoyed wide immunity protecting them from
legal proceedings for organising industrial
action, so that the organisation of almost any
industrial action was protected. Legislative
reforms have restricted the scope of these
immunities. To have the benefit of statutory
immunity (that is, to be ‘lawful’), the
organisation of industrial action must now be
wholly or mainly in contemplation or
furtherance of a trade dispute between workers
and their own employer, and must not:
• involve workers who have no dispute
with their own employer (so-called
‘secondary’ action);
• involve unlawful forms of picketing;
• be to establish or maintain a union-only
labour agreement (the ‘closed shop’); or
• be in support of any employee dismissed
while taking unofficial industrial action.
Before calling for industrial action, a trade
union must first obtain the support of its
members in a secret postal ballot and must
notify employers of its intention to conduct
such a ballot. The union must also provide

Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in Britain are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters,
although others are also trade associations
concerned with commercial matters in
general. With the move away from national
pay bargaining, many employers’ associations
have moved towards concentrating on areas
such as supplying information for bargaining
purposes and dealing with specialist issues.
As with some of the larger trade unions, a
number of employers’ associations are
increasingly concerned with legislation and
other issues relating to Europe.
Employers’ organisations are usually
established on an industry basis rather than a
product basis, for example, the Engineering
Employers’ Federation. A few are purely
local in character or deal with a section of an
industry or, for example, with small
businesses; most are national and are
concerned with the whole of an industry. In
some of the main industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national
1
a
federations. At the end of 1994, 117 listed
and 123 unlisted employers’ associations were
known to the Certification Officer.
Most national organisations belong to the
Confederation of British Industry (see p.
199), which represents directly or indirectly
some 250,000 businesses.
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory
body which has a general duty of promoting
the improvement of industrial relations.
ACAS seeks to discharge its responsibilities
through the voluntary co-operation of
employers, employees and, where appropriate,
their representatives. Its main functions are
collective conciliation, provision of arbitration
and mediation facilities, advisory mediation
services for preventing disputes and
improving industrial relations through the
joint involvement of employers and
employees, and providing an information
service. ACAS also conciliates in disputes on
individual employment rights.
In 1994 ACAS:
• received 1,313 requests for collective
conciliation, with a further 156 requests
referred to arbitration or mediation;
• completed nearly 80,000 individual
conciliation cases;
• made nearly 3,600 advisory visits;
• assisted with 487 joint working exercises,
and
• dealt with almost 526,200 enquiries
through its public enquiry points.

HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Health and safety standards in Britain are
tmong the best in the world. Recent statistics
indicate a reduction in the rate of major and
ather reported injuries to employees. In
1993-94 the number of deaths from accidents
it work fell to 379, the lowest figure
recorded. The decline reflects improvements
in safety, together with a change in industrial
structure away from old heavy industries
which tend to have higher risks. About 18
million working days a year are lost as a
result of work-related injuries and 13 million
from work-related illnesses.
In 1993-94 the Health and Safety
Commission (HSC) conducted a
review of all health and safety
legislation to assess its relevance. It
found considerable scope for
simplifying legislation without
endangering health and safety
standards and identified many
redundant regulations. The
Government has accepted all the
HSC’s recommendations.
The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It imposes
general duties on everyone concerned with
work activities, including employers, the self-
employed, employees, and manufacturers and
suppliers of materials for use at work.
Associated Acts and regulations deal with
particular hazards and types of work.
Employers with five or more staff must
prepare a written statement of their health
and safety policy and bring it to the attention
of their staff.
The Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health Regulations 1988 constitute one of the
most important sets of regulations made
under the 1974 Act. They replaced a range of
outdated legislation by a comprehensive and
systematic approach to the control of exposure
to virtually all substances hazardous to health.
Health and Safety Commission
The HSC has responsibility for developing
policy on health and safety at work, including
proposals for new or revised regulations and
approved codes of practice. It has an
obligation to consult those who would be
affected and makes recommendations to the
appropriate Secretary of State.
The HSC has advisory committees
covering subjects such as toxic substances,
genetic modification and the safety of nuclear
installations. There are also several industry
advisory committees, each of which deals
with a specific sector of industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is
the primary instrument for carrying out the
HSC’s policies and has day-to-day
responsibility for enforcing health and safety
law, except where other bodies, such as
local authorities, are responsible. Its field
services and inspections are carried out by
the Field Operations Division. This
incorporates the Factory, Agricultural and
Quarries inspectorates, together with the
regional staff of the Employment Medical
Advisory Service and the Field Consulting
Groups, which provide technical support to
the inspectorates.
In May 1995 the HSE launched a
major health management campaign
aimed at reducing the number of
people—-2.2 million a year—who
suffer work-related ill health. The
campaign, which will run for at least
three years, is designed to raise
awareness of health risks at work, and
to persuade managers to ensure that
working conditions do not cause
illness among their employees.
The HSE’s Technology and Health
Services Division provides technical advice
on industrial health and safety matters. The
Health and Safety Laboratory provides
scientific and medical support and testing
services, and carries out research.
In premises such as offices, shops,
195
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
warehouses, restaurants and hotels, health
and safety legislation is enforced by
inspectors appointed by local authorities,
working under guidance from the HSE.
Some other official bodies work under agency
agreement with the HSE.
Northern Ireland
The general requirements of the Northern
Ireland health and safety legislation are
broadly similar to those for Great Britain.
They are enforced mainly by the
Department of Economic Development and
the Department of Agriculture through their
health and safety inspectorates, although the
district councils have an enforcement role
similar to that of local authorities in Great
Britain. There is a Health and Safety Agency,
roughly corresponding to the HSC but
without its policy-making powers, and an
Employment Medical Advisory Service.

14 Industry and
Government
Structure and Organisation Government Policy 199
of Industry 197
The private sector is responsible for over three-quarters of total economic
activity. Since 1979 the Government has privatised nearly 50 major businesses
and reduced the state-owned sector of industry by about two-thirds. It
believes that economic decisions are best taken by those competing in the
market place, and that its primary role is to encourage enterprise and create
the right climate for markets to work better. Government schemes do,
however, provide direct assistance or advice, mainly to small and
medium-sized businesses without the resources of large companies.
STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION
OF INDUSTRY
In some sectors a small number of large
companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a substantial proportion of
total production, for instance in the
chemical, motor vehicle, aerospace and
transport equipment industries. Private
enterprises account for by far the greater
part of activity in the agricultural,
manufacturing, construction, distributive,
financial and miscellaneous service sectors.
The private sector contributed 76 per cent of
total domestic expenditure in 1994, general
government 23 per cent and public
corporations 1 per cent.
About 250 British industrial companies
each have an annual turnover of over
£500 million. The annual turnover of the
biggest company, British Petroleum (BP),
makes it the 11th largest industrial group in
the world and the second largest in Europe.
Five British firms are among the top 20
European Union (EU) companies in terms
of capital employed.
Small businesses are making an
increasing contribution to the
economy. Between 1980 and 1993 the
number of businesses, the great
majority small firms, rose from 2.4
million to 3.6 million. Companies
with fewer than 100 employees
account for 50 per cent of the private
sector workforce and 30 per cent of
turnover. About 97 per cent of firms
employ fewer than 20 people.
Industries with the fastest growth
rates in recent years are in the
services sector, particularly finance,
property, and professional and
business services.
Legal Framework
All British companies are registered with the
Registrar of Companies in Cardiff, Edinburgh
or Belfast, depending on whether a
company’s registered office is in England or
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.
197
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Companies with a place of business or branch
in Britain, but which are incorporated
overseas, are also required to register.
Legislation deals with capital structure,
rights and duties of directors and members,
and the preparation and filing of accounts
(see p. 207). Most corporate businesses are
‘limited liability’ companies. The liability of
members of a limited company is restricted to
contributing an amount related to their
shareholding (or to their guarantee where
companies are limited by guarantee). In the
case of unincorporated businesses, such as
sole proprietorships or partnerships,
individuals are personally liable for any
business debts, except where a member of a
partnership is a limited liability company or a
limited member of a limited partnership.
Companies may be either public or private.
A company must satisfy certain conditions
before it can become a public limited
company (pic). It must:
• be limited by shares or guarantee and
have a share capital;
• state in its memorandum of association
that it is to be a public limited company;
• meet specified minimum capital
requirements; and
• have as the suffix to its name the words
‘public limited company’ or ‘pic’.
All other British companies are private
companies and are generally prohibited from
offering their shares to the public.
Industrial Financing
Over half of companies’ funds for investment
and other purposes are generated internally.
Banks are the chief external source of finance,
but companies have increasingly turned to
equity finance. The main forms of short-term
finance in the private sector are bank
overdrafts, trade credit and factoring (making
cash available to a company in exchange for
debts owing to it).
Types of medium- and long-term finance
include bank loans, mortgaging of property
and the issue of shares and other securities to
the public through the London Stock
Exchange. The leasing of equipment may also
be regarded as a form of finance. Other
sources of finance for industry include
government, the European Union (EU) and
specialist financial institutions, such as
financing and leasing, factoring and venture
capital companies.
Venture Capital
Venture capital, or private equity capital,
provides long-term unsecured capital for
companies starting up or expanding as well as
those undergoing management buy-outs and
buy-ins. Venture capital is available principally
from institutions that include independent
funds and wholly-owned subsidiaries or
divisions of financial institutions, such as
banks. The British Venture Capital Association
has 107 full members, which represent every
major source of venture capital in Britain.
Nearly £12,800 million has been invested by
venture capital companies in 12,900 businesses
since 1984, with £2,074 million being invested
in 1,208 businesses in 1994.
The majority of venture capital deals
involve investments of over £100,000,
averaging in excess of £1 million each in
1994. In that year, 68 per cent of venture
capital deals were in expansion stage
companies; 67 per cent of the total amount of
money was invested in management buy-outs
and buy-ins.
Business angels, or private investors, are
an increasingly important source of smaller
amounts of venture capital. The Enterprise
Investment Scheme (EIS) and V enture
Capital Trusts (VCTs) seek to encourage
private investment in smaller unquoted
trading companies by offering individuals tax
incentives. The EIS allows business angels to
take a position on the boards of the investee
company; VCTs are more suited to less active
investors. VCTs, which were launched in
September 1995, are similar in structure to
investment trusts: they invest in unquoted
trading companies and are quoted on the
Stock Exchange.
Taxation
Rates of corporate taxation have been
progressively reduced in recent years (see
198
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
p. 164). The main rate of corporation tax is
33 per cent, with a reduced rate of 25 per
j cent for small firms (those with annual profits
j of less than £300,000). For companies with
profits of between £300,000 and £1.5 million,
j the overall corporation tax rate is between
I the main rate and the rate for small firms.
Expenditure on business plant and
machinery, industrial building, and scientific
research qualifies for annual allowances
against profit for tax purposes.
Industrial Associations
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
is the largest employers’ organisation in
Britain, representing about 250,000 companies
from all sectors, which together employ over
50 per cent of Britain’s workforce.
Membership ranges from the smallest to the
largest companies in virtually all business
:! sectors. Most national employers’
organisations, trade associations, and some
chambers of commerce are also members.
The CBI aims to ensure that the
Government, national and international
institutions and the public understand the
needs, intentions and problems of business, so
as to create a climate of opinion in which
business can operate efficiently and profitably.
It campaigns to lessen the burdens on
business, tackle handicaps on competition,
and help improve the performance of
companies. It offers members a forum, a
lobby and a range of advisory services. The
CBI also conducts surveys of activity in
manufacturing, distribution, financial services,
the regions, innovation, and pay and
productivity. It has 12 regional offices and an
office in Brussels. The CBI is the British
member of the Union of Industrial and
Employers’ Confederations of Europe.
The chambers of commerce represent
business views to the Government at national
and local levels. They promote local
economic development—for example, through
regeneration projects, tourism, inward
investment promotion and business services,
including overseas trade missions, exhibitions
and training conferences. Member firms are
also supplied with information about
overseas buyers and product sourcing. The
Association of British Chambers of
Commerce represents more than 214,000
businesses in over 230 chambers of commerce
and trade throughout Britain.
The Institute of Directors (IOD) has more
than 50,000 members worldwide, including
33,000 members in Britain, many of whom
are from small businesses. The IOD provides
business advisory services on a range of
matters affecting company directors, such as
corporate management, insolvency and career
counselling, and represents the interests of
members to authorities in Britain and the
EU. It also offers a full training programme
of courses and lectures.
Trade associations represent companies
producing or selling a particular product or
group of products. They exist to supply
common services, regulate trading practices
and represent their members to
government departments. Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) initiatives
encourage trade associations representing
companies within the same sector to work
more closely together.
GOVERNMENT POLICY
The Department of Trade and Industry is
the department mainly responsible for the
Government’s relations with industry and
commerce. Specific responsibilities, which are
dealt with in this chapter, include company
law, small firms, regional industrial
development and inward investment,
competition policy and consumer affairs, and
intellectual property. The Department of the
Environment oversees provision of regional
industrial aid through the Government
Offices for the Regions. The Scottish, Welsh
and Northern Ireland Offices are responsible
for industrial policies in their areas. Export
promotion is examined in Chapter 12 and
technology and innovation in Chapter 20.
The DTI’s responsibilities for industrial
relations are covered in Chapter 13.
The Department of Trade and Industry
seeks to help British industry to compete
successfully in domestic and overseas
markets. It has specified its objectives as:
• identifying business needs through close
contact with individual sectors;
199
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• ensuring these needs are taken into
account by Government and the EU;
• identifying influences on competitiveness
at home and abroad;
• working for global trade liberalisation
worldwide and helping businesses take
advantage of market opportunities at
home and abroad;
• widening choice and stimulating
enterprise by promoting competition and
privatisation;
• maintaining confidence in markets
and protecting consumers by fair
regulation;
• reducing unnecessary regulatory and
administrative burdens on business;
• promoting innovation and best practice in
quality, design and management;
• fostering the creation and development of
small and medium-sized businesses;
• responding to the needs of different
regions and areas with special difficulties;
and
• taking account of environmental issues
when developing government policies and
stimulating an effective business response
to environmental developments.
Competitiveness White Papers
A White Paper on Competitiveness, issued in
May 1994, contains a programme of measures
to help British business compete effectively in
world markets (see p. 154). These were
introduced to improve education and training,
help small firms to be more innovative and to
increase exports, boost regional economies
and attract more inward investment. A
follow-up White Paper was published in May
1995, detailing progress since 1994 and
setting out new policies and initiatives, in
particular for smaller companies (see p. 154).
Some of the more important measures are
covered in this chapter and also in Chapter 13.
Single European Market
The Government believes that the single
European market (see p. 120) is beneficial to
the economy of each member state: removal
of trade barriers should lead to a reduction in
business costs and greater competition and
efficiency, to the benefit of consumers and
job and wealth creation.
Specific advantages of the single market
include:
• wider consumer choice;
• removal of barriers to trade through
mutual recognition of standards and
harmonisation;
• liberalisation of public procurement;
• the right to trade financial services
throughout the EU on the basis of a
single authorisation ‘passport’ (see p. 215);
• mutual recognition of professional and
vocational qualifications; and
• a reduction in export business
bureaucracy.
Privatisation
The Government is of the view that the best
way to improve the performance of public
sector companies and nationalised industries
is to expose them to market forces, through
privatisation and the promotion of
competition. Privatisation has also provided
an opportunity to widen and deepen share
ownership by encouraging both employees
and the public to take a direct stake in
industry. In major flotations, employees in
privatised companies are normally given a
preferential right to buy shares in the new
privatised companies.
Since 1979 the Government has
privatised 48 major businesses, with net
proceeds to the end of 1994—95 of about
£60,000 million. Recent privatisations
include British Coal, the electricity industry
in Northern Ireland, London’s buses and the
Government’s residual shareholdings in BT
(British Telecom), National Power and
PowerGen. Legislation has been introduced
to enable the private sector to operate rail
services (p. 300). Privatisation is also being
extended to non-core government activities
(including a number of research
laboratories—p. 326) and other public sector
areas. The Government plans to privatise

Benefits
The Government believes that the economy
has benefited through higher returns on
capital in the privatised industries, which now
have to compete for funds in the open capital
markets. Privatised companies have welcomed
the freedom to raise finance in private-sector
capital markets.
The consumer has gained from
downward pressure on prices and from
rising standards of service. The Government
has established a system of independent
regulation for the privatised utilities. In
each of the privatised utility sectors—-
telecommunications, electricity, gas and so
on—a regulatory body has been appointed
with a wide range of powers and duties to
promote competition and the interests of
consumers. These usually include considering
all complaints and representations about the
company’s services. Each privatised utility
operates under a pricing policy set by the
regulator, which usually limits annual
price increases to significantly less than the
rate of inflation.
Nationalised Industries
The remaining major nationalised industries
are British Rail, Railtrack, the Post Office,
London Transport, Nuclear Electric, Civil
Aviation Authority, and Scottish Nuclear.
Managing boards are appointed by ministers,
who have power to give general directions
but are not engaged in day-to-day
management. Managing boards and staffs of
nationalised industries are not civil servants.
The Government considers that nationalised
industries should act as commercial
enterprises and has set policies to which they
are expected to conform. These involve:
• clear government objectives;
• regular corporate plans and performance
reviews;
• agreed principles relating to investment
appraisal and pricing;
• financial targets and performance aims;
201
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• external financing limits; and
• systematic monitoring.
Deregulation
The Government’s aim is to reduce or
simplify administrative and legislative
burdens on business, particularly small
businesses, where the burden of compliance is
most demanding. A small firms ‘litmus test
is helping to ensure that compliance costs for
new regulations are not unduly high.
Deregulation helps businesses to contain
costs, operate more efficiently and trade more
competitively.
Under the Deregulation Initiative, the
Government is reducing burdens on
business by:
• achieving better regulation, and cutting
unnecessary controls and the cost of
compliance with essential regulation;
• ensuring that the views of business, and
potential costs of compliance, are taken
into account in framing new regulations
and in negotiating EU proposals;
• increasing official awareness of the needs
of business through training and better
consultation and communication; and
• improving the quality of service to
business generally, whether provided by
central or local government.
The existing 3,500 regulations affecting
companies are being reviewed by
government departments with the help of
business people; about 500 provisions were
repealed or changed in 1994. The
Deregulation and Contracting Out Act
enables the Government to amend or repeal
primary legislation imposing unnecessary
burdens on business.
Regulation of Markets
The aim of Government competition policy is
to encourage and enhance the competitive
process. It is not the purpose of the policy to
protect particular firms that may be adversely
affected by competition. When the
competitive process itself is frustrated,
however, intervention may be justified. The
law provides several ways in which market
situations can be examined and, if necessary,
altered.
Responsibility for competition policy lies
with the President of the Board of Trade
who enforces the competition law with the
Director General of Fair Trading, the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission and
the Restrictive Practices Court. The main
legislation comprises:
• the Fair Trading Act 1973 and the
Competition Act 1980, which deal with
mergers and monopolies, and anti¬
competitive practices respectively;
• the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976,
which regulates agreements between
people or companies that could limit their
freedom to operate independently; and
• the Resale Prices Act 1976, covering
attempts to impose minimum prices at
which goods can be sold.
As well as British law, competition policy
is also governed by European Community
rules. These apply only where an agreement
or practice has an effect on trade between
member states. Enforcement of these rules is
primarily the responsibility of the European
Commission, which has powers to investigate
and terminate alleged infringements and to
impose fines. The Director General assists
the European Commission in the application
of European Community competition law.
Monopolies
Under the Fair Trading Act 1973, a
monopoly is defined first as a situation where
a company supplies or purchases 25 per cent
or more of a particular product or service in
Britain, or a defined part of it; and secondly,
as a situation where a group of companies or
people together have 25 per cent or more of
the market and behave in a way that adversely
affects competition (a ‘complex monopoly’).
The Director General may enquire into
possible abuse of a monopoly position and take
various measures to remedy the situation. If
there is ‘prima facie’ evidence of a monopoly
situation, the matter can be referred for furthei
investigation by the independent Monopolies
and Mergers Commission (MMC), whose

the situation.
Mergers
In most cases judgment of the advantages
and disadvantages of mergers is left to the
parties involved, with the market determining
the outcome. The great majority of mergers
are not considered to pose a threat to
competition and are allowed to take place.
However, under the Fair Trading Act 1973,
the President of the Board of Trade can
refer mergers for investigation by the MMC
if they could lead to a significant reduction
in competition or raise other matters of
public concern.
A merger is defined as occurring when
two or more enterprises come under common
ownership or control. It qualifies for
investigation by the MMC where:
• a market share of 25 per cent or more in
Britain or a substantial part of it is
created or increased; or
• the total value of gross assets to be taken
over exceeds £70 million.
After considering advice from the Director
General of Fair Trading, the President of the
Board of Trade may refer a merger or
proposed merger to the MMC. Alternatively,
the Director General may be asked to obtain
suitable undertakings from the companies
involved to remedy the adverse effects
identified. If a merger or proposed merger is
referred and the MMC finds that it may be
expected to operate against the public
interest, the President of the Board of Trade
can prohibit it or allow it subject to certain
conditions being met. Where the merger has
already taken place, action can be taken to
reverse it. There are special provisions for
newspaper and water company mergers.
The Companies Act 1989 and the
Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994
made changes to merger control procedures.
They provide for:
• a voluntary procedure for pre-notification
of proposed mergers which offers prompt
clearance of straightforward cases; and
• acceptance of enforceable undertakings by
the parties concerned to divest assets in
order to obviate the need for a full
investigation by the Commission.
Certain mergers with an EU dimension,
assessed by reference to turnover, come
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
European Commission where competition in
trade between members of the European
Union is affected. The Commission can ban
mergers if it concludes that they create or
strengthen a dominant position which would
significantly impede effective competition
within the EU or a substantial part of it;
alternatively, it may negotiate undertakings to
correct the adverse effect.
Anti-competitive Practices
The Director General of Fair Trading can
investigate any course of conduct by a
business which appears to be anti¬
competitive. If a practice is found to be
anti-competitive, undertakings may be sought
from the business responsible for the
conduct. In the event of a suitable
undertaking not being given, the matter may
be referred to the MMC. In the case of an
adverse finding by the MMC, the President
of the Board of Trade has powers to take
remedial action. Companies are not covered
by the legislation if they have a turnover of
less than £10 million, or have less than 25
per cent of a relevant market in Britain.
Restrictive Trade Practices
Most commercial agreements containing
restrictions on matters such as prices and
other conditions of sale and parties or areas
to be dealt with have to be submitted to the
Director General of Fair Trading for
registration. Legal proceedings are
normally initiated by the Director General
203
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
against blatantly anti-competitive agreements
which have not been notified.
Once an agreement has been registered,
the Director General is under a general duty
to refer it to the Restrictive Practices Court.
The Court must declare the restrictions in
the agreement contrary to the public interest
unless the parties can satisfy it that the
restrictions fall within set public interest
criteria (‘gateways’). Restrictions declared
contrary to the public interest by the Court
are void, and the Court has the power to
order the parties not to implement them.
In practice, however, the great majority of
agreements are never brought to court because
the restrictions they contain are not significant
enough to warrant such action. In these
circumstances the Director General may be
discharged from his duty to bring proceedings.
Resale Price Maintenance
For the most part it is unlawful for suppliers
to notify dealers of a minimum resale price
for their goods or to make it a condition of
supply that their goods be sold at a specified
price. It is also unlawful for suppliers to seek
to impose minimum resale prices by
withholding supplies of goods or by
discriminating against price-cutting dealers in
other ways. The Director General of Fail-
Trading, or anyone affected, can take
proceedings in the civil courts.
Consumer Protection
Consumer protection is an integral element
in the fair operation of markets. The
Government believes that consumers’
interests are best served by open and
competitive markets offering the widest
choice of goods and services. There are,
however, laws to ensure that consumers are
adequately protected.
Legislation covers the sale of goods, the
supply of goods and services, and the way
that goods and services are described. The
marking and accuracy of quantities are
regulated by weights and measures legislation
Another law provides for the control of
medical products, and certain other
substances and articles, through a system of
licences and certificates. Under EC
legislation, it is a criminal offence to supply
unsafe consumer products. A range of
public safety information for consumers has
been made available by the DTI.
The Director General of Fair Trading
promotes good trading practices and acts
against malpractice. Under the Fair
Trading Act 1973, the Director General can
make recommendations for legislative or
other changes to stop practices adversely
affecting consumers’ economic interests;
encourage trade associations to develop
codes of practice promoting consumers’
interests; and disseminate consumer
information and guidance. The Director
General can also take assurances as to future
conduct from traders who persistently
breach the law to the detriment of
consumers. New regulations which came
into force in July 1995 empower the
Director General to act against traders using
unfair contract terms.
The Consumer Credit Act 1974 is
intended to protect consumers in their
dealings with credit businesses. Businesses
connected with the consumer credit or hire
industry or which supply ancillary credit
services, for example credit brokers, debt
collectors, debt counsellors and credit
reference agencies, require a consumer
credit licence. The Director General is
responsible for administering the licensing
system, including revoking the licences of
those unfit to hold them. Under other
regulations he or she also has powers to take
court action to prevent the publication of
misleading advertisements and powers to
prohibit unfit persons from carrying out
estate agency work.
The EU’s consumer programme covers
activities such as health and safety,
protection of the consumer s economic
interests, promotion of consumer education
and strengthening the representation of
consumers. The views of British consumer
organisations on EU matters are represented
by the Consumers in Europe group (UK).
British consumer bodies also have a voice
on the European consumer ‘watchdog
body, the Bureau Europeen des Unions
de Consommateurs.
204
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
Consumer Advice and Information
\dvice and information on consumer matters
ire given by Citizens Advice Bureaux, trading
standards or consumer protection departments
3f local authorities (in Northern Ireland the
Department of Economic Development),
ind, in some areas, by specialist consumer
id vice centres.
The independent, non-statutory National
Consumer Council (and associated councils
for Scotland and Wales), which receives
government finance, presents the consumer’s
view to government, industry and others. The
General Consumer Council for Northern
Ireland has wide-ranging duties in consumer
affairs in general.
Consumer bodies for several privatised
utilities investigate questions of concern to
the consumer. Some trade associations in
industry and commerce have established
codes of practice. In addition, several private
organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’
Association, funded by the subscriptions of its
800,000 members.
Education and Training
A well-educated and well-trained workforce
is essential for economic prosperity,
especially at a time of intense international
competition and rapid technological advance.
The Government aims to ensure that
education and training are broadly based and
that people of all ages can acquire relevant
knowledge and skills.
New initiatives on education and training
outlined in the competitiveness White
Papers include:
• improved careers information, education
and guidance for young people;
• a strengthening of academic and
vocational qualifications;
• new accelerated modern apprenticeships;
• an initiative to help firms develop and
implement training plans;
• making training loans available to smaller
firms; and
• a competition open to small firms in
England and Wales for the best co¬
ordinated training projects.
A package of proposed measures for
Scotland was announced in April 1995.
Training and Enterprise Councils and Local
Enterprise Companies
The Government has set up a network of 81
business-led Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) in England and Wales; two
enterprise bodies run 22 local enterprise
companies (LECs) in Scotland. TECs and
LECs are independent companies managed
by boards of directors, the majority of whom
are drawn from private sector business.
They provide training, vocational
education and enterprise programmes on
behalf of the Government and encourage
investment in the development of skills
throughout the workforce. In addition, they
offer advisory and training services to
businesses, including schemes to enhance the
expertise of managers. In Scotland the LECs
make available the full range of services
offered by the Enterprise bodies (see p. 186)
—support and advice to businesses,
environmental renewal, training programmes
for young and long-term unemployed people
and encouragement to businesses to invest in
management and skills. TECs and LECs also
have a key role in regeneration and economic
development activities locally and in setting
up Business Links and similar operations in
Scotland and Wales.
Management Education and Development
The DTI, in conjunction with the Department
for Education and Employment (DFEE),
works with industry, higher education
institutes and business schools to spread
awareness about best management practices
and to encourage continuous professional
development. Performance standards for all
levels of management have been devised.
The ‘Managing in the 90s’ programme
aims to improve the competitiveness of
business by promoting best management
practice. It is concerned with making
businesses aware of the need for change and
205
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
providing them with guidance on how to
identify the changes required. Delivered
mainly through Business Links and sectoral
organisations, the programme offers a range
of material and activities which are constantly
being developed in response to market
needs, such as help with networking and
benchmarking between companies.
Management education is on offer at many
universities and colleges of higher and further
education. Regional management centres have
been established in England and Wales by
associations of these colleges, and there are
several similar organisations in Scotland.
Universities run full-time postgraduate
programmes at business schools such as those
of London, Manchester, Durham, Warwick
and Strathclyde universities.
The British Institute of Management
encourages excellence in management. Other
bodies are concerned with standards and
training in specialised branches of
management. The employer-led Management
Charter Initiative (MCI) is the operating arm
of the National Forum for Management
Education and Development and the leading
industrial body for management standards.
More than 1,800 employers, representing a
quarter of the total workforce, are members
of the MCI, which has 90 local networks
working with local employers.
Design, Quality and Standards
Design is a key commercial tool for companies,
they aim to become more profitable through
the design of products and services which
add value and improve performance. The
British design consultancy industry has an
annual estimated turnover of £1,000 million
and employs around 18,000 people, mainly in
small consultancies of up to six designers.
The DTI encourages firms to invest in
design which can contribute to international
competitiveness; it also supports the benefits
of good design through the Design Council,
an independent body governed by Royal
Charter. The Council acts primarily as a
provider of analysis and advice on design
policy to government, business and education.
Design services for industry are supplied
through Business Links in England (and
equivalent bodies in Scotland and Wales), with B
financial support from the DTI (see p. 208). ii
The Government urges business to "
consider quality at all stages of design,
production, marketing and delivery to
customers. Accreditation is a key method of
improving quality and competitiveness.
Through its support for consultancy projects,
the Government helps small and medium¬
sized firms to learn about and apply quality
management techniques based on a national
standard—BS EN ISO 9000 meeting
international requirements. In order to
increase customer confidence, companies
are encouraged to obtain assessment
and certification to this standard. The
competence and performance of organisations
undertaking such certification are officially
accredited by United Kingdom Accreditation
Service (UKAS—see below). Companies
certified by accredited bodies are permitted to
use the national ‘crown and tick’ accreditation
mark. The DTFs Register of Quality Assessed
Companies lists accredited certification bodies
and companies assessed by them.
The DTI is responsible for policy relating
to the National Measurement System. This
provides, through a number of DTI-funded
agencies, many of the physical measurement
standards and associated calibration facilities
necessary so that measurements in Britain are
made on a common basis and to the required
accuracy. Two of these agencies—the National
Physical Laboratory and the Laboratory of the
Government Chemist—are to be privatised or
contracted out. The National Measurement
Accreditation Service (NAMAS), the national
accreditation service for calibration and testing
laboratories, has merged with the National
Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies
to form United Kingdom Accreditation
Service (UKAS), a private-sector company.
The National Weights and Measures
Laboratory, which registers weighing and
measuring equipment and services equipment
manufacturers, is to continue as an executive
agency within the DTI.
British Standards Institution
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is
Britain’s national standards body and is the
206
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
British member of the European and
international standards organisations. It works
with industry, consumers and government to
produce standards relevant to the needs of
the market and suitable for public purchasing
md regulatory purposes.
Government support for the BSI is
directed particularly towards European and
international standards work. Harmonised
standards contribute to the aim of removing
technical barriers to trade in the EU. Hence,
over 90 per cent of the BSPs work is
concentrated on European or international
standards. The Kitemark is the BSPs
registered product certification trade mark.
Awards
The Queen’s Awards for Export,
Technological and Environmental Achievement
recognise outstanding performance in their
respective fields. Awarded annually, they are
valid for five years and are granted by the
Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister,
assisted by an Advisory Committee consisting
of senior representatives from business, trade
unions and government departments. Any self-
contained ‘industrial unit’ in Britain is eligible
to apply, regardless of size, provided it meets
the scheme’s criteria.
Other awards include the Export Award
for Smaller Businesses (for firms employing
fewer than 200 people) and the MacRobert
Award for engineering in Britain made by the
Fellowship of Engineering for successful
technological innovation.
Industrial and Intellectual Property
The Government supports innovation by
protecting the rights of the originators of
inventions, industrial designs and trade marks
together with copyright in literary, artistic
and musical works. These matters are the
responsibility of the DTPs Patent Office,
which includes the Design Registry and the
Trade Marks Registry. Patent protection is
also available under the European Patent
Convention and the Patent Co-operation
Treaty. Benefits may be claimed in other
countries by virtue of separate conventions on
industrial property, literary and artistic work,
and music and broadcasting. Recent measures
giving greater protection to industrial and
intellectual property owners include:
• the adoption of European Community
directives on copyright which harmonise
rental and lending rights of performers,
record producers and broadcasters, and
legal protection of computer programs; and
• a new EC regulation on counterfeit and
pirated goods.
Company Law
Laws relating to companies are designed to
meet the need for proper regulation of
business, secure open markets and to create
safeguards for those wishing to invest in
companies or do business with them. They
take account of EC directives on company
law, and on company and group accounts
and their auditing. The Government’s aim
is to achieve these objectives while imposing
as small a burden as possible on business.
Hence, it has removed from certain types
of small companies the statutory obligation
to have their accounts audited and has
introduced a simple procedure for
dissolving private companies that are no
longer operational. Additionally, it is taking
steps to encourage the use of summary
financial statements and simplify statutory
accounting requirements.
The 1992 Cadbury Committee Report on
the management of companies contains a Code
of Best Practice for company boards,
underpinned by a Stock Exchange
requirement for firms to state whether they
are complying with the Code and giving
reasons for areas of non-compliance. Standards
of disclosure have improved since 1992 and
they indicate a high level of compliance with
the Cadbury recommendations, especially
among larger companies. Shareholders,
including institutional shareholders, are
encouraged by the Government to play a
more active role in overseeing management.
Insider dealing in shares is a criminal
offence and inspectors may be appointed to
investigate possible insider dealing. A
licensing procedure ensures the professional
competence, integrity and independence of
207
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
people acting as trustees of bankrupt
individuals, or as liquidators, receivers or
administrators of insolvent companies.
Business Support Services
To encourage the development of small firms,
the DTI is establishing a network of around
200 Business Links in England. This
programme is designed to bring together in a
single point of access organisations supporting
enterprise, such as local companies, Training
and Enterprise Councils (TECs), chambers of
commerce, local authorities and enterprise
agencies. Business Links are local, commercial
partnerships, in which larger firms can make
contacts and expertise available to smaller firms.
A planned 600 personal business advisers
will be able to provide a full range of business
consultancy and other services, calling on the
services of specialist advisers, such as private-
sector export consultants, design advisers, and
innovation and technology counsellors. Business
Links are also the access point for a new
regional supply network designed to promote
best practice in supply chain partnerships by
including buyers and sellers in both private and
public sectors. Every company in England
should have easy access to a Business Link by
the end of 1995. From April 1996 government
office staff providing services to businesses will
be seconded to Business Links. Further
measures to help small firms, available through
Business Links, were outlined in the 1995
competitiveness White Paper:
• an extra £100 million over four years to
develop existing management initiatives
and make available locally designed
business development programmes;
• more advice on innovation and technology,
including overseas development; and
• free export help to small firms through
export vouchers.
In Scotland, Business Shops, run by local
partnerships between Local Enterprise
Companies (LECs), local authorities and
business support organisations, are being
opened, where trained advisers provide
information and direct enquiries to the
business support services of local partners.
Similar arrangements have been set up in
Wales through Business Connect Wales. In
Northern Ireland, business services are
available from the regional offices of the Local
Enterprise Development Unit; in addition,
there is a network of local enterprise agencies.
Consultancy
Business Links are the access point for
consultancy support for small and medium¬
sized firms. They are responsible for providing
a new flexible consultancy and diagnostic
service, which has replaced the Enterprise
Initiative Consultancy Scheme. In Scotland, a
similar diagnostic and consultancy service is
available through Business Shops in lowland
Scotland and Business Information Source in
the Highland and Islands area. The new
services help smaller firms assess their
strengths and weaknesses and draw up plans
for future development. In addition, a new
consultancy brokerage service was introduced
in 1995 to assist in selecting consultants. Since
1988, when the Enterprise Initiative
Consultancy Scheme was established, over
141,000 businesses have asked for assistance
and 70,000 projects have been completed.
Small Firms Schemes
The SPUR scheme offers grants to
businesses with up to 250 employees for
new product and process development
demonstrating a significant technological
advance (see p. 325). Since 1991, when the
scheme began, grants of £45 million have
helped over 500 projects. Under a new
SPUR-PLUS scheme, higher maximum
grants are available for exceptional projects.
SMART is an annual competition
providing grants to individuals and businesses i
with no more than 50 employees in support
of innovative technological projects with
commercial potential. Firms which have
completed their SMART projects are
eligible for enhanced SPUR grants to develop
their product. In 1994—95 SMART grants
were made to over 180 new projects. The
existing SPUR and SMART schemes have
been merged and simplified.
Other government assistance to small
businesses includes:
208
INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
• the Small Firms Loan Guarantee
Scheme, which helps businesses with
viable proposals to obtain finance where
conventional loans are unavailable as a
result of a lack of financial security or
previous performance; the scheme
provides banks and other financial
institutions with a government guarantee
on a certain percentage (70 or 85 per
cent) of the loan in return for a premium
payment; some ^246 million was
guaranteed in 1994—95;
• an initiative to encourage informal
investment for small firms from a wider
range of sources; the Government supports
TECs and other organisations in bringing
together investors and small firms;
• the Business Start-Up scheme, enabling
unemployed people to claim an allowance
while establishing a new business; and
• an initiative which allows small firms to
develop, in-house, the training skills of
key workers.
The Government is also considering a
series of measures to help tackle the problem
of late payment of commercial debt, including
the establishment of a British Standard for
prompt payment.
Regional Industrial Development
Industrial policy is designed to encourage
enterprise and economic growth in all areas of
Britain. However, where additional help is
needed, it is focused on the Assisted Areas
(Development Areas and Intermediate Areas),
which cover around 35 per cent of Britain’s
working population. The promotion of
inward investment is a key element in the
Government’s regional policy (see p. 212).
The main regional policy instruments are:
• Regional Selective Assistance, available in
the Assisted Areas, for investment
projects undertaken by firms in
manufacturing and some service sectors
that will create or safeguard employment;
• Regional Investment Grants, for firms
with no more than 25 employees in
Development Areas or areas affected by
colliery closures;
• Regional Innovation Grants, for firms
employing no more than 50 people in
Development, Intermediate, Task Force
and City Challenge areas or localities
affected by colliery closures (see p. 262),
as well as some other areas covered by
EU schemes; they are also available in
certain Scottish urban areas.
Regional Selective Assistance and Regional
Investment and Innovation Grants are
administered by the Government Offices for
the Regions in England, the Scottish Office
Industry Department and the Welsh Office
Industry and Training Department.
England
Established in 1994, English Partnerships
promotes job creation, inward investment and
environmental improvement through
reclamation and development of vacant,
derelict, under-used or contaminated land
and buildings. The Rural Development
Commission advises the Government on
economic and social development in the
countryside, assists local enterprises,
promotes jobs and supports essential services.
The Commission’s resources are concentrated
in areas of greatest need, known as priority
areas (see p. 349), covering about 35 per cent
of the area of England.
Scotland
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise provide and manage
government and EU support to industry
and commerce, in lowland and highland
Scotland respectively, operating mainly
through the network of LECs (see p. 186).
The two bodies have a broad range of
powers, including powers to:
• attract inward investment and encourage
exports;
• give financial and management support
to new businesses and assist existing ones
to expand;
• improve the environment by reclaiming
derelict and contaminated land; and
• increase job opportunities and skills.

INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT
A major initiative was launched by
Scottish Enterprise in 1995 to increase the
rate of business start-ups with the objective of
creating an additional 25,000 businesses in
Scotland by 2000. In 1995—96 the Enterprise
networks plan to:
• assist over 15,000 businesses;
• provide 38,000 square metres of
commercial and industrial premises; and
• train 37,000 young people and 30,000
unemployed adults.
Wales
The Welsh Development Agency (WDA)
was set up in 1976 to promote industrial
efficiency and international competitiveness
and improve the environment. Providing
affordable, high quality sites and premises for
existing businesses and inward investors, it
has so far spent ^822 million on property
development. Since 1990 the Agency’s
property development activities have attracted
over £242 million of private-sector
investment through Welsh Property Venture.
The WDA seeks to attract investment into
Wales and co-ordinates the approach for
responding to the need of investors. It has
helped to attract over 1,400 projects involving
capital investment of £7,200 million and the
creation of 84,000 new jobs. Since 1991 the
Agency has spent over £90 million on urban
regeneration and helped bring in more than
£170 million of private-sector investment,
including £70 million for urban joint
ventures. The WDA’s land reclamation
programme is the largest and most sustained
landscape improvement project in Europe and
has the goal of reclaiming all significant
derelict sites in Wales by 2000. Its Business
Services programme focuses on developing
stronger regional clusters (such as supply and
service chains), improving standards and
efficiency, and helping Welsh companies to
l exploit new technology.
The Development Board for Rural Wales
promotes the economic and social well-being
of rural mid-Wales. It is concentrating
investment in market towns, especially those in
the west, in order to help stimulate business
confidence and prosperity. Priority is also being
given to activities in smaller communities.
Northern Ireland
Industrial development policy in Northern
Ireland is the responsibility of the
Department of Economic Development and is
delivered through various agencies:
• the Industrial Development Board, which
deals with overseas companies considering
Northern Ireland as an investment location,
as well as the development of local
companies with more than 50 employees;
• the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
which promotes enterprise and the
development of small businesses;
• the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit, providing advice and assistance on
research and development, innovation
and technology transfer; and
• the Training and Employment Agency,
which helps with in-company training
and management development.
A variety of schemes are on offer to help
companies with marketing, exporting,
product development and design, improved
productivity and quality, training, and
research and development. The full range of
assistance is made available to those
companies able to demonstrate development
potential and a prospect of long-term
competitive growth. This assistance includes
capital grants, loans and share capital
investment. The Industrial Development
Board also offers stocks of land and
industrial premises for purchase or lease.
There is exemption from local property taxes
for manufacturing premises.
European Union Regional Policy and Aid
The EU seeks to reduce disparities between
the different regions of the Union. The
principal responsibility for helping poorer
areas remains with national authorities, but
the EU complements schemes by providing
grants and loans from a number of sources,
including the European Regional
Development Fund (ERDF).
211
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The European Investment Bank (see p. 121)
offers loans for public and private capital
investment schemes. Assisted projects typically
include improvements to and building of
infrastructure projects; construction of trans-
European transport links (like the Channel
Tunnel); support for business and tourism
development; and capital investment in
industry, such as factory construction.
EU Structural Funds, especially the
ERDF, play an important role in regional
development. Three areas—Northern Ireland,
the Highlands and Islands, and Merseyside—
are eligible for assistance; they will receive
around £2,000 million of EU funding over
the period 1994-99. The ERDF also provides
finance for areas of industrial decline and for
rural development. Structural Funds are
made available to areas suffering from a
decline in the coal, steel, textile, fishing and
defence industries.
Inward Investment
The Government encourages overseas
investment in Britain, recognising the many
benefits it brings to the industrial base and the
economy as a whole. Some of Britain s new
manufacturing techniques and management
attitudes were introduced by inward
investors, which also create new employment
and help boost Britain’s balance of payments
through higher exports and lower imports.
Inward investment also has a positive impact
on the performance and competitiveness of
British suppliers; product development has
also been strengthened.
Many overseas firms are household names
in Britain. Overseas companies are
responsible for around 18 per cent of British
manufacturing employment, 32 per cent of
capital investment, 24 per cent of output and
40 per cent of exports.
Overall policy and co-ordination of
overseas promotion of inward investment are
the responsibility of the DTI’s Invest in
Britain Bureau (IBB), which represents
Britain as a whole. It is supported in Britain
by several territorial and regional bodies and
overseas it operates through British
Embassies, High Commissions and
Consulates-general.
Britain’s share of US investment into
Europe for the period 1950-94 was 41
per cent and its share of Japanese
investment into Europe 40 per cent.
German government figures for
1982-94 reveal German investment
into Britain of 12 per cent, second
only to investment into the United
States. In 1994-95 the IBB recorded
announcements of 434 new projects
and 88,000 associated jobs in Britain.
A growing proportion of inward
investment has been through expansion or
reinvestment by existing investors. This is
likely to continue as firms rationalise their
European operations. The IBB and its
regional partners give high priority to ‘caring
for’ existing foreign investors, to ensure that
they are aware of the advantages of remaining
and expanding in Britain.

organisations is available through:

Northern Ireland.

The service industries, which include finance, retailing, tourism and business
services, contribute about 65 per cent of gross domestic product and 75 per
cent of employment. Overseas earnings from services amounted to around
30 per cent of the value of exports of manufactures in 1994. The number of
employees in services rose from over 13 million in 1983 to 16.5 million by
June 1995, much of the rise being accounted for by growth in part-time
(principally female) employment. The City of London remains a world leader
in the provision of financial services, which make a substantial contribution
to Britain’s balance of payments.
Average real disposable income per head
increased by more than three-quarters
between 1971 and 1994 and this was
reflected in a rise in consumer spending on
financial, personal and leisure services and
on the maintenance and repair of consumer
durables. Demand for British travel, hotel
and catering services rose as real incomes in
Britain and other countries increased.
Britain is a major financial centre,
housing some of the world’s leading
banking, insurance, securities, shipping,
commodities, futures, and other financial
services and markets. Financial services are
an important source of employment and
overseas earnings. Business services include
advertising, market research, management
consultancy, exhibition and conference
facilities and computing.
By the year 2000, tourism is expected to be
the world’s biggest industry, and Britain is one
of the world’s leading tourist destinations.
The industry is Britain’s second largest,
employing about 7 per cent of the workforce.
Retailing is also a major employer.
Financial Services
Historically the financial services industry in
Britain has been located in the famous
‘Square Mile’ in the City of London. This
remains broadly the case, even though the
markets for financial and related services have
grown and diversified greatly. Manchester,
Cardiff, Liverpool, Leeds, Edinburgh and
Glasgow are also financial centres. ‘The
City’, the collection of markets and
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
institutions in and around the Square Mile,
is noted for having:
• a larger number of overseas banks than in
any other financial centre;
• a banking sector that accounts for about a
fifth of total international bank lending;
• one of the world’s largest international
insurance markets;
• the largest centre in the world for
trading overseas equities, accounting for
59 per cent of foreign equities turnover
in 1994;
• the world’s largest foreign exchange
market;
• one of the world’s largest financial
derivatives markets;
• the greatest concentration of international
bond dealers, handling 75 per cent of the
secondary market in international bonds
in 1994;
• important markets for transactions in
commodities; and
• a full range of ancillary and support
services—legal, accountancy and
management consultancy—which
contribute to London’s strength as a
financial centre.
British financial institutions’ net overseas
earnings amounted to £20,400 million in
1994, up by nearly a third on 1993.
DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCIAL
SERVICES
The growth in international movements of
capital in the 1960s and 1970s mainly took
the form of increased bank lending and
foreign exchange trading. London became the
international centre of this activity,
particularly in the eurocurrency markets (see
p. 225). During the 1980s, with increasing
international competition in financial services
and developments in technology, London’s
securities markets grew rapidly. Edinburgh also
developed as a centre for fund management.
Some traditional distinctions between
financial institutions have been eroded, so
that single firms supply a broader range of
services, both in domestic and international
markets. There has also been a significant
deregulation of Britain’s financial services.
Major landmarks include:
• the abolition of exchange controls in 1979;
• the abolition in 1981 of the Reserve Asset
Ratio requirement, under which banks
had to hold 12.5 per cent of their
deposits as liquid assets with the Bank of
England;
• the Building Societies Act 1986 and
subsequent proposals to further ease
controls on building societies (see p. 219),
• ‘Big Bang’, also in 1986 (see p. 224); and
• the Friendly Societies Act 1992 (see p. 220).
The foresight panel for financial
services, one of the 15 panels
established under the Technology
Foresight Programme co-ordinated
by the Office of Science and
Technology (see p. 318), identified
future major changes expected in
financial services in its report issued
in 1995. These include:
• widespread use of multimedia for
delivering retail financial services,
• more sophisticated customer
profiling;
• greater choice of financial
products; and
• a substantial reduction in the use
of cheques.
SUPERVISION
The Government is committed to improving
market efficiency by providing a regulatory
regime which takes account of developments
and provides a proper framework for the
sector, in which free and fair competition can
take place. HM Treasury is the government
department with responsibility for financial
services. In particular, it is responsible for
legislation covering the supervision of banks,
building societies, friendly societies and
investment businesses, which are subject to
the regulatory system established under the
214
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Banking Act 1987 (see p. 216), the Building
Societies Act 1986 (see p. 219) and the
Financial Services Act 1986 (see below). The
Treasury also oversees the Securities and
Investments Board (SIB).
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) is responsible for company law and
insolvency matters, and for investigations and
prosecutions under the Financial Services,
Insolvency and Companies Acts.
Investigations are carried out with the Serious
Fraud Office (see p. 89). The DTPs
responsibilities include prudential supervision
of insurance undertakings, European
Community (EC) insurance directives, and
general questions affecting the insurance
industry. It also has powers to investigate
‘insider dealing’—securities trading carried
out on the basis of privileged access to
relevant information.
The Treasury negotiates and implements
EC directives relating to financial services and
is responsible for arrangements with overseas
regulators for exchanging information.
Various EC directives give or will give
banking, insurance and investment services
firms the freedom to operate throughout the
European Union (EU) on the basis of their
home state authorisation.
The Treasury is also charged with
encouraging international liberalisation in
financial services. Members of the World
Trade Organisation reached agreement in July
1995 on a liberalisation package covering
banking, insurance and securities trade.
Negotiations were conducted under the
General Agreement on Trade in Services,
which entered into force as part of the
GATT Uruguay Round conclusions (see
p. 173). International supervisory forums
include the Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision and the International
Organisation of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO). IOSCO is the primary international
meeting place for regulatory authorities.
Under the Financial Services Act 1986,
investment businesses (those dealing in,
arranging, managing or giving advice on
investments or operating collective
investment schemes) require authorisation
and are subject to rules on the conduct of
business. Most of the Act’s powers are
delegated to the SIB, which has recognised a
number of self-regulating organisations
(SROs) and recognised professional bodies
(RPBs). It has a duty to assist SROs and
RPBs to fulfil their regulatory functions.
Most investment businesses are authorised
under the Act by virtue of membership of
one of these. The SROs are:
• the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (IMRO), whose members
include merchant banks and pension fund
managers with mainly corporate clients;
• the Securities and Futures Authority
(SFA), whose members include member
firms of the London Stock Exchange, as
well as futures brokers and dealers, and
eurobond dealers; and
• the Personal Investment Authority
(PIA), which came into operation in
July 1994 and is the main single
regulator for retail investment services;
these cover the marketing and provision
of advice on products like life
assurance, pension funds, unit trusts
and investment trusts.
Other information relating to supervision
and regulation is contained in subsequent
sections.
BANK OF ENGLAND
The Bank of England was established in 1694
by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a
corporate body. Its entire capital stock was
acquired by the Government in 1946. The
Bank acts as banker to the Government,
holding its main accounts, managing Britain’s
reserves of gold and foreign exchange,
arranging new government borrowing and
managing the stock of its existing debt. The
Bank’s main objectives are to:
• ensure the soundness of the financial
system through the direct supervision of
banks and specialised City institutions;
• promote the efficiency and
competitiveness of the financial system,
especially in domestic and international
payment and settlement systems; and
• provide advice on and implement the
Government’s monetary policy.
215
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Banking Act 1987 assigns the Bank of
England the overriding objective of
protecting depositors. To this end institutions
intending to take deposits from the public
must gain authorisation from the Bank and
submit to its continuing supervision. In order
to be and remain authorised, an institution
has to satisfy the Bank that it has:
• adequate capital and liquidity;
• a realistic business plan;
• adequate systems and controls;
• adequate provision for bad and doubtful
debts; and
• ensured that its business is carried out
with integrity and skill, and in a prudent
manner.
The Bank’s supervision is ‘prudential’—it
sets minimum standards but offers no
guarantee that authorised institutions will not
fail or that investors or depositors will be
fully compensated. However, if an authorised
bank fails, depositors are entitled to limited
compensation from the Deposit Protection
Fund, financed by contributions levied on the
banking system.
Under the deposit protection scheme,
customers of banks had been entitled
to protection for up to 75 per cent of
the first £20,000 deposited in each
bank in the event ot the bank ceasing
to trade. Under a separate scheme,
building society depositors had been
guaranteed up to 90 per cent.
Both schemes have been brought
into line with the EC’s Deposit
Guarantee Directive, which took
effect in Britain in July 1995. As a
result, the protection for both
schemes is now 90 per cent of the
first £20,000, and the schemes cover
depositors of banks and building
societies at their branches throughout
the European Union.
The Bank is the Government’s agent for
selling marketable debt. It maintains the
register of holdings of government
securities on behalf of the Treasury, and
manages the Exchange Equalisation
Account holding the Government’s official
reserves of gold, foreign exchange, Special
Drawing Rights (SDRs—claims on the
International Monetary h und) and European
Currency Units (ECUs). The reserves are
used to check undue fluctuations in the
exchange value of sterling and to enable
government departments to meet their
foreign currency needs.
The Bank of England provides
technical assistance and training to
central banks in other countries,
especially the Commonwealth. In 1990
it established its Centre for Central
Banking Studies to give a more
specific focus to these activities and
to meet additional demands. Since
1990 the Centre has trained over 2,000
participants from more than 100
countries and co-ordinated technical
assistance to over 30 central banks.
The Bank is able to influence money-
market conditions through its dealings
with the discount houses (see p. 220)
which give it powerful influence over
short-term interest rates. Discount houses
hold mainly Treasury, local authority and
commercial bills, and negotiable certificates
of deposit financed by short-term loans
from the banks. If on a particular day there
is a shortage of cash in the banking system
as a result, for example, of large tax
payments, the Bank relieves the shortage
either by buying bills from the discount
houses or by lending directly to them. This
permits banks to replenish their cash
balances at the Bank by recalling some of
their short-term loans to the discount houses.
The Bank of England has the sole right in
England and Wales to issue banknotes, which
are backed by government and other
securities. Three Scottish and four Northern
Ireland banks also issue notes. These issues,
apart from a small amount specified by
legislation for each bank, must be fully
covered by holdings of Bank of England
notes and coinage. Responsibility for the
provision of coin lies with the Royal Mint, a
government executive agency.
The Bank of England seeks to ensure that
216
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Britain’s financial markets are efficient and
I competitive. To this end it runs two
securities settlement systems with in-built
payment arrangements—the Central Gilts
Office and the Central Moneymarket Office.
The Bank is playing a full part in the work
of the European Monetary Institute in
Frankfurt, established in 1994 (see p. 119).
It is also involved in arranging the
implementation of several EC directives. The
Bank has developed a framework for the
implementation in Britain in 1995 of the EC
Capital Adequacy Directive, which sets
minimum capital requirements for market
risks in the operations of banks and
investment firms.
BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES
In addition to banks, the chief institutions
offering banking services are the building
societies and the Department for National
Savings. The ‘single passport’ system created
by the EC’s Second Banking Directive allows
‘credit institutions’ (banks and building
societies) to operate throughout the European
Economic Area (EEA) on the basis of their
home-state authorisation.
A useful distinction can be made between
‘retail’ and ‘wholesale’ banking. Retail
banking is primarily for personal customers
and small businesses. Its main services are
cash deposit and withdrawal facilities, and
money transmission systems. Competition
between banks and building societies in
providing services for personal customers has
intensified, and there have been a number of
mergers or takeovers.
Wholesale business involves taking large
deposits at higher rates of interest, deploying
funds in money-market instruments (see p.
225) and making large loans and investments.
Nearly all banks in Britain engage in some
wholesale activities and some, such as the
merchant and overseas banks, centre their
business on them. Many of the dealings are
conducted on the inter-bank market—that is,
between banks themselves.
In 1995 there were 379 institutions
authorised under the Banking Act 1987,
including clearing banks, investment banks,
branches of overseas banks from outside the
EEA, discount houses and banking
subsidiaries of both banking and non-banking
institutions from Britain and overseas. A
further 102 branches of banks from EEA
countries were entitled to take deposits in
Britain; such ‘European authorised
institutions’ are authorised by the relevant
authority in their home country. Of the total
of 481 banks, 307 were members of the
British Bankers’ Association, the main
representative body for British banks.
Retail Banks
The major retail banks have a significant
branch network, offering a full range of
financial services to both individuals and
companies. Services generally available
include interest-bearing current accounts,
deposit accounts, various kinds of loan
arrangements and a full range of money
transmission facilities increasingly featuring
plastic card technology.
The major banks in England and Wales
are HSBC (including its subsidiary Midland),
Barclays, Lloyds, National Westminster, the
TSB Group and Abbey National; and in
Scotland the Bank of Scotland and the Royal
Bank of Scotland. Other important retail banks
are the Clydesdale Bank, the Co-operative
Bank, the Yorkshire Bank and Alliance &
Leicester Giro. Northern Ireland is served by
branch networks of four major banking groups.
With the growth of financial services and
fewer restrictions on competition among
financial institutions, the major banks have
diversified their services. Most now own
finance houses, leasing and factoring companies,
merchant banks, securities dealers, insurance
companies and unit trust companies.
The banks offer loan facilities to
companies and have become important
suppliers of finance for small firms. A loan
guarantee scheme is supported by the banks,
under which 70 per cent (85 per cent in
certain cases) of the value of bank loans to
small companies is guaranteed by the
Government. Some banks have set up special
subsidiaries to provide venture capital for
companies (see p. 224). Most retail banks
maintain overseas subsidiaries and are active
in eurocurrency markets (see p. 225).
217
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The total liabilities/assets of the retail
banks amounted to over £1,366,000 million
in the second quarter of 1995. Liabilities are
made up of sterling deposits, foreign currency
deposits, items in suspense or transmission,
and capital and other funds. T he banks main
liquid assets consist of money at call (mainly
short-term loans to discount houses), their
holdings of Treasury and other bills, short-
dated British government securities and
balances at the Bank of England. They also
hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio
investments (mainly longer-dated British
government securities) or trade investments.
The main retail banks operate through over
11,000 branches and sub-branches in Britain.
National Westminster has the largest number,
with 2,410 branches, followed by Barclays
(2,090), Lloyds (1,799), Midland (1,706), TSB
(1,235), the Royal Bank of Scotland (732),
Abbey National (675) and the Bank of
Scotland (430). Around three-quarters of
adults in Britain have a current account and
over one-third a deposit account.
Payment Systems
Apart from credit and debit card
arrangements, the main payment systems are
run by three separate companies operating
under an umbrella organisation, the
Association for Payment Clearing Services
(APACS), of which 23 banks and building
societies are members. One covers bulk paper
clearings—cheques and credit transfers. A
second deals with high-value clearings for
same-day settlement, namely the nationwide
electronic transfer service Clearing House
Automated Payment System (CHAPS) and
the cheque-based Town Clearing (which
operates only in the City of London). A third
covers bulk electronic clearing for standing
orders and direct debits. Membership of each
company is open to any bank, building
society or other financial institution meeting
the criteria for appropriate supervision and
volume of transactions.
Plastic Cards
The use of plastic cards has become much
more widespread, and around 84 million are
in circulation. Among the main types are
cheque guarantee cards, debit cards, credit
cards, charge cards and cash cards. Often
cards combine one or more of these functions.
One of the most popular uses is for obtaining
cash from automated teller machines (ATMs).
All the major retail banks and building
societies participate in nationwide networks of
ATMs, which give customers access to cash
and other services for up to 24 hours a day.
About 19,000 ATMs were in operation at the
end of 1994.
Cheque guarantee cards entitle holders to
cheque-cashing facilities in participating
institutions and guarantee retailers that
transactions up to the specified guarantee
limit—typically £50 or £100—will be
honoured. Uniform eurocheques supported by
a eurocheque card are available from all major
banks. They may be used to obtain cash or
make payments in Britain, elsewhere in
Europe and in a few other overseas countries.
Cheques are made out in the currency of the
country in which they are being used.
Credit cards are widely accepted
throughout Britain. They are mainly issued
by banks. Most cards are affiliated to one of
the two major international credit card
organisations, Visa and MasterCard. There
are a growing number of ‘affinity’ cards,
where the card is linked to an organisation
such as a charity or trade union. Credit card
users receive a statement each month and
must pay off a minimum of the amount
owed, interest then becoming chargeable on
the remainder. Most users though choose to
pay off the full amount owed each month. A
charge card, like a credit card, enables the
holder to make retail payments, but often has
greater facilities than are available from a
credit card, such as no credit limit or a very
high limit. They are usually available only to
those with relatively high income or assets;
the credit balance must be settled in full each
month. Some of the major retailers issue
cards for use within their own outlets.
More people are now paying for goods by
debit cards issued by the major retail banks
and building societies. Payments can then be
deducted directly from the purchaser’s
current account. There are two debit card
schemes in operation: Visa and Switch.
218
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
; Electronic Banking
Scottish clearing banks have been at the
forefront in Britain in introducing information
technology, pioneering the use of cash
dispensers, satellite payment systems and
electronic home, office and corporate banking.
The number of home banking services run by
the banks and building societies is growing.
I Customers use a telephone or personal
: ! computer to obtain account information, make
transfers and pay bills.
The National Westminster and
Midland banks in conjunction with
the telecommunications operator BT
launched a £50 million electronic
y cashless banking experiment,
r ‘Mondex’, in Swindon (Wiltshire) in
mid-1995. About 40,000 adults in
Swindon have been given electronic
cards. The cards are ‘charged’ with
money by the user making a call to
his or her bank from a new type of
telephone, or using a specially
adapted cash machine, and the
money debited from the user’s
account. The cards allow a variety of
financial transactions without the
need for cash, including the payment
of bills and the purchase of goods at
participating retailers through
electronic tills.
^ Building Societies
Building societies are mutual institutions,
is owned by their savers and borrowers, and
are the main source of housing finance in
Britain. They make long-term loans, mostly
a at variable rates of interest, against the
t security of property—usually private
'] dwellings purchased for owner-occupation,
i Around 60 per cent of adults have building
j society savings accounts. A variety of
}! savings schemes have been established, and
1 a growing number of societies provide
H current account facilities such as cheque
' books and ATMs.
There are 80 registered societies, of which
79 are members of the Building Societies’
Association. Building societies’ assets
totalled £301,000 million at the end of
1994; about £37,000 million was advanced
in new mortgages in 1994. The three
largest—the Halifax, Nationwide and
Woolwich—account for about one-half of
the total assets of all societies. The Council
of Mortgage Lenders is a trade body
established in 1989 for all mortgage
lending institutions, including building
societies, insurance companies, finance
houses and banks.
The Building Societies Act 1986
enabled societies to diversify into banking
and other services and established the
Building Societies Commission to carry
out the prudential supervision of
building societies. Up to 25 per cent of a
society’s commercial assets may be used
for purposes other than loans on first
mortgage of owner-occupied houses,
including as much as 15 per cent in
other types of asset such as unsecured
loans. Directly or through subsidiaries,
societies may offer services within the
general areas of banking, investment,
insurance, trusteeship, executorship and
estate agency.
Following a review of the 1986 Act, the
Government announced its intention to
replace the current legislative framework
governing building societies’ powers by a
more permissive regime. At the same time,
proposals were put forward to increase the
accountability of societies’ boards to their
members, for example, by improving the
information given to members about their
rights as shareholders.
As a result of the review, societies will,
among other things, be able to make
unsecured loans to businesses and wholly
own a general insurance company.
Measures have also been taken under the
Deregulation and Contracting Out Act
1994 (see p. 202) to widen further the
powers of building societies and remove or
reduce certain statutory burdens. For
example, societies will be able to raise up
to 50 per cent (up from 40 per cent) of
their funds on the wholesale market.
Major changes are taking place in the
structure of the industry:
219
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• The Halifax merged with the Leeds
Permanent Building Society in August
1995. It plans to ask its members to
vote for the conversion of the enlarged
Halifax into a public limited company,
becoming a retail bank. It would be the
second society to convert to a bank
under provisions in the 1986 Act,
following Abbey National in 1989,
and would become Britain’s third
largest bank.
• The Cheltenham & Gloucester
Building Society was taken over by
Lloyds Bank in August 1995, and the
National and Provincial Building
Society is being taken over by Abbey
National.
Friendly Societies
Friendly societies have traditionally been
unincorporated societies of individuals,
offering their members a limited range of
financial services, particularly provision for
retirement and against loss of income
through sickness or unemployment. The
Friendly Societies Act 1992 enabled
friendly societies to incorporate, take on
new powers and offer a broad range of
financial services through subsidiaries.
Merchant Banks
Merchant banks have traditionally been
concerned primarily with accepting, or
guaranteeing, commercial bills and with
sponsoring capital issues on behalf of their
customers. Today they undertake a
diversified range of activities. After the
‘Big Bang’ some merchant banks acquired
securities trading operations. Merchant
banks have important roles in equity and
debt markets and the provision of advice
and financial services to industrial
companies, especially where mergers,
takeovers and other forms of corporate
reorganisation are involved. Management of
investment holdings, including trusts,
pensions and other funds, is another
important function. The sector is split
between independent houses and those
which are part of larger banking groups.
Overseas Banks
A total of 257 banks incorporated overseas
are represented in Britain, including 28 from
Japan and 23 from the United States. A total
of 102 institutions incorporated in Britain are
subsidiaries of overseas companies. They
offer a comprehensive banking service in
many parts of the world and engage in
financing trade not only between Britain
and other countries but also between third-
party countries.
British-based Overseas Banks
A small number of banks have their head
offices in Britain, but operate mainly abroad,
often specialising in particular regions.
Standard Chartered, which is represented in
Asia, Africa and the Middle East, is the
major example of this type of bank.
Discount Houses
There are seven discount houses authorised
under the Banking Act 1987. They act as
financial intermediaries between the Bank of
England and the rest of the banking sector,
promoting an orderly flow of short-term
funds. They guarantee to tender for the
whole of the weekly offer of the
Government’s Treasury bills, which are
instruments to raise funds over a period of
up to six months. In return for acting as
intermediaries, the discount houses have
secured borrowing facilities at the Bank of
England, acting as ‘lender of last resort’.
Assets of the discount houses consist
mainly of Treasury and commercial bills,
negotiable certificates of deposit and
short-term loans. Their liabilities are for the
most part short-term deposits.
Department for National Savings
The Department for National Savings, a
government department, contributes to
government borrowing and aims to encourag
saving by offering personal savers a range of
investments designed to meet various
requirements. Certain National Savings
products offer tax exempt returns. In March
220
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
1995 the total amount invested in National
Savings was £51,900 million. Sales of National
Savings products totalled £9,200 million in
1994—95. After allowing for repayments, the
net contribution to government funding was
£3,577 million. The largest single contribution,
of £1,485 million, was from Premium Bonds
(where interest is in the form of prizes chosen
by lottery). Other important products include:
• Savings Certificates, which either pay a
fixed rate of interest alone or a lower
fixed rate of interest combined with
index-linking;
• Income and Capital Bonds;
• Pensioners’ Guaranteed Income Bonds,
where interest is paid monthly and rates
are fixed for five years at a time;
• Children’s Bonus Bonds, which are
designed to accumulate capital sums for
those under 21;
• Ordinary and Investment Accounts,
where deposits and withdrawals can be
made at post offices throughout Britain;
and
• FIRST Option Bonds, which offer a
guaranteed rate of interest that is fixed
for one year.
INSURANCE
London is the world’s leading centre for
insurance and for placing international
reinsurance; it handles an estimated 20 per cent
of the general insurance business placed on the
international market. There are two broad
categories of insurance: long-term life
insurance, where contracts may be for periods
of many years; and general insurance, including
accident and short-term health insurance,
where contracts are for a year or less.
Authorised insurance companies are supervised
by the Department of Trade and Industry
under the Insurance Companies Act 1982.
In addition to the British companies and
Lloyd’s (see below), a large number of
overseas companies are represented, with
r which many British companies have formed
: close relationships. Some British companies
confine their activities to domestic business
but most large companies undertaking
i general business transact a substantial
amount overseas through branches and
agencies or affiliated local companies.
Over 800 companies are authorised to
carry on one or more classes of insurance
business in Britain. The industry employs
about 370,000 people. Some companies are
mutual institutions, owned by their policy
holders. About 440 companies belong to the
Association of British Insurers (ABI).
EC directives introducing the ‘single¬
licence’ system in insurance came into force
in July 1994. Life and non-life direct insurers
may operate throughout the EEA on the basis
of authorisation in their home state.
Long-term Insurance
As well as providing life cover, life insurance
is a vehicle for saving and investment because
premiums are invested in securities and other
assets. About 30 per cent of adults have life
assurance policies. The total long-term
insurance assets under management by
companies representing about 99 per cent of
the British market in 1994 was £406,900
million on behalf of their worldwide
operations. Long-term insurance is handled
by around 200 companies.
General Insurance
General insurance business is undertaken by
insurance companies and by underwriters at
Lloyd’s. It includes fire, accident, general
liability, short-term life, motor, marine,
aviation and transport risks. Total ABI
member company premium income
worldwide in 1993 was £34,000 million, of
which £21,000 million was earned in Britain.
Lloyd’s
Lloyd’s, the origins of which go back to the
17th century, is an incorporated society of
private insurers in London. Although its
activities were originally confined to marine
insurance, a considerable worldwide market
for the transaction of other classes of
insurance business, such as aviation and
motor insurance, has been built up.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for
insurance administered by the Council of
221
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Lloyd’s and Lloyd’s Regulatory and Market
Boards. Business is carried out for individual
elected underwriting members, or ‘names’,
trading with unlimited liability in competition
with each other and with insurance companies.
Since January 1994 corporate members with
limited liability have been trading alongside
individual members. Both are required to
satisfy certain financial requirements and
maintain set levels of deposits at Lloyd s.
For the 1995 year of account, there is total
market capacity of £10,198 million provided
by 14,800 members grouped into 170
syndicates. Each syndicate is managed by an
underwriting agent responsible for appointing
a professional underwriter to accept insurance
risks and settle claims on the syndicate
members’ behalf. With the exception of
motor insurance business, insurance may only
be placed through accredited Lloyd’s brokers,
who negotiate with Lloyd’s syndicates on
behalf of the insured. Reinsurance constitutes
a large part of Lloyd’s business.
Lloyd’s net premium income in 1992, the
most recent year for which figures are available,
was £6,331 million. Lloyd’s has suffered severe
losses, partly as a result of a series of natural
disasters, including Hurricane Andrew, which
struck Florida and Louisiana in 1992, and also
as a result of claims arising from asbestosis and
pollution. The Council is taking action to tackle
the consequent financial problems through a
£2,800 million package of measures, including a
levy on ‘names’ and changes to accounting
arrangements which would release profits from
1993 and subsequent accounting years.
Institute of London Underwriters
The Institute of London Underwriters,
formed in 1884 as a trade association for
marine underwriters, now provides a market
where member insurance companies transact
marine, energy, commercial transport and
aviation business. The Institute issues
combined policies in its own name on risks
which are underwritten by member
companies. The gross premium income
processed by the Institute for its member
companies in 1994 was nearly £2,100 million.
About half of the 65 member companies are
branches or subsidiaries of overseas companies.
Insurance Brokers
Insurance brokers acting on behalf of the
insured are a valuable part of the company
market and play an essential role in the
Lloyd’s market. Smaller brokers mainly deal
with the general public or specialise in a
particular type of commercial insurance.
Medium to large brokers almost exclusively
handle commercial insurance, with the largest
dealing with risks worldwide. Some brokers
specialise in reinsurance business. The
Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977
makes provision for the voluntary registration
and regulation of insurance brokers by the
Insurance Brokers Registration Council. Only
those registered with the Council can use the
title ‘insurance broker’. In July 1995, 14,600
individuals were registered with the Council,!
through 1,215 partnerships or sole tradership
and over 2,450 limited companies.
Other independent intermediaries may alsl
arrange insurance, but are not allowed to use
the title ‘insurance broker’. There are about
7,000 independent intermediaries operating
under the Association of British Insurers
code of practice.
INVESTMENT
Britain has a great deal of expertise in fund
management, which involves managing funds
on the investor’s behalf, or advising investors
on how to invest their funds. The main types
of investment fund include pension schemes,
life assurance, unit trusts and investment trust,
Collective investment schemes are
becoming more important,
particularly in the context of the
Government’s wish to encourage
wider share ownership. Accordingly,
regulations are planned to allow a
new type of scheme—open ended
investment companies (OEICs). They
will be similar to unit trusts, but an
investor in an OEIC will buy shares
rather than units in the company.
The new schemes should enable
British companies to compete on an
equal footing with similar schemes
operating elsewhere in the EU.
222
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Pension Funds
Over 13 million people belong to
occupational pension schemes and more
than 5 million to personal pension schemes.
Most occupational pension schemes pay
benefits related to final salary, although some
are on a ‘money purchase’ basis where
benefits depend on the size of the accrued
funds. Benefits are normally funded in
advance by employer (and wholly employee)
contributions, which are held and invested by
trustees on behalf of beneficiaries. Pension
funds are major investors in securities
markets, holding around 30 per cent of
securities listed on the London Stock
Exchange. Total British pension fund net
assets were worth about £451,000 million at
the end of 1994.
The Pensions Act 1995 (see p. 417)
includes provisions for several measures
designed to increase confidence in the
security of occupational pensions, including:
• a statutory minimum solvency
requirement;
• the establishment of an Occupational
Pensions Regulator with powers to
investigate and to impose sanctions; and
• a new compensation scheme to protect
members against dishonest removal of
assets.
Unit Trusts
Authorised unit trusts are open-ended
mutual or pooled investment vehicles which
place funds in a wide range of securities
markets all over the world. Investors with
relatively small amounts to invest are able to
benefit from diversified and expertly managed
portfolios. The industry has grown rapidly
during the last decade, and in 1995 there
were nearly 1,600 authorised unit trusts. By
September 1995 total assets were £107,800
million, £14,000 million higher than a year
earlier. Unit trust management groups are
represented by the Association of Unit Trusts
and Investment Funds and regulated by
IMRO. The trusts themselves are authorised
by the SIB.
Investment Trusts
Investment trust companies, which also offer
the opportunity to diversify risk on a
relatively small lump-sum investment or
through regular savings, are listed on the
London Stock Exchange and their shares are
traded in the usual way. They must invest
mostly in securities, and the trusts
themselves are exempt from capital gains tax.
Assets are purchased mainly out of
shareholders’ funds, although investment
trusts are also allowed to borrow money for
investment. There were 314 members of the
Association of Investment Trust Companies
in October 1995, with £48,800 million worth
of assets under management. The largest
trust is the venture capital company 31, which
was floated on the London Stock Exchange
in 1994.
Growth in Share Ownership
Privatisation (see p. 200) and employee share
schemes (see p. 190) have both helped to
increase share ownership, in line with the
Government’s policy of encouraging wider
share ownership. About 10 million adults—
22 per cent of the adult population in Great
Britain—hold shares.
Another major stimulus to raising share
ownership by individuals has been the
introduction of Personal Equity Plans
(PEPs), which allow investment in shares,
unit trusts and investment trusts.
Dividends and capital gains on shares held in
a PEP are exempt from income tax and
capital gains tax, and withdrawals from PEPs
are normally tax free. Since their
introduction in 1987, over £16,000 million
had been invested in some 4.7 million PEPs
by April 1994. In 1993-94, 1.4 million
general PEPs and 190,000 single company
PEPs were opened.
The November 1994 Budget included
proposals for PEPs to be extended to cover
certain corporate bonds (except those issued
by financial services companies), preference
shares and ‘convertibles’ (bonds or preference
shares which can eventually be converted into
a company’s ordinary shares). The first of the
new PEPs were offered in July 1995.

SPECIAL FINANCING INSTITUTIONS
Several specialised institutions offer finance
and support to personal and corporate sector
borrowers. Among public sector agencies are
Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, the Welsh Development Agency,
the Industrial Development Board for
Northern Ireland and ECGD (see p. 176).
The main private sector institutions are
described below.
Finance and Leasing Companies
The Finance and Leasing Association
represents the interests of companies offering
motor finance, consumer credit, and business
finance and leasing. Its 158 full and associate
members undertook new business worth
£32,000 million in 1994.
Factoring Companies
Factoring comprises a range of financial
services allowing companies to obtain
finance in exchange for outstanding
invoices due to them. Factoring has
developed as a major financial service since
the early 1960s. Member companies of the
Association of British Factors and
Discounters handled business worth
£24,400 million in 1994.
Venture Capital Companies
Venture capital companies offer medium-
and long-term equity financing for new and
developing businesses when such funds are
not easily or directly available from
traditional sources, such as the stock
market or banks. The British Venture
Capital Association has 107 full members
and makes up virtually all the industry.
Many venture capital companies are
subsidiaries of other financial institutions,
including banks, insurance companies and
pension funds. To help encourage the
availability of equity and long-term finance
for new and growing businesses, the
Government facilitated the establishment
from April 1995 of new venture capital
trusts (see p. 198).
FINANCIAL MARKETS
The City of London’s financial markets
include the London Stock Exchange, the
foreign exchange market, the financial futures
and options market, eurobond and
eurocurrency markets, Lloyd’s insurance
market (see p. 221), and bullion and
commodity markets. The securities markets
are supervised jointly by the Treasury, the
Bank of England, SIB and the London Stock
Exchange, among others.
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange plays a vital
role in maintaining London’s position as one
of the world’s most important financial
centres. Its main administrative centre is in
London and there are regional offices in
Belfast, Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds and
Manchester. As a result of a set of legal
reforms implemented in 1986 and known as
‘Big Bang’, the Exchange has changed
radically over recent years. The most
fundamental change has been the move to
screen-based trading away from the
traditional market floor. CREST, a new
computerised settlement system for shares
and other securities, is being developed by a
project team led by the Bank of England and
will replace Talisman, the Exchange’s current
settlement system.
The Exchange provides a trading platform
for domestic equities with its automated price
information system, SEAQ, which
continuously updates share prices and can be
viewed on a wide range of information systems.
For trading in foreign equities, London’s
leading international equity market is
supported by the Exchange’s electronic price
quotation system, SEA(£International.
More than 2,600 British and overseas
companies, with a market capitalisation of
£4,800,000 million, are listed on the Exchange.
In 1994 turnover of British and Irish equities
reached £606,000 million, while turnover of
foreign equities amounted to £719,000 million.
The gilt-edged market (see p. 167), allows
the Government to raise money by issuing loan
stock through the Bank of England. The
Exchange offers a secondary or trading
224
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
market where investors can buy or sell gilts.
Average daily turnover in the market totalled
£6,100 million in 1994.
Recent developments in share trading have
included:
• the establishment in June 1995 of the
Stock Exchange’s new public equity
market, the Alternative Investment
Market, which caters mainly for small,
young or developing companies wishing
to raise public finance and to have their
shares more widely traded—it operates
within a lighter regulatory framework
than is applied to shares on the main
stock market;
• the opening in September 1995 of
Tradepoint, a computer-based, ‘order-
driven’ share dealing system in
competition with the Stock Exchange;
and
• the introduction in September 1995 of a
service run by Electronic Share
Information and ShareLink, which allows
investors to deal in shares on the
Internet.
Money Markets
The London money markets comprise the
interbank deposit markets plus a range of
other instruments, usually short-term in
maturity. Banks are the major participants in
these markets, and are supervised by the
Bank of England. The Bank also supervises
other institutions which operate in the
foreign exchange and other wholesale money
markets.
Since 1986, large companies have been
permitted to issue sterling commercial paper
(SCP), which takes the form of negotiable
bearer debt securities with a maturity of up
to one year. The range of qualifying issuers
of SCP has broadened since 1986 to include,
for example, banks, building societies and
overseas public authorities.
Euromarkets
These are markets in currencies lent or
invested outside their domestic marketplace,
particularly as a means of financing
international trade and investment.
Transactions can thus be carried out in
eurodollars, eurodeutschemarks, euroyen and
so on. London is at the heart of the
euromarkets and houses most of the major
international banks and securities firms.
Distinctions between markets have been
breaking down and the euromarkets form a
major part of the wider international money
and capital markets. Participants in the
markets include multinational trading
corporations, financial companies,
governments and international organisations
like the World Bank and the European
Investment Bank.
The euro-securities markets have grown
considerably in recent years because the
instruments traded on them, including
eurobonds, euro-medium-term notes
(EMTNs) and euro-commercial paper, are
seen as flexible alternatives to bank loans.
EMTN programmes were introduced in
1986, and EMTN issues rose sevenfold
between 1990 and 1993. British building
societies are prominent among EMTN
issuers. There is a growing private sector
market in ECU-denominated deposits,
securities and eurobonds.
Foreign Exchange Market
London is the world’s biggest centre for
foreign exchange trading, accounting for
over a quarter of global net daily turnover
in foreign exchange. Average daily turnover
in London amounts to about US
$300,000 million.
The foreign exchange market consists of
telephone and electronic links between the
participants, which include banks, other
financial institutions and several foreign
exchange broking firms acting as
intermediaries. It provides those engaged in
international trade and investment with
foreign currencies for their transactions.
The banks are in close contact with
financial centres abroad and are able to
quote buying and selling rates for both
immediate (‘spot’) and forward
transactions in a range of currencies and
maturities. The forward market enables
traders and dealers who, at a given date in
225
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the future, wish to receive or make a
specific foreign currency payment, to
contract in advance to sell or buy the foreign
currency involved for sterling at a fixed
exchange rate.
Derivatives
Financial derivatives are contracts to buy or
sell, at a future date, financial instruments
such as equities, bonds or money-market
instruments. Their use has grown rapidly,
especially among companies and investment
institutions, and instruments have become
more complex, especially as advances have
been made in information technology.
Derivatives offer a means of hedging against
changes in prices, exchange rates and interest
rates. They include:
• futures—agreements to buy or sell
financial instruments or physical
commodities at a future date;
• options—the right to buy or sell financial
instruments or physical commodities for
a stated period at a predetermined price;
and
• ‘over-the-counter’ products, including
swaps—a foreign exchange swap can
convert a money-market instrument in
one currency into a money-market
instrument in another.
Financial Futures and Options
Banks, other financial institutions, brokers
and individual traders are members of the
London International Financial Futures and
Options Exchange (LIFFE), which trades at
the Cannon Bridge development. Futures
contracts cover the purchase or sale of a fixed
amount of a commodity at a given date in the
future at a price agreed at the time of trade.
There is also dealing in options on the equity
of prominent British companies and in stock
index options. LIFFE has the most
internationally diverse range of financial
futures and options products of any exchange
in the world. Turnover on LIFFE totalled
153 million contracts in 1994, 50 per cent
more than in 1993.
London Bullion Market
Around 60 banks and other financial trading
companies comprise the London gold and
silver markets, which, like the foreign
exchange market, trade by telephone or other
electronic means. Five of the members of the
London Bullion Market Association meet
twice daily to establish a London fixing price
for gold—a reference point for worldwide
dealings. The silver fixing is held once a day.
Although much interest centres upon the
fixings, active dealing takes place throughout
the day. London and Zurich are the main
world centres for gold dealings.
Commodity, Shipping and Freight
Markets
Britain is a major international centre for
commodities trading and the home of many
of the related international trade
organisations. At the London Commodities
Exchange, futures in grains and potatoes are
traded, as are futures and options on ‘soft’
commodities (cocoa and coffee). White sugar,
raw sugar and dry freight index futures
contracts are also traded. The London Metal
Exchange is the primary base metals market
in the world, trading both spot and forward
contracts in aluminium, aluminium alloy,
copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc. The
International Petroleum Exchange is Europe’s
only energy futures exchange. Total turnover
of the three exchanges rose by 25 per cent in
1994 to nearly 66 million contracts.
The Baltic Exchange, which finds ships
for cargoes and cargoes for ships throughout
the world, is the world’s leading international
shipping market.
Other Services
DISTRIBUTION AND SALES
The distribution of goods, including food and
drink, to their point of sale by road, rail, air
and sea is a major economic activity. The large
retailers and wholesalers of food and drink and
clothing operate, either directly or through
contractors, extensive distribution networks.
226
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Wholesaling
There were 115,000 businesses, with a
turnover of £268,000 million (see Table 15.1),
engaged in wholesaling and dealing in Great
Britain in 1993. The industry has more than
850,000 employees in Britain.
In the food and drink trade almost all large
retailers have their own buying and central
distribution operations. Elsewhere in the
trade, voluntary ‘symbol’ groups (for example,
Spar and VG) have been formed by
wholesalers and small independent retailers.
This has helped many smaller retail outlets,
including traditional ‘corner shops’ and village
stores, to stay in business, as it has given
them the advantages of bulk buying and co¬
ordinated distribution.
London’s wholesale markets play a
significant part in the distribution of
foodstuffs. New Covent Garden is the main
market for fruit and vegetables, Smithfield for
meat and Billingsgate for fish.
The Co-operative Movement has its own
distribution organisation, the Co-operative
Wholesale Society (CWS). Retail co-operative
societies buy from the CWS, which is their
main supplier. The CWS is also the largest
co-operative retailer, with 675 stores located
in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the east and
south Midlands, and south-east and
northern England.
Retailing
In 1993 there were 202,000 retail businesses,
with 306,000 outlets, employing 2.3 million
people in Great Britain (see Table 15.2).
These range from national supermarket
chains to corner grocery shops and
newsagents, together employing 2.3 million
people. During recent years the large
multiple retailers have grown considerably,
tending to reduce numbers of stores but
increase outlet size and diversify product
ranges. Some, like Marks and Spencer, J.
Sainsbury and Tesco, have acquired retailers
or made franchise arrangements abroad. Of
the ten largest food retailers in Western
Europe, four are British.
Decline has been particularly evident
among small independent businesses and
retail co-operative societies (see above).
Sunday trading laws have been relaxed to
allow supermarkets, department stores and
other retailers to open for limited periods on
Sundays; smaller retailers are permitted to
open for longer hours than the larger stores.
The biggest supermarket groups are
Tesco, J. Sainsbury, Argyll (principally
Safeway) and Asda. These four had a market
share of 40 per cent of all food and drink
sold in 1994—95. Other important retailers are
Marks and Spencer, Somerfield and Kwik
Save—the latter is the leading discount food

retailer in Britain. Since the early 1990s
several overseas discount food retailers, such
as Aldi of Germany and Denmark’s Netto,
have entered the British market.
Retail co-operative societies are voluntary
organisations controlled by their members,
membership being open to anyone paying a
small deposit on a minimum share. Of the
5,000 retail co-operative outlets, over half sell
food and groceries.
Alcoholic drinks are sold mainly in
specialist ‘off licences’ and supermarkets,
which have roughly equal sales. The principal
off-licence chains are Cellar Five, Oddbins,
Threshers and Victoria Wine. The selling of
alcohol is closely controlled by law and only
permitted between certain hours.
The leading mixed retail businesses
include Marks and Spencer, Boots,
Woolworth (part of Kingfisher), Storehouse,
W. H. Smith, Argos, Littlewoods, Savacentre
(J. Sainsbury), John Menzies, Sears, Burton
Group and House of Fraser.
About 18 million people regularly buy all
kinds of goods and services through mail
order catalogues like Freemans, Great
Universal Stores, Empire and Littlewoods. In
1993 sales by general mail order totalled more
than £4,000 million, 3 per cent of all retail
sales. The largest selling items are clothing,
footwear, furniture, household textiles and
domestic electrical appliances.
Shopping Facilities
Britain has a wide range of complementary
shopping facilities inside and outside town and
city centres. One of the most significant trends
in retailing has been the spread of superstores,
many of which have been built away from
urban centres in recent years. While the 100
largest retailers account for about three-fifths
of retail sales, there continues to be a demand
for the products and services provided by
small, specialised shops. Encouraged by the
Government, the main multiple grocery
companies are turning their attention back to
town centres, redeveloping existing stores and
building smaller outlets, some aimed at the
convenience market. Examples include
Tesco’s ‘Metro’ format and J. Sainsbury’s
‘Capital’ stores.
Regional out-of-town shopping centres
have been established on sites offering good
access and parking facilities. One of the first
was the Metro Centre at Gateshead, which is
228
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
the largest of its kind in Europe; Merry Hill
at Dudley in the West Midlands attracted 25
million customers in 1994. Other centres
include Meadowhall in Sheffield and the
Lakeside Centre at Thurrock in Essex, both
opened in 1990. About one-half of total food
sales are accounted for by superstores away
from town centres, compared with a fifth at
the beginning of the 1980s. Retailers of
non-food goods, such as DIY products, toys,
furniture and electrical appliances, sportswear,
and office and computer products, have also
built outlets away from urban centres. There
is a strong trend towards grouping retail
warehouses into retail parks, often with food
and other facilities.
All new retail development requires
planning permission from the local government
planning authority. These authorities must
consult the appropriate central government
department before granting permission for
developments of 20,000 sq m (215,000 sq ft) or
more. The Government’s policy is to
encourage the provision of a broad range of
shopping facilities to the public. At the same
time it seeks to ensure that the effects of major
new retail developments, especially those
outside urban centres, do not undermine the
viability of existing town centres. The
Government is intensifying efforts to help
revitalise shopping and other facilities in town
centres where this is needed.
Rental Services
A broad range of rental services, many
franchised, are on offer throughout Britain
(see p. 233). These include hire of cars and
c other vehicles, televisions and video cassette
recorders, household appliances such as
washing machines and tumble dryers, tools
and heavy decorating equipment (ladders,
floor sanders and so on) and video films and
computer games. Retailing of many types of
service is dominated by chains, though
independent operators are still to be found in
most fields.
Auction Houses
Britain attracts buyers and sellers from
around the world and has a long tradition of
expertise and innovation in auctioneering. Its
chief auction houses are active in the
international auction markets for works of art,
trading on their acknowledged expertise. The
two largest houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s,
are established worldwide. In 1994 Sotheby’s
celebrated its 250th anniversary. Sotheby’s
handled sales valued at £868 million in
1994, while Christie’s sales amounted to
£820 million. Phillips and Bonhams are also
prominent auctioneers.
Other Trends
Many of the large multiple groups sell a
much greater number of goods and services
than previously. However, in some cases
extensive diversification has proved
unprofitable and, for example, large food
retailers are increasing their range of foods
instead. More emphasis is also being placed
on selling own-label goods (which now
account for up to one-half of goods on sale)
and environmentally friendly products,
including organic produce. Most superstores
and supermarkets offer fresh food, such as
meat, fish, vegetables and, in many cases,
bread baked on the premises, as well as
packaged foods. The major supermarket
chains also have their own petrol stations at
some of their bigger outlets (see p. 230).
‘Stores within stores’ are becoming more
common; for example, sportswear and sports
goods retailers are to be found in many of the
big mixed retail stores, while Laura Ashley,
the furnishings and fabrics retailer, has
opened facilities in Homebase (a DIY chain
owned by J. Sainsbury).
Several large retailers have issued their
own credit cards for regular customers in an
attempt to encourage sales, particularly of
high-value goods. Marks and Spencer also
offers financial services.
Information Technology
Information technology has become
increasingly central to distribution and
retailing. Computers monitor stock levels and
record sales figures through electronic point-
of-sale (EPOS) systems. EPOS systems read
a bar-code printed on the retail product that
229
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
holds price and product information and can
be used to generate orders for stock
replenishment as well as totalling up bills and
providing a receipt for customers.
Techniques such as ‘just-in-time’
ordering, in which produce arrives at the
store at the last possible moment before sale,
have become widespread as a result. Most
large retailers have set up electronic data
interchange (EDI) systems; these enable their
computers to communicate with those of
their suppliers, and transmit orders and
invoices electronically, so reducing errors and
saving time.
EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer at
point of sale) systems enable customers to
pay for purchases using debit cards which
automatically transfer funds from their bank
account. Several major EFTPOS schemes are
well established and the number of terminals
is growing rapidly.
‘Superscan’ technology—which
involves customers using an
electronic scanning device to work out
their own bills, thus avoiding the
need to queue at a check-out—is
currently undergoing trials in a
number of supermarkets. Electronic
home shopping, using a television and
telephone, and ‘online’ shopping,
where personal computers are linked
to databases, are already starting to
become established.
Vehicle, Vehicle Parts and Petrol Retailing
In Great Britain 275,000 people were
employed in 1995 in retailing motor vehicles
and parts, and in petrol stations. Many
businesses selling new vehicles are franchised
by the motor manufacturers. Drive-in fitting
centres sell tyres, exhaust systems, batteries,
clutches and other vehicle parts; the largest
chains include Kxvik-Fit and Associated
Tyre Services.
Over one-third of petrol stations are
owned by oil companies. The three
companies with the largest number of
outlets are Shell, Esso and BP. Unleaded
petrol accounts for more than half of petrol
sold. The majority of petrol stations are
self-service.
The number of petrol stations has been
reduced by about a half in the last decade as
owners focus on larger sites that can
accommodate the broad range of retail
services, including food, that are now
commonly available at petrol stations. Almost
one-fifth of petrol sold in Britain comes from
supermarket forecourts.
HOTELS, HOLIDAY CENTRES,
PUBLIC HOUSES AND CATERING
The hotel and catering trades, which include
public houses (pubs) and licensed bars,
employ 1.2 million people in Great Britain,
including:
• 302,000 in hotels and other residential
establishments;
• 336,000 in pubs and bars;
• 304,000 in restaurants, cafes and snack
bars; and
• 136,000 in clubs.
Around 161,000 self-employed people also
work in these sectors.
There are 52,000 hotels in Great Britain.
The largest hotel business is Forte, with 344
hotels in Britain. As well as catering and
leisure interests, Forte has substantial
overseas interests. At the other end of the
scale, numerous guest houses and hotels each
have fewer than 20 rooms. Holiday centres,
including holiday camps with full board, self¬
catering centres and caravan parks, are run by
Butlins, Holiday Club, Center Parcs, Warner
Holidays and Pontin’s.
Britain’s 100,000 restaurants offer cuisine
from virtually every country in the world.
Chinese, Indian, Italian and Greek
restaurants are among the most popular. Fast
food’ restaurants, an area where franchising
plays a significant role, are becoming more
widespread. They specialise in hamburgers,
chicken, pizza and a variety of other foods to
be eaten on the premises or taken away. The
most well-known chains, some of which are
US-owned, include Wimpy (hamburgers),
McDonald’s (hamburgers), Burger King
(hamburgers), KFC (chicken) and Pizza Hut.
230
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Traditional fish and chip shops are the other
main providers of cooked take-away food.
Sandwich bars proliferate in towns and cities,
typically in areas with high concentrations of
office workers.
About 77,000 public houses sell beer,
wines, soft drinks and spirits to adults for
consumption on the premises, and most also
provide hot and cold food; many have
separate facilities where children are allowed.
Some are owned by the large brewing
companies, which either provide managers to
run them or offer tenancy agreements; these
pubs tend to sell just their own brands of
beer, although some also offer ‘guest’ beers.
Others, called ‘free houses’, are independently
owned and managed and frequently serve a
variety of beers. Wine bars are normally
smaller than pubs and tend to specialise in
wine and food; they more closely resemble
bars in other parts of Europe.
Permitted opening hours for public houses
and bars in England and Wales were
extended in 1988; today the more popular
pubs and bars open from 11.00 to 23.00 from
Monday to Saturday (on Sunday pubs may
open between 12.00 and 22.30). The
introduction of liquor licences for ‘cafe-style’
premises allows children under 14 to
accompany their parents to places where
alcoholic drinks are served.
TOURISM AND TRAVEL
In the region of 1.5 million people, 25 per
cent more than a decade ago, are employed in
tourism. The industry contributes £33,000
million annually to the economy—4 per cent
of GDP. Britain is the world’s sixth leading
tourist destination, although its share of world
tourism earnings has fallen from 6 to 4.5 per
cent in the last ten years. By the year 2000
tourism is expected to be the biggest industry
in the world.
Britain’s tourist attractions include
theatres, museums, art galleries, and historic
houses, as well as shopping, sports and
business facilities. Domestic and foreign
tourists play an ever more important role in
supporting Britain’s national heritage, creative
arts and, to a lesser extent, sport.
Domestic tourism was worth £14,500
million in 1994 (see p. 40). Of British
residents opting to take their main holiday in
Britain, around half choose a traditional
seaside destination, such as Blackpool
(Lancashire), Bournemouth (Dorset) and
resorts in Devon and Cornwall. Short holiday
breaks (one to three nights), valued at
£2,200 million in 1993, make up an
increasingly significant part of the market.
Shopping accounts for about a quarter of all
expenditure on day trips. Scotland has several
skiing resorts.
Between 1980 and 1994 the number of
overseas visits to Britain grew by two-
thirds. In 1994 a record 21 million
overseas visitors came to Britain,
spending £10,000 million. An
estimated 63 per cent were from
Europe and 17 per cent from North
America, with the United States
supplying the largest number of any
single country. Business travel
accounts for about one-quarter of all
overseas tourism revenue.
Most British holiday-makers wishing to go
overseas buy ‘package holidays’ from travel
agencies, where the cost covers both transport
and accommodation. The most popular
package holiday destinations are Spain,
France and Greece. Long-haul holidays to
places like the United States, the Caribbean
and Australia are becoming more popular as
air fares come down. Winter skiing holidays
to resorts in Austria, France, Italy and
Switzerland and other countries inside and
outside Europe continue to attract large
numbers of Britons.
Britain has around 7,000 travel agencies,
nearly all of which belong to the Association
of British Travel Agents (ABTA). Although
most are small businesses, a few large firms,
such as Lunn Poly and Thomas Cook, have
hundreds of branches. Some 617 tour
operators are members of ABTA; about half
are both retail agents and tour operators.
ABTA operates financial protection
schemes to safeguard its members’ customers
and maintains codes of conduct drawn up
with the Office of Fair Trading. It also
offers a free consumer affairs service to help
-
231
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
resolve complaints against members and an
independent arbitration scheme for tour
operators’ customers.
Tourist Authorities
The Department of National Heritage is
responsible for tourism in England, and the
Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland
Offices have responsibility for tourism in
their respective countries. The government-
supported British Tourist Authority (BTA)
promotes Britain overseas as a tourist
destination and encourages the development
of tourist facilities in Britain to meet the
needs of overseas visitors. The tourist boards
for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland encourage the development and
promotion of domestic tourism and work
with the BTA to promote Britain overseas.
In February 1995 the Government
published Tourism—Competing with
the Best, in which it outlined plans to
develop Britain’s tourism industry by:
• raising standards of hotel and
other accommodation;
• improving overseas marketing of
Britain as a tourist destination;
• promoting London more
effectively; and
• making holiday booking
arrangements easier.
The BTA and the national tourist boards
inform and advise the Government on issues
of concern to the industry. They also help
businesses and other organisations to plan by
researching and publicising trends affecting
the industry. The national tourist boards
work closely with regional tourist boards, on
which local government and business
interests are represented. The national tourist
boards offer financial assistance to the
industry. There are 800 or so Tourist
Information Centres in Britain, operating an
information service for visitors.
Three accommodation classification and
grading schemes are operated by the national
tourist boards:
• the Crown scheme for hotels, guest
houses, inns, bed and breakfast and
farmhouse holiday accommodation. A
new Lodge category has been introduced
for purpose-built accommodation
alongside motorways and major roads;
• the Key (Dragons used in Wales) scheme
for self-catering holiday homes; and
• the Quality ‘Q^ scheme for holiday
caravan, chalet and camping parks.
Common standards are applied throughout j
Britain. All participating establishments are
inspected every year.
BUSINESS SERVICES
Exhibition and Conference Centres
Britain is one of the world’s three leading
countries for international conferences the
others being the United States and h ranee.
London and Paris are the two most popular
conference cities. A large number of other
towns and cities in Britain have facilities for
conferences and exhibitions. Total spending
in 1993 on conferences and exhibitions
amounted to £630 million.
Among the most modern purpose-built
conference and exhibition centres are the
International Conference Centre in
Birmingham; the Queen Elizabeth II and
Olympia Conference Centres, both in
London; and Cardiff International Arena, a
5,000-seat multi-purpose facility which
opened in 1993. Others are located in
Brighton (East Sussex), Harrogate (North
Yorkshire), Bournemouth, Birmingham,
Manchester, Nottingham and Torquay
(Devon). In Scotland both Glasgow and
Aberdeen have exhibition and conference
centres, and a new International Conference
Centre has been built in Edinburgh.
Other large exhibition facilities are situated
in London at the Barbican, Earls Court,
Alexandra Palace and Wembley Arena. A
£100 million exhibition and conference
facility is planned for London Docklands, to
be completed in 1998.
Many of the larger sites belong to a
marketing group, the British Conference and I
Exhibition Centres Export Council.
232
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Franchising
A notable trend in the services sector is the
growth of franchising, an operation in which
a company owning the rights to a particular
form of trading licenses them to franchisees,
usually by means of an initial payment with
continuing royalties. The main areas include
cleaning services, film processing, print
shops, hairdressing and cosmetics, fitness
centres, courier delivery, car rental, engine
tuning and servicing, and fast food retailing.
Advertising and Sponsorship
Britain is a major centre for creative
advertising, and multinational corporations
often use advertising created in Britain for
marketing their products globally. British
agencies have strong foreign links through
overseas ownership and associate networks.
Spending on advertising in 1994
amounted to £10,200 million, a rise of more
than 8 per cent in real terms on the
previous year. The press accounted for 55
per cent of the total, television for 28 per
cent, direct mail for 10 per cent, and
posters, transport, commercial radio and
cinema for the rest. The largest advertising
expenditure is on food, household durables,
cosmetics, office equipment, motor vehicles
and financial services. The biggest spenders
in 1994 included BT, Ford, Dixons,
McDonald’s, Tesco and J. Sainsbury. The
National Lottery (see p. 460) also quickly
established itself as a major spender on
advertising. British television advertising
receives many international awards.
Campaigns are planned by around 2,000
advertising agencies. In addition to their
creative, production and media buying roles,
some agencies offer integrated marketing
services, such as consumer research and
public relations. Leading agencies include
Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, J Walter
Thompson, Leo Burnett and Ogilvy and
Mather Advertising.
Government advertising campaigns—
crime prevention, health promotion, road
safety and so on—are organised in the main
by the Central Office of Information, an
executive agency of the Government
(see p. 530), which is able to secure
large discounts because of its centralised
buying power.
Many advertising agencies have
sponsorship departments, which arrange for
businesses to sponsor products and events,
including artistic, sporting and charitable
events. In return for financial or other
support, the sponsoring company is
associated with a worthy product or event,
thereby raising its profile with consumers^
Public Relations
Britain’s public relations industry has grown
rapidly over the past ten years and is now the
most developed in Europe. In 1994 it had an
estimated turnover of £1,300 million.
Computing Services
The computing services industry comprises
software houses; production of packaged
software; consultancy; information technology
‘outsourcing’; processing services; and the
provision of complete computer systems. It
also includes companies providing information
technology education and training; independent
maintenance; support, contingency planning
and recruitment; and contract staff.
The turnover of companies in the
Computing Services & Software Association,
which represents about 75 per cent of the
industry in Britain, totalled over £7,000
million in 1994. Important areas for software
development include data and word
processing, telecommunications, computer-
aided design and manufacturing, defence and
consumer electronics.
Management Consultancy
Management consultants provide business
solutions by giving advice and technical
assistance to business and government
clients. Typically, consultants identify and
investigate problems and opportunities,
recommend appropriate action and help to
implement recommendations.
Many British-based consultancies operate
internationally; the most recent trend has
been for the largest firms to set up offices in
233
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim. The
32 member firms of the Management
Consultancies Association are among the
largest in the industry and account for more
than half of management consultancy work;
they range from Andersen Consulting and
CMC Management, with a strong technical
bias, to Coopers & Lybrand and PA
Consulting group, which specialise in
market/industry sectors. In 1994 member
firms earned more than £1,000 million in
Britain and £150 million overseas.
Market Research
A wide range of domestic and overseas
clients, including government bodies, use
Britain’s market research facilities. Britain
accounts for 9 per cent of worldwide market
research spending. The Association of Market
Survey Organisations is the main trade
organisation, with 35 member companies; in
1994 its members earned £325 million out of
an estimated total market research industry
turnover of £485 million.

16 Manufacturing and
Construction Industries
Introduction 235 Construction 248
Sectors of Manufacturing 236
Britain became the world’s first industrialised country in the mid 19th century.
Wealth was based on manufacturing iron and steel, heavy machinery and
cotton textiles, and on coal mining, shipbuilding and trade. Manufacturing
still plays an important role and Britain excels in high-technology industries
like pharmaceuticals, electronics (including computers), aerospace and
offshore equipment, where British companies are among the world’s largest
and most successful. The British construction industry has made its mark
around the world and continues to be involved in some of the most
prestigious international building projects.
Introduction
Manufacturing accounted for just over a fifth of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1994 and for
about the same proportion of employment. More
than four-fifths of visible exports consisted of
manufactured or semi-manufactured goods.
Almost all manufacturing is carried out by
private-sector businesses.
Following the recent recession, which led
to a decline in manufacturing output, output
rose by 1.2 per cent in 1993 and by 4.2 per
cent in 1994 (see Table 16.2). Employment in

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
manufacturing in 1994 was 4.2 million
compared with 5.4 million in 1984. Total
capital investment in manufacturing was
£13,400 million in 1994, comprising £11,100
million in plant and machinery, £1,500
million in new building work and £700
million in vehicles.
The most successful manufacturing
industry in terms of sales (including exports)
to demand in Britain is spirit distilling
(mainly whisky). In 1992 the industry’s ratio
of sales to demand in Britain was 8.8. The
next most successful were office machinery,
construction equipment, pesticides and tractors.
The construction industry contributed 5
per cent of GDP and about 1.4 million
people worked in the industry in 1994, 6 per
cent of the total number of employees and
self-employed. Between 1993 and 1994 output
increased by 4 per cent, following declines in
output in 1991, 1992 and 1993 as recession
affected the industry. Total domestic fixed
capital investment was £700 million in 1994.
Sectors of Manufacturing
Relative sizes of enterprises and the main
sectors are shown in Tables 16.1 and 16.2.
Table 16.3 indicates output and investment.
A more detailed description of some of the
main sectors is given below.
Mineral and Metal Products
British producers delivered 15.7 million
tonnes of finished steel in 1994, of which 50
per cent was exported. Over the past ten
years annual steel industry exports have
increased by 50 per cent, to nearly 8 million
tonnes, creating a favourable balance of trade
in steel products.
The major areas of steel production are in
south Wales and northern England, with
substantial further processing in the
Midlands. Major restructuring in the steel
industry took place during the 1980s and
early 1990s. Productivity and efficiency have
improved and the industry is now one of the
lowest-cost producers in Europe.
British Steel is the fourth largest steel
company in the world, employing 41,000
people and producing about three-quarters of
Britain‘s crude steel in 1994. The company‘s
output is based on flat steel products, plate,
heavy sections and tubes. These are used
principally in the construction, automotive,

engineering, transport, metal goods,
f packaging and energy industries.
Other important steel producers in Britain
include Caparo, Allied Steel and Wire, Co-
| Steel Sheerness, the Glynwed Group and the
i stainless steel producer A vesta Sheffield.
Products manufactured by these companies
include reinforcing bars for the construction
industry, wire rod, hot rolled and cold
finished bars and other special steels for the
! aerospace and offshore oil and gas industries.
In February 1995 British Steel took
full ownership of UES Holdings,
Europe’s biggest producer of
engineering steels—these are
specialist grades used to make
products such as forgings for the
automotive and aerospace industries.
Output of non-ferrous metals and their
i alloys includes primary and secondary
(recycled) aluminium and copper, as well as
aluminium and copper and copper alloy semi¬
manufactures. The production of metal relies
mainly on imported ores and recycled
. material of both domestic and overseas origin.
Britain is a major producer of specialised
! alloys for high-technology requirements in
the aerospace, electronic, petrochemical, and
nuclear and other fuel industries. Titanium
and titanium alloys, which are light, strong
and flexible, are used in aircraft
manufacturing, power generation and North
Sea oil production. Nickel alloys are utilised
in aero-engines for high-temperature
environments. In recent years considerable
progress has been made in producing
‘superplastic’ alloys, which are more ductile
and elastic than conventional alloys.
Aluminium alloys, including aluminium
lithium (developed by British Alcan
Aluminium), are ideal for use in aircraft,
being lighter, stronger and more rigid than
normal aluminium. Aluminium alloys typically
make up three-quarters of an airframe.
There is also an important sector
producing copper and copper alloy
semi-manufactures for use in a wide variety
of electrical switchgear, wire and cable, tube
and fittings for plumbing, and valves and
components for the engineering and
transport industries.
Ceramics
The ceramics industry manufactures clay
products, such as domestic pottery,
sanitaryware and tiles, and clay pipes for the
building trade. Domestic pottery production
237
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
includes china, earthenware and stoneware.
Tableware is produced in Stoke-on-Trent.
Britain is the world’s leading manufacturer
and exporter of fine bone china; Wedgwood,
Spode and Royal Doulton are among the
more famous names.
Research is being conducted into
ceramics for use in house building and diesel
and jet engines. Important industrial
ceramics invented in Britain include silicon
carbides and sialons, which can withstand
ultra-high temperatures.
Glass Products
Flat glass is manufactured through the float
glass process, which was developed by
Pilkington Brothers and licensed to
glassmakers throughout the world. Pilkington
has also produced an energy-saving window
glass which reflects room heat without
impairing visibility and an automotive glass
that prevents car interiors overheating and
being damaged by heat and sunlight. United
Glass is a leading manufacturer of bottles and
other glass containers. Glass-reinforced cement
composites for the construction industry were
invented in Britain in the early 1970s and are
made under licence in over 40 countries.
China Clay
Britain is the world’s biggest exporter of
china clay (kaolin), four-fifths of which is
used in paper-making. In 1994, 2.5 million
tonnes were sold overseas. The main
company is ECC International, part of the
English China Clays Group.
Chemicals and Related Products
The products of Britain’s chemical industry,
the third largest in Europe, underpin almost
all other industrial processes and products. It
is at the forefront of modern technology,
spending more than 7 per cent of total sales
on research and development (R & D). The
industry provides direct employment for
about 280,000 people. Over a half of its
output is exported, making it British
manufacturing’s greatest single export earner.
Exports in 1994 were worth ^18,700 million,
while imports (mainly consisting of plastics
and organic chemicals) were valued at
£14,500 million.
Many major chemical companies in Britain
are multinationals; several are subsidiaries of
overseas companies and others are specialist
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, such as
Glaxo Wellcome. Imperial Chemical
Industries (ICI), the sixth largest chemical
company in the world, manufactures
industrial chemicals, paints, materials and
explosives. Zeneca produces pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals and seeds, and specialty
chemicals. Teesside has been especially
successful in attracting investment from some
of the largest overseas chemical firms.
Traditionally, Britain has been a major
producer of basic industrial chemicals, such as
basic organic and inorganic chemicals, plastics
and fertilisers, which together comprise
around two-fifths of output. The most rapid
growth in recent years has been in specialt\
chemicals, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
Sales of basic organic chemicals amounted
to £4,100 million and those of other basic
industrial chemicals to £7,200 million in
1993. The most important bulk products are
ethylene, propylene and benzene. Britain is
the world’s fourth biggest producer of
specialised organic chemicals, with over
7.5 per cent of the world market.
Much inorganic chemical production
consists of relatively simple bulk chemicals,
such as sulphuric acid and metallic and non-
metallic oxides, serving as basic materials for
industry. Specialty chemicals include
pharmaceutical ingredients, essential oils and
flavourings, adhesives and sealants, and
explosives, including those used for car safet;
airbags. Investment in environmentally safe
products and processes, for example
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
is increasing.
A sizeable proportion of world R & D in
agrochemicals is conducted in Britain.
Notable British discoveries include diquat
and paraquat herbicides, pyrethroid
insecticides, systemic fungicides and
aphicides, genetically-engineered microbial
pesticides and methods of encouraging
natural parasites to eradicate common pests
in horticulture.
238
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
Exports of soap and detergent preparations
in 1994 were valued at £1,400 million. This
sector is dominated by Lever Brothers
(part of Unilever) and the US-owned
Procter and Gamble.
Plastics
Around 200,000 people are employed by
nearly 4,000 firms engaged in plastics
processing—the conversion of plastics
materials into finished or sub-assemblies of
final products. Total annual turnover of the
plastics processing industry is estimated at
£11,300 million; exports reached £2,800
million in 1994. Production includes
housewares and components/products for the
automotive, electrical/electronic, construction
and engineering industries, as well as a broad
range of packaging materials.
Paints
Sales of paint, varnishes and painters’ fillings
were worth £2,200 million in 1993. ICI is the
world’s largest paint manufacturer. Among its
specialised products are new ranges of
synthetic resins and pigments, powder
coatings, non-drip and quick-drying paints
and paints needing only one top coat. Its
best-known consumer product is the ‘Dulux’
paint range. Two of the more significant
innovations have been solid emulsion paint
and a temporary water-based finish which can
be removed easily by chemical treatment, for
vehicle bodies and road markings.
Pharmaceuticals
The British pharmaceutical industry is the
world’s fourth biggest exporter of medicines,
accounting for around 12 per cent of the
world market. About 300 pharmaceutical
manufacturers operate in Britain, including
several multinational corporations. The
British-owned group Glaxo Wellcome became
the largest pharmaceutical company in the
world when Glaxo took over Wellcome in
1995. There are also many medium-sized and
smaller specialist companies. Total sales in
1994 were around £9,300 million, of which
£4,000 million was accounted for by overseas
sales. The main overseas markets are Western
Europe and North America, with Japan an
expanding market.
Some 80,000 people work in the industry,
of whom more than a quarter are engaged in
R & D. The industry, which is largely based
in the South East and East Anglia, invested
£2,500 million in R & D in 1994. This sum
amounts to one-third of British industry’s
R & D and represents about a tenth of total
world expenditure on pharmaceuticals R &
D. Progress in devising vaccines has helped
to reduce dramatically the impact of
infectious diseases such as whooping cough,
mumps and measles.
British firms discovered and developed 13
of the world’s 50 best-selling drugs, including
Glaxo Wellcome’s ulcer treatment Zantac, the
best-selling medicine in the world, and
Zeneca’s beta-blocker Tenormin, for treating
high blood pressure. Among Zeneca’s newer
products are Zestril (for combating high
blood pressure), Zoladex (a prostate cancer
therapy) and Diprivan (an anaesthetic).
Other major developments pioneered in
Britain are semi-synthetic penicillins and
cephalosporins, both powerful antibiotics, and
new treatments for asthma, arthritis,
migraine and coronary heart disease. The
world’s fifth largest pharmaceutical
company, SmithKline Beecham, manufactures
four of the world’s top-selling antibiotics; it
also developed Augmentin, used to treat a
range of infections that have become
resistant to antibiotics. Glaxo Wellcome’s
Zofran, an anti-nausea drug for countering
the unpleasant side-effects of cancer
treatments, is one of the company’s most
successful new medicines.
British companies lead in the development
of molecular graphics. These contribute to
the rational design of new and improved
medicines through a computer-aided
technique for analysing the structures of
complicated organic molecules using a visual
display unit.
A growing trend is the production of
generic drugs. These are versions of branded
drugs whose patents have expired. They are
mostly unbranded and cheaper than the
branded originals. About 50 per cent of doctors’
prescriptions in Britain are for generic drugs.
239
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Biotechnology
The British biotechnology industry is second
only in pre-eminence to that of the United
States. As well as Zeneca, Glaxo Wellcome
and SmithKline Beecham, around 30 smaller
independent firms, including Celltech, British
Biotech, Xenova and Cantab, contribute to
the sector.
Biotechnology has improved the specificity
of pharmaceuticals through greater
understanding of disease at the molecular
level. It has enabled companies to
manufacture products using genetic
modification. Britain has made major
advances in the development of drugs such as
human insulin and interferons, genetically-
engineered vaccines, and in the production of
antibiotics by fermentation; alternative
bactericidal drugs based on Nisin, a food
preservative made in Britain; agricultural
products such as infection-resistant crops;
and medical diagnostic devices, including the
world’s best-selling biosensor.
A second generation of vaccines based on
recombinant DNA technology includes
SmithKline Beecham’s Engerix-B vaccine
against hepatitis. Therapies based on
correcting the function of defective genes are
under development. Diseases being targeted
include those where a single defective gene
needs correcting, such as cystic fibrosis,
and those where there are genetic and
environmental components, like
cardiovascular disease.
Specialist products of Britain’s small and
medium-sized biotechnology firms comprise,
among other items, medical diagnostics and
microbial pesticides. Celltech was the first
licensed by the United States Government
for the large-scale production of
monoclonal antibodies, proteins which can
seek out a particular substance in the body.
They are used to diagnose diseases, identify
different blood types and can be employed
in the treatment of a range of conditions,
including cancer.
Fibres
The main types of synthetic fibre are still
those first developed: regenerated cellulosic
fibres such as viscose, and the major
synthetic fibres like nylon polyamide,
polyester and acrylics. Extensive research
continues to produce a wide variety of
innovative products; antistatic and flame-
retardant fibres are examples. More specialist
products include the aramids (with very high
thermal stability and strength), elastanes
(giving very high stretch and recovery) and
melded fabrics (produced without the need
for knitting or weaving).
Courtaulds, one of Britain’s biggest
chemical companies, developed Tencel, a
solvent-spun, biodegradable fibre. This is twice
as strong as cotton while being soft enough to
be used by designers of luxury garments.
Mechanical Engineering
The mechanical engineering sector has about
24,000 firms employing over 470,000 people.
In 1994 exports totalled £14,200 million, with
a trade surplus of £2,600 million. Output
includes pressure vessels, heat exchangers
and storage tanks for chemical and oil¬
refining plant, steam-raising boilers
(including those for power stations), nuclear
reactors, water and sewage treatment plant,
and fabricated steelwork for bridges,
buildings and industrial installations.
Machine-building is an area where British
firms excel, especially in construction and
earth-moving equipment, wheeled tractors,
internal combustion engines, textile
machinery, medical equipment, fork-lift
trucks, pumps and compressors. Britain is one
of the world’s major producers of tractors,
which make up around three-quarters of the
country’s total output of agricultural
equipment. Sales of wheeled tractors in 1994
were valued at £1,400 million. Among
leading tractor manufacturers are Massey
Ferguson, JCB, Case and New Holland.
Widely-used technical innovations include
computer-controlled tractors, a highly
efficient pesticide sprayer and combined
mower/conditioners that reduce the drying
time for grass. Much new machinery is
designed for use in a variety of conditions to
meet the needs of overseas farmers.
Britain is the world’s eighth largest
producer of machine tools. Almost all are
240
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
purchased by the engineering, aerospace,
automotive, and metal goods industries. The
machine tools sector was badly affected by
the recent recession, but has started to
recover. Total sales of metal-working
machine tools were ^^000 million in 1994,
15 per cent up on the 1993 figure. British
manufacturers have made technological
advances in probes, sensors, co-ordinate
measuring devices, laser melting and the
installation of flexible manufacturing systems.
Computer numerical-controlled machines
account for an increasing proportion of
output. The 600 Group is the biggest British
machine tool company.
Most sales of textile machinery are to
export markets. British innovations include
computerised colour matching and weave
simulation, friction spinning, high-speed
computer-controlled knitting machines and
electronic jacquard attachments for weaving
looms. Bonas Machine Company of Gateshead,
producer of electronic jacquards, exports
more than 90 per cent of its £46 million
annual turnover, to more than 75 countries.
Britain’s mining and tunnelling
equipment industry leads in the production
of coal-cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports,
conveying equipment, flameproof
transformers, switchgear, and subsurface
transport equipment and control systems.
J.C. Bamford, Britain’s biggest construction
equipment manufacturer, is the world’s
leading manufacturer of backhoe loaders and
telescopic handlers. Sales of construction
equipment, such as excavators and backhoe
loaders, rose in 1994 to £2,000 million.
The mechanical lifting and handling
equipment industry produces cranes and
transporters, lifting devices, escalators,
conveyors, powered industrial trucks and air
bridges, as well as electronically-controlled
and automatic handling systems. In 1994
sales in this sector were worth £3,200
million. Britain is also a major producer of
industrial engines, pumps, valves and
compressors, and of pneumatic and hydraulic
equipment. Companies like Babcock
manufacture steam generators and other
heavy equipment for power plants. Despite
an overall decline in the castings industry,
some foundries have invested in new melting,
moulding and quality control equipment.
Electrical, Electronic and Instrument
Engineering
Making extensive use of the most advanced
technologies, the electrical engineering
industry manufactures products for the
electricity supply sector: power plant, cable
transformers and switchgear, and lighting,
plugs and sockets. The domestic electrical
appliance sector is dominated by a few large
firms. Britain has the fourth largest
electronics industry in the world. Products
include computers, communications
equipment and a large range of components.
Scotland’s ‘Silicon Glen’ employs
45,000 people in electronics. The
electronics industry in Scotland
currently produces 11 per cent of
European semiconductors, over 35 per
cent of all personal computers sold in
Europe and over 50 per cent of its
automated cash dispensers. Major
overseas companies located in the
area include IBM, NEC, Compaq and
Digital, which are supplied by a
strong indigenous electronic
components sector.
The major electronic consumer goods
produced are television sets and high-fidelity
audio and video equipment. Several leading
Japanese companies have established
manufacturing bases in Britain. British
manufacturers have a worldwide reputation
for high-quality goods aimed at the upper
end of the market.
Computers
This sector produces an extensive range of
systems, central processors and peripheral
equipment, from large computers for large-
scale data-processing and scientific work to
mini- and microcomputers for control and
automation systems and for home, educational
and office use. Between 1993 and 1994 sales
of electronic data processing equipment rose
from £10,300 million to £13,700 million.
241
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain’s biggest computer manufacturer is
the largely Japanese-owned ICL. Other
companies, such as Psion, have concentrated
on developing new products for specialised
markets. These include hand-held, pocket-
sized computers, increasingly used by company
sales forces, and notebook and pen computers.
British firms make computer applications
software, and are particularly strong in
specialist markets such as artificial
intelligence, computer-aided design,
mathematical software, geographical
information systems and data visualisation.
The world’s first modem (computer
telephone link) for portable computers was
designed in Britain. Psion is a pioneer of
the ‘palmtop’ computer, which has the
equivalent power of a desktop machine. A
Scottish firm, Calluna, has designed an
extremely small disc drive for use in
notebook-sized computers.
British firms and research organisations,
with government support, have been involved
in the development and application of the
family of ‘three-five’ semiconductor materials,
such as gallium arsenide; these are used in a
number of microwave devices and in the
production of faster-working computers.
Major advances are being made by British
firms and academic institutions in the field of
‘virtual reality’, a three-dimensional
computer simulation technique with a host of
industrial and other applications. It is being
used to design buildings and a range of
products, including cars, pharmaceuticals and
machine tools.
Communications Equipment
Britain’s main communications products are
switching and transmission equipment,
telephones and terminals. As the
telecommunications market has become fully
liberalised (see p. 310), there has been a
growing demand for equipment and services.
GPT, formerly GEC Plessey
Telecommunications, is Britain’s foremost
telecommunications manufacturer; its product
range includes PBXs (private branch
exchanges), transmissions systems and
videoconferencing equipment.
Innovative work is being stimulated by the
expansion of cable television and the growth
in value added network services. There has
been rapid expansion in the market for
cellular telephones since the second half of
the 1980s.
Transmission equipment and cables for
telecommunications and information networks
include submarine and high-specification
data-carrying cables. Supported by a
technically advanced cable industry, BT has
led in the development of optical fibre
communications systems. It has paved the
way for simpler and cheaper optical cables by
laying the first non-repeatered cable over 100
km (62 miles) long, and by developing the
first all-optical repeater.
More than half of the world’s undersea
communications cables have been made and
laid by STC Submarine Systems, which, with
its US and French partners, completed the
laying of the first transatlantic optical fibre
cable in 1988. Now part of Canada s
Northern Telecom, STC is building the first
fibre-optic cable linking Canada and Europe.
The cable, which is being made in Britain
and the United States, will carry up to
30,000 telephone calls simultaneously down
each of two pairs of optical fibres.
Britain also has a world lead in the
transmission of computerised data along
telephone lines for reproduction on
television screens.
Another sector of the industry
* manufactures radio communications
equipment, radar, radio and sonar
navigational aids for ships and aircraft,
thermal imaging systems, alarms and
signalling equipment, public broadcasting
equipment and other capital goods. Radar
was invented in Britain and British firms
are still in the forefront of technological
advances. Racal Avionics X-band radar for
aircraft ground movement control is in use
at airports in several overseas countries.
Solid-state secondary surveillance radar,
manufactured by Cossor Electronics, is
being supplied to 50 overseas civil aviation
operators. Cable and Wireless s submarine
cable-laying robot ‘CIRRUS’, which can
work at depths of up to 1 km (3,280 ft), is
controlled entirely by a computer on its
mother ship.
242
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
j] Medical and Other Electronic Equipment
!A range of electronic measurement and test
equipment is made in Britain, as well as
II analytical instruments, process control
I equipment, and numerical control and
indication equipment for use in machine
i tools. Companies such as GEC and Oxford
Instruments produce electronic medical
equipment, including ultrasound scanners,
electromyography systems and patient
monitoring systems for intensive and coronary
care and other uses. Britain pioneered
1 magnetic resonance imaging.
The indigenous electronics components
industry is supplemented by subsidiaries of
leading overseas companies. An area of rapid
change in which Britain is particularly strong
i i is the manufacture of advanced components,
such as integrated circuits.
The instrument engineering industry
makes measuring, photographic,
cinematographic and reprographic equipment;
watches, clocks and other timing devices; and
medical and surgical instruments. Total sales
of this sector amounted to £5,200 million
in 1994.
Overseas sales of scientific and
photographic equipment were worth £5,400
million in 1994.
Motor Vehicles
Car output is dominated by seven groups,
accounting for 99 per cent of the total: Rover
(which became a subsidiary of BMW in
1994), Ford (including Jaguar), Vauxhall,
Peugeot-Talbot, Honda, Nissan and Toyota.
The remainder is in the hands of smaller,
specialist producers such as Rolls-Royce,
whose cars are renowned for their quality and
durability. Rover’s production includes the
highly successful Land Rover four-wheel
drive vehicles and a full range of family cars.
Ford has announced that it is to concentrate
its world diesel engine production for
medium-sized cars and light commercial
vehicles at its Dagenham (Essex) plant.
A period of major change has accompanied
the arrival of the three major Japanese
manufacturers — Nissan, Toyota and Honda
s — which have invested heavily and
introduced new management techniques and
production methods. The established motor
vehicle manufacturers and components
suppliers are restructuring as a result.
Car production has recovered
strongly following the recession: in
1994 nearly 1.5 million cars were
manufactured, the highest figure for
20 years, due in large part to a strong
export performance. A total of
619,000 passenger cars were exported
in 1994, almost three times as many
as in 1988.
The motor components industry consists
of up to 4,000 companies, including large
conglomerates such as Lucas, GKN and
Bosch, and is ranked as one of Britain’s major
industries. Lucas has signed a £1,000 million
contract with Volkswagen to supply diesel
electronic fuel injection systems.
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
Order books of British merchant shipbuilders
for new building were estimated to be worth
£400 million at the end of 1994; merchant
ship repairers had a turnover of £150 million
in 1994. The marine equipment industry is a
major contributor to the shipbuilding
industry, as equipment installed in a ship’s
hull accounts for about 50 per cent of its
total cost. Some 800 firms offer a complete
range of products, from diving equipment to
sophisticated navigational systems, 75 per
cent of which is exported.
More than two decades of oil and gas
exploitation in the North Sea have generated
a major offshore industry (see p. 256).
Shipbuilders and fabricators build floating
production units and semi-submersible units
for drilling, production and emergency/
maintenance support, drill ships, jack-up rigs,
modules and offshore loading systems. UIE
Scotland, Highlands Fabricators, John Brown
and McDermott Scotland are among the
larger manufacturers and designers.
Several thousand firms supply other
products needed by the offshore industry—
such as diving equipment and helicopters—as
well as services, including consultancy,
243
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
design, project management, and R & D to
the offshore industry. Their experience of
North Sea projects has enabled them to
establish themselves in oil and gas markets
throughout the world.
Aerospace
Britain’s aerospace industry is the third
largest in the Western world, after the
United States and France. Only nine firms
employ 2,500 people or more and two-thirds
of the 540 core aerospace companies have
fewer than 50 employees. Around 200
companies belong to the Society of British
Aerospace Companies, employing over
130,000 people. Total sales of the industry
amounted to £12,000 million in 1994 with
exports contributing £7,500 million. Aircraft
and parts account for around two-fifths of
overseas sales, with engines and parts,
missiles and aerospace equipment (including
satellite equipment) making up the rest.
The impact of recession on the civil
aerospace market and reductions in defence
orders following the ending of the Cold War,
accompanied by fierce international
competition in the defence products market,
have led to further rationalisation and
consolidation in the aerospace industry.
Collaborative development of civil and
military aircraft and engines, as well as
aviation equipment and satellites, is increasing
to save on the costs of long-term programmes.
The industry’s activities cover designing
and constructing airframes, aero-engines,
guided weapons, simulators and space
satellites, flight controls including ‘fly-by¬
wire’ and ‘fly-by-light’ equipment (see
p. 318), avionics and complex components,
with their associated services. In order to
improve fuel economy, engine and airframe
manufacturers use lighter materials such as
titanium and carbon-fibre composites (see
p. 237), combined with advanced avionics and
improved aerodynamic techniques.
Civil Aircraft
As one of the leading British exporters of
manufactured goods, British Aerospace
(BAe) produces both civil and military
aircraft, as well as guided weapons and
aircraft components.
BAe has a 20 per cent share of the
European consortium Airbus Industrie,
which outsold market leader Boeing in 1994.
BAe designs and supplies the wings for the
whole family of Airbus airliners, from the
short- to medium-haul A320 series (the first
civil airliner to use fly-by-wire controls—
see p. 318) to the large long-range four-
engined A340.
With Aerospatiale of France and Italy’s
Alenia, BAe has formed a new regional
aircraft alliance which jointly markets
turboprops and jet aircraft with between 29
and 115 seats; these include BAe’s Avro RJ
family of regional ‘quiet jet’ airliners and the
29-seat Jetstream 41 turboprop airliner.
Short Brothers of Belfast (now Canadian-
owned) is engaged in the design and
production of major civil aircraft sub-
assemblies, advanced nacelles (engine casings)
and components for aerospace manufacturers
as well as in the provision of aviation support
services. It designs and builds the wings for
the Fokker 100 and 70 jetliners and is a
partner in manufacturing the 50-seat Canadair
Regional Jet airliner; the Learjet 45, a small
business jet aircraft; and the Bombardier
Global Express long-range business jet.
Pilatus Britten-Norman manufactures the
Islander light utility aircraft, which has had
sales in over 100 countries.
Military Aircraft and Missiles
British Aerospace is one of the world’s top
defence companies, with more than four-
fifths of its military production having been
exported in 1994. The Harrier is a unique
vertical/short take-off and landing (V/STOL)
military combat aircraft. BAe also produces
the Hawk fast-jet trainer and, with McDonnel
Douglas, the Goshawk T45 carrier jet trainer
It has a 33 per cent share in the development
of the Eurofighter 2000, which had its maiden
flight in 1994. This is a European collaborativ
programme involving companies from Britain
Germany, Italy and Spain.
The Tornado combat aircraft is built by a
company set up jointly by BAe, Alenia and
Daimler-Benz Aerospace. A £5,000 million
244
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
order for 48 Tornado bombers for Saudi
Arabia was confirmed in 1993, making it one
of Britain’s biggest ever export deals.
Together with Alenia, Daimler-Benz and
Aerospatiale, BAe has formed a new company,
a military subsidiary of Airbus Industrie, to
manage the Future Large Aircraft military
transport programme. The United States Air
Force has chosen Slingsby Aviation’s T67
Firefly training aircraft as its new basic trainer
and 113 aircraft are being built. Slingsby also
designs and makes composite components for
the aviation and other industries.
BAe and Shorts are major suppliers of
tactical guided weapon systems for use on
land, at sea and in the air.
Helicopters
Westland Helicopters (now part of the GKN
group) manufactures the Sea King, Lynx and
Apache military helicopters, and, in
partnership with Agusta of Italy, the multi¬
role EH 101 medium-lift helicopter. Over
1,000 Westland helicopters are in service in
19 countries. Orders currently being
fulfilled include ones for the Royal Navy
(for the EH101), Royal Air Force (EHlOl and
Sea King), and the British Army (Apache)
and customers from Brazil (Lynx), Norway
(Sea King) and Italy (EHlOl). Major Sea King
upgrading programmes are being undertaken
for Australia, Belgium and Norway.
Aero-engines
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s three prime
manufacturers of aero-engines, with a
turnover in 1994 of nearly £2,000 million for
its aerospace division. The company’s civil
engine group makes engines for airliners and
regional, executive and corporate jets. Over
50,000 Rolls-Royce engines are in service with
more than 300 airlines in over 100 countries.
More than 80 per cent of Boeing 757
operators have selected RB211-535 engines.
The company’s latest large engine, the
Trent, powers the new generation of wide-
body twin-engined airliners, such as Boeing’s
777 and the Airbus A330. The Trent 800,
which has run at over 100,000 lb thrust, is the
most powerful engine ever certificated.
Rolls-Royce is a partner in the five-nation
International Aero Engine consortium,
which manufactures the low-emission V2500
aero-engine, now in service on the Airbus
A320 and A321 as well as the McDonnell
Douglas MD90.
The military engine group of Rolls-Royce
produces engines for both aircraft and
helicopters, and is a partner in the EJ200
engine project for the Eurofighter 2000.
The company also manufactures gas
turbines for power generation, for oil and gas
pumping and marine propulsion. Turnover of
Rolls-Royce’s industrial power wing
amounted to £1,200 million in 1994, of
which 70 per cent came from overseas sales.
Aviation Equipment
Around one-third of the aerospace industry is
devoted to designing and manufacturing
aviation equipment. British firms have made
significant technological advances.
Manufacturers like Dowty, GEC-Marconi,
Lucas, Smiths Industries, Racal, Normalair-
Garrett and BAe provide equipment and
systems for engines and aircraft propellers,
navigation and landing systems, engine and
flight controls, environmental controls and
oxygen breathing and regulation systems,
electrical generation, mechanical and
hydraulic power systems, cabin furnishings,
flight-deck controls and information displays.
GEC-Marconi is the world’s largest
manufacturer of head-up displays (HUDs).
British firms have made important
advances in developing ejection seats,
firefighting equipment and flight simulators,
as well as fly-by-wire and fly-by-light
technology, where control surfaces are moved
by means of automatic electronic signalling
and fibre optics respectively, rather than by
mechanical means. GEC supplies the fly-by-
wire system for the Boeing 777. Britain’s
aerospace companies provide radar and air
traffic control equipment and ground power
supplies to airports and airlines worldwide.
Space Equipment and Services
Over 400 companies employing almost 6,500
people are engaged in industrial space
245
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
activities. Annual turnover in 1993 exceeded
£700 million. The industry is strong in the
development and manufacture of civil and
military communications satellites and
associated Earth stations and ground
infrastructure equipment. In the field of
Earth observation, it plays a leading role in
manufacturing platforms, space radar and
meteorological satellite hardware, and in the
exploitation of space data imaging products.
Through its participation in the Intelsat,
Inmarsat, Eutelsat and Astra European space
projects, Britain has become Europe’s biggest
user of space. The British Government is the
fourth largest contributor to the European
Space Agency (ESA); in 1993 its civil and
military space budget was in excess of
£300 million.
The largest British space company is
Matra Marconi Space UK, which, with its
French partner, is one of the world’s leading
space companies. Its current major activities
include manufacture of the Skynet 4 military
communications satellites, payloads for the
Koreasat and Inmarsat 3 communications
spacecraft and the European Polar Platform
and space radar systems. The company has
recently completed work on the SOHO
scientific satellite instrumentation.
The National Remote Sensing Centre has
a major role in developing the market for
Earth observation data, an area in which
other British firms—notably Logica, Vega,
Science Systems and Cray—have major
interests. SERCO is Europe’s biggest supplier
of technical services in space.
GEC-Marconi produces inertial guidance
systems for Ariane 4 as well as electronics
components; Pilkington dominates the world
market in solar array cover glasses.
Food and Drink
Britain has a large food and drink
manufacturing industry, which has accounted
for a growing proportion of total domestic
food supply in recent decades. In the last few
years, it has increased productivity and
undergone restructuring, partly in order to
take advantage of the single European market.
Approximately 500,000 people are employed
in the industry.
Frozen and convenience foods, such as
ready-prepared meals, salads and pasta,
together with yoghurts, dairy desserts and
‘instant snacks’, have formed some of the
fastest-growing sectors of the food market in
recent years. Companies have introduced new
low-fat and fat-free products such as spreads
and ice creams to meet growing consumer
demand. There has also been a rise in sales of
products for vegetarians (soya-based foods,
for instance).
British firms are at the forefront of
innovation in the food industry. They support
research and development programmes to
ensure that products and production methods
meet the highest safety standards and the
expectations of consumers. New foods,
including ‘healthy’ alternatives, and better
packaging are constantly being developed.
Around one-half of liquid milk in Britain
is distributed through a doorstep delivery
system employing about 26,000 people; the
proportion is, however, declining. Household
milk consumption per head—1.9 litres (3.4
pints) a week—is among the highest in the
world. Consumption of skimmed and semi-
skimmed milk continues to rise as people
seek to reduce the fat content in their diet.
Milk for manufacturing purposes goes
principally into butter, cheese, condensed
milk, dried whole and skimmed milk powder,
cream and other products like yoghurt. The
British dairy industry accounted for 58 per
cent of butter supplies to the domestic
market in 1994 and 74 per cent of cheese
supplies. Butter exports in 1994 were worth
£120 million. The other main exports are
skimmed milk powder and whole milk
powder, valued at £189 million in total and
cheese at £124 million.
About 80 per cent of bread is
manufactured in large bakeries; the total breac
market is valued at £2,900 million a year. A
significant increase in the varieties available,
greater awareness of the nutritional value of
bread and the growth of the sandwich
market have helped stabilise consumption in
the last few years. Sales of ready-made
sandwiches are now worth £1,000 million a
year. Exports of biscuits were valued at
£240 million in 1994 and those of chocolate
and sugar confectionery at £530 million.
246
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
Of major significance among the alcoholic
drinks produced in Britain is Scotch whisky,
which is one of Britain’s top export earners.
There are 110 distilleries in Scotland, where
the best known brands of blended Scotch
whisky, such as J & B, Johnnie Walker,
Famous Grouse, Bell’s and Teacher’s, are
made from the products of single malt and
f single grain whisky distilleries. Almost 90 per
cent of Scotch whisky production is exported,
to over 200 countries. The value of whisky
exports was £2,200 million in 1994, Europe
taking 35 per cent and the United States 13
per cent by volume.
In 1994 purchases of beer in Britain
reached £13,800 million, about 3 per cent of
consumers’ expenditure. The brewing
industry has four major national brewery
groups—Scottish & Newcastle, Bass,
Whitbread and Carlsberg-Tetley—and about
400 regional and local brewers. British malt,
which is made almost entirely from home¬
grown barley, is used by brewers throughout
the world. Demand for traditional cask-
conditioned ales (‘real ale’) continues to rise,
while lager now accounts for just over half of
all beer sales. In recent years there has been a
shift towards stronger bottled beers, a
significant proportion of which are imported.
Cider is made primarily in south-west England,
, Gloucester, Hereford and Worcester.
Some 430 vineyards and 150 wineries in
Britain (mainly in southern England) produce
an average of 1.8 million litres of wine a year.
The soft drinks industry, which has an
annual turnover of £6,000 million, produces
carbonated drinks, concentrates, fruit juices,
and natural mineral and bottled waters. A
highly competitive industry, it is the fastest
growing sector of the grocery trade,
introducing many innovative products.
d
Tobacco
The British tobacco industry manufactures
nearly all cigarettes and tobacco goods sold in
Britain. Almost all domestic output is
provided by three major manufacturers
(Imperial Tobacco, Gallaher and Carreras
Rothmans). The industry specialises in the
production of high-quality cigarettes made
from flue-cured tobacco and achieves
significant exports. Europe, the Middle East
and Africa are important markets.
Textiles and Clothing
These products make a substantial
contribution to the British economy in terms
of employment, exports and turnover.
Together with the footwear and leather
industries, they employ around 420,000
people, representing 10 per cent of
manufacturing employment. For textiles, there
is a high degree of regional concentration,
particularly in North West England, West
Yorkshire (mainly wool), the East Midlands
(knitwear), Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The clothing industry is scattered throughout
Britain, with significant concentrations in
Manchester, Leicester and London. The
principal products are spun yarns, woven and
knitted fabrics, apparel, industrial and
household textiles, and carpets based chiefly
on wool, cotton and synthetic fibres. Exports
of textiles, clothing and footwear totalled more
than £6,000 million in 1994.
The textile and clothing industry has
around 13,000 firms, comprising a few large
multi-process companies and two of the
world’s largest firms—Coats Viyella and
Courtaulds Textiles—as well as a large
number of small and medium-sized firms.
The international Multi-Fibre
Arrangement (MFA—see p. 174) has allowed
a measure of restraint on imports into the
European Union from low-cost countries;
however, the MFA is being phased out over
ten years to the year 2005. Increased
investment in new machinery and greater
attention to design, training and marketing
have helped the industry to raise
competitiveness. New technologies, largely
designed to improve response times and give
greater flexibility in production, are being
used throughout the industry.
Britain’s wool textile industry is one of the
most important in the world. West Yorkshire
is the main producing area, but Scotland is
also famous as a specialist producer of high-
quality yarns and tweeds. Raw wool is
scoured and cleaned in Britain in preparation
for woollen and worsted spinning and
weaving (worsted is fine wool fabric often
.
247
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
used for making suits). British mills also
process rare fibres such as cashmere and
angora. Sales of the wool textile industry
amounted to £1,300 million in 1994.
Low-cost competition has cut
progressively into British markets for cotton
and allied products. Production includes yarn
and fabrics of cotton, synthetic fibres and
cotton-synthetic mixes, with large-scale
dyeing and printing of cotton and synthetic
fibre fabric. The linen industry is centred in
Northern Ireland.
The high quality and variety of design
make Britain one of the world’s leading
producers of woven carpets. Over half the
value of carpet and rug output is made up of
tufted carpets. Woven carpets, mainly
Axminster, account for most of the remaining
sales. There is a higher wool content in woven
types, although in these, too, considerable use
is being made of synthetic fibres.
Industrial textiles account for an increasing
proportion of textile industry output,
covering products such as conveyor belting
and geotextiles used in civil engineering.
Many of these are non-woven. Synthetic
polypropylene yarn is used in the
manufacture of carpet backing and ropes, and
woven into fabrics for a wide range of
applications in the packaging, upholstery,
building and motor vehicle industries.
The clothing industry is more labour
intensive than textiles, with about 7,700
companies. While a broad range of clothing is
imported from Europe and Asia, British
industry supplies about one-half of domestic
demand. Exports have risen since the British
fashion designer industry regained
prominence during the 1980s and traditional
British tailoring enables branded clothing
companies such as Burberry’s to compete
overseas. The hosiery and knitwear industry
comprises about 1,500 companies, mainly in
the east Midlands and Scotland.
Paper, Printing and Publishing
There are 99 paper and board mills
employing 25,000 people. Among the largest
British groups are Shotton, St Regis and
Bridgewater. Production has been
concentrated in large-scale units to enable the
industry to compete more effectively within
the single European market. Between 1985
and 1994 output increased by 57 per cent.
Over half the industry is made up of forestry
product companies from Scandinavia, North
America, Australia and elsewhere. There has
been a significant trend towards waste-based
packaging grades. Usage of recycled waste
paper is increasing and research is helping to
extend it. In 1994 the total amount of waste
paper used in British newspapers accounted
for four-fifths of newsprint produced. Waste
paper provides over half of the industry’s
fibre needs.
Employment in the paper products,
printing and publishing industries is 450,000.
Much printing and publishing employment
and output is in firms based in south-east
England. Mergers have led to the formation
of large groups in newspaper, magazine and
book publishing. Reed Elsevier, one of the
world’s biggest publishing businesses,
resulted from a merger between Reed
International and the Dutch company
Elsevier in 1993. More than £2,800 million
worth of books were sold in Britain in 1994.
The book-publishing industry is a major
exporter, selling one-third of production in
overseas markets. Security printers (of, for
example, banknotes and postage stamps) are
also important exporters, the major company
being De La Rue.
Construction
Annual output of the construction industry is
around £50,000 million. Most construction
work is done by private firms, 98 per cent
of which employ fewer than 25 people.
While only 86 out of a total of 195,000
firms employ more than 600 people directly,
these companies undertake about 20 per cent
of all construction in Britain. Some larger
firms own quarries and factories for
materials manufacture, and sophisticated
plant. Some undertake responsibility for all
stages of projects from initial design to
final construction.
Efficiency and productivity in constructio
have benefited from greater off-site
fabrication of standardised components and
248
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
rom computerised techniques such as
dectronic load safety measures for cranes,
listance measuring equipment, computerised
itock ordering and job costing, and computer-
lided design.
The Department of the Environment
issists British construction and building
products and materials firms to secure
jverseas contracts by, for instance, arranging
nward and outward trade missions.
Building Materials and Products
\ vast range of products is used in the
construction process, from glass and bricks to
tiles and bathroom fittings. These materials
are estimated to make up around 40 per cent
of the value of construction output. In 1994
sales of construction materials were worth
about £30,000 million, with exports
amounting to £3,000 million.
Most crushed rock, sand and gravel that is
quarried by the aggregates industry is used in
construction. The brick industry, one of
Britain’s oldest, is regarded as the world’s
most technically advanced: in the late 1980s
over £300 million was invested in improving
production. Portland cement, a 19th-century
British innovation, is the most widely used
chemical compound in the world.
Britain is also a world leader in the
manufacture of glass used in windows, doors
and cladding. Pilkington developed the float
process for manufacturing distortion-free flat
glass (see p. 238), which is licensed
throughout the world. Substantially more
s, energy efficient, flat glass is used to allow
more light into buildings and to provide
insulation against heat loss in winter. The
manufacture and supply of windows and
doors is carried out by a large number of
companies operating in one of three distinct
t product sectors—timber, metal (aluminium
and steel) and UPVC.
Project Procurement, Management and
Financing
The common basis of procurement is a lump-
iij sum contract with provision for variation.
The largest projects are often carried out
under the direction of construction managers
or management contractors. Clients generally
employ architects, project managers or civil
engineers to advise on the feasibility of
projects, draw up plans, and inspect and
supervise the construction work.
Private and public sector projects are
managed in a variety of ways. Most clients
invite construction firms to bid for work by
competitive tender, having used the design
services of a consultant. The successful
contractor will then undertake on-site work
with a number of specialist sub-contractors.
Alternative methods of contracting are
becoming more common: for example,
contracts might include subsequent provision
of building maintenance or a comprehensive
‘design-and-build’ service, where a single
company accepts responsibility for every stage
of a project.
Under the Government’s Private
Finance Initiative announced in 1992
(see p. 158), private sector companies
are becoming involved in large-scale
public infrastructure projects,
including building the Ashford
International Passenger Station and
the Heathrow Express line. In January
1995 the Government issued
invitations to tender for four ‘DBFO’
(‘Design, Build, Finance and Operate’)
road contracts.
The Government provides substantial
work for the construction industry. Recently,
several projects have been built and paid for
by private consortia, which then charge the
public for their use for a fixed period of time
before transferring ownership back to the
public sector; these are known as ‘BOOT’
(‘Build, Own, Operate and Transfer’)
schemes. Two examples are the toll bridge
over the River Thames at Dartford, Kent
(see p. 295) and the second River Severn
bridge under construction (see p. 295).
Major Construction Projects in Britain
The most important recent construction
project is the Channel Tunnel, the largest
single civil engineering project ever
undertaken in Europe (see p. 302).
..
249
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Completed in 1993, its estimated cost was
£10,000 million. Building work was carried
out by a consortium of ten French and
British contractors working together as
Transmanche Link (TML). The tunnel is
nearly 50 km (31 miles) long and is 70 m
(230ft) below sea level at its deepest.
Associated projects included a new
international station at Waterloo in London
and an international terminal at Folkestone. A
new international passenger station is being
built at Ashford in Kent (see p. 302).
Other major building projects in hand or
recently completed are the M25 motorway
widening scheme, the M74 in Scotland, the
Severn Estuary crossing, the extensive
development in London’s Docklands, and the
Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk.
Both Stansted and Manchester airports have
been substantially redeveloped. There has
also been large-scale redevelopment of sports
stadiums, including Twickenham and
Murrayfield (in Edinburgh) rugby grounds,
and Manchester United and Arsenal football
grounds. A new £16 million football stadium
has been built to house Middlesbrough
football club. Major redevelopment work has
begun at the Wimbledon lawn tennis
complex, which will lead to the construction
of new courts.
Housing
During 1994 construction of 200,000
dwellings was started in Great Britain, 8 per
cent more than in 1993. Starts by private
enterprise were 157,000, by housing
associations 41,000 and in the public sector
1,400. Around 181,000 dwellings were
completed; 144,000 by the private sector,
34,000 by housing associations and 1,900 by
the public sector. The total value of new
housing orders was £7,100 million.
Building Regulations
The Department of the Environment’s
building regulations prescribe minimum
standards of construction in England and
Wales. Administered and enforced by local
government, the regulations apply to new
building, the installation or replacement of
fittings, alterations and extensions to existing
buildings and to certain changes of use of
existing buildings. Similar controls apply in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. An
alternative to local authority building
control was introduced in 1984, involving
private certification of compliance with
building regulations. The British Standards
Institution is making Britain’s contribution
to the drafting of European standards, which
are increasingly replacing national
construction standards.
Research and Advisory Services
The Building Research Establishment, an
executive agency of the Government,
provides advice and research services to the
Government on the design, construction and
performance of buildings, together with the
health and safety of people in and around
buildings. Its areas of expertise include
prevention and control of fires and protectioi
of the environment. It has a key role in
developing European codes and standards,
and has strong links with a variety of
international organisations. Major
construction and materials firms, universities
colleges and research associations, as well as
the British Board of Agrement, carry out
research and provide advisory services. The
Building Centre supplies exhibition and
information services on materials, products,
techniques and building services.
Overseas Contracting and Consultancy
British companies are engaged in many majc
projects throughout the world and have beei
in the forefront of innovative methods of
management contracting and construction
management. They are increasingly engaged
in developing privately-financed projects.
Contractors and consultants undertake the
supervision and all or part of the construed#
of a project. Consultants are involved in the
planning, design and supervision of
construction projects. British contractors an
consultants have a reputation for integrity
and independence.

British engineering consultants are engaged
in projects in 130 countries, having offices in
most of those countries. In 1994 members of
the Association of Consulting Engineers were
engaged in new work overseas valued at
£20,000 million. The capital value of projects
under way at the end of 1994 was £64,000
million. British consulting engineers had
estimated gross earnings in 1994 of £630
million from overseas commissions. The three
largest categories of work covered roads,
bridges and tunnels; thermal power stations;
and water supply. The largest markets were
the Far East, Africa, India and the Middle
East. Major international projects include:
• a gas plant in Norway;
• hydroelectric works in Pakistan;
• roads and bridges in China;
• a thermal power station in Saudi Arabia;
and
• housing and infrastructure works in
Russia.

Energy production is a vital part of Britain’s economy. It directly employs
about 300,000 people—5.5 per cent of industrial employees. Offshore oil and
gas also provide employment for 250,000 in support industries The energy
sector accounts for 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), 10 per cent of
total investment, 42 per cent of industrial investment, and 10 per cent ol
annual business expenditure on research and development. It also includes
three of Britain’s ten largest companies—Shell, BP and British Gas.
Privatisation and liberalisation have increased the number of firms operating
in the energy market. Cumulative production of oil (1,800 million tonnes since
1975) is about one-fifth of maximum estimated recoverable reserves. 1 he
value of non-fuel minerals output approached £2,000 million in 1993.
Energy Resources
Britain has the largest energy resources of any
country in the European Union (EU) and is a
major world producer of oil and natural gas
known as primary sources. The other main
primary sources are coal, nuclear power and
some water power; secondary sources (derived
from primary sources) are electricity, coke
and smokeless fuels, and petroleum products.
In 1994 Britain was a net exporter of
fuels—39 million tonnes of oil
equivalent—representing a surplus of
£3,300 million, more than £1,900
million higher than in 1993.
Coal still supplies a significant, but
declining, proportion of the country’s
primary energy needs—23.9 per cent of total
home consumption in 1994. Nuclear power
provided about 26 per cent of electricity
supplied by the British electricity companies
in 1994.
Ownership and Extraction
With the major exceptions of gold, silver, oil
and natural gas (owned by the Crown), and
most coal, minerals in Great Britain are
mainly privately owned. In Northern Ireland
gold and silver are owned by the Crown,
while rights to exploit petroleum and other
minerals (except ‘common substances ,

deluding sand and gravel, and crushed
ock) are vested in the Department of

UKCS; see map, p. 257) the right to work
11 minerals except coal is vested in the
>own. Following the privatisation of British
]oal, the exclusive right to extract coal, or
icense others to do so, both on land in Great
Britain and under the sea, is now vested in
he Coal Authority. Normally, ownership of
ninerals belongs to the owner of the land
urface, but in some areas, particularly those
vith a long history of mining, these rights
lave become separated. Mining and
quarrying are usually carried out by privately
iwned companies.
ENERGY POLICY
The President of the Board of Trade, who
leads the Department of Trade and Industry
DTI), is responsible for most energy matters
n Great Britain. However, the Secretary of
State for the Environment is responsible for
mergy conservation and efficiency matters.
Electricity in Scotland is under the Secretary
af State for Scotland, who also has a direct
interest in a wide range of energy concerns.
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
is responsible for all energy matters there.
The aim of the Government’s energy
policy is to ensure secure, diverse and
sustainable supplies of energy in the forms
that people and businesses want, and at
competitive prices. Health, safety and
environmental policies, as well as EU and
other international commitments, have also to
be borne in mind.
Key elements are to:
• encourage competition among producers
and choice for consumers, and maintain a
legal and regulatory framework to enable
markets to work well;
• ensure service in a commercial
environment, with customers paying the
full cost of energy resources they
consume;
• ensure that the discipline of the capital
markets is applied to state-owned industries
by privatising them where possible;
• have regard to the impact of the energy
sector on the environment, including
taking measures to meet international
commitments;
• promote energy efficiency; and
• promote wider share ownership.
The independent regulators’ main role is to
encourage the development of competition
and to protect the interests of consumers by
administering price controls and enforcing
standards of service in remaining areas
of monopoly.
Privatisation
British Gas, Britoil, Enterprise Oil, and the
non-nuclear electricity supply industry in
Britain are in the private sector. The Coal
Industry Act 1994 has enabled privatisation
of the coal industry to take place. The
Government proposes to privatise Britain’s
two nuclear generating companies, though
leaving the older reactors in public ownership
(see p. 266).
Liberalisation
Liberalisation—the introduction of
competition into markets—increases
incentives to minimise costs, to produce the
quality and range of services customers
demand, to innovate, and to price in line
with costs. The Government believes that
competition will give consumers the freedom
to choose which company will supply them.
Liberalisation of the gas and electricity
markets, and suppliers’ commitment to the
principles of the Citizen’s Charter, open the
way to significant improvements in the
services offered. Customers are to be
compensated when standards set by the
regulators are not met.
International Commitments
Britain is actively engaged in international
collaboration on energy questions, notably
through its membership of the EU and of the
International Energy Agency (IEA: an
autonomous part of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development,

'’Adjustments in the figures for recent years are the result of methodological review.
Note: Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
with 23 member countries). The European
Energy Charter Treaty, signed in 1994, is the
first major economic agreement between the
former Soviet Union, as well as central and
Eastern Europe, and the West, and the first
international agreement enshrining trade in
energy products in international law.
Britain supports the continuing development
of the single market in energy in the EU,
particularly through trans-European networks
and the removal of obstacles to trade in the
EU’s gas and electricity markets.
Energy Report
The purpose of the Government’s second
annual energy report, published in April 1995
and with a range of information about
markets, prices, regulation and the environment,
is to help competitive markets to develop by
setting out the key elements of energy policy.
An independent energy panel advises on
the preparation of the report. Energy
suppliers and users serve on the panel.
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
During 1983-94, when Britain’s GDP rose by
about 29 per cent, final energy consumption
on an ‘energy supplied’ basis increased by
only 12 per cent. Energy consumption by
final users in 1994 amounted to 152.1 million
tonnes of oil equivalent1 on an ‘energy
supplied’ basis, of which transport consumed
33 per cent, industrial users 25 per cent,
domestic users 29 per cent, and commerce,
agriculture and public services 13 per cent.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Britain’s consumers spend about £53,000
million a year on energy. The Energy
Efficiency Office (EEO), part of the
Department of the Environment, estimates
that 20 per cent—or £10,600 million could
be saved cost effectively, both through
improved management and through energy
efficiency investment, usually on plant
replacement. Energy efficiency improvements
offer a fast, cost-effective means of reducing
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The EEO
encourages investment in energy efficiency
improvements through various programmes i
(see below). Its budget for 1995-96 has been
increased to £135 million.
Combined Heat and Power
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is an
energy-efficient technology which puts heat
which would otherwise be wasted to use.
CHP can increase overall efficiency to as
much as 70-90 per cent, compared with
30-50 per cent for conventional electricity
generation. Apart from saving money, this
benefits the environment by reducing
emissions of greenhouse gases, including C02
In spring 1995 total installed capacity of
CHP in Britain was approximately 3,200
megawatts (MW) on 1,200 sites.2
'l tonne of oil equivalent = 41.868 gigajoules.
21 MW = 1,000 Kilowatts (kW).

ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Energy Efficiency Schemes
The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme gives
dvice and grants to householders on low
ncomes or over the age of 60 for draught-
iroofing and loft and water tank insulation,
jovernment spending on the programme, £11
nillion in 1994—95, is to grow to about £100
nillion during 1995-96. The Small Company
Environmental and Energy Management
Assistance Scheme (SCEEMAS) has been
levised primarily to support the EU eco
nanagement and audit scheme (see p. 369) in
Britain. SCEEMAS provides grants to help
mall manufacturing and industrial
irganisations, with up to 250 employees
vorldwide, obtain consultancy advice in
:stablishing an environmental management
fystem. Grants of up to 50 per cent will be
laid towards the cost of consultancy fees.
The Energy Design Advice Scheme
EDAS), funded by the DTI, aims to
mprove the energy and environmental
lerformance of the building stock. The
EDAS makes low-energy building design
ixpertise more accessible for the energy
ifficiency and restoration of buildings.
The EEO’s initiative for business and the
lublic sector, the Making a Corporate
Commitment campaign, underlines the need
or senior management to commit itself to
'aise the profile of energy efficiency within its
irganisation and provides a focus for action.
Over 1,800 organisations have joined the
:ampaign to date.
Publicity campaigns (the latest being
Wasting Energy Costs the Earth’), which
include extensive media coverage, tell
householders how they can combat global
warming by improving the energy efficiency
of their homes.
The Standard Assessment Procedure
(SAP) for home energy rating has been
incorporated into the revised building
regulations for England and Wales. From July
1995, all new dwellings, including
conversions, submitted for building control
will be required to have a SAP rating.
The Energy Saving Trust is an independent
organisation set up by the Government, British
Gas and the electricity companies to develop
new programmes to promote the efficient use
of energy. It is currently preparing proposals
for the Government’s consideration.
OIL AND GAS
Britain has substantial oil and gas reserves
offshore on the UKCS. Recent trends have
been the exploitation of smaller reservoirs
and an increase in production, with
significant discoveries, especially west of
Shetland, still to be developed.
In 1994, 40 companies were supplying
gas to industrial and commercial
consumers. There was record gas
production for the fifth year in a row,
the highest rate of oil production for
nearly ten years and record numbers
of development wells being drilled
on the UKCS.
All plans for the development of oil
and gas fields must be approved by the
Government. It has granted exploration and
production licences as a result of 15 offshore
licensing rounds since 1964. By the end of
1994, 5,506 wells had been or were being
drilled in the UKCS: 2,595 development
wells, 1,818 exploration wells and 1,093
appraisal wells.
Oil and Gas Licensing
The 15th round, which closed in July 1994,
requested applications for 81 blocks in the
established areas of the central and southern
North Sea. Awards for 29 of the blocks
were quickly made. For the 16th round
nominations for inclusion were received from
29 companies for a total of 328 blocks; 164
were offered. A number are in environmentally
sensitive areas. If awarded, there will be strict
licence conditions to ensure that there are no
adverse effects on wildlife or habitat. In
March 1995, 691 blocks were nominated for
inclusion in the 17th round.
Offshore Supplies
The role of the Oil and Gas Projects and
Supplies Office (OSO) of the DTI is to assist
255
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOL
Britain’s oil and gas supplies industry to win
an increasing share of a world market worth
over £140,000 million. It provides market
information, encourages increased
competitiveness, promotes Britain’s capabilities
and supports British bids. The OSO focuses
on markets where British companies have the
best opportunities and where government
action can increase these opportunities.
All oil companies, their suppliers and the
DTI are partners in the Cost Reduction in
the New Era Initiative, which has led to a fall
of 30 per cent in capital costs since 1992.
Research
The Offshore Energy Technology Board
advises the OSO on its offshore technology
programme. A number of universities,
research institutes and private-sector
companies carry out oil-related research.
Funding comes from private-sector oil and
supplies companies, the OSO, the Marine
Technology Directorate Ltd and the
Petroleum Science and Technology Institute.
The Offshore Technology Park in Aberdeen
comprises several research facilities.
Since 1965 the industry has generated
trading profits of some £165,000
million, of which £60,000 million have
been reinvested in the industry,
£77,000 million paid to the Exchequer,
and £28,000 million left for disposal
by the oil companies. High levels of
investment in 1991—93 have produced
strong rises in output.
Proceeds from the sale of oil in 1994-95
were up 9.5 per cent on 1993-94; those from
the sale of gas were up 7 per cent. Total
value of oil and gas produced onshore is
estimated at £385 million in 1994, compared
with £300 million in 1993.
Economic and Industrial Aspects
In 1994 UKCS oil and gas production
accounted for nearly 2 per cent of Britain’s
gross national product. Total revenue from
the sale of oil and gas produced from the
UKCS in 1994 is estimated at £9,500 million
and £3,800 million respectively. Taxes and
royalty receipts attributable to UKCS oil and
gas are estimated at £1,600 million in 1994 95.
Gross capital investment from British
sources in the oil and gas extraction industry
amounted to some £3,600 million in 1994,
compared with £4,700 million in 1993.
This was about 16 per cent of British
industrial investment and 4 per cent of gross
domestic fixed capital formation. Some
27,300 people were employed offshore in
September 1994.
Offshore Safety
Offshore health and safety are the
responsibility of the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE; see p. 195). Government
funding for the HSE’s Offshore Safety
Division reached £35 million in 1994-95.
OIL
For centuries small quantities of oil have
been produced in mainland Britain. The firsl
onshore production well was at Hardstoft
(Derbyshire) after the First World War.
Some 250 onshore wells came into operation
in 1939-40, though by the early 1960s they
were producing only 150,000 tonnes a year—
about 0.3 per cent of refinery output. Britain
was almost wholly dependent for its oil
supplies on imports. However, the first
notable offshore discovery of oil in the
UKCS was made in 1969 and the first oil
brought ashore in 1975. Output of crude oil
and natural gas liquids (NGLs) in Britain in
1994 averaged 2.72 million barrels (about
360,000 tonnes) a day, making Britain the
world’s eighth largest producer.
North Sea Fields
There were 62 offshore fields producing
crude oil at the end of February 1995, and j
new offshore development projects (nine of
them for oil) were approved during 1994.
The fields with the largest cumulative
production totals are Forties and Brent.
Ninian, Piper, Beryl, Fulmar, Magnus,
Statfjord (UK) and Claymore are other higl
producers. Remaining recoverable reserves <

"Crude oil plus condensates.
UKCS oil in the ‘proven’ plus ‘probable’
categories amount to 2,865 million tonnes,
while the total remaining potential of the
UKCS could be about 7,000 million tonnes
on current estimates.
Production from most large fields is
controlled from platforms of either steel or
concrete which have been built to withstand
severe weather, including gusts of wind of up
to 260 km/h (160 mph) and waves of 30. m
(100 ft). The Petroleum Act 1987 provides
for the abandonment of offshore oil and gas
installations and pipelines on the UKCS.
Abandonment Guidance Notes for Industry
were issued for consultation in May 1995.
The Brent Spar abandonment programme
provided for the disposal of this offshore
storage and loading buoy in over 2,200 m
(7,300 ft) of water in the north-east Atlantic.
In June, however, Shell announced that they
had decided not to proceed with the sea
disposal of the Brent Spar. The Government
is to consider any requests its owners make
in relation to onshore disposal. Further
proposals, however, will need to satisfy the
Government on those issues which led to the
conclusion that deep sea disposal was the best
practicable environmental option.
Structure of the Oil Industry
About 250 private sector companies,
including many large oil firms, operate in
Britain or engage in work on the UKCS.
Exploration and development of the UKCS
are carried out by the private sector. The
Government receives royalties from UKCS
oil and petroleum revenue tax.
The two leading British oil companies are
British Petroleum (BP) and Shell Transport
and Trading, which has a 40 per cent
interest in the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of
Companies. BP and Shell are the two
largest industrial companies in Britain in
terms of turnover.
Land-based Fields
Onshore production of crude oil and NGLs
is much less significant than offshore
production. In 1994 it was 4.6 million tonnes
a 24 per cent increase on 1993, 89 per cent o
which came from Britain’s largest onshore
field at Wytch Farm (Dorset). In addition to
minor production from various mining
licensees, other onshore fields include
Welton (Lincolnshire) and Wareham
258
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Dorset). Small independent companies
)lay an increasingly prominent role in
mshore exploration. At the end of 1994,
158 landward petroleum licences were in
hrce, covering an area of 20,858 sq km
8,050 sq miles).
Refineries
Britain’s refinery industry (14 refineries) is
ane of the most modern and efficient in
Europe. In 1994 the refinery sector
processed 93.1 million tonnes of crude and
process oils (3 per cent down on 1993).
About 80 per cent of output (by weight) is
in the form of lighter, higher-value
products such as gasoline, DERV and jet
kerosene. By comparison, the proportion of
Western European refinery output
accounted for by these higher-value
products is about 70 per cent.
Consumption
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1994 included 22.8 million
tonnes of motor spirit, 12.9 million tonnes of
DERV fuel, 7.3 million tonnes of aviation
turbine fuel, 7.8 million tonnes of gas oil and
10.8 million tonnes of fuel oils.
Trade
Britain’s refinery sector has set new records
for exports in each of the three years
1992-94. In 1994, it exported nearly 30
million tonnes of refined petroleum products
and NGLs (separated at North Sea
terminals), 32 per cent of its output (worth
£1,100 million to the balance of payments).
Virtually all exports went to Britain’s
partners in the EU and the IEA, the largest
markets being France, the Irish Republic,
Italy, the Netherlands and Germany, and,
s, outside the EU, the United States.
)1
! Oil Pipelines
Oil pipelines brought ashore about 80 per
cent of offshore oil in 1994. Some 2,500 km
(1,560 miles) of major submarine pipeline
brings oil ashore from the North Sea
oilfields. Major crude oil onshore pipelines
(from harbours, land terminals or offshore
moorings to refineries) include those
connecting Grangemouth to Finnart, Cruden
Bay to Grangemouth, and Purbeck to
Southampton. Onshore pipelines also carry
refined products to major marketing areas;
for example, a 423-km (263-mile) pipeline
runs from Milford Haven to the Midlands
and Manchester, while similar pipelines run
from Fawley to Wolverhampton and from
Lindsey to north London. Chemical pipelines
include one from Mossmorran to
Grangemouth and another (405 km; 252 miles)
from Grangemouth to Stanlow.
GAS
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain
began in the early 19th century in central
London. For many years gas was produced
from coal, but during the 1960s growing
imports of oil brought about production of
town gas from oil-based feedstocks. Following
the first commercial natural gas discovery in
the UKCS in 1965 and the start of offshore
gas production in 1967, supplies of offshore
natural gas grew rapidly and by 1977 natural
gas had replaced town gas in the public
supply system in Great Britain.
Up to the end of 1994 some £15,000
million had been spent on developing
natural gas resources on the UKCS
and 1,031,876 million cubic metres
had been produced. Britain is the
world’s fifth largest gas producer—
after Russia, the United States,
Canada, and the Netherlands.
Structure
When it was privatised in 1986, British Gas
pic was given a monopoly of supplies to
premises taking less than 25,000 therms a
year. Contract customers taking more than
this were able, in theory, to buy their gas
from other suppliers. Since 1988 various
steps have been taken to develop competition
in gas supply. In 1993 the Government required
259
*1/
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
British Gas to separate its supply and
transportation activities and to bring forward
removal of its tariff monopoly to March 1996,
with a phased opening of the domestic
market (18.4 million customers) in 1996-98.
The Gas Bill, now before Parliament,
would reform the gas industry, so as to bring
consumers the benefits of competition. In
particular, it would provide for a new
; licensing framework for:
• gas suppliers, who sell piped gas to
consumers;
• public gas transporters, who operate the
pipeline system through which such gas
will normally be delivered; and
• gas shippers, who are to arrange with
transporters for appropriate amounts of
gas to be moved through the pipeline
system.
The regulatory regime for the private gas
f sector charges the Office of Gas Supply
* (Ofgas) with ensuring that British Gas is
I operating within the terms of its authorisation.
1 The Gas Consumers’ Council, independent
/ of both British Gas and Ofgas, is responsible
G for investigating consumer complaints.
Production
In 1994 indigenous production of natural gas
amounted to 69,960 million cubic metres.
This included 4,694 million cubic metres of
gas used for drilling, production and piping
operations on North Sea production
platforms and at terminals. Total availability
of UKCS gas amounted to 71,400 million
cubic metres—7.7 per cent higher than in
1993. In addition, about 3,275 million cubic
metres of gas were imported from Norway.
I Some 1,092 million cubic metres were
J exported. Natural gas accounts for 65.7 per
cent of total inland primary fuel consumption
in Britain. Natural gas from the three most
prolific of the 50 or so offshore gasfields—
^ Leman, Indefatigable (South) and the Hewett
area—accounted for over half the cumulative
total gas produced in the UKCS. In addition
to supplies from gasfields, associated gas,3
^Mainly methane, produced and used on oil production
platforms.
delivered to land via the Far North Liquids
and Associated Gas System (FLAGS) and
from Alwyn North, made further significant
contributions. Gas from the South Morecambe
field in the Irish Sea and from the twin North
Sean and South Sean fields is used to augment
supplies to meet peak demand in winter.
There are various methods of natural gas
storage, including salt cavities and storage
facilities for liquefied natural gas. The
partially depleted Rough field is used as a
major gas store. Gas is drawn from the
national transmission system in summer and
injected into the Rough reservoir for rapid
recovery during periods of peak winter demand.
Reserves
Remaining recoverable gas reserves in present
discoveries are estimated at between 660,000
million and 1.92 million million cubic metres.
If possible gas from existing discoveries and
potential future discoveries are added, the
remaining total reserves are estimated to be
in the range of 1.226 million million to
3.8 million million cubic metres. Indigenous
offshore natural gas reserves are likely to
meet most of the British demand well into
the next century.
Transmission
The British Gas national and regional
high-pressure pipeline system of some
267,300 km (167,060 miles) transports
natural gas around Great Britain. It is largely
supplied from five North Sea shore terminals,
and one in Barrow-in-Furness (Cumbria).
The high pressure transmission system is
inspected regularly.
Newly built natural gas pipelines, run by
independent operators, run from Horndean
to Barking and from Theddlethorpe to
Killingholme.
Consumption
Sales of natural gas in Britain totalled 706
terawatt4 hours (TWh) in 1994. About 53 per
cent of this is for industrial and commercial
41 TW = 1,000 gigawatts. 1 GW = 1,000 MW.

purposes, the remainder being for domestic
use. Gas is used extensively in industries
requiring the control of temperatures to a fine
degree of accuracy, such as the pottery and
glass industries, and in certain processes for
making iron and steel products.
Some 281 TWh of this gas were sold to
industry in Britain, and 95 TWh to
commercial (including other non-domestic)
users. Industrial gas prices have fallen by
about 39 per cent in real terms since
privatisation, and domestic prices by
15.5 per cent. An increasingly large part of
domestic demand is for gas for central heating.
In 1994, 330 TWh were sold to domestic users.
Development
British Gas has a worldwide reputation for gas
technology, with a research and development
programme totalling £19.1 million in 1994. It
is one of nine companies to join in building
an interconnector linking the British and
European gas grids, to come into operation by
late 1998, for a total investment of £170 million.
Among its overseas activities, the company is
drilling to add to reserves in the Gulf of
Thailand and developing a gas field in Trinidad.
COAL
The size of the British coal industry has
reduced drastically since the 1960s. Yet coal
mining in Britain can be traced back to
Roman times. Taxes raised on its sale helped
pay for rebuilding London, and St Paul’s
Cathedral, after the Great Fire of 1666. Coal
played a crucial part in the industrial
revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. In
its peak year, 1913, the industry produced
292 million tonnes of coal, exported 74
million tonnes and employed over a million
workers. In 1947 (when 200 million tonnes
were produced) the coal mines passed into
public ownership, and the National Coal
Board (now British Coal) was set up.5 In 1955
there were 850 British Coal collieries in
operation; by 1994 the number had dwindled
to 15 (excluding Asfordby in Leicestershire,
5 British Coal will continue to have residual functions beyond
1995.
still under development), with a labour
force of 7,400 and some 3,000 contractors.
Despite this, the year also saw growth in
the private sector, as nine mines which
British Coal had previously closed were
transferred under licence to private-sector
owners. Coal production, reflecting a fourfold
increase in labour productivity since 1986,
was 48 million tonnes.
Privatisation
The Coal Industry Act 1994 enabled
privatisation of the industry to take place.
Five regional coal companies and seven
care-and-maintenance collieries (23 collieries
and 32 opencast sites in all) were offered for
sale. The three English regions were bought
by RJB Mining pic; the South Wales
company went to Celtic Group Holdings
Ltd; and the Scottish company to Mining
(Scotland) Ltd. Four care-and-maintenance6
collieries were also sold. Total proceeds from
the sales came to about £960 million.
Coal Authority
Set up under the Coal Industry Act 1994, the
Coal Authority took over ownership of coal
reserves from British Coal. Its role is to:
• make these reserves available for coal
mining and coal bed methane operations;
• license coal mining;
• take responsibility for the physical legacy
of past mining, to the extent that this
arises out of the ownership of the coal
reserves and is not taken over by the
private sector; and
• make available mining records and
geological information.
Market for Coal
In 1994 inland consumption of coal was
81.7 million tonnes, of which about
77 per cent was by power stations, 11 per

cent by coke ovens and 5 per cent by domestic
users. Exports were 1.2 million tonnes, while
imports amounted to 15 million tonnes.
Production
In 1994 total output of 48 million tonnes
included 31.1 million tonnes of deep-mined coal
and 16.6 million tonnes from opencast mines.
Research
Work on the £44 million coal liquefaction
plant project at Point of Ayr (Clwyd) ended
in late 1994.
It successfully demonstrated technology to
produce high grade petrol and diesel fuels
from a range of coals. The Government has
encouraged the formation of an industry-led
consortium, Clean Coal Power Generation
Group, to pursue coal gasification. Its initial
objective was to develop the air blown
gasification cycle, a power generation
technology. There are about 40 projects in
progress within this and related initiatives, to
a total project value of £74 million, including
£14 million from the DTI.
ELECTRICITY
England and Wales
The privatised electricity supply industry in
England and Wales consists of two main
generating companies, the National Grid
Company (NGC) and 12 regional electricity
companies (RECs). The two main non¬
nuclear generators, National Power and
PowerGen, the publicly owned nuclear
generator, Nuclear Electric pic, and other
generators and importers sell electricity to
suppliers through a market known as the
pool. The NGC operates the transmission
system, which transfers electricity in bulk
across the national grid. The NGC is owned
by the RECs through a holding company.
Distribution—the transfer of electricity
from the national grid to consumers via local
networks—is carried out by the RECs.
Supply is the purchase of electricity from
generators and its sale to customers. RECs
have a monopoly of all franchise sales (to
consumers taking less than 100 kW) in their
regions. These RECs are known as first-tier
suppliers. Above 100 kW the market is
already open to competition, and consumers
may have contracts with a second-tier
supplier, who could be one of the generators,
a REC from a different region, or an
independent supplier.
The Government sold its remaining
40 per cent shareholding in each of National
Power and PowerGen in March 1995.
Scotland
Scottish Power pic and Scottish Hydro-
Electric pic generate, transmit, distribute and
supply electricity. They are also contracted to
buy all the output from Scottish Nuclear
Ltd, a government-owned company which
operates the nuclear power stations at
Hunterston (Strathclyde) and Torness
(Lothian). ScottishPower and Scottish
Hydro-Electric have access, under contract,
to a stated capacity in each other’s generating
stations. This gives each company access to a
good range of generating fuels.
Associated Functions
Certain service and co-ordinating functions
for the industry are undertaken by the
Electricity Association, jointly owned by
the electricity companies of Great Britain.
Regulation of the industry is the
responsibility of the Office of Electricity
Regulation, headed by the Director
General of Electricity Supply (DGES),
whose duties include the promotion of
competition and the protection of consumer
interests. In 1994-95 the DGES asked
National Power and PowerGen to sell 4,000
MW and 2,000 MW respectively of oil- and
coal-fired capacity. The aim is to increase
the number of independent generators and
thus competition.
Northern Ireland

1993. Three private companies generate
electricity from four power stations. The
largest power station, Ballylumford, is being
converted from oil to gas firing and accounts
for almost half Northern Ireland’s generating
capacity. Regulation of the industry is the
responsibility of the Office of Electricity
Regulation (NI), headed by the Director
General of Electricity Supply (NI).
Consumption
In 1994 sales of electricity through the
distribution system in Britain amounted to
284,439 GWh. Domestic users took 35 per
cent of the total, industry 32 per cent, and
commercial and other users the remainder.
Generation
National Power owns 28 operational fossil-
fuelled power stations, which, together with
their hydro schemes, generate about 35 per
cent of the electricity supplied to the
transmission and distribution networks in
England and Wales. PowerGen’s 19
operational fossil-fuelled power stations and
other hydro schemes together generate about
26 per cent. The nuclear stations in Great
Britain generate almost 27 per cent.
In 1994-95, 54 per cent of electricity used
in Scotland was produced by Scottish
Nuclear’s two stations. In addition to nuclear
generation, Scotland’s electricity needs are
met from hydro, coal, and gas—a total output
capacity of 9,900 MW. Scottish Nuclear sells
74.9 per cent of its output to ScottishPower
and the rest to Hydro-Electric.
Non-nuclear power stations owned by
Britain’s major power producers consumed
50.6 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 1994,
of which coal accounted for 71 per cent and
oil 7 per cent.
The growing number of independent
generators and ‘autogenerators’ (who
produce power for their own use) have
equal access with the major generators to
the grid transmission and local distribution
systems.
To control acid emissions National Power
and PowerGen expect to complete their
programme of fitting flue gas
desulphurisation (FGD) equipment to 6 GW
of their generating capacity by the end of
1996. ScottishPower is evaluating FGD
equipment with a view to fitting this at its
main coal station, Longannet. In addition, a
ten-year programme to control emissions of
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) through the
installation of low-NOx burners at 12 major
power stations in England and Wales is in
progress. ScottishPower is fitting low-NOx

burners, and refurbishing electrostatic
precipitators, at Longannet.
The increase in the number of combined
cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) has been a
significant development in electricity
generation. CCGTs are quicker and cheaper
to build than conventional plant. They use
natural gas, are low in sulphur emissions, and
help reduce C02 emissions. In England and
Wales, 17 such stations (total declared net
capacity 9.2 GW) are generating electricity; 4
(total registered capacity 4.4 GW) are under
construction; and 8 (total registered capacity
4.8 GW) have consents and are likely to go
ahead. Some 13 per cent of electricity in
Britain was derived from gas in 1994.
The NGC, together with Electricite de
France, runs a 2,000-MW cross-Channel
cable link, providing the capacity for the
transmission of electricity between the two
countries. The link has generally been used to
supply baseload electricity—electricity that
needs to be generated and available round the
clock—from France to England. Imports of
electricity met about 5 per cent of Britain s
electricity needs in 1994.
Transmission lines linking the Scottish and
English grid systems enable cross-border
trading. This interconnector is run jointly by
the NGC and ScottishPower. The capacity of
the interconnector has been increased from
850 MW to 1,600 MW, and there are plans
for further enhancement of the line’s capacity.
NIE pic and ScottishPower plan to'construct
a 250-MW interconnector between Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Reports on two public
inquiries are awaited.
Nuclear Power
In 1956 the world’s first industrial-scale
nuclear power station, at Calder Hall
(Cumbria), began to supply electricity to the
national grid. It, together with the Magnox
station at Chapelcross (Dumfries and
Galloway), is still operated by British Nuclear
Fuels pic (BNFL). The electricity generated
at Chapelcross is sold to England. There are
also 14 commercial nuclear power stations
operated by Nuclear Electric and Scottish
Nuclear. The former has 6 Magnox stations
(with capacities ranging from 245 to 950
MW) and 5 Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor
stations (AGRs; ranging from 1,110 MW to
1,250 MW). Scottish Nuclear operates two
1,320-MW AGR stations. Nuclear Electric
has also built Britain’s first pressurised water
reactor (PWR; 1,188 MW) at Sizewell
(Suffolk). Three Magnox stations (one each
in England, Wales and Scotland) have
reached the end of their commercial life and
have been shut down, before being
decommissioned.
Nuclear power generation increases
diversity of energy supply and helps
maintain its security, and nuclear stations
produce no sulphur dioxide (S02) or C02. A
non- fossil fuel obligation (NFFO), placed on
the RECs in England and Wales, requires
them to contract for specified amounts of
electricity from non-fossil sources. They
contract for this non-fossil capacity at prices
above the market rate and the difference is
returned to them through the fossil fuel levy
(10 per cent) on electricity sales. Although
most NFFO electricity comes from nuclear
sources, a small but increasing amount comes
from renewables.
Under its NFFO contract, Nuclear
Electric obtains a premium price on output
up to a certain limit in each year until the
contract ends in 1998. For output above this
level, Nuclear Electric gets the same price as
other generators. It expects these prices to
enable the full cost of nuclear generation to
be met, including the decommissioning of its
two closed Magnox stations at Berkeley
(1989) and Trawsfynydd (1993).
Nuclear Energy Agreement
The NFFO does not apply in Scotland where,
under the Nuclear Energy Agreement (NEA),
ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric are
required to take all of the electricity generated
by Scottish Nuclear. From 1990 to 1994 the
price which Scottish Nuclear received for its
output was fixed above the market rate for
electricity. The price is now set to taper until
1998 to one based on the market rate for
electricity in England and Wales. Therefore
Scottish Nuclear’s income under the NEA will
depend on the market rate. The NEA is due
to run until 2005.

Nuclear Review
The main conclusions of this review,
undertaken by the Government and
published in May 1995, are that:
• Britain’s AGRs and PWRs should be
transferred to the private sector;
• the parts of Nuclear Electric and Scottish
Nuclear to be privatised will be
subsidiaries of a single holding company
with headquarters in Scotland;
• Magnox stations and their liabilities will
be kept in the public sector;
• the Government sees no case at present
for providing public funds for building
new nuclear power stations;
• the nuclear element of the fossil fuel
levy, and the premium element of the
NEA, will cease on privatisation; and
• renewable energy (see below) will
continue to be supported through the
fossil fuel levy on electricity bills.
In the Government’s opinion, the review
confirms the importance of nuclear power to
the country’s energy needs, and suggests that
nuclear power will continue to have an
important role, as long as it is competitive
and able to maintain high standards of safety
and environmental protection.
British Nuclear Fuels
BNFL provides services covering the whole
of the nuclear fuel cycle. The company is
wholly owned by the Government.
BNFL’s thermal oxide reprocessing plant
(THORP) at Sellafield (Cumbria) began
operations in 1994. Built at a cost of
£2,800 million, including its share of
associated facilities, THORP reprocesses
spent fuel from British and overseas nuclear
reactors. Environmental protection plant
costing £600 million was brought on stream
at the same time. BNFL already supplies fuel
for the PWR at Sizewell and for all Magnox
and AGR stations in Britain. The Sellafield
Mixed Oxide Fuel plant, currently under
construction and due to become operational
in late 1997, will blend plutonium recovered
from reprocessing with uranium, to make
mixed oxide fuel for use in reactors
worldwide. BNFL contributes waste
management and decommissioning expertise
to international joint ventures. A subsidiary
company, BNFL Inc, has won environmental
restoration contracts with the United States
Department of Energy.
AEA Technology
AEA Technology is the commercial business
of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority, which provides science and
engineering services to the nuclear industry
worldwide and to other industrial sectors.
UKAEA Government Division
UKAEA Government Division is responsible
for the safe management and
decommissioning of UKAEA’s nuclear
facilities and the safe management of its
radioactive waste. It is also responsible for
Britain’s fusion programme (see below).
267
BRITAIN 1996. AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Nuclear Research
Most of the DTI’s nuclear expenditure is on
the decommissioning of redundant nuclear
research and development facilities. These
include research and demonstration power
reactors, such as the Steam Generating Heavy
Water Reactor at Winfrith in Dorset, and
Windscale AGR (Cumbria), and the
Dounreay Fast Reactor and the Prototype
Fast Reactor in the Highland region. The
radioactive wastes arising from this
programme are stored safely until their final
disposal in authorised purpose-built facilities.
The Government plans to spend £15.7
million in 1995-96 on fusion research. About
half of this is Britain’s contribution to the EU
Joint European Torus nuclear project at
Culham (Oxfordshire). The remaining half
goes to fund a national programme of fusion
research carried out by the UfCAEA as part
of the EU fusion programme.
The DTI also funds assessments of
advanced reactor safety and of international
safety standards, and the transfer of
technology to help improve nuclear safety in
the former Soviet Union, and in central and
eastern Europe. In 1995 it contributed
£5 million to the nuclear safety account at
the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, which finances safety
improvements at the higher-risk nuclear
plants in those countries.
Nuclear Safety
Both public and private nuclear operators
will be subject to the same rigorous safety
regime that applied before privatisation of
the relevant parts of Scottish Nuclear and
Nuclear Electric. This regime is enforced by
the HSE’s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate
(Nil), which ensures that high standards of
safety are incorporated into the design,
construction, operation, maintenance and
decommissioning of all nuclear plant, and
eventual disposal of resulting wastes. While
the safety of such plant in Britain is the
ultimate responsibility of the nuclear
operator, the Nil has the power to shut down
a plant if it thinks it unsafe and may also
require improvements to an installation if it
believes the appropriate standards of safety
are not being met.
Discharges of radioactive waste have to be
kept within the limits and conditions set by
authorisations granted under the Radioactive
Substances Act 1993. Within maximum dose
limits, operators of nuclear facilities are
required to keep discharges as low as
reasonably achievable and failure to do so
makes them liable to prosecution.
Britain is one of 58 signatories of the
Nuclear Safety Convention agreed in
Vienna in 1994. This is designed to achieve
a high standard of nuclear safety worldwide,
by encouraging best practice in the safe
design, construction, operation and
regulation of nuclear power plants. Each
signatory will produce a national report
stating how it meets or intends to meet a
range of nuclear safety obligations set out in
the Convention.
Emergency Plans
The precautions taken in the design and
construction of nuclear installations in Britain,
and the care taken in their operation and
maintenance, reduce the chance of accidents
which might affect the public to an extremely
low level. However, all operators are required,
as a condition of their site licences, to prepare
emergency plans, including those for dealing
with an accidental release of radioactivity.
These are regularly tested in exercises under
the supervision of the NIL
International conventions have been
established on the early notification of a
nuclear accident which may have possible
transboundary effects, and on the mutual
provision of assistance in the event of a
nuclear accident or radiological emergency.
NEW AND RENEWABLE SOURCES OF
ENERGY
The Government encourages development of
new and renewable energy sources wherever
they have prospects of being economically
attractive and environmentally acceptable. It
is working towards 1,500 MW (3 per cent of
Britain’s current capacity) of new electricity
generating capacity from renewable energy
268
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
;ources, for Britain as a whole, by 2000.
\chieving this capacity could produce annual
savings of 2 million tonnes of C02, 100,000
:onnes of S02 and about 30,000 tonnes of
i \Ox. Looking further ahead, renewables
: might be able to supply up to 20 per cent of
Britain’s 1991 electricity needs by 2025,
under severe pressures of need and economics.
Making NFFO orders is the Government’s
main instrument for helping to develop the
new capacity. Through the NFFO the
Government aims to create an initial market
for electricity-producing technologies close to
commercial competitiveness, so that the most
promising renewables can compete without
financial support.
Three renewables Orders have been made
for England and Wales and one each (in 1994)
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. At the end
of 1994, 144 projects contracted in England
j and Wales under the first two orders were
operating, with a declared net capacity of 325
MW. The first Scottish Renewables
Obligation was for 76 MW capacity.
The main renewable technologies
i identified as relevant to Britain are:
• biofuels (landfill gas, energy from wastes,
and energy crops);
• solar energy (active, passive and
photovoltaics);
• wind; and
• hydro.
Among new sources under investigation are
advanced fuel cells.
International collaboration is undertaken
through multilateral and bilateral
arrangements within the IEA and the EU.
These include:
• JOULE, which supports research into
economically viable and environmentally
sound energy technologies;
• THERMIE, which aims to promote
innovative energy technologies in energy
efficiency, renewable energy and clean
coal and hydrocarbons; and
• ALTENER, which is designed to foster
development of renewable sources in the
EU, and increase trade in products,
equipment and services.
Non-energy Minerals
Although much of Britain’s requirements for
industrial raw materials is met by imports,
the non-energy minerals it produces make
an important contribution to the economy.
Output of non-energy minerals in 1993
totalled 325 million tonnes, valued at
£1,832 million. Construction raw materials,
in particular aggregates, form the bulk of the
value of non-energy minerals production.
The total number of employees in the
extractive industry was some 32,000 in 1993.
Exploration
The Government is seeking to restrict the
growth in England of quarries supplying rock,
and sand and gravel for construction. It also
expects the construction industry to double
the amount of recycled and secondary material
it uses, and to reduce its dependence on
primary aggregates extracted on land from 83
to 68 per cent by 2006. Coastal superquarries
from outside England may make an increased
contribution to aggregates requirements in the
future. Scottish Office guidelines on minerals
working in Scotland include a policy that there
should be no more than four superquarries in
Scotland over the period to 2009.
The British Geological Survey continues a
long-term programme for the DTI aimed at
identifying areas with mineral potential. Gold
exploration by the private sector has decreased
but continues, especially in Scotland,
Northern Ireland and south-west England. In
Wales small-scale production of gold takes
place at the Gwynfynydd mine. Planning
permission for a small underground gold mine
at Cononish, near Tyndrum (Perthshire), and
for a small opencast gold mine at Cavancaw in
Northern Ireland has recently been granted.
Production
In terms of value, production of limestone
and dolomite was estimated at £514 million
in 1993, sand and gravel £440 million, clays
£302 million (with china clay valued at £230
million), igneous rock £250 million,
sandstone £74 million, potash £71 million,
salt £51 million, chalk £38 million, silica

sands £36 million, gypsum and anhydrite
£18 million, fluorspar £9 million and tin
£7 million. In 1993 the production of metals
in non-ferrous ores totalled 3,000 tonnes,
mainly tin from Cornwall. In 1994 South
Crofty, the one remaining Cornish tin mine
and one of the very few sources of tin in the
EU, produced 1,919 tonnes of tin-in¬
concentrate, a 14 per cent decrease on 1993
and equivalent to about 18.5 per cent of
Britain’s demand. Some lead and a little zinc
are produced as by-products of fluorspar.
Water
Britain’s water supplies are obtained mostly
(about 75 per cent) from surface sources such
as mountain lakes, reservoirs and river
intakes, and partly (about 25 per cent) from
groundwater. The 22-month wet period from
July 1992 brought about a rapid recovery in
water resources, especially in eastern,
southern and central England. In August
1995, during an exceptionally dry spell, the
Government set out the measures it is taking
to achieve a more sustainable pattern of use
of water resources. About 99 per cent of the
population in Great Britain and 97 per cent
in Northern Ireland are served by the public
water supply system. Water put into the
public supply system (including industrial
and other uses) in England and Wales
amounted to 16,433 megalitres (Ml) a da\ in j
1994, of which average domestic daily
consumption per household was 380 litres.
An average of 2,272 Ml a day was supplied in
Scotland in 1993-94.
Some 51,658 Ml a day were abstracted in
England and Wales in 1993, of which public
water supplies accounted for 16,651 Ml a da>.
The electricity generating companies and othei
industry took 30,474 Ml a day. Fish farming,
cress growing and amenity ponds took 3,817
Ml a day. Agriculture took 140 Ml a day.
England and Wales
The Secretaries of State for the Environmeni
and for Wales, the Director General of Wate
Services and the National Rivers Authority
(NRA) are the principal regulators. The
Drinking Water Inspectorate regulates
drinking water quality. The Minister of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the
Secretary of State for Wales are responsible

Water Companies
The ten water service companies have
statutory responsibilities for water supply, its
quality and sufficiency, and for sewerage and
sewage treatment. The supply-only
companies, of which there were 29 in the
private sector in 1989, now, after various
mergers, number 21. They supply water to
about a quarter of the population.
The Water Industry Act 1991 allows the
water companies to determine their own
methods of charging. In the Government’s
view, water metering is potentially the fairest
way of paying for water, even though it
would take time to introduce and would not
be appropriate everywhere. In general,
companies require new properties and those
substantially converted to have metered
supplies. Commercial and industrial concerns
are metered on a compulsory basis.
A system of economic regulation and
guaranteed standards of service is overseen by
OFWAT, the office of the Director General
of Water Services. It has a duty to ensure
that water companies are able to finance the
carrving-out of their statutory obligations, it
promotes economy and efficiency within the
water industry and, where appropriate,
competition; and it has to protect the
interests of customers and to ensure that
there is no undue preference or
discrimination in the fixing of charges. The
Director General also sets limits to the rate
at which water companies can increase
their prices.
Over 99 per cent of the population is
connected to mains drinking water supplies.
These supplies are of high quality and all are
safe to drink. Supplies are tested regularly; in
1994 (the latest year for which data are
available) over 99 per cent of the nearly
4 million tests complied with the relevant
drinking water quality standards. In Britain
some of these standards are stricter than those
in the EC drinking water directive, and have
been set on health grounds to provide
additional protection for public health. The
remaining standards are in line with the
requirements of the directive. All standards
have to be met at consumers’ taps, as this
provides the best protection for public health.
National Rivers Authority
The NRA is a non-departmental public body
with statutory duties and powers to regulate
the water environment, including
management of water resources and pollution
control, and to carry out flood defence,
fisheries, recreation, conservation and
navigation duties and operations in England
and Wales. Its responsibilities extend to all
rivers, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, coastal
waters and water stored naturally
underground. The NRA’s consent is needed
for the abstraction of water and the discharge
of effluent. From 1 April 1996 the functions
currently carried out by the NRA will be
merged with those of Her Majesty’s
Inspectorate of Pollution and those of the
waste regulation authorities to form the
Environment Agency (see p. 368).
Development Projects
Since 1990-91, the water industry has
invested about £15,000 million. The new
price limits set by the Director General
of Water Services in 1994 allow for a
further £24,000 million over ten years:
£11,000 million for quality improvements,
£12,000 million for maintenance of assets
and £1,000 million for additional water
resources and measures to reduce the risk of
flooding from sewers.
The NRA encourages companies to
promote efficient water use and to reduce
leakage (estimated at about 25 per cent in
1994)—thus helping to remove the need for
land-consuming and expensive new
reservoirs. IVlore household meters would, tl
NRA believes, curb demand.
Scotland
In Scotland responsibility for public water
supply, sewerage and sewage disposal rests
with the nine regional and three island
councils (‘the water authorities’). In additior
272
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
the Central Scotland Water Development
Board (CSWDB) is responsible for providing
water in bulk to five regional councils in
central Scotland. In 1994-95 the CSWDB
supplied authorities with an average 261 Ml
a day. From April 1996 three new public
water authorities, North, West and East, will
be responsible for water and sewerage
services in Scotland. The independent
Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers
Council, a representative body for consumers,
will also be established.
The Secretary of State for Scotland is
responsible for promoting conservation of
water resources and provision of adequate
water supplies. He has a duty to promote the
cleanliness of rivers and other inland waters,
and the tidal waters of Scotland. River
purification authorities have a statutory
responsibility for water pollution control,
which will be taken over by the new Scottish
Environment Protection Agency, to be set up
in April 1996.
Water is charged for according to type of
consumer: domestic consumers pay council
water charges or metered charges; non¬
domestic consumers pay non-domestic water
rates, or metered charges. For sewerage
services, domestic consumers pay through
the council tax, and non-domestic
consumers pay non-domestic sewerage rates
and, where appropriate, trade effluent
charges. Charges and rates are decided by
each authority. From April 1996 charging
will become the responsibility of the three
new water authorities.
Scotland has a relative abundance of
unpolluted water from upland sources.
Northern Ireland
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland is responsible for public
water supply and sewerage throughout
Northern Ireland. It is also responsible for
the conservation and cleanliness of water
resources and, with the Department of
Agriculture, may prepare a water
management programme with respect to
water resources in any area. There is a
domestic water charge which is contained in
the regional rate, while agriculture,
commerce and industry pay metered charges.
There are abundant potential supplies of
water for both domestic and industrial use.
An average of 670 Ml of water a day was
supplied in 1993-94.
Research
Several organisations and centres of expertise
provide water research services to
government, the NRA, water companies and
the Scottish river purification authorities.
The Water Research Centre, a private
company, has a large programme of research
into, for example, environmental issues and
drinking water safety.
Research carried out by institutes of the
Natural Environment Research Council
(see p. 323) embraces river modelling,
water quality, climate change, effects on
resources and the impact of pollution
on freshwater.
Among its various roles the Institute of
Hydrology studies the statistics of floods
and droughts.

Major recent developments in British agriculture have been the ending of the
milk marketing schemes, and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round
agreement on agriculture signed by the European Union in April 1994. In that
year the aggregate income of the agricultural sector increased in real terms
for the third year in succession. Environmental schemes underline Britain’s
commitment to environmentally sensitive agriculture.
Agreement has been reached on a new fisheries access regime for Spain
and Portugal in the EU’s western waters and on stricter enforcement of catch
limits in international fisheries off the coast of Canada.
Agriculture
In 1994 British agriculture, forestry and
fishing employed 2.1 per cent- of the total
workforce. Food, feed and beverages
accounted for about 10 per cent of Britain’s
imports by value, compared with about a
quarter in the 1960s. The agricultural
contribution to gross domestic product
(GDP) was £7,800 million in 1994, 1.4 per
cent of the total. Britain is a major exporter
of agricultural produce and food products,
agrochemicals and agricultural machinery.
The Government has three main
objectives for the farming, fisheries and
food industries:
• to improve the economic performance of
the agriculture, fisheries and food
industries by creating the conditions
in which they can flourish efficiently
and sustainably;
• to promote the provision of safe, high-
quality food; and
• to protect and enhance the rural
environment, and to protect farm animals
by encouraging welfare standards.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food (MAFF) has published a range of
customer service standards or codes of
practice in accordance with the principles of
the Citizen’s Charter. MAFF’s regional
service centres, which deal directly with
farmers over matters such as grants and
licences, were first set performance targets in
December 1992; these were revised and the
number of targets increased in January 1995.
All 12 of the Ministry’s specialised
Inspectorates, which enforce quality and fish
or animal health standards, published
comparable documents in 1994. Six MAFF
executive agencies now have service

AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
standards. The Scottish Office Agriculture
and Fisheries Department sets out its
standards of service and performance targets
in a charter standard statement called Serving
Scottish Farmers.
Land Use
The area of agricultural land has been
declining, although there has been a
reduction in the net rate of loss in recent
years. In 1994 there were 11.3 million
hectares (27.9 million acres) under crops and
grass. A further 5.8 million hectares (14.3
million acres) were used for rough grazing,
most of it in hilly areas. Soils vary from the
thin poor ones of highland Britain to the rich
fertile soils of low-lying areas such as the
fenlands of eastern England. The climate is
generally temperate, though rainfall
distribution over Britain is uneven. The
South East receives only about 600 mm (2 ft)
a year, compared with over 1,500 mm (5 ft)
in parts of west Scotland, Cumbria and
Wales. Autumn 1994 saw rather mild weather
over much of Britain, helping to extend the
grazing season and enabling late cuts of silage
to boost fodder stocks.
Land Use in Britain
Farming
In 1994 there were some 244,300 farm
holdings in Britain (excluding minor holdings
too small to be surveyed on a regular basis),
with an average size of 70.1 hectares (173.2
acres)—again excluding minor holdings.
About two-thirds of all agricultural land is
owner-occupied. Some 44.6 per cent of
holdings are smaller than 8 European size
units (ESU).1

and their spouses, and family workers—see
Table 18.1) was estimated at £4,212 million
in 1994, 6.9 per cent more than in 1993. In
real terms this measure of income is about 25
per cent higher than a decade ago.
At the end of 1993 the industry’s gross
capital stock, valued at 1990 prices, amounted
to some £30,470 million, of which buildings
and works made up over two-thirds. The
level of capital stock is now estimated to be
some 6.2 per cent below the 1983-85 average.
This decline reflects a reduction in the stock
of plant and machinery, and, to a lesser
extent, in vehicles. Since 1989, however,
the stock of buildings and works has
changed little and still remains greater than it
was in 1985.

Livestock
Over half of full-time farms are devoted
mainly to dairy farming or to beef cattle and
sheep. The majority of sheep and cattle are
reared in the hill and moorland areas of
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and
northern and south-western England. Beef
fattening occurs partly in better grassland
areas, as does dairying, and partly on arable
farms. British livestock breeders have
developed many of the cattle, sheep and pig
breeds with worldwide reputations, for
example, the Hereford and Aberdeen Angus
beef breeds, the Jersey, Guernsey and
Ayrshire dairy breeds, Large White pigs and
a number of sheep breeds. Developments in
artificial insemination and embryo transfer
have enabled Britain to export semen and
embryos from high-quality donor animals.
Livestock totals are given in Table 18.3.
Cattle and Sheep
Cattle and sheep constitute about 45 per cent
of the value of Britain’s gross agricultural
output. Dairy production is the largest part
of the sector, followed by cattle and calves,
and then fat sheep and lambs. Most dairy
cattle in Britain are bred by artificial
insemination. In 1994 the average size of
dairy herds was 67 (excluding minor
holdings), while the average yield of milk for
each dairy cow was 5,372 litres (1,182
gallons). Average household consumption of
liquid (including low-fat) milk per head in
1994 was 1.95 litres (3.4 pints) a week.

277
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
production originates from the national dairy
herd, in which the Holstein Friesian breed is
predominant. The remainder is derived from
suckler herds producing high-quality beef
calves, mostly in the hills and uplands. The
traditional British beef breeds, such as
Hereford and Aberdeen Angus, and
increasingly imported breeds, such as
Charolais, Limousin, Simmental and Belgian
Blue, are used for beef production. In 1994
the size of the beef-breeding herd continued
to expand. The dairy herd decreased slightly.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep
production, with more than 60 native breeds
and many cross-bred varieties. Sheepmeat
production is the main source of income
for sheep farmers, and wool provides
additional return.
Grass (including silage) covers most
British agricultural land and supplies 60-80
per cent of the feed for cattle and sheep.
Grass production has been enhanced by the
increased use of fertilisers, methods of grazing
control, and improved herbage conservation
for winter feed. Certain sheep and cattle feed
extensively on rough grazings, producing
young animals for fattening elsewhere.
A harmonised identification system
throughout the EU enables animals to be traced
to their farm of origin, for disease control
purposes and for checking payments made
under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
Pigs
Pig production occurs in most areas but is
particularly important in East Anglia and
Yorkshire. There is an increasing
concentration into larger breeding units—
about 20 per cent of holdings with
breeding sows account for 80 per cent of
the national breeding herd.
Poultry
High husbandry standards and the use of
improved genetic stock have helped to
increase efficiency in poultry meat
production. Larger companies have bought up
smaller concerns and a more efficient industry
has resulted. The increase in demand is partly
satisfied by imports. Poultry production in
1994 was 1.08 million tonnes—a small
increase on 1993—dominated by broilers.
Broiler production, at 830,000 tonnes, was
4,000 tonnes below the level for 1993.
Broilers from the 8 per cent of holdings with
over 100,000 table birds account for well over
a half of the total flock. Production of hen
eggs went up from 803 million dozen in 1993
to 811 million dozen in 1994. Britain remains
broadly self-sufficient in poultry meat and
eggs (see p. 277).
Animal Welfare
The welfare of farm animals is protected by
legislation and it is an offence to cause
unnecessary pain or distress to livestock on
agricultural land. More detailed requirements
are laid down in regulations and welfare
codes. There are further controls to safeguard
the welfare of animals in markets, during
transport and at slaughter. The Farm Animal
Welfare Council, an independent body set up
by the Government, advises on legislative or
other changes relating to farm animal welfare.
EC rules on the protection of animals at
slaughter, adopted in 1993, came into force
in 1995. These rules require all member
states to apply the high standards which
already exist under British legislation.
From late 1994 the trade in live animals
was disrupted by the refusal of the major
passenger ferry companies to carry live
animals, accompanied by public protest
against the trade, particularly at the south
coast ports. Negotiations on Community-wide
rules governing the transport of live animals
had been continuous since earlier that year,
and in June 1995 agreement was finally
reached between the EU member states. The
new rules agreed are a significant step
forward in that they introduce, for the first
time, maximum limits on journeys for
livestock being transported in the EU. They
also incorporate feeding and watering
intervals which have to be observed on the
way, and tough new measures for enforcing
the rules right across the Community. During
1995 the Government took action to:
• bring forward from 1997 the review
of production systems for calves across
the EU;
278
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
• urge an EU ban on the veal crate system,
already illegal in Britain, when the review
is in progress;
• bring into immediate effect a revised
order for the welfare of animals during
transport in Great Britain, which enables
prosecution of an exporter who has not
complied with the required journey plan
without good reason—with penalties of
up to £ 1,000 an animal in the event of
conviction in court; and
• take further steps to promote production of
beef and veal by humane methods.
Crops
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops
are found mainly in eastern and central-
southern England and eastern Scotland. The
main crops are shown in Table 18.4. In
Britain in 1994 cereals were again grown on
about 3 million hectares (7.5 million acres),
an area 13 per cent down on 1992 as a direct
result of the introduction of compulsory set-
aside. Production of wheat and oats was up
on 1993, but that of barley was down.
About 30 per cent of barley production is
normally used for brewing, malting and
distilling (there were plentiful supplies of
good-quality malting barley from the 1994
harvest), and virtually all the remainder for
animal feed.
Large-scale potato and vegetable
cultivation can be found on the fertile soils
throughout Britain, often with irrigation.
Principal areas are the peat and silt fens of
Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk;
the sandy loams of Norfolk, Suffolk, West
Midlands, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire
and Lincolnshire; the peat soils of South
Lancashire; and the alluvial silts of parts of
the Thames and Humber valleys. Early

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
potatoes are produced in Shropshire,
Pembrokeshire, Cornwall, Devon, Essex,
Kent and Cheshire. Production of high-grade
seed potatoes is confined to Scotland,
Northern Ireland and the Welsh borders.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet
provides just over 60 per cent of home needs,
most of the remainder being refined from
raw cane sugar imported under the Lome
Convention (see p. 174).
Horticulture
In 1994 the land utilised for horticulture
(excluding potatoes, peas for harvesting dry and
mushrooms) was about 189,000 hectares
(467,000 acres). Vegetables grown in the open
accounted for 67 per cent of this, orchards for
17 per cent, and soft fruit and ornamentals
(including hardy nursery stock, bulbs and
flowers grown in the open) for 7 per cent each.
More than one vegetable crop is, in some
cases, taken from the same area of land in a
year, so that the estimated area actually cropped
in 1994 was 240,400 hectares (593,000 acres).
Mushrooms and lettuces are the single
most valuable horticultural crops, with farm
gate values of £179 million and £105 million
respectively in 1994. Apples are also a
significant crop. Output of dessert and
cooking apples reached 324,000 tonnes,
compared with 30,000 tonnes for pears.
Field vegetables account for 55 per cent of
the value of horticultural output and are
widely grown throughout the country. Most
horticultural enterprises are increasing
productivity with the help of improved
planting material, new techniques and the
widespread use of machinery. Some field
vegetables, for example, are raised in blocks
of compressed peat or loose-filled cells, a
technique which reduces root damage and
allows plants to establish themselves more
reliably and evenly.
Glasshouses are used for growing
tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet peppers,
lettuces, flowers, pot plants and nursery
stock. Widespread use is made of automatic
control of heating and ventilation, and
semi-automatic control of watering. Low-cost
plastic tunnels extend the season for certain
crops previously grown in the open.
Alternative Crops
The Government is contributing £1.3 million
in 1995-96 towards research into oils for
industry uses, fibres and energy crops.
Oilseeds, for instance, can be used in
lubricants, paints, varnishes and
pharmaceuticals; flax, hemp and straw in
paper, textiles and brake linings. Set-aside
(see p. 284) can provide an opportunity to
grow crops for non-food uses.
Organic Farming
The Government launched a voluntary
Organic Aid Scheme in England in 1994,
with a budget of about £1.5 million in
1995-96 it offers payments to farmers over a
five-year period to help with the costs of
converting land to organic production.
Parallel schemes, worth about £500,000 a
year, run in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. Other government help for the
organic sector covers the development of
regulatory standards and a research
programme (worth about £1 million a year).
The organic production and processing
standards are implemented by the United
Kingdom Register of Organic Food
Standards, which has a board of independent
experts appointed by ministers.
FOOD SAFETY
EU food law harmonisation covers food
safety, fair trading and informative
labelling. The Government’s system for
identifying food safety risks involves food
surveys, investigations and research. Results
of government action are always published.
Food law enforcement falls mainly to
local authorities.
In particular, MAFF has programmes to
promote food safety and against diseases
affecting food supply. Its expenditure on food
safety research in 1994—95 was about £10
million. The link between diet, nutrition and
health is one of the main subjects studied.
Among the groups assisting MAFF on
food safety, the Steering Group on Chemical
Aspects of Food Surveillance monitors
through surveillance the need for action to
280
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
ensure the chemical safety, nutritional adequacy
and authenticity of food. The Advisory
Committee on the Microbiological Safety of
Food provides agriculture and health
ministers with independent advice on the risk
to humans from foodborne micro-organisms.
EXPORTS
Provisional data for 1994 suggest that the
value of exports related to agriculture (food,
feed and drink), at some £9,000 million, was
about 11 per cent greater than 1993. The
main markets are Western Europe, North
America and the Middle East.
Exports include speciality products
such as fresh salmon, whisky (exports
to the EU alone were worth £816
million, worldwide £2,185 million),
biscuits, jams and conserves, and tea,
as well as beef and lamb carcasses,
and cheese.
Export promotion for food and drink is
headed by Food From Britain, an organisation
funded by MAFF (£5.25 million in 1994-95)
and industry. For agricultural products and
machinery, and food processing equipment,
MAFF co-ordinates export promotion and
organises trade fairs and ministerial visits to
special markets in other countries.
One of the world’s largest agricultural
events, the annual Royal Agricultural Show,
held at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, enables
visitors to see the latest techniques and
improvements in British agriculture. Some
180,000 visitors attended in 1995, of whom
24,000 were from overseas. Other major
agricultural displays include the Royal
Smithfield Show, held every other year in
London, which exhibits agricultural
machinery, livestock and carcasses; the Royal
Highland Show; the Royal Welsh Show; and
the Royal Ulster Agricultural Show.
MARKETING
The Marketing Development Scheme,
introduced in 1994, makes available about
£10 million to Britain’s agriculture and food
industries over three years. The scheme,
which is directed at non-capital expenditure,
aims to help industry develop the
management skills necessary to improve its
marketing performance. By June 1995 some
140 projects had been awarded funding,
representing grant of over £5.5 million.
Agricultural goods are sold by individuals,
private traders, and producers’ co-operatives
and special boards. The four statutory milk
marketing schemes in Great Britain came to
an end in November 1994 and the scheme in
Northern Ireland came to an end in March
1995. Producers are now free to sell their
milk to whomever they wish. Dairy
companies are now free to buy direct from
producers. The Milk Marketing Boards
(MMBs) no longer buy and sell milk, but
exist in residuary form in order to deal
with outstanding liabilities and dispose of
retained assets.
Milk Marque, the England and Wales
MMB’s successor co-operative, has
responsibility for certain of the milk
marketing assets of the MMB. Scottish Milk,
Aberdeen Milk Co. and the North of
Scotland Milk Co-operative Society are the
successor co-operatives in Scotland. United
Dairy Farmers is the Northern Ireland
MMB’s successor co-operative.
The Government also participates in
the EU’s Processing and Marketing
Grant. This scheme is directed at
capital expenditure on the processing
and marketing of primary
agricultural products; the first two
groups of awards, announced in
February and June 1995, involved a
commitment of over £16 million.
A Milk Development Council has been
established to continue some of the activities
which were carried out by the MMBs in
Great Britain, such as on-farm research and
development, genetic evaluation and livestock
improvement work, human nutritional
guidance, industry statistics and the provision
of market information. The Potato Marketing
Scheme in Great Britain will come to an end
after the 1996—97 crop season. Arrangements
for wool continue to be administered by the
British Wool Marketing Board.
281
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Much agricultural and horticultural
produce, such as grain, fruit and vegetables,
is handled by marketing co-operatives and
other farmers’ businesses; these had a
turnover of some £3,720 million in 1994.
ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
Four government departments have joint
responsibility for agriculture and fisheries
matters—MAFF; The Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department; the
Welsh Office; and the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland.
Common Agricultural Policy
The original aims of the CAP were to
increase agricultural production through the
promotion of technical progress, rational
development and efficiency, thus providing a
fair standard of living for producers, to
stabilise markets and to ensure the availability
of supplies to consumers at reasonable prices.
For many commodities support prices are set
annually; there are also levies on imports to
maintain internal market prices. Surpluses are
bought by intervention boards (the
Intervention Board executive agency in
Britain) to be stored and sold when
appropriate. Intervention stocks can be
disposed of within the EU where this can be
done without disrupting internal markets.
Intervention stocks have decreased
significantly over the last three years, partly
as a result of the 1992 reforms (see p. 283).
Exports, from the market and intervention
stocks, are facilitated by the provision of
export refunds to bridge any gap between EU
prices and world prices. In some cases there
are also direct payments to producers—for
example, the Arable Area Payments Scheme
(see p. 285), the Suckler Cow Premium, the
Beef Special Premium and the Sheep Annual
Premium (see p. 283). The support prices, as
well as rates of levy, export refunds and other
aids, are set in European Currency Units and
are converted into the currencies of the
member states at fixed rates of exchange—so-
called ‘green rates’. These green rates are
kept broadly in line with market rates in
accordance with agreed rules.
Nearly all the EU’s agricultural
expenditure (£25,400 million in 1994) is
channelled through the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee fund. The Fund s
guarantee section finances market support
arrangements, including direct payments
made under the CAP, while the guidance
section provides funds for structural reform
for example, farm modernisation and
investment—and payments to assist certain
farmers to change to alternative enterprises.
Public Expenditure under the CAP
by the Intervention Board and the
Agricultural Departments
FORECAST 1994/95
The Government believes that the CAP
should be further reformed so as to achieve
progressive reductions in product-linked
support and protection. 4 his, it is hoped,
would lead to the eventual removal of
artificial restrictions on production and the
creation of a competitive and market-onentec
farming industry. Any remaining support
could then be better aimed at environmental
and other specific objectives. j
Pressures arising from the prospect of EL
enlargement to the East would be a factor in
such change, requiring other member states
to focus on the need for further reform—
because extending the present CAP to
282
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
Central and Eastern Europe would lead to an
unacceptable increase in its cost and would
1 prevent the EU from meeting its General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT—
see p. 173) commitments.
Reforms
Those reforms agreed in 1992 have been
implemented for arable crops (see p. 285),
beef and sheep. Commitment to
environmental protection, which Britain
secured as part of the CAP, has been
followed in a number of areas.
Beef. In 1994—95 the beef market was affected
by new trade rules on bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE—see p. 286), and ferry
company restrictions on live calf exports. The
Government makes payments to beef farmers
through the EU beef premium schemes.
lls Under the Beef Special Premium, a payment
(of up to £86 in 1995) is made not more than
3a twice in the life of male beef animals. The
cost of 1995 payments is estimated at £228
million. The Suckler Cow Premium Scheme
na provides a payment, worth £114.43 in 1995,
for cows suckling beef calves, at a total cost
of £235 million. There is also support for
beef prices through EU beef intervention and
export subsidy schemes. Export subsidies are
estimated at some £79 million in 1994—95;
and intervention storage and other costs some
£7 million. Receipts from the sale of
intervention beef in 1994-95 are estimated at
about £95 million. The Government
minimises the use of intervention. By July
1995, British beef intervention stocks were
less than 10,000 tonnes.
Sheepmeat. The Sheep Annual Premium
Scheme comprises a headage payment on
eligible ewes paid to producers—£16.96 a
ewe in 1994. A supplement of £5.24 a ewe
was paid in Less Favoured Areas (LFAs).
il Claims for ewe premium are subject to
individual producer quotas on the number of
animals eligible. Total sheep premium quota
for Britain is some 19.6 million.
. Environment. Member states are obliged to
i reduce pollution and nuisance from
agriculture and to protect agriculture from
the effects of pollution.
The CAP reform measures adopted in
1992 meant significant changes in the
support arrangements for the main arable
and livestock schemes. The Integrated
Administration and Control System,
introduced in 1993 and fully operational by
January 1996, aims to improve control of
CAP expenditure and to reduce the scope for
fraud. It requires farmers to submit an
annual application with details of all land
farmed on a field-by-field basis. The details
are held on a computerised database, from
which a co-ordinated series of administrative
checks on subsidy claims and farm
inspections can be made. Late or inaccurate
applications are subject to stringent and
automatic penalties.
GATT Uruguay Round
The Final Act of the GATT Uruguay Round
of multilateral trade negotiations was signed
in April 1994 (see p. 173). One of the aims of
the Uruguay Round agreements is to
introduce, for the first time, disciplines on
the use of agricultural subsidies. The
agricultural commitments made by the EU
and other major exporters include cuts in the
volume of subsidised exports, in expenditure
on export subsidies, in domestic support and
in tariffs and tariff equivalents. The
Government expects the reformed CAP to
meet the new GATT requirements without
substantial further change.
Price Guarantees, Grants and Subsidies
Expenditure in Britain in 1994—95 on CAP
market regulation and on price guarantees,
grants and subsidies was estimated at £268
million and £2,436 million respectively.
Farmers are eligible for grants aimed at
environmental enhancement of their farms.
In LFAs, where land quality is poor,
farmers benefit from enhanced rates of grant
and special payments on livestock (hill
livestock compensatory allowances—HLCAs).
There are headage payments on breeding
cattle and sheep, and their purpose is to
support the continuation of livestock farming
in hills and uplands, thus conserving the
countryside and maintaining a viable
population in the LFAs.
-
283
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Producers in the LFA (United Kingdom)2
are estimated to receive direct livestock subsidy
payments of over £600 million in 1995, of
which over £100 million comes from HLCAs.
Smallholdings and Crofts
In England and Wales county councils let
smallholdings to experienced people who
want to farm on their own account. Councils
may lend working capital to them. At 31
March 1994 there were 33,362 smallholdings
in England and 6,125 in Wales. Land
settlement in Scotland has been carried out
by the Government, which, while now
seeking to dispose of holdings to its sitting
tenants, still owns and maintains 109,000
hectares (269,230 acres) of land settlement
estates, comprising 1,416 crofts and holdings.
In the crofting areas of Scotland—the
former counties of Argyll, Inverness, Ross
and Cromarty, Sutherland, Caithness, Orkney
and Shetland—much of the land is tenanted
by crofters (smallholders). They enjoy the
statutory protection provided by crofting
legislation and can benefit from government
schemes which exist to support and help
crofting communities, such as agriculture and
livestock improvement schemes. Most crofters
are part-time or spare-time agriculturalists,
using croft income to supplement income
from activities such as weaving, fishing,
tourism and other occupations. The Crofters
Commission has a statutory duty to promote
the interests of crofters and to keep all
crofting matters under review.
Agricultural Landlords and Tenants
About one-third of agricultural land in
England and Wales is rented. To encourage
landowners to offer more land for rent and to
increase the number of opportunities for new
entrants to become established, the
Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 has been
introduced. It gives landlords and tenants in
England and Wales greater freedom to decide
the terms of new tenancy agreements which
are taken up from September 1995. Full relief
designation of LFA status is decided by the EU. The case for
LFAs in Britain was submitted to the EU as covering all of
Britain.
from inheritance tax on new tenancies from
that date will also encourage landowners to
offer tenancies.
In Scotland, just under 50 per cent of
farmland is rented, partly because of the
relatively large areas of common grazings
tenanted by crofters.
Most farms in Northern Ireland are
owner-occupied, but, under a practice known
as ‘conacre’, occupiers not wishing to farm all
their land let it annually to others. Land let
under this practice—about one-fifth of
agricultural land—is used mainly for grazing.
Agriculture and Protection of the
Countryside
During 1993 Britain secured EU agreement
that member states should be able to
attach appropriate environmental conditions
to the payment of livestock subsidies.
Further progress was made in improving
the environmental potential of set-aside—
arable land deliberately not used for
agricultural purposes.
Environmentally Sensitive Areas
The ESA scheme (see Table 18.5) encourages
farmers to maintain or adopt environmentally
beneficial agricultural practices in parts of the
country where the landscape, wildlife or
historical features are of national importance.
ESAs are regularly reviewed and information
on their economic and environmental impact
is published. The newest, designated in 1994,
include Dartmoor and the Cotswold Hills in
England, the Argyll Islands and Shetland
Islands of Scotland, and the Sperrins and
Slieve Gullion in Northern Ireland.
Participation in the ESA scheme is
voluntary. Farmers enter into ten-year
agreements with the relevant agriculture
department. An agreement specifies the
agricultural management practices to be
carried out. Each ESA has varying tiers of
such practices, from basic care and
maintenance to more extensive forms of
management and environmental restoration.
Details also vary, but participants may not
convert grassland to arable and are subject to
restrictions on fertiliser and chemical usage.

Most ESAs also restrict or control the
numbers of stock on the land as well as
operations such as the timing of cultivation.
The annual payments (between £8 and £400
a hectare, depending on the needs of each
tier) are designed to compensate for reduced
profitability through the adoption of these
less intensive production methods, and for
the further work some management practices
require. Additional payments are made for
specific items, such as hedgerows and stone
wall renewal, set out in conservation plans, and
for allowing public access to suitable farmland.
Other Schemes
The Farm Woodland Premium Scheme offers
incentives to farmers to plant woodlands on
agricultural land. Trees planted on arable or
improved grassland qualify for annual
payments of up to £250 a hectare for either
ten or 15 years, depending on the type of
woodland created. Between April 1992 and
March 1995, applications to plant nearly
23,500 hectares (58,750 acres) of woodland in
Britain were approved. Three-quarters of this
area will be planted with broadleaved trees.
Under the Arable Area Payments Scheme,
growers can claim area-based payments on
cereals, oilseeds, protein and linseed crops.
For the main scheme, growers must set aside
part of the area on which they claim
payment; for the simplified scheme, no
set-aside is required, but the claim must not
exceed 15.6 hectares (39.7 acres). In 1994
some 47,000 applications were received in
Britain for some 4.3 million hectares
(10.5 million acres).
The Habitat Scheme offers annual
payments, ranging from £125 to £525 a
hectare, to farmers to promote nature
conservation on their farms by taking
carefully selected areas of land out of
production for ten or 20 years and managing
them in environmentally beneficial ways. In
1994 the Government expanded the Nitrate
Sensitive Areas (NSA) Scheme in England by
introducing 22 new NSAs to bring the total to
32. NSAs help protect selected groundwater
sources used to supply drinking water. The
Organic Aid Scheme helps farmers wishing to
convert to organic production.
Two further schemes have been introduced:
• in 1994 the Countryside Access Scheme,
to increase opportunities for public access
on set-aside land; and
• in 1995 the Moorland Scheme, to
protect and improve the upland
moorland environment by encouraging
LFA farmers outside ESAs to graze
fewer sheep where this would improve
the condition of heather and other
moorland vegetation.
Programmes of schemes along broadly
similar lines are being introduced in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By
the time all the schemes are fully operational,
annual expenditure on these new measures in
Britain will exceed £100 million.
Rural Economy
A special programme, agreed with the EU
and administered locally, supports
development of rural areas by helping farmers
to adapt to changing conditions and to make
best use of the resources available to them.
Eleven areas (for example, Lincolnshire,
Gwynedd, and Dumfries and Galloway) in
285
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Great Britain have been designated to receive
funds under Objective 5b of the EC
Structural Funds. Such a designation depends
on an area being rural, having a low GDP
and population density, and being
substantially dependent on agriculture. Costs

support the agriculture sector from the
European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee
Fund are estimated at £56 million, plus £56
million from national public expenditure.
A study published in late 1994 estimated
that farmers in Britain earned about £615
million a year from activities such as bed and
breakfast, riding and game shoots—nearly 4
per cent of what they receive from agricultural
activities. The study indicates that some 10
per cent of farmers earn more than £300
million between them from diversification—
some more than £50,000 a year each.
Rural White Paper
MAFF and the Department of the
Environment are to publish a White Paper on
the future of the rural areas of England.
Other government departments whose policies
impinge on the countryside are also involved.
Its purpose is to examine the many economic,
social and environmental changes taking place
in rural society. A rural development strategy
is in progress in Scotland. A similar five-year
initiative is in progress for Northern Ireland.
Agricultural Training
ATB-Landbase, an independent company,
currently acts as the Industry Training
Organisation (see p. 183) for agriculture and
commercial horticulture. ATB-Landbase
oversees the industry’s training needs and
arranges training through its network of
providers and instructors. It currently
operates under contracts with the
Government, which allots the funding.
Training and Enterprise Councils and Local
Enterprise Companies (see p. 183), as well as
the expanding network of Business Links
(see p. 208), help develop business skills.
ATB-Landbase also arranges training in
wider rural skills, business management and
the management of shows and similar events.
The agricultural colleges and independent
instructors also help to provide training in
the agricultural and horticultural businesses.
Professional, Scientific and
Technical Services
In England and Wales ADAS (Food, Farms,
Land and Leisure), an executive agency of
MAFF and the Welsh Office, provides
professional, scientific and technical services
for agriculture and its ancillary industries.
Most types of advice and servicing are on a
fee-paying basis, although initial advice to
farmers on conservation, use of land for
woodlands and animal welfare is available
free. The Government also contributes
towards the funding of the Farming and
Wildlife Advisory Group to provide free
initial conservation advice. Similar services in
Scotland come from The Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department
through the Scottish Agricultural College. In
Northern Ireland they are available from the
Department of Agriculture’s agriculture and
science services.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND PESTS
Farm Animals
Britain maintains its high animal health status
by enforcement of controls on imports of live
animals and genetic material, including
frequent checks on imported consignments at
destination points. There are safeguards to
prevent the importation of diseased animals
and genetic material from regions or
countries affected by disease. Veterinary
checks include 24-hour periods of import and
export surveillance at all south and east coast
ports, as well as checks on all individual
consignments originating from outside the EU.
The number of consignments failing to meet
animal health requirements in 1994 was low.
The number of new cases of the cattle
disease BSE continues to decline as predicted
as a result of measures in place to control the
disease. EC rules continue to apply to trade
in beef with Britain. In July 1995, these rules
were amended slightly. Meat may now be
exported without any further restriction from
286
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
any animals aged less than 30 months at
slaughter. (The previous requirement was
that they should be born after 1 January
1992.) Any other beef on the bone must be
I certified as coming from animals who have
resided only on holdings which have been
free of BSE for the past six years.
Professional advice and action on the
I statutory control of animal disease and
the welfare of farm livestock are the
responsibility of the State Veterinary Service.
It is supported by the laboratories of the
Veterinary Investigation Service in England
and Wales, which charge for their diagnostic
service to private veterinary practitioners and
have an important role in animal disease
surveillance. A similar service is provided in
Scotland by the Scottish Agricultural College.
Rabies
Special measures apply to prevent rabies
entering Britain. Dogs, cats and certain other
mammals are subject to import licence and
six months’ quarantine. From July 1994
commercially traded dogs and cats from other
EU states which satisfy strict conditions have
been allowed entry without quarantine. There
are severe penalties for breaking the law. No
cases of rabies outside quarantine have
occurred in Britain since 1970.
Fish
The fisheries departments operate statutory
controls to prevent the introduction and
spread of serious diseases of fish and
shellfish. These controls include the licensing
of live fish imports, the licensing of deposits
of shellfish on the seabed, and movement
restrictions on sites where outbreaks of
notifiable diseases have been confirmed.
Plants
The agriculture departments are responsible
for limiting the spread of plant pests and
diseases and for preventing the introduction of
new ones. They issue the health certificates
required by other countries to accompany
| plant material exported from Britain, and
authorise growers who wish to sell on the
EU’s single internal market. Certification
schemes encourage the development of
healthy and true-to-type planting stocks.
Pesticides
All pesticides must be approved for their
safety and efficacy. There are strict controls
on the supply, storage and use of pesticides,
and their maximum residue levels in food.
Controls on pesticides are the joint
responsibility of six government departments
on the basis of advice from the independent
Advisory Committee on Pesticides. Progress
has been made in establishing an effective
European system.
Veterinary Medicinal Products
The authorisation and manufacture of
veterinary medicinal products are controlled
by legislation. Licences are issued by the
Veterinary Medicines Directorate on behalf of
the agriculture and health ministers for
products that have been approved on the basis
of safety, quality and efficacy. Independent
expert advice on these criteria and on
suspected adverse reactions is provided by the
Veterinary Products Committee. Approval of
veterinary medicines was harmonised under
an EU-wide system from January 1995.
The Fishing Industry
The fishing industry provides 59 per cent by
quantity of British fish supplies, and is an
important source of employment and income
in a number of ports. Cod, haddock, whiting,
herring, plaice and sole are caught in the
North Sea off the east coasts of Scotland and
England; mackerel, together with cod and
other demersal fish (those caught on or near
the bottom of the sea), are found off the west
coast of Scotland; sole, plaice, cod, herring
and whiting in the Irish Sea; and mackerel,
sole and plaice off the south-west coast of
England. Nephrops, crabs, lobsters and other
shellfish are taken from the inshore waters all
around the coast. A fleet also operates in
distant waters—around Greenland and north
Norway, for example.
287
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Fish Caught
In 1994 demersal fish accounted for 43 per
cent by weight of total landings by British
fishing vessels, pelagic fish (those caught near
the surface) for 44 per cent and shellfish for
13 per cent. Landings of all types of fish
(excluding salmon and trout) by British
fishing vessels totalled 874,900 tonnes
compared with 857,600 tonnes in 1993. Cod
and haddock represented 16 and 15 per cent
respectively of the total value of demersal and
pelagic fish landed, while anglerfish (10 per
cent), plaice and mackerel (each with 9 per
cent), and hake and whiting (each with 5 per
cent) were the other most important sources
of earnings to the industry. The quayside
value of landings of all sea fish, including
shellfish, by British vessels in 1994 was
£561 million.
The Fishing Fleet
At the end of 1994 the British fleet consisted
of 10,295 registered vessels, including 450
deep-sea vessels longer than 24.4 m (80 ft).
Under an EU commitment to reduce fishing,
Britain operates a decommissioning scheme to
bring the fleet size into line with fishing
opportunities. In 1993-94 135 vessels were
scrapped at a cost of £7.8 million; in 1994—95
162 vessels went, at a cost of £8.9 million.
Total government financial commitment to
decommissioning in the period 1993-98 is
some £53 million.
Among the main ports from which the
fishing fleet operates are Aberdeen,
Peterhead, Fraserburgh (Grampian), Lerwick
(Shetland), Kinlochbervie, Ullapool
(Highland), North Shields (Tyne and Wear),
Hull, Grimsby (Humberside), Lowestoft
(Suffolk), Brixham (Devon), Newlyn
(Cornwall), and Kilkeel, Ardglass and
Portavogie (Northern Ireland).
In its effort to conserve fish stocks, the
Government takes account of biological and
environmental considerations and of marine
ecology. Its primary purpose is to create a
safe, efficient industry, its capacity tuned to
what stocks will bear.
Fish Farming
Fish farming is centred on Atlantic salmon
and rainbow trout, which are particularly
suited to Britain’s climate and waters.
Production of salmon and trout has grown
from less than 1,000 tonnes in the early
1970s to 64,066 tonnes of salmon (all in
Scotland) and 15,088 tonnes of trout in
1994. Scotland produces the largest amount
of farmed salmon (with a first-sale value in
excess of £200 million) in the EU. Shellfish
farming concentrates on molluscs such as
oysters, mussels, clams and scallops,
producing an estimated 4,160 tonnes a year.
The fish and shellfish farming industries
make an important contribution to the rural
economy, especially in remote areas such as
the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. In

AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
1994 the industries were estimated to have a
combined wholesale turnover of some
£246.5 million. Production is based on 974
businesses operating from 1,638 sites and
employing more than 3,000 people.
Administration
The fisheries departments are responsible for
the administration of legislation concerning
the fishing industry, including fish and
shellfish farming, and for fisheries research.
The safety and welfare of crews of fishing
vessels and other shipping matters are
provided for under legislation administered
by the Department of Transport.
The Sea Fish Industry Authority is
concerned with all aspects of the sea fish
industry, including consumer interests. It
undertakes research and development,
provides training, and encourages quality
awareness. It also acts as an agent to pay
government grants (£2.5 million in 1994-95)
towards the cost of work necessary to
obtain a Department of Transport vessel
safety certificate.
Fishery Limits
British fishery limits extend to 200 miles or
the median line (broadly halfway between the
British coast and the opposing coastline of
another coastal state), measured from
baselines on or near the coast of Britain. Only
British vessels may fish within six miles of
the coast. Certain other EU member states
have fishing rights between six and 12 miles
in certain areas and for named species, as
British vessels have in other member states’
coastal waters. Outside 12 miles EU vessels
may fish against agreed EU quotas in named
areas. The only non-EU countries whose
vessels may fish in EU waters are those with
which the EU has reciprocal fisheries
agreements (Norway and the Faroes) which
define areas and quantities (by species) of
permitted catch.
Common Fisheries Policy
Britain plays an active role in the
implementation and development of the EU’s
Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The
CFP’s system for the conservation and
management of the EU’s fishing resources
means that total allowable catches are set
each year in order to conserve stocks.
Decisions are based on independent scientific
advice. These catch levels are then allocated
between member states on a fixed percentage
basis, taking account of traditional fishing
patterns. Activity is also regulated by a
number of technical conservation measures,
including minimum mesh sizes for towed
nets and net configuration restrictions,
minimum landing sizes and closed areas
designed mainly to protect young fish. All
commercial fishing vessels in Britain have to
be licensed. However, implementation of
restrictions on days at sea has been
suspended pending a ruling from the
European Court of Justice. Each member
state is responsible for enforcement of the
rules on its own fishermen and those of other
member states in its own waters. Compliance
is monitored by EU inspectors.
North Atlantic Fisheries
Outline agreement has been reached on the
arrangements to integrate Spain and Portugal
fully into the CFP from 1 January 1996.
Spanish access will be limited to 40 vessels at
one time in the Irish Box—the area
immediately north, west and south of Ireland;
Spanish boats will be excluded from the Irish
Sea and the Bristol Channel; and
arrangements will be introduced to ensure
that fishing in western waters does not increase.
An agreement reached in 1995 between
the EU and Canada over fisheries in the
north-west Atlantic has four main features:
• neutral observers on board all vessels
fishing in the area, to monitor
compliance with all internationally
agreed conservation measures;
• new conservation measures for
Greenland halibut;
• an agreed share-out of the total allowable
catch of 27,000 tonnes of Greenland
halibut between Canada and the EU; and
• Canada to repeal legislation authorising
the seizure of Spanish and Portuguese
boats in international waters.
289
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Fisheries Agreements
The CFP also covers the common
organisation of the market in fishery and
aquaculture products and policies on the size
and structure of the EU fleet.
CFP provisions are supplemented by a
number of fisheries agreements between the
EU and third countries, the most important
for Britain being the agreements with
Norway, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
EU catch quotas have also been established
around Spitzbergen (Svalbard).
Fish and Shellfish Hygiene
Community legislation sets minimum hygiene
standards for the production and marketing of
fish and shellfish. Live bivalve molluscs
(oysters, mussels and cockles) can be
marketed only if they come from areas
classified by the Government according to
strict microbiological standards.
Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries
Salmon and sea-trout are fished commercially
in inshore waters around the British coast.
Eels and elvers are also taken commercially in
both estuaries and fresh water. Angling for
salmon and sea-trout (game fishing) and for
other freshwater species (coarse fishing) is
popular throughout Britain. There is no
public right to fish in freshwater lakes and
rivers in Great Britain. In England and Wales
those wishing to fish such waters must first
obtain permission from the owner of the
fishing rights and a licence from the National
Rivers Authority. In Scotland salmon fishing
is administered by district salmon fishery
boards. In Northern Ireland fishing is
licensed by the Fisheries Conservancy Board
for Northern Ireland and the Foyle Fisheries
Commission in their respective areas, and 65
public angling waters, including salmon, trout
and coarse fisheries, are accessible to
Department of Agriculture permit holders.
Research
Departmental funding of research and
development in agriculture, fisheries and food
in 1995-96 amounts to about £184 million.
This includes funding by MAFF, the
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries
Department, and the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland. The
Government funds research:
• to support the improvement of the
economic performance of the agriculture,
fishing and food industries;
• to protect the public by ensuring food
safety, controlling animal diseases with
implications for human health, and
providing flood protection;
• to enhance the rural and marine
environment; and
• to promote animal welfare.
It looks to industry to fund those areas of
research where individual firms or ventures
gain direct benefit. Research is carried out in
government research establishments, research
institutes, specialist laboratories and universities.
Agriculture and Food
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC; see p. 323) is
responsible for research in biological sciences
that underpin food and agriculture. The
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC; see p. 323) is responsible for
research on the environment, including
agricultural aspects. These research councils
receive funds from the science budget
through the Office of Science and
Technology, and income from work
commissioned by MAFF, by industry and by
other bodies. They carry out research at their
institutes and in higher education institutions
through their grant schemes.
ADAS carries out research and
development under commission from MAFF
and under contract for other bodies. Work is
carried out at research farms across England
and Wales, through regional centres and on
clients’ premises.
MAFF also commissions research at its
other agencies—the Central Veterinary
Laboratory and the Central Science
Laboratory—and increasingly through open
competition. The five Scottish Agricultural
and Biological Research Institutes, funded by
290

by the Scottish Agricultural College, which
operates from three centres. In Northern

Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 2.4 million
hectares (5.9 million acres) in Britain: about 7
f per cent of England, 15 per cent of Scotland,
12 per cent of Wales and 5 per cent of
I Northern Ireland. This is about 10 per cent
of the total land area and well below the 25
per cent average for the whole of Europe.
Britain’s forestry programme protects
| forest resources and conserves woodland as
a home for wildlife and for public
recreation. It also promotes the market for
home-grown timber.
The area of productive forest in Great
Britain is 2.17 million hectares (5.36 million
acres), 38 per cent of which is managed by
the Forestry Commission. The rate of new
planting in 1994—95 was 8,765 hectares
(21,649 acres) by the Commission and 18,128
hectares (44,776 acres) by other woodland
owners, with the help of grants from the
Commission, mainly in Scotland. In 1994-95,
9,986 hectares (24,665 acres) of broadleaved
trees were planted, a practice encouraged on
suitable sites. Much new planting is by
private owners.
The forest area has doubled since
1919. Since the mid-1980s nearly
220,000 hectares (545,000 acres) of new
woodland have been created. Forestry
employs more than 40,000 people.
Britain’s woodlands produce about
7 million cubic metres (250 million
cubic feet) of wood a year—about
15 per cent of total consumption. The
Government is spending £242 million
to support the management of state
and private forests and their
expansion in the three years 1994-95
to 1996-97.
The volume of timber harvested on
Commission lands in 1994-95 totalled 4.3
million cubic metres (150 million cubic feet).
The Commission’s Woodland Grant
Scheme pays grants to help create new
woodlands and forests and regenerate existing
ones. Approval was given for 24,263 hectares
(59,930 acres) of new planting in 1994—95,
including 5,633 hectares (13,914 acres) of new
natural regeneration. Annual management
grant is available under the scheme as a
contribution towards the cost of management
operations needed to safeguard or enhance
the special environmental value of a
woodland, improve woods which are below
environmental standards or create, maintain
or enhance public access.
The Forestry Commission and
Forestry Policy
The Forestry Commission, established in 1919,
is the government department responsible for
forestry in Great Britain. The Commissioners
advise on forestry matters and are responsible
to the Secretary of State for Scotland, the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
and the Secretary of State for Wales.
291
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Within the Commission, the Forestry
Authority controls tree felling, provides
grants and advice to private woodland
owners, and sets standards for the forestry
industry as a whole. Forest Enterprise, an
executive agency of the Commission, develops
and manages the Commission’s forests and
forestry estate, supplying timber and
opportunities for recreation, and enhancing
nature conservation and the forest
environment. The Policy and Resources
Group sees to parliamentary business,
policy development, and European and
international liaison.
The Commission has sold 115,313
hectares (284,823 acres) of forest land since
1981 and, at the Government’s request, has
to dispose of 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres)
during the 1990s. The Commission is
financed partly by the Government and partly
by receipts from sales of timber and other
produce, and from rents.
Forestry Initiatives
Plans for 12 Community Forests3 in
England—for example, Thames Chase (east
of London), Mercia (Staffordshire), Great
North (Tyne and Wear), Mersey (close to
Liverpool) and Bristol/Avon—have been
approved. A new national forest in the
English Midlands (500 sq km; 200 sq miles)
is being established. In Wales, the Valleys
Forest Initiative encourages local communities
to participate in the development of 350

valleys of south Wales—about 20 per cent of
the land area—which is owned by the
Forestry Commission. Community forests are
also being promoted and developed in
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Forestry Research
The Forestry Commission maintains two
principal research stations, at Alice Holt
Lodge, near Farnham (Surrey), and at Bush
Estate, near Edinburgh, for basic and
applied research into all aspects of forestry.
Aid is also given for research work in
universities and other institutions. There is
an increasing number of co-operative research
projects with international partners, and
Commission specialists are undertaking
overseas consultancies. A database on
forestry and tree-related research in Great
Britain has been compiled by the Forestry
Research Co-ordination Committee and is
updated annually.
The Forestry Authority conducts an
annual survey of forest condition to monitor
the effects of climatic environmental stress
factors on broadleaves and conifers.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
The Department of Agriculture may acquire
land for afforestation and give financial and
technical assistance for private planting. The
state forest area has grown steadily since
1945. By 1994, 75,500 hectares (186,500
acres) of plantable land had been acquired, of
which 60,800 hectares (150,000 acres) were
planted. There were 17,000 hectares (42,000
acres) of privately owned forest. Some 470
staff are employed by the forestry service.

Communications
Britain’s transport and communications infrastructure is developing rapidly.
The Channel Tunnel (see p. 302) has linked the rail transport system of Great
ij Britain to that of the European mainland. Britain’s road network is being
• improved, with the emphasis on upgrading existing routes rather than
I building new motorways. Investment at seaports and airports and in air
| traffic control equipment continues to expand capacity and ease the
international movement of people and goods. Britain’s telecommunications

i Transport
There has been a considerable increase in
passenger travel in recent years—in Great
Britain it rose by 29 per cent between 1984
and 1994. Travel by car and van rose by 38
! per cent and air travel was up by roughly
two-thirds. However, travel by motor cycle,
pedal cycle and by bus and coach has been
| declining. In all, car and van travel accounts
for 87 per cent of passenger mileage within
Great Britain, buses and coaches for about 6
per cent, rail for 5 per cent and air 1 per
I cent. The amount of freight moved by road
| increased by 21 per cent between 1984 and
1994. Total motor traffic for 1994 is
estimated at 421,900 million vehicle-km.
Car ownership has also risen substantially.
In all, 68 per cent of households in Great
Britain had the regular use of one or more
cars in 1993; 23 per cent had the use of two
| or more cars. At the end of 1994 there were
25.2 million vehicles licensed for use on the
roads of Great Britain, of which 21.2 million
were cars (including 2.2 million company
cars); 2.0 million light goods vehicles;
580,000 other goods vehicles; 720,000 motor
cycles, scooters and mopeds; and 150,000
buses and coaches.
Research on transport issues is undertaken
by a number of public sector bodies and by
industry, especially the motor, aviation,
marine and oil industries. Research is also
commissioned by the Department of
Transport, the Civil Aviation Authority
(CAA—see p. 308), British Rail (BR—see p.
300) and London Transport (LT—see p.
298). In addition to the Transport Research
Laboratory, which was due to be privatised in
1995, the Department of Transport uses a
wide range of contractors, including
consulting engineers, universities, and
institutes and laboratories of the research
councils (see pp. 321-5).

ROADS
The total road network in Britain in 1994
was 389,200 km (243,200 miles). Trunk
motorways accounted for 3,200 km
(2,000 miles) of this, less than 1 per cent,
and other trunk roads for 14,400 km
(9,000 miles), or 3.7 per cent. However,
motorways carry 16 per cent of all traffic
and trunk roads another 16 per cent.
Combined, they carry over half of all goods
vehicle traffic in Great Britain.
A Road User’s Charter was published in
April 1994, setting out the standards
expected of the Highways Agency (see
below) on motorways and trunk roads.
These cover matters such as safety and
security on the road network, maintenance
and improvement of the network, and
answering queries and complaints.
Management
Responsibility for trunk roads, including most
motorways, rests in England with the
Secretary of State for Transport, in Scotland
with the Secretary of State for Scotland and
in Wales with the Secretary of State for
Wales. Central government meets the
majority of the costs of construction and
maintenance. The Highways Agency, an
executive agency of the Department of
Transport, is responsible for building,
improving and maintaining motorways and
trunk roads in England. Its total budget is
£1,864 million in 1995-96. In Northern
Ireland the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland is responsible for the
construction, improvement and maintenance
of all public roads.
The main highway authorities for non¬
trunk roads in England are at present the
county councils, the metropolitan district
councils and the London borough councils.
In Wales, the highway authorities are the
county councils until April 1996, when the
new unitary authorities (see p. 72) take over.
Likewise in Scotland, the new unitary
councils will take over these responsibilities
from the regional councils in April 1996.
The islands councils will retain their
highway responsibilities.
Road Programme
In a 1994 review of the motorway and trunk
road programme in England, schemes in the
programme were assessed for priority. The
most important projects are to be
implemented more quickly. By contrast, 49
schemes that were no longer environmentally
acceptable or not needed in the foreseeable
future were withdrawn, and preparation work
was suspended on 67 others. In particular,
the number of proposals for building new
publicly-funded trunk routes was sharply
reduced. Increased emphasis is being placed
on smaller schemes to reduce accident and
congestion blackspots, with a 40 per cent rise
in funding being announced in December
1994 for smaller schemes.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
road schemes were under construction in
England and 271 further schemes were in
preparation. Expenditure of £1,090 million on
new trunk road construction is planned for
1995-96, with eight new schemes due to
start. The trunk road maintenance
programme is £500 million. Surveys have
shown that the condition of trunk roads has
improved since the mid-1980s. Support for
local authority road schemes is now approved
on a package basis, with local authorities
being encouraged to submit bids for a
package of measures covering both roads and
public transport. For 1995-96, the
Department of Transport has approved 37
package bids totalling £79 million. A total of
£346 million of government grant is available
to support local authority spending on
transport in England in 1995-96.
Road communications in Wales will benefit
from the second Severn crossing, the recent
completion of the M4 motorway and
improvements to the A55 and A465 roads.
The A55 is now dual carriageway across the
mainland. The Welsh Office’s trunk road and
transport programme for 1995-96 will cost
£187 million. A total of £109 million is also
being made available in 1995-96 for local
authority capital expenditure on transport.
This includes about £80 million for specific
major road improvements.
A scheme for a 10,400-km (6,500-mile)
national cycle network was among
the first proposals to be approved for
funding by the Millennium
Commission. The project, towards
which the Commission is providing
£43 million, will see 4,000 km (2,500
miles) completed by the year 2000.
The Government is providing £3
million in 1995-96 for a cycle network
in London.
The Government has committed
£538 million between 1995-96 and 1997-98
to trunk road construction and improvement
in Scotland. The main priorities within the
trunk road programme are the upgrading to
motorway of the Glasgow to Carlisle route,
some 60 per cent of which was ready by
January 1995, and the completion of the
motorway network in central Scotland. These
routes provide important links for commerce
and industry to the south and to mainland
Europe. The Government’s strategy also
includes a series of ‘route action plans’
designed to make significant improvements to
safety and journey times on specific major
routes. A total of £172 million is being made
available in 1995-96 for local authority
capital expenditure on roads and transport
schemes in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland the emphasis is on
improving arterial routes, constructing
more bypasses, and improving roads in the
Belfast area.
Private Finance
The Government is encouraging
greater private sector involvement in the
design, construction, operation and
funding of roads. Privately funded schemes
completed in recent years, being built or
undergoing planning procedures include:
• a crossing of the River Thames at
Dartford, which opened to traffic in 1991
and links into the M25 London orbital
motorway;
• a bridge between the mainland of
Scotland and Skye, which opened in
October 1995;
• a second crossing of the River Severn,
scheduled for completion in summer
1996; and
• a relief road north of Birmingham,
which would be the first overland toll
route in Britain, and which is the subject
of a public inquiry that opened in
summer 1994.
The Government is assessing the
feasibility of introducing electronic tolls on
the motorway network, which at present
has no tolls. The Government is stimulating
the private sector road operating industry
and harnessing private sector capital through
a number of projects whereby the private
sector will design, build, finance and
operate new roads in return for payments
from the Government principally related to
traffic volumes.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Licensing and Standards
The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
(DVLA) maintains official records of drivers
and vehicles in Great Britain. At the end of
1994 it held records on 35.2 million drivers
and 25.5 million licensed vehicles. New
drivers of motor vehicles must pass a driving
test before getting a full licence to drive.
In May 1995 the Government
announced proposals for introducing a
separate test of driving theory for
learner drivers. The test, which will
have to be passed before taking the
present on-road practical test, will
last about half an hour and consist of
about 35 multiple-choice questions on
matters such as traffic signs, safety
aspects of vehicles and driver
attitude. These arrangements will be
in force from July 1996.
The Driving Standards Agency is the
national driver testing authority in Great
Britain. It also supervises professional
driving instructors and the compulsory basic
training scheme for learner motor cyclists.
Minimum ages are:
• 16 for riders of mopeds, drivers of small
tractors, and disabled people receiving a
mobility allowance;
• 17 for drivers of cars and other
passenger vehicles with nine or fewer
seats (including that of the driver), motor
cycles and goods vehicles not over
3.5 tonnes permissible maximum weight;
• 18 for goods vehicles weighing over 3.5,
but not over 7.5, tonnes; and
• 21 for passenger vehicles with more
than nine seats and goods vehicles over
7.5 tonnes.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles
are allowed on the roads, they must meet
certain safety and environmental
requirements, based primarily on standards
drawn up by the EU. This form of control,
known as type approval, is operated by the
Vehicle Certification Agency.
The Vehicle Inspectorate is responsible for
ensuring the roadworthiness of vehicles. It
does this through the annual testing of
vehicles, including heavy goods vehicles, light
goods vehicles, public service vehicles, cars
and motor cycles. It also ensures the
compliance of drivers and vehicle operators
with legislation through roadside and other
enforcement checks.
In Northern Ireland the Driver and
Vehicle Testing Agency (DVTA) is
responsible for testing drivers and vehicles
under statutory schemes broadly similar to
those in Great Britain. Private cars four or
more years old are tested at DVTA centres.
Road Safety
Although Great Britain has one of the highest
densities of road traffic in the world, it has a
good record on road safety, with the lowest road
accident death rate in the EU. Figures for 1994
show that 3,650 people were killed on the roads
(down 4 per cent on 1993 and the lowest since
records began), 46,500 seriously injured and
265,000 slightly injured. This compares with
nearly 8,000 deaths a year in the mid-1960s.
Several factors, such as developments in vehicle
safety standards, improvements in roads, and the
introduction of legislation on seat-belt wearing
and drinking and driving, have contributed to the
long-term decline in deaths and serious casualties.
In March 1995 the Government
announced that seat belts would have
to be fitted to every coach and
minibus used specifically for
transporting children.
The Government’s aim is to reduce road
casualties by one-third by the end of the
century, compared with the 1981—85 average.
Priority is given to reducing casualties among
vulnerable road-users (children, pedestrians,
cyclists, motor cyclists and elderly people),
particularly in urban areas, where about
75 per cent of road accidents occur. Other
strategies for reducing casualties focus on
improvements in highway design, better
protection for vehicle occupants,
encouraging the use of cycle helmets and
measures to combat drinking and driving.

Spending on local road safety schemes will
increase to £60 million by 1997-98, up
20 per cent on 1995-96 levels.
Traffic in Towns
Traffic management schemes are used in
many urban areas to reduce congestion,
create a better environment and improve
road safety. They include bus lanes,
facilities for pedestrians and cyclists, and
traffic-calming measures such as road humps
to constrain traffic speeds in residential areas.
Local authorities can introduce 20 mph (32
km/h) zones, subject to central government
consent. About 170 have been set up.
Many towns have shopping precincts
designed for the convenience of pedestrians,
from which motor vehicles are excluded for all
or part of the day. Controls over on-street
parking are enforced through excess charges and
fixed penalty fines, supported where appropriate
by powers to clamp or remove vehicles.
The first part of a 505-km (315-mile)
network of priority ‘red routes’ in London
came into operation in March 1995. Marked
by red lining and special signs, these routes
are subject to special stopping controls and
other traffic management measures, strictly
enforced with higher penalties. The Traffic
Director for London is co-ordinating the
introduction and operation of red routes
throughout London. A pilot scheme in north
and east London, introduced in 1991, led to
significant falls in bus journey times and a
more dependable service, with a consequent
rise in passenger numbers.
ROAD HAULAGE
Road haulage traffic by heavy goods vehicles
amounted to 137,800 million tonne-km1 in
1994, 7 per cent more than in 1993. There
has been a move towards larger and more
efficient vehicles carrying heavier loads—
about 80 per cent of the traffic, measured in
tonne-km, is now carried by vehicles of over
25 tonnes laden weight. Journey lengths are
1A tonne-km is equivalent to 1 tonne transported for 1 km.
297
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
increasing, with the average haul now being
86 km (53 miles), 23 per cent longer than in
1979. Public haulage (private road hauliers
carrying other firms’ goods) accounts for
73 per cent of freight carried in Great Britain
in terms of tonne-km.
Road haulage is predominantly an industry
of small, privately owned businesses. There
were about 121,000 holders of an operator’s
licence in March 1995, with 403,000 heavy
goods vehicles. Nearly 90 per cent of
operators have fleets of five or fewer vehicles.
The biggest in Great Britain are NFC pic,
LEP Group pic, P & O Industrial Services
Division, Ocean Group pic, Parcelforce and
Transport Development Group pic.
Licensing and Other Controls
In general, those operating goods vehicles or
trailer combinations over 3.5 tonnes gross
weight require a goods vehicle operator’s
licence. Licences are divided into restricted
licences for own-account operators carrying
goods connected with their own business, and
standard licences for hauliers operating for hire
or reward. Proof of professional competence,
financial standing and good repute is needed
to obtain a standard licence. In Northern
Ireland own-account operators do not require
a licence, although this is under consideration.
EC regulations prescribe maximum limits
on driving times and minimum requirements
for breaks and rest periods for most drivers
of heavy goods vehicles over 35 tonnes.
Drivers’ activities are recorded by means of a
tachograph. Drivers of goods vehicles which
are exempt from EC rules are subject to
separate British drivers’ hours rules, which
normally require drivers to keep a written
record of their activities when driving
vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes. Speed limiters
must also be fitted to heavy lorries. Originally
these had to be set to limit speed to 60 mph
(97 km/h). However, in January 1994 a
programme began to reduce this gradually to
56 mph (90 km/h).
International Road Haulage
International road haulage has grown rapidly
and in 1994 about 1.7 million road goods
vehicles were ferried to mainland Europe or
the Irish Republic. Of these, 469,000 were
powered vehicles registered in Britain. In
1994 British vehicles carried almost 13
million tonnes internationally, about three
times the amount for 1984. About 95 per
cent of this traffic was with the European
Union. The largest commodity group carried
is agricultural produce and foodstuffs,
which accounted for 34 per cent of inward
tonnage and 25 per cent of outward tonnage
in 1993.
International road haulage within the EU
was fully liberalised in 1993. ‘Cabotage’ (the
operation of domestic road haulage services
within a member state by a non-resident) will
be fully liberalised in 1998. Until then,
quotas of permits are available which allow
cabotage in most parts of western Europe.
Haulage elsewhere takes place under bilateral
agreements, most of which allow unrestricted
numbers of British lorries into the country
concerned, although some require permits.
The European Conference of Transport
Ministers issues a limited but increasing
number of permits giving free access to, and
transit across, a number of countries in
central and eastern Europe.
PASSENGER SERVICES
Buses
Almost all bus services in Great Britain are
provided by companies in the private sector,
ranging from major groups with over 5,000
buses to small operators with fewer than five.
The largest operator is Stagecoach Holdings.
Outside London, operators may provide
services without restriction, although controls
may be imposed on the number of vehicles
operating if this would otherwise cause
congestion or danger to other road users.
Although most local bus services are provided
commercially, local authorities may subsidise
the provision of services which are not
commercially viable but which are considered
to be socially necessary, after competitive
tender. Local bus mileage outside London in
1993-94 was up 24 per cent on its 1985-86
pre-deregulation level.
London Transport (LT) is a statutory
298
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
corporation responsible for providing public
transport in London. It no longer has its own
buses, but organises about 650 bus routes
through private sector companies operating
under contract. A London Bus Passenger’s
Charter sets service standards. LT completed
the privatisation of its bus operating
subsidiaries by the end of 1994. In the longer
term deregulation of bus services in London
is proposed. Provision would be made for
operating socially necessary but uneconomic
services and the continuation of a London¬
wide concessionary travel scheme.
Bus priority measures, such as bus lanes
and traffic light priority signalling, form an
important element in many local authorities’
package bids to the Department of Transport
(see p. 295). A further £8 million has been
allocated in 1995-96 to continue development
of a London bus priority network. Also, new
information systems are being provided to
assist passengers. For example, in
Southampton a bus passenger information
system known as Stopwatch provides
information to passengers at 30 stops.
In Northern Ireland subsidiaries of the
publicly owned Northern Ireland Transport
Holding Company supply almost all road
passenger services. Citybus Ltd operates
services in Belfast, and Ulsterbus Ltd runs
most of the services in the rest of Northern
Ireland. These companies have about 285 and
1,200 vehicles respectively. As well as the
two major operators, there are about 75 small
privately owned undertakings, often operating
fewer than five vehicles.
Coaches
In Britain long-distance coach services are
provided by companies in the private sector.
There are no restrictions on routes served or
the number of vehicles operated. A national
network of routes is maintained by the
National Express company, largely through
franchised operations. Passenger comfort in
coaches has improved in recent years, for
example through the provision of refreshment
facilities on some services.
While all regular, and some shuttle, overseas
coach services still require authorisation or
permission from the authorities of the
countries to or through which they travel,
most tourist services within the EU have
been liberalised. Operators no longer need
prior permission to run either holiday
shuttle services, where accommodation is
included as part of the package, or occasional
coach tours to, from or within another
member state. Since 1993 passenger cabotage
has been allowed for tours where a single
vehicle carries the same group of passengers
throughout a journey. From January 1996,
this will extend to all non-regular services.
Taxis
There are about 58,000 licensed taxis in
Great Britain, mainly in urban areas; London
has about 18,000. In London and several
other major cities taxis must be purpose-built
to conform to very strict requirements and
new ones have to provide for people in
wheelchairs. In many urban districts drivers
must have passed a test of their knowledge of
the area. At present, a local authority can
only limit the number of licensed taxis if it is
satisfied that there is no unfulfilled demand
for taxis in its area. Private hire vehicles with
drivers (‘minicabs’) may be booked only
through the operator and not hired on the
street. In most areas outside London private
hire vehicles are licensed; there are about
52,000 in England and Wales outside
London. It is estimated that at least 40,000
minicabs operate in London.
Having reviewed the taxi licensing regime
in England and Wales, in February 1995 the
Government announced that it intends to
maintain the distinction between taxis and
minicabs, and will introduce a licensing system
for minicabs in London when legislation
permits. The power of local authorities to
control numbers of taxis would be phased out.
There are about 4,000 licensed taxis in
Northern Ireland. Licences are issued by the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland on a broadly similar basis to that in
Great Britain.
RAILWAYS
Railways were pioneered in Britain: the
Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in
299
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1825, was the first public passenger railway
in the world to be worked by steam power.
The main railway companies in Great Britain
were nationalised in 1948, coming under the
control of the British Railways Board. This
rail network is now being privatised.
Privatisation
The Government’s approach, enshrined in
the Railways Act 1993, includes:
• the franchising of all BR’s existing
passenger services to the private
sector;
• the transfer of BR’s freight and parcels
operations to the private sector;
• the creation of a new right of access to
the rail network for private operators of
both passenger and freight services;
• the separation of track from train
operations, under which Railtrack—at
present a government-owned company—
is responsible for operating all track and
infrastructure, with passenger services
being run by BR until they are
franchised;
• the appointment of a Rail Regulator to
oversee the fair application of
arrangements for track access and
charging, and a Franchising Director
responsible for negotiating, awarding and
monitoring franchises;
• opportunities for the private sector to
lease stations; and
• improved grant arrangements for
individual rail services or groups of
services.
Railtrack is seeking private sector finance
to improve the network—for example, it is
working with a private sector consortium to
implement proposals to modernise the West
Coast Main Line, for which contracts are
expected to be let in 1995-96. The Government
intends to float Railtrack on the Stock
Exchange during the present Parliament.
BR has restructured its passenger services
into 25 train operating units as a basis for the
privatised railway network. The Government
has set the Franchising Director targets of
awarding the first six franchises by the end of
1995 and over half of BR’s current passenger
services by April 1996. Invitations to tender
for the first three franchises—South West
Trains, Great Western and London Tilbury
Southend—were issued in May 1995. Also in
May 1995 the Franchising Director
announced that overall fare levels would not
be allowed to rise above the rate of inflation
for three years from January 1996. For the
following four years, they would be limited to
the rate of inflation less 1 per cent.
Three rolling stock leasing companies have
taken over virtually all of BR’s passenger
rolling stock, leasing it to the operators,
including BR pending franchising. The three
companies are expected to be sold to the
private sector during 1995.
Three new, competing, bulk commodity
rail freight companies, each with a geographic
heartland, were set up in 1994 and are due to
be privatised by the end of 1995. They are:
• Transrail Freight, covering the west,
including Scotland and Wales;
• Loadhaul, in the north-east; and
• Mainline Freight, in the south-east.
The parcels business was also being sold in
1995. In June 1995 the Government invited
private sector bids for Rail Express Systems,
the BR business which operates trains for the
Royal Mail, including 22 Travelling Post
Offices on which mail is sorted overnight by
Post Office staff. Freightliner, which carries
containers between major ports and inland
terminals, is also being privatised.
New regulations require rail operators to
prepare a ‘safety case’ to demonstrate that
safe practices will be followed at all times;
these cases are validated by Railtrack. Railway
employees who undertake work with safety
implications are required to be fit and
competent. The Railway Inspectorate, part of
the Health and Safety Executive (see p. 195),
is responsible for validating Railtrack’s own
safety case.
Operations
In 1994—95 BR’s turnover, including
financial support and income from other
activities, was £6,236 million. It received
grants of £2,054 million from the

Government as support for railway operations
and to cover the cost of restructuring.
As part of the Citizen’s Charter initiative,
BR has published a Passenger’s Charter.
Compensation is payable to passengers if
performance falls by more than a small
margin below the standards set in the
Charter. Under the privatisation
arrangements, franchisees will be required to
produce their own charters, which will
include targets at least as demanding as
BR’s existing ones.
Investment
There has been substantial investment in
Britain’s railways in recent years. BR’s
programme totalled £300 million in 1994-95,
while Railtrack invested £500 million.
Major areas of expenditure included rolling
stock and facilities for Channel Tunnel traffic
(see p. 302).
Passenger Services
The passenger network (see map facing inside
back cover) comprises a fast inter-city
network, linking the main centres of Great
Britain; local stopping services; and commuter
services in and around the large conurbations,
especially London and south-east England.
InterCity 125 trains, travelling at maximum
sustained speeds of 125 mph (201 km/h), are
the world’s fastest diesel trains. Following the
introduction of electric InterCity 225 trains,
Britain has more services running at over
100 mph (160 km/h) than any other country
in Europe.
About 30 per cent of route-mileage is
electrified, including the East Coast Main
Line linking London and Edinburgh. A new
generation of diesel multiple-unit trains has
been introduced on regional services. The
first of a new generation of electric trains
entered service in Kent in 1992, with the first
674 coaches for suburban traffic in service by
1995, and 164 for main line use both in
Kent and between London and Peterborough
being delivered.
Freight
Nearly 90 per cent of rail freight traffic by
volume is of bulk commodities, mainly coal,
coke, iron and steel, building materials and
petroleum. The opening of the Channel
Tunnel has presented an important
opportunity for non-bulk freight movement.
301
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government makes grants available to
encourage companies to move goods by rail
rather than road; more than 200 schemes
have been helped since 1975 at a cost of
over £80 million. The Department of
Transport budget for freight grants in
1995-96 is £14.4 million. New freight
operators have had rights of open access to
the rail network since April 1994, allowing
services to be set up in competition with
existing hauliers.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland
Railways Company Ltd, a subsidiary of the
Northern Ireland Transport Holding
Company, operates the railway service on
about 336 km (210 miles) of track. It
published a revised passenger charter in
1992 which includes a compensation scheme
that operates if targets for punctuality and
reliability are not met.
Channel Tunnel
The Channel Tunnel, the largest civil
engineering project in Europe to be financed
by the private sector, was opened to traffic
in 1994. The project, which is estimated to
have cost about £10,000 million, was
undertaken by Eurotunnel, a British-French
group which has a 65-year operating
concession from the British and French
governments. Construction was carried out
for Eurotunnel by Transmanche Link, a
consortium of ten British and French
construction companies.
Eurotunnel Services
Eurotunnel operates shuttle trains through
twin one-way rail tunnels between the
terminals near Folkestone and Calais, with
the journey taking about 35 minutes from
platform to platform. These trains provide a
drive-on, drive-off service, with separate
shuttle trains for passenger and freight
vehicles. Car and coach passengers stay
with their vehicles during the journey.
Lorry drivers travel separately from
their vehicles, in a carriage at the front of
the shuttle. Eurotunnel runs passenger
shuttle services every 15 minutes and
freight shuttle services every 20 minutes at
peak periods.
Railway Services
About £1,400 million has been invested in
new passenger and freight rolling stock and
infrastructure improvements for Channel
Tunnel services. About 30 Eurostar high¬
speed trains will run each day between the
London terminal at Waterloo and Paris or
Brussels. Daytime passenger services from
the Midlands, northern England and Scotland
to Paris and Brussels should begin operating
in 1996. Overnight services from London,
south Wales, Scotland, the Midlands, the
North West and the South West to
continental Europe will also start in 1996. A
part-privately funded international station is
being built at Ashford in Kent, scheduled for
completion by the end of 1995.
Freight services through the Channel
Tunnel are operating from a network of
regional terminals to major industrial centres
on the Continent. Four terminals—in
London, Glasgow, Manchester and
Birmingham—started operations when the
tunnel opened. Because of infrastructure
improvements and advanced wagon designs,
over 90 per cent of standard continental
‘swap-bodies’ are able to travel over the lines
between the tunnel and the British terminal
network, even though the British loading
gauge is smaller than the continental gauge.
The terminal facilities allow freight to be
transferred between road and rail easily.
A new private sector rail link between
London and the Channel Tunnel is proposed
to meet the forecast growth in demand for
through rail services. The route for the rail
link will pass through Kent, crossing the River
Thames near Dartford. It will then run
through the east of London to a second
London terminal at St Pancras. A Bill has been
introduced in Parliament, using the hybrid Bill
procedure (see p. 57), for the construction of
the rail link. By the end of 1995, the
Government is expected to have chosen from
among several bids the private sector
consortium that will carry forward the scheme.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Other Railways in London
London Underground Ltd (LUL), a
subsidiary of LT, operates services on 392
km (245 miles) of railway, of which about
170 km (106 miles) are underground. The
system has 245 stations, with 466 trains
running in the peak period. About 764 million
passenger journeys were made on London
Underground trains in 1994-95. LUL has a
charter that commits it to provide a certain
level of service to passengers. It includes a
compensation scheme that applies when
delays of 15 minutes or more occur within
LUL’s control. The most recent version was
introduced in 1995. LUL has also been set
more demanding performance targets for
1995-96.
Major investment in the Underground is
under way or planned. Work started in 1993
on an extension of the Jubilee Line to
Stratford (east London) via Docklands and
the north Greenwich peninsula. The
extension is scheduled to open in 1998.
Routes being considered include CrossRail,
which would link Paddington with Liverpool
Street, and a line from Chelsea to Hackney.
Total LUL investment in new lines will be
well over £500 million in 1995-96, of which
most will be spent on the Jubilee Line. LUL
has also applied for the parliamentary Order
necessary to build a northern extension to the
East London Line to Dalston, where it would
link with BR’s North London Line.
The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), a
22-km (14-mile) route with 27 stations,
connects the City of London with Docklands,
Beckton and Stratford. An extension under
the River Thames is planned to Greenwich
and Lewisham, to be built by one of four
private sector consortia shortlisted in
February 1995. The DLR’s operations will be
franchised to the private sector in 1996, the
eventual aim being to transfer the railway as a
whole into the private sector.
The Government has set aside funding for
the Croydon Tramlink, which would connect
Croydon with Wimbledon, Beckenham and
New Addington. This project would be a
joint venture between LT and the private
sector. Government financial support would
be subject to satisfactory private sector bids.
Other Urban Railways
The Glasgow Underground, a heavy rapid
transit system, operates on a 10-km (6-mile)
loop in central Glasgow. The Tyne and Wear
Metro is a 59-km (37-mile) light rail system
connecting Newcastle upon Tyne with
Gateshead, North and South Shields, Heworth
and Jarrow. An extension to Sunderland is
currently being planned. Two light railway
systems have been constructed in recent years:
• the Greater Manchester Metrolink, which
connects Altrincham and Bury with
Manchester city centre on a 31-km
(19-mile) route, to which further
extensions are planned; and
• the South Yorkshire Supertram, which is
a 29-km (18-mile) system connecting
Meadowhall, Hillsborough and Halfway
to Sheffield City Centre.
The Government has announced that it
will provide the major proportion of the
funding for the Midlands Metro Line 1, a
21-km (13-mile) system between Birmingham
and Wolverhampton. Construction is due to
begin before the end of 1995. Other schemes
with parliamentary approval include the
Leeds Supertram and the Greater
Nottingham Light Rapid Transit. There are
also plans for a privately financed and run
light railway between Caernarfon and
Porthmadog in north Wales.
Traditional tramcars still operate in
Blackpool, the Isle of Man and Llandudno.
Private Railways
There are over 100 small, privately owned
passenger-carrying railways in Great Britain,
mostly operated on a voluntary basis and
providing limited services for tourists and
railway enthusiasts. The main aim of most of
these railways is the preservation of steam
locomotives. They generally run on old BR
branch lines, but there are also several
narrow-gauge lines, mainly in north Wales.
INLAND WATERWAYS
Inland waterways are popular for recreation,
make a valuable contribution to the quality
303
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of Britain’s environment, play an important
part in land drainage and water supply,
and are used to a limited extent for freight¬
carrying. The greatest amounts of freight
are carried on the rivers Thames, Forth,
Humber and Mersey and the Manchester
Ship Canal. The majority of waterways
are primarily for leisure use, but about
620 km (385 miles) are maintained as
commercial waterways.
The first new stretch of canal in
Britain since 1905 was opened in April
1995 near Leeds (West Yorkshire). The
£20 million scheme enhances the Aire
and Calder Navigation’s freight¬
carrying potential and provides new
facilities for leisure craft.
The publicly owned British Waterways is
responsible for 3,200 km (2,000 miles) of
waterways in Great Britain. It is developing
its historical heritage for recreational and
commercial use, often in conjunction with
the private sector. In 1994—95 British
Waterways’ turnover amounted to
£86.8 million, including a government grant
of £48.9 million to maintain its waterways
to statutory standards.
SHIPPING AND PORTS
In December 1994 British companies owned
678 trading vessels of 100 gross tonnes or
more, totalling 13.0 million deadweight
tonnes. Among the ships owned by them
were 176 vessels totalling 7.7 million
deadweight tonnes used as oil, chemical or
gas carriers and 473 vessels totalling
5.2 million deadweight tonnes employed as
dry-bulk carriers, container ships or other
types of cargo ship. In all, 73 per cent of
British-owned vessels are registered in
Britain or British dependent territories such
as Bermuda.
The tonnage of the British-registered
trading fleet has been declining. In
recognition of this, measures to encourage
British shipowners to register their vessels in
Britain have been introduced. These include
the relaxation of officer nationality rules,
announced in June 1995. Except on ‘strategic’
ships, this will open positions to officers of
any nation provided they hold British
certificates of competency or equivalents.
Fiscal changes announced in 1994 enable
shipowners to carry forward tax charges
resulting from ship sales to set against further
investment within a six-year period.
Cargo Services
About 94 per cent by weight (76 per cent by
value) of Britain’s foreign trade is carried by
sea. In 1992 British seaborne trade amounted
to 311 million tonnes (valued at £178,000
million). British-registered ships carried 19
per cent by weight and 36 per cent by value.
Tanker cargo accounted for 44 per cent of this
trade by weight, but only 7 per cent by value.
Virtually all scheduled cargo-liner services
from Britain are containerised. The British
tonnage serving these trades is dominated by
a relatively small number of private sector
companies which, in deep-sea trades, usually
operate in conjunction with other companies
on the same routes in organisations known as
‘conferences’. The object of these groupings
is to ensure regular and efficient services with
stable freight rates, to the benefit of both
shipper and shipowner. In addition to the
carriage of freight by liner and bulk services
between Britain and the rest of Europe, there
are many roll-on/roll-off services to carry
cars, passengers and commercial vehicles.
Passenger Services
In 1994 37 million international sea passenger
movements took place between Britain and
the rest of the world, compared with about
96 million international air passenger
movements. Almost all passengers who
arrived at or departed from British ports
travelled to or from the continent of Europe
or the Irish Republic. In 1994 about 236,000
people embarked on pleasure cruises from
British ports. Traffic from the southern and
south-eastern ports accounts for a substantial
proportion of traffic to the continent of
Europe. The main British operators are
Stena Sealink Line, P & O European Ferries
and Hoverspeed, although not all their
vessels are under the British flag. Services are
304
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
provided by roll-on/roll-off ferries,
hovercraft, hydrofoils and high-speed
catamarans. There has been a trend towards
usage of larger vessels in recent years as the
ferry companies prepared for competition
from the Channel Tunnel.
Domestic passenger and freight ferry
services also run to many of the offshore
islands, such as the Isle of Wight, the Orkney
and Shetland islands, and the islands off the
west coast of Scotland. It is estimated that in
1992 there were about 36 million passengers
on such internal services.
Merchant Shipping Legislation
and Policy
The Government’s policy is to promote open
and competitive shipping markets. Regulations
administered by agencies of the Department of
Transport provide for marine safety and welfare,
investigation of accidents and prevention and
cleaning up of pollution from ships.
Britain plays a significant role in the
formulation of shipping policy within the EU.
All international services and most cabotage
services within the EU have been liberalised.
Full cabotage liberalisation will be achieved
over the next ten years. Work is progressing
well to introduce the measures in a European
programme to improve maritime safety and
prevent pollution.
Ports
The Government’s policy has been to:
• remove constraints on the ability of ports
to operate efficiently;
• enable them to compete more fully on an
equal footing; and
• expose the ports industry as a whole to
the marketplace.
There are about 80 ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain, and in addition
several hundred small harbours cater for local
cargo, fishing vessels, island ferries or
recreation. There are three broad types of
port—trust ports owned and run by a board
constituted as a trust, those owned by local
authorities and company-owned ports. Most
operate with statutory powers under private
Acts of Parliament. Major ports controlled by
trusts include Aberdeen, Dover, Ipswich,
Milford Haven and Tyne. Local authorities
own many small ports and a few much larger
ports, including Portsmouth and the oil ports
in Orkney and Shetland. The Ports Act 1991
facilitates the transfer of trust ports fully to
the private sector; Clyde, Forth, Medway,
Tees and Hartlepool and the Port of London
Authority dock at Tilbury have already
moved to the private sector. The port of
Dundee is seeking to do likewise.
Associated British Ports Holdings PLC,
Britain’s largest port owner and operator,
operates 22 ports, including Cardiff, Grimsby
and Immingham, Hull, Newport,
Southampton and Swansea. Together its
ports handled 110 million tonnes of cargo in
1994. Other major ports owned by companies
include Felixstowe, Liverpool, Manchester
and a group of ferry ports, including Harwich
(Parkeston Quay) and Stranraer.
Port Traffic
In 1994 traffic through British ports
amounted to 538 million tonnes, comprising
179 million tonnes of exports (its highest ever
level), 190 million tonnes of imports and 169
million tonnes of domestic traffic (which
included offshore traffic and landings of sea-
dredged aggregates). About 55 per cent of the
traffic was in fuels, chiefly petroleum and
petroleum products.
Britain’s main ports, in terms of total
tonnage handled, are given in Table 19.3.
Forth, Milford Haven and Sullom Voe
(Shetland) mostly handle oil, while the main
ports for non-fuel traffic are Dover,
Felixstowe, Grimsby and Immingham,
Liverpool, London, and Tees and Hartlepool.
Container and roll-on/roll-off traffic in
Britain has increased sixfold since 1970 to
108 million tonnes in 1994 and now accounts
for 78 per cent of non-bulk traffic. The
leading ports for container traffic are
Felixstowe, London and Southampton. Those
for roll-on/roll-off traffic are Dover (Britain’s
leading seaport in terms of the value of trade
handled), Felixstowe, Grimsby and
Immingham, Portsmouth and Ramsgate.
Northern Ireland has four fully-equipped

ports, at Belfast, Larne, Londonderry and
Warrenpoint, which handle worldwide trade.
Belfast is the principal freight port,
handling over half of all cargo through its
modern roll-on/roll-off facilities. It handled
9.3 million tonnes in 1993.
Development
Most recent major port developments have
been at east- and south-coast ports. For
example, at Felixstowe a £50 million
extension to the terminal was completed in
1990; a new £100 million terminal on the
River Medway caters for deep-sea container
traffic; and Dover has started on a
£100 million programme to develop its
western docks to meet competition from the
Channel Tunnel. A new cool store has been
opened at Tees and Hartlepool, and there are
plans for a new grain terminal. A 16-hectare
(40-acre) car terminal has been built at
Tyne. Recent investment by Associated British
Ports includes:
• an £18 million third berth at the
Immingham oil terminal, opened in 1994;
• a £13 million roll-on/roll-off terminal at
Immingham, opened in June 1995;
• an £11 million roll-on/roll-off facility
at Hull;
• a £3.5 million vehicle handling terminal
at Grimsby; and
• two new terminals costing £3 million at
Newport, specially designed for handling
animal feedstuffs.
Purpose-built terminals for oil from the
British sector of the North Sea have been
built at Hound Point on the Forth, on the
Tees, at Flotta and at Sullom Voe (one of
the largest oil terminals in the world).
Supply bases for offshore oil and gas
installations have been constructed at several
ports, notably Aberdeen, Great Yarmouth
and Heysham.
Safety at Sea
The Department of Transport has two
executive agencies concerned with safety at
sea—the Coastguard Agency and the Marine
Safety Agency (MSA). The former is
responsible for HM Coastguard and the
Marine Pollution Control Unit (see p. 371).
The latter has taken over the former Surveyor
General’s Organisation and the Register of
Shipping and Seamen. The MSA carries out
inspections on British and foreign ships using
British ports to ensure that they comply with
international safety, pollution prevention and
operational standards. It sets the standards
and monitors the training, examination and
certification of British seafarers.
HM Coastguard is responsible for
co-ordinating civil maritime search and rescue
operations around the coastline of Britain. In
306
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
a maritime emergency the coastguard calls on
and co-ordinates facilities such as:
• coastguard helicopters and cliff rescue
companies;
• lifeboats of the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution (a voluntary body);
• Ministry of Defence aeroplanes,
helicopters and ships; and
• merchant shipping and commercial aircraft.
In 1994 HM Coastguard co-ordinated
action in 5,891 incidents (including cliff
rescues), in which 11,560 people were helped.
Some locations around Britain are
hazardous for shipping. Measures are taken to
reduce the risk of collision, including the
separation of ships in internationally agreed
shipping lanes. The traffic separation scheme
in the Dover Strait, one of the busiest
seaways in the world, is one such scheme. It
is monitored by radar from the Channel
Navigation Information Service near Dover.
Ships are encouraged to report their
movements and these are tracked. Those
found to be contravening the regulations are
identified and action is taken.
Following the grounding of the MV Braer
off the Shetlands in 1993, the Government
set up an inquiry to advise on further
measures to prevent pollution from merchant
shipping. The Government accepted 86 of
the report’s 103 recommendations, which it is
in the process of implementing. One
recommendation concerned the poor standard
of foreign fish factory ships (‘klondykers’) in
British waters. The Government has introduced
a tightening of the licence regime for fish
factory ships—the number of licences is now
limited, applications for licences must be
submitted 28 days in advance and unlicensed
vessels will be asked to leave British waters.
The lighthouse authorities, which control
about 370 lighthouses and other lights and
buoys, are:
• the Corporation of Trinity House, which
covers England, Wales and the Channel
Islands;
• the Northern Lighthouse Board, for
Scotland and the Isle of Man; and
• the Commissioners of Irish Lights for
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
They are funded mainly by light dues levied
on shipping in Britain and Ireland. The Ports
Act 1991 provided for the transfer of certain
lights and buoys to harbour authorities where
these are used mainly for local rather than
general navigation. Responsibility for pilotage
within harbours rests with harbour authorities
under the Pilotage Act 1987.
CIVIL AVIATION
Airlines are seeking opportunities for
modernisation, and the aviation authorities
are negotiating new international rights and
improving facilities such as air traffic control.
British airlines are entirely in the private
sector, as are a number of the major airports.
Air Traffic
Total capacity offered on all services by
British airlines amounted to 27,700 million
tonne-km in 1994: 20,400 million tonne-km
on scheduled services and 7,400 million
tonne-km on non-scheduled services. British
airlines carried 43.9 million passengers on
scheduled services and 27.1 million on charter
flights; 96 million passengers travelled by air
(international terminal passengers) to or from
Britain, a 10 per cent increase on 1993.
The value of Britain’s overseas trade
carried by air in 1992 was about £44,000
million—10 per cent of exports by value and
also 10 per cent of imports. Air freight is
important for the carriage of goods with a
high value-to-weight ratio, especially where
speed is essential.
British Airways
British Airways pic is one of the world’s
leading airlines. In terms of international
scheduled services it is the largest in the
world. During 1994-95 its turnover from
airline operations was £7,100 million. The
British Airways group carried 27.6 million
passengers on scheduled and charter flights
both within Britain and internationally.
The British Airways scheduled route
network serves 153 destinations in 72
countries. Its main operating base is
London’s Heathrow airport, but services from
307
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Gatwick and regional centres such as
Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester have
been expanding. Scheduled Concorde
supersonic services operate from London
Heathrow to New York and, in summer,
Toronto, crossing the Atlantic in about half
the time taken by subsonic aircraft. In March
1995 British Airways had a fleet of 283
aircraft, the largest in Western Europe,
including seven Concordes and 62 Boeing
747s. Its first services with the new Boeing
777s were due to start in the autumn of 1995.
Other Airlines
Other major British airlines include:
• Britannia Airways, the world’s largest
charter airline, which carried 7.9 million
passengers in 1994 and has 29 aircraft;
• British Midland, which operates a large
network of scheduled services, and has 32
aircraft; and
• Virgin Atlantic, which operates scheduled
services between Britain, seven North
American destinations, Athens, Dublin,
Hong Kong and Tokyo, with 16 aircraft.
Helicopters and Other Aerial Work
Helicopters are engaged on a variety of work,
especially operations connected with Britain’s
offshore oil and gas industry. The main
offshore operators in Britain are Bond
Helicopters, British International Helicopters
and Bristow Helicopters, with 43, 25 and 56
helicopters respectively in 1993. Light aircraft
and helicopters are also used in other
important commercial activities, such as
charters, search and rescue services, load¬
lifting, aerial surveying and photography, and
police and air ambulance operations. In
March 1995 the Government published a
study into the potential for a new heliport to
serve central London.
Aviation Policy
The Government’s civil aviation policy aims
to maintain high standards of safety and
security and to achieve environmental
improvements by reducing noise and
emissions from aircraft. It seeks to promote
the interests of travellers by encouraging a
competitive British industry, and is
committed to encouraging more international
services to and from regional airports. The
Government has taken the lead in the EU
and with bilateral partners in negotiating
freer arrangements within which airline
competition can flourish; arrangements within
the European Economic Area (see p. 120) are
now almost fully liberalised. New
arrangements with an increasing number of
countries are resulting in better provision of
services at more competitive fares.
Civil Aviation Authority
The CAA is an independent statutory body
responsible for the economic and safety
regulation of the industry and, jointly with
the Ministry of Defence, for the provision of
air navigation services. Its board members are
appointed by the Secretary of State for
Transport. The CAA’s primary objectives are
to ensure that British airlines provide air
services to satisfy all substantial categories of
public demand at the lowest charges
consistent with a high standard of safety, and
to further the reasonable interests of air
transport users.
Air Safety
British airlines have a good safety record. In
all but two of the 12 years to 1994, there
were no passenger fatalities in accidents
involving large commercially registered
British aircraft in British airspace. In this
period no crew or passenger fatalities
associated with British-registered aircraft
occurred in foreign airspace.
Every company operating aircraft used for
commercial air transport purposes must
possess an Air Operator’s Certificate, which
the CAA grants when it is satisfied that the
operator is competent to operate its aircraft
safely. The CAA’s flight operations
inspectors, who are experienced civilian
pilots, together with airworthiness surveyors,
check that satisfactory standards are
maintained. All aircraft registered in Britain
must be granted a Certificate of Airworthiness
308
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
by the CAA before being flown. In this and
many other aspects of its work, the CAA is
increasingly working to standards developed
with its European partners in the Joint
Airworthiness Authorities.
Each member of the flight crew of a
British-registered aircraft, every ground
engineer who certifies an aircraft fit to fly,
and every air traffic controller must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the
CAA. To qualify for a first professional
licence, a pilot must undertake a full-time
course of instruction approved by the CAA—
or have acceptable military or civilian flying
experience—and pass ground examinations
and flight tests.
Air Traffic Control and Navigation Services
Civil and military air traffic control over
Britain and the surrounding seas, including a
large part of the North Atlantic, is carried out
by the National Air Traffic Services (NATS),
jointly operated by the CAA and the Ministry
of Defence. NATS also provides air traffic
control at most major British airports.
Britain plays a major role in European air
traffic control developments through
participation in a number of international
forums. It has put forward several European
initiatives, including the centralised
management of traffic flows throughout
Europe, which is being progressively
implemented over the period 1991-96. Within
Britain, NATS has an investment programme
running at around fflS million a year, which
includes the construction of a new air traffic
control centre for England and Wales, due to
become operational in 1996. The Government
has also approved a new air traffic control
centre for Scotland to be designed, financed,
built and maintained by the private sector.
Airports
Of the 142 licensed civil aerodromes in Britain,
about one-fifth handle more than 100,000
passengers a year each. Of these, 14 handle
over 1 million passengers a year each (see
Table 19.4). In 1994 Britain’s civil airports
handled a total of 123.9 million passengers
(122.4 million terminal passengers and 1.6 million
in transit), and 1.6 million tonnes of freight.
Proposals have been put forward for a
fifth terminal at Heathrow, which
could eventually handle 30 million
passengers a year. A public inquiry on
the planning application opened in
May 1995.
Heathrow is the world’s busiest airport for
international passengers and is Britain’s most
important airport for passengers and air freight,

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
handling 52 million passengers (including
transit passengers) and 967,000 tonnes of
freight in 1994. Gatwick is also one of the
world’s busiest international airports. The
Government accepts that there is a strong case
for further runway capacity in the south-east,
but options for new runways at Heathrow or
Gatwick will not be considered further.
Ownership and Control
Seven airports—Heathrow, Gatwick,
Stansted and Southampton in south-east
England, and Glasgow, Edinburgh and
Aberdeen in Scotland—are owned and
operated by BAA pic. Together they handle
about 72 per cent of air passengers and 82
per cent of air cargo traffic in Britain.
Many of the other airports are controlled
by local authorities, including Manchester,
which is the third largest airport in Britain.
A total of 12 major local authority airports
now operate as companies. The Government
is encouraging their privatisation. For
example, East Midlands International Airport
was sold by its local authority shareholders
in 1993 and Cardiff Wales Airport was sold
in April 1995. Councils which sell
shareholdings in airports before April 1997
will be able to spend three-quarters of the
proceeds on other capital projects.
The CAA has responsibility for the
economic regulation of the larger airports. It
has powers to take action to remedy practices
considered to be unreasonable or unfair, in
particular any abuse of an airport’s monopoly
position, and also to limit increases in
charges to airlines at certain airports. All
airports used for public transport and
training flights must also be licensed by the
CAA for reasons of safety. Stringent
requirements, such as the provision of
adequate fire-fighting, medical and rescue
services, must be satisfied before a licence is
granted. Following a review, the
Government announced in March 1995 that
the regulatory system would be streamlined
and improved, including the provision of
better information to airlines about proposals
for airport charges.
Strict security measures are in force at
Britain’s airports; these were tightened in
1994 with the introduction of regulations
requiring airlines to account for and authorise
for carriage every item of hold baggage
placed on board international flights
originating in Britain. This has not only
improved security but should also cut down
on misrouted baggage.
Communications
The telecommunications industry is one of
the most rapidly growing sectors of the
British economy. Despite the growth in
electronic means of communication in
recent years, postal services continue to
be important. The volume of mail in
Britain is increasing rather than declining,
partly as a result of the growth in direct
mail marketing.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Major changes have occurred since 1981,
with the progressive introduction of
competition into the markets for
telecommunications equipment and services.
British Telecommunications pic (BT),
which was privatised in 1984, faces increasing
competition in the provision of services
over fixed links. The principal feature of
the regulatory regime is an independent
industry regulator, the Director General of
T elecommunications.
Duopoly Review
In 1991 a major review of government
telecommunications policy resulted in the
publication of a White Paper, Competition and
Choice: Telecommunications Policy for the
1990s. This stated that the Government
would end the ‘duopoly policy’, under which
only two companies, BT and Mercury
Communications, were permitted to run
nationwide fixed-link telecommunications
systems. Other important points contained in
the review were:
• greater freedom for existing mobile
telecommunications operators and
permission for cable television operators
to provide telephone services in their
own right;
310
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
• the introduction of ‘access deficit
contributions’ payable to BT by operators
interconnecting with BT’s network whose
customers use BT’s local network when
making calls;
• the introduction of ‘international simple
resale’2 to destinations with equivalent
freedom to Britain; and
• the establishment of a new regime for
national numbering, taken over by the
Office of Communications (OFTEL—see
below), and the modification of operators’
licences to allow for the introduction of
number portability.
Office of Telecommunications
OFTEL, a non-ministerial government
department, is the independent regulatory
body for the telecommunications industry. It
is headed by the Director General of
Telecommunications, whose functions include:
• ensuring that licensees comply with the
conditions of their licences;
• initiating the modification of licence
conditions by agreement or a referral to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
(see p. 202);
• promoting effective competition in the
telecommunications industry;
• providing advice to the President of the
Board of Trade on telecommunications
matters; and
• investigating complaints.
The Director General also has a duty to
promote the interests of consumers in respect
of prices, quality and variety in
telecommunications services. A key area of
regulatory activity relates to ‘interconnection’,
where one operator charges another for the
right to route calls over its network. OFTEL is
making progress on seeking a fair and
transparent regime for this, including changes
to BT’s licence which were agreed by BT in
March 1995. OFTEL launched a wide-ranging
review of the regulatory regime in December
The use of international leased circuits connected with the
! public switched network at both ends.
1994. This put forward options for changing
the interconnection regime and looked at issues
such as capacity charging for interconnection
and providing and funding universal service.
OFTEL has taken over responsibility for
In May 1995 OFTEL published the
results of a large consumer survey.
Among other things, this showed that
53 per cent of people thought that
telephone services had got better over
the previous five years, while only
5 per cent thought they had got worse;
40 per cent thought that value for
money had got better, and 19 per cent
that it was worse.
About one in five people with a
telephone also had an answerphone.
administering the national telephone
numbering scheme. A major change took
place in April 1995 when an extra digit, 1,
was introduced after the initial 0 to all area
dialling codes in Britain. Thus, for example,
the 071 code for inner London became 0171
and the 0232 code for Belfast became 01232.
Five cities with greater need for additional
capacity—Bristol, Leeds, Leicester,
Nottingham and Sheffield—were given
entirely new codes. These changes open up
the opportunity to use 8,000 million extra
numbers to provide customers with new
services. OFTEL is hoping to see a ‘number
portability’ scheme, enabling someone who
wishes to change service-provider at the same
address to retain their existing number,
rather than having to change it as at present,
become widely available by the end of 1995.
BT
BT runs one of the world’s largest public
telecommunications networks, including:
• 20.6 million residential lines;
• 6.4 million business lines;
• telex connections to about 30,000 British
companies;
• more than 130,000 public payphones; and
• a wide range of specialised voice, data,
text and visual services.
The inland telephone and telex networks
311
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
are fully automatic. International direct
dialling is available from Britain to 200
countries, representing 99 per cent of the
world’s telephones. Following the sale of its
shares in three tranches between 1984 and
1993, the Government has only a residual
stake in BT to enable it to meet outstanding
commitments under the bonus scheme which
accompanied the privatisation.
Network Modernisation
BT has invested £20,000 million since 1985 in
the modernisation and expansion of its network
to meet increasing demand for basic telephone
services and for more specialised services. The
company has more than 2.6 million km
(1.6 million miles) of optical fibre laid in its
network in Britain, a higher proportion than
any other world operator. There are more than
7,000 digital and modern electronic exchanges
serving about 98 per cent of telephone lines.
The combination of digital exchange switching
and digital transmission techniques, using
optical-fibre cable and microwave radio links, is
substantially improving the quality of telephone
services. It also makes possible the provision
of a wider range of services through the
company’s main network.
General Services
BT’s services include:
• a free facility for emergency calls to the
police, fire, ambulance, coastguard,
lifeboat and air-sea rescue services;
• directory enquiries;
• various chargeable operator-connected
services, such as reversed-charge calls;
• an operator-handled ‘Freefone’ service
and automatic Freefone and ‘Lo-calf
facilities that enable callers to contact
organisations anywhere in Britain, either
free or at local call rates;
• premium-rate services which allow callers
to obtain information from independent
providers; and
• select network services such as caller
display, reminder calls, three-way calling,
call waiting and call diversion, which are
available to customers on digital exchanges.
Public payphone modernisation has
included additional provision on sites
convenient for travellers, such as train
carriages, London Underground platforms
and motorway service areas. A number of
cashless call services are available, including
the Phonecard service using prepaid cards,
BT chargecards, and phones that accept
credit cards. More than 40,000 payphones
accept BT phonecards and 30,000 accept
credit or charge cards. There are about
200,000 private rented payphones on
premises to which the public has access.
BT Electronic Information Services (an
electronic mail and information service) forms
part of the company’s portfolio of global
network services. Through links with other
databases, a wide range of other services,
such as company accounting and market
research information, banking services,
holiday booking and reservation facilities,
insurance and financial markets information,
and BT’s telephone directories, are available.
International Services
BT is the second largest shareholder in the
International Telecommunications Satellite
Organisation (INTELSAT), of which 125
countries are members, and in the European
Telecommunications Satellite Organisation
(EUTELSAT). It is also a leading
shareholder in the International Maritime
Satellite Organisation (INMARSAT), with
interests in a number of other consortia.
BT operates satellite earth stations in the
London Docklands and at Goonhilly Downs
(Cornwall), Madley (near Hereford),
Aberdeen, and Mormond Hill (Grampian).
Its range of digital transmission services
includes a number available overseas,
including ‘Satstream’ private-circuit digital
links covering North America and Western
Europe, using small-dish aerials. Extensive
direct-dial maritime satellite services are
available for vessels worldwide. In-flight
operator-controlled telephone call facilities are
provided via Portishead radio station near
Bristol. Digital transmission techniques have
been introduced for services to the United
States, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia via
the Madley and Goonhilly stations.
312
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
To increase its presence in the world
market, BT has entered into several joint
ventures with overseas firms: MCI in the
United States, for example; the German
industrial group VIAG; and Grupo
Santander in Spain.
Mercury Communications
Mercury Communications Ltd, which is part
of the Cable & Wireless group and is 20 per
cent owned by Bell Canada Enterprises, has
constructed its own long-distance all-digital
network. The network runs from the north
of Scotland to the south coast, linking over
100 cities and towns across Britain.
Mercury now offers a service to all the
population, including both business and
residential customers.
Major customers can have a direct digital
link between their premises and the Mercury
network. Routeing devices have also been
developed to enable customers to use
Mercury indirectly via their existing
exchange lines. Businesses can take
advantage of savings plans and automatic
discounts as well. There are Mercury-
compatible phones which connect the caller
to the network at the push of a button. In
addition, many customers are now able to
use the Mercury network by dialling an
access code.
International services are provided by
satellite communications centres in London’s
Docklands, in Oxfordshire and at Brechin in
Scotland, as well as by submarine cable links
to Europe and the United States.
Other Operators
Other operators include Kingston
Communications, which is the long-
established network operator for the
Kingston upon Hull area of Britain. The
duopoly review (see p. 310) allowed other
would-be operators to apply for licences to
provide telecommunications services over
fixed links. In the first seven months of
1995, the Government granted six new
licences. Earlier licensees included:
• COLT, which is focusing on business
customers in the Greater London area;
• Energis, one of the first electricity
companies to expand its interests into
telecommunications, which is using its
infrastructure as a platform for installing
new optical fibre networks;
• lonica, which is installing a new national
network using radio to provide the final
connection to customers;
• Sprint, the third-largest long-distance
telephone company in the United States,
which is seeking to expand its domestic
and international services in Britain; and
• Vodafone, the well-established mobile
operator, which was granted a licence for
fixed services in 1993.
Mobile Communications
The Government has encouraged the
expansion of mobile telecommunications
services. It has licensed Vodafone and
Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio to run
competing national cellular radio systems.
Considerable investment has been made in
establishing their networks to provide
increased capacity for the growing numbers
of mobile phone users (4.5 million by
September 1995). The two companies also
run the pan-European mobile system, known
as GSM, in Britain.
Britain was the first country to offer
personal communications network (PCN)
services, which are intended to allow the
same telephone to be used at home, at work
and as a portable wherever there is network
coverage. PCNs operate in the frequency
range around 1.8 gigahertz. The Mercury
One-2-One service started in 1993, and
Hutchison Microtel’s Orange service was
launched in 1994.
National Band Three Ltd is licensed to
offer a nationwide trunked radio service,
while 32 licences have been awarded for
London and regional services. Five licences
to operate mobile data networks and another
six to run nationwide paging networks have
also been granted. A government consultation
paper on increasing the availability of the
radio spectrum was published in May 1995.
This would allow new radio-based services
for small and medium-sized businesses.
313
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Cable Television Franchises
The Government concluded in the duopoly
review that cable operators should be able to
offer voice telephony in their own right,
which they could previously make available
only in conjunction with BT or Mercury. In
all, 63 of the 80 local cable television
franchises in operation by the beginning of
1995 also offered voice telephony services.
By then, the cable operators had installed
718,000 telephone lines in Britain,
compared with 2,200 lines in January 1991.
The OFTEL consumer survey (see p. 311)
showed that 12 per cent of people for whom
such services were available had taken them up.
Cable & Wireless
Cable and Wireless pic provides a wide range
of telecommunications services in over 50
countries worldwide. Its main business is the
provision and operation, through the
companies of the Cable & Wireless
federation, of public telecommunications
services in over 30 countries and territories,
including Hong Kong, the United States and
Japan, under franchises and licences granted
by the governments concerned. It also
supplies and manages telecommunications
services and facilities for public and private
sector customers, and undertakes consultancy
work worldwide. It operates a fleet of 15
ships and 18 submersible vehicle systems for
laying and maintaining submarine
telecommunications cables. Its strategy is to
build on its regional hubs in Asia, Western
Europe and the Caribbean. It links these
hubs through its worldwide network of cable
and satellite communications.
POSTAL SERVICES
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance
payment for mail.
The Royal Mail provides deliveries to
25 million addresses and handles over 67
million letters and parcels each working day,
which comes to over 16,700 million items a
year. About 500,000 parcels a day are
handled. Mail is collected from over 100,000
posting boxes, as well as from post offices
and large postal users.
The Royal Mail has invested substantially
in the latest mail-sorting technology, and
mechanisation has been introduced at all
stages of the sorting process. Automatic
sorting utilises the information contained in
the postcode; the British postcode system is
one of the most sophisticated in the world,
allowing mechanised sorting down to part of
a street on a postman’s round and, in some
cases, to an individual address.
Britain has good international postal
services, with prices among the cheapest.
Royal Mail International dispatches 717
million items a year, including over 600
million by air. It has its own mail-handling
centre at Heathrow, which handles about
four-fifths of outward airmail. It uses 1,400
flights a week to send mail direct to over 300
destinations worldwide.
Post Office Counters Ltd handles a wide
range of transactions; it acts as an agent for
the letters and parcels businesses, government
departments, local authorities and Alliance &
Leicester Giro—formerly Girobank, which
was transferred to the private sector in 1990.
There are just under 20,000 post offices, of
which 700 are operated directly by the
Post Office. The remainder are franchise
offices or are operated on an agency basis
by sub-postmasters.
Post Office Specialist Services
The Post Office offers a range of specialist
services. Parcelforce ‘Datapost’, a door-to-
door delivery service, provides overnight
delivery throughout Britain and an
international service to over 160 countries.
‘Datapost Sameday’ provides a rapid
delivery within or between major cities in
Britain. The Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh
is an important outlet for the Post Office’s
philatelic business, including sales to
overseas collectors or dealers. The British
Postal Consultancy Service offers advice
and assistance on all aspects of postal
business to overseas postal administrations,
and over 50 countries have used its services
since 1965.
314
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Competition in Postal Services
The Post Office has a monopoly on the
conveyance of letters within Britain, but the
President of the Board of Trade has the
power to suspend the monopoly in certain
areas or for certain categories of mail and to
license others to provide competing services.
He has suspended the monopoly on letters
subject to a minimum fee of £1.
The Government has been considering
options for the future of the Post Office. In
May 1995 it announced a new business regime
for the Post Office, which will involve:
• removing existing capital financing limits;
• turning the main operating units into
separate subsidiary limited companies; and
• making full use of the Private Finance
Initiative (see p. 158) to support moves
into new markets.
Private Courier and Express Service
Operators
Private-sector couriers and express operators
are allowed to handle time-sensitive door-to-
door deliveries, subject to a minimum fee of
£1. The courier/express service industry has
grown rapidly and the revenue created by the
carriage of these items is estimated at over
£3,000 million a year. Britain is one of the
main providers of monitored express deliveries
in Europe, with London an important centre
for air courier/express traffic.

Britain has a long tradition of research and innovation in science, technology
and engineering in universities, research institutes and industry. Science and
technology are critical elements in the innovation process, which is essential
for competing successfully in domestic and international markets.
INTRODUCTION
British achievements in science and technology
in the 20th century include fundamental
contributions to modern molecular genetics
through the discovery of the three-dimensional
molecular structure of DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) by Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins,
James Watson and Rosalind Franklin in 1953
and of cholesterol, vitamin D, penicillin and
insulin by Dorothy Hodgkin.
Notable contributions in other areas
over the past 25 years have been made by
Stephen Hawking in improving the
understanding of the nature and origin of
the universe; Brian Josephson in
superconductivity (abnormally high electrical
conductivity at low temperatures); Martin
Ryle and Antony Hewish in radio
astrophysics; and Godfrey Hounsfield in
computer assisted tomography (a form of
radiography) for medical diagnosis.
Other pioneering work included the
discovery in 1985 by British Antarctic Survey
scientists of the hole in the ozone layer over
the Antarctic. Also in 1985 Alec Jeffreys
invented DNA fingerprinting, a forensic
technique which can identify an individual
from a small tissue sample. More recently
there have been several British breakthroughs
in genetics research, including the
identification of the gene in the Y
chromosome responsible for determining sex,
and the identification of other genes linked to
diseases, including cystic fibrosis and a type
of inherited heart disease. Gene therapy has
begun in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The
world’s first pig with a genetically modified
heart has been bred by scientists at Cambridge
University, an important milestone in
breeding animals as organ donors for people. !
Nobel Prizes for Science have been won
bv over 70 British citizens, more than any
other country except the United States.
Research and Development Expenditure
Total expenditure in Britain on scientific
research and development (R & D) in 1993
was £13,752 million, 2.2 per cent of gross
domestic product. About 50 per cent of the
funding was provided by industry and around
33 per cent by government. Significant
contributions were also made by private
endowments, trusts and charities. Industry
also funds university research and finances

Note: R & D expenditure includes expenditure overseas.
contract research at government
establishments. Some charities have their own
laboratories and offer grants for outside
research. Contract research organisations
carry out R & D for companies and are
playing an increasingly important role in the
transfer of technology to British industry.
Total spending on R & D in industry
amounted to £9,069 million in 1993. Of this
total, British industry’s own contribution was
72 per cent, with 12 per cent from government
and the rest from overseas. Since the ending
of the Cold War, there has been a marked
shift in the balance between civil and defence-
related R & D, reflected, for example, in a
reduction in real terms in aerospace R & D.
According to reports by listed British
companies, there was a rise of 4 per cent in
investment in R & D in 1994-95, continuing
a five-year upward trend. The chemistry and
biotechnology-based sectors—chemicals,
pharmaceuticals and health care—continue to
grow in importance, accounting for 40 per
cent of R & D spending by listed companies.
Three of the four companies with the largest
investment in R & D—Glaxo Wellcome,
SmithKline Beecham and Zeneca—are in
these sectors (see Table 20.1). Electronics and
aerospace are also areas of R & D strength.
Some examples of recent notable R & D
projects in these areas are given below.
Chemicals
Research carried out by the chemicals
industry over the past few years has led to
significant technological and commercial
breakthroughs. ICI (now Zeneca) pioneered
the microbial production of a biodegradable
plastic, Biopol, and is at the forefront of
global efforts to develop substitutes for
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs—see p. 373).
Pharmaceuticals is the most research
intensive sector of the chemicals industry.
British firms have been responsible for
discovering and developing 13 of the world’s
50 best-selling drugs (see p. 239). Research
conducted by ICI, Glaxo Wellcome,
SmithKline Beecham and Fisons led to the
development of the first successful beta
blockers, drugs used in the treatment of
cardiovascular conditions; semi-synthetic
penicillins; vaccines; and treatments for
cancer, asthma, migraine and arthritis.
Glaxo Wellcome is the world’s biggest
pharmaceutical company. Its new
£700 million research centre at Stevenage
(Hertfordshire) was officially opened in
April 1995.
Among a host of other research projects
are the application of biotechnology to
pharmaceuticals, disease resistant crops, new
forms of food, plant science, and the
development of advanced materials such as
engineering plastics. The biotechnology sector
continues to grow, with an increasing number
of companies engaged in the development
and manufacture of products using genetic
modification techniques.
Electronics
British firms and research organisations, with
government support, are leading in the
development and application of the family of
‘three-five’ semiconductor materials (such as
gallium arsenide). These materials have a
wide variety of uses including lasers for
optical fibre communications, microwave
devices for satellite communications, and
high efficiency solar cells.
BT (British Telecom) is in the forefront of
the development of optical fibre cable and
developed the first all-optical repeater. Britain
317
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
also has a world lead in the transmission of
computerised data along telephone lines for
reproduction on television screens. Up to 800
R & D projects are carried out by BT at any
one time; a recent example is the
development of a video handset with an
optical telephone link. Around two-thirds of
its research is in software engineering.
Aerospace
Britain has led the world in many aspects of
aerospace R & D over the past 80 years.
Pioneering achievements include radar, jet
engines, Concorde, automatic landing,
vertical take-off and landing, flight
simulators and ejector seats. British
Aerospace, with Marconi and Dowty Boulton
Paul, developed a system known as ‘fly-by-
wire’, in which flying control surfaces are
moved by electronic rather than mechanical
means. GEC developed the world’s first
optically signalled (‘fly-by-light’) system. The
concept of head-up display (HUD) was
pioneered and developed in Britain. This
system electronically projects symbols into
the pilot’s view, avoiding the need to look
down at instruments. GEC has also
developed a holographic HUD, which enables
pilots to fly at high speeds at very low
altitude in darkness.
GOVERNMENT ROLE
Science and technology issues are the
responsibility of a Cabinet Minister, the
President of the Board of Trade, acting on
behalf of the Prime Minister. The Minister is
supported by the Office of Science and
Technology (OST)—which became part of
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
in 1995; the OST is headed by the
Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser. The
OST provides a central focus for the
development of government policy on science
and technology, both nationally and
internationally, including strengthening the
science base and maximising its contribution
to economic performance and the quality of
life. It co-ordinates science and technology
policy across government departments.
The term ‘science and engineering base’ is
used to describe the research and
postgraduate training capacity based in the
universities and colleges of higher education
and in establishments operated by the
research councils, together with the national
and international central facilities (such as
CERN—see p. 333) supported by the
councils and available for use by British
scientists and engineers. There are also
important contributions from some private
institutions, mainly those funded by charities.
Universities and other institutions of the
science and engineering base are the main
providers of basic research and much of the
strategic research (research likely to become
applicable) carried out in Britain. They also
increasingly collaborate with the private
sector in the conduct of specific applied
research. Nearly two-thirds of the
Government’s spending on civil R & D
supports basic and strategic research carried
out in the science and engineering base.
The OST has specific responsibility for
the Science Budget and seven government-
financed research councils (see pp. 321-5):
the Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC), the Medical
Research Council (MRC), the Particle
Physics and Astronomy Research Council
(PPARC), the Natural Environment Research
Council (NERC), the Biotechnology and
Biological Sciences Research Council
(BBSRC), the Economic and Social Research
Council (ESRC) and the Council for the
Central Laboratory of the Research Councils
(CCLRC). OST funding provides assistance
for research, through the research councils, in
the following ways:
• awarding grants and contracts to
universities and other higher education
establishments and to research units;
• funding research council establishments;
• supporting postgraduate study; and
• subscribing to international scientific
organisations.
The OST also supports universities
(whose main source of funding is the
appropriate higher education funding council)
through programmes administered through
the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of
Engineering (see p. 331).

Finance
Government finance for R & D goes to research
establishments, higher education institutions
and private industry, as well as collaborative
research programmes. Total net government
R & D expenditure (both civil and defence)
in 1994-95 was £5,853 million, of which
£3,068 million was devoted to civil science.
The Science Budget (see Table 20.2) totals
£1,281.7 million for 1995-96; £67 million, or
about 5 per cent of the total, is allocated to
priority initiatives designed to advance the
Government’s policy on science, engineering
and technology. Government funding
through the Science Budget has increased by
over 30 per cent in real terms since 1979-80.
Among government departments, the
Ministry of Defence (MoD—see p. 326) has
the largest research budget. The main civil
departments involved are the Department of
Trade and Industry (see p. 325), the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF—
see p. 327) and the Department of the
Environment (see p. 327).
Strategy
A number of changes in the funding and
organisation of British science and technology
are being implemented. They are based on
the principles set out in the White Paper,
Realising Our Potential: A Strategy for
Science, Engineering and Technology, published
in 1993 and the first major review of science
for over 20 years.
The White Paper aimed to create a closer
partnership between government, industry
and the scientific community in developing
strengths in areas of importance to the future
economic well-being of Britain. In particular,
it established the Technology Foresight
Programme to identify opportunities for the
public and private sectors to work together in
R & D projects with commercial potential
over the next 15 to 20 years.
The programme is co-ordinated by a joint
industry/academic steering group under the
chairmanship of the Government’s Chief
Scientific Adviser. Following consultation
with over 10,000 organisations and
individuals, reports by 15 independent
Technology Foresight panels on different
business sectors were published in March and
April 1995. Each report contains
recommendations which are being pursued as
the programme moves forward.
The steering group also identified six cross-
sectoral themes or priority areas, including:
• communications and computing power
(with applications in all economic
sectors);
• new organisms, products and processes
from genetics (with applications in
health, agriculture, food and
environmental protection);
• materials science, engineering and
technology;
• production processes and services;
• pollution monitoring and control
technologies, and technologies for
conserving energy and other resources; and
• social trends (improving understanding of
human factors involved in markets and
scientific advance).
The findings of the Foresight reports
and the steering group report are being
disseminated widely to achieve the
following aims:
• ensuring that scientific excellence is
sustained;
• increasing collaboration between industry
and academic institutions in areas of
economic importance by building on the
links generated in the initial consultation;
319
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• influencing government priorities in
science, engineering and technology
programmes and in government
regulation and training responsibilities;
• guiding future priorities where support
from academic institutions would be most
helpful; and
• helping industry to develop more informed
business and investment strategies.
Government departments, the universities
and higher education funding councils, and
the research councils will be expected to
reflect Foresight priorities in their research
spending allocations. The private sector will
be encouraged to take account of the
priorities both in participating in collaborative
research programmes and in strategic planning.
The Government is providing £40 million
for a competitive Foresight Challenge, with
industry and academics invited to propose
collaborative R & D projects in areas
identified by the Foresight reports. The
awards will be matched by equivalent funding
from industry. Other measures intended to
encourage research and training in
economically significant disciplines were
announced during 1995. These included an
expansion of the Realising Our Potential
Award (ROPA) scheme, which focuses on
researchers already working closely with
industry and provides funding for separate
‘curiosity-driven’ research. Further sums were
also made available to research councils to
expand the Co-operative Awards in Science
and Engineering (CASE) scheme, which
funds students carrying out work relevant to
the needs of industry. A pilot industry-led
CASE scheme involving 120 student awards
was launched in 1994 and will be extended
in future years.
LINK
The LINK scheme provides a government¬
wide framework for collaborative research in
support of wealth creation and improvement
of the quality of life. LINK aims to promote
partnerships in high quality, commercially
relevant research projects between industry
and higher education institutions and other
research base organisations. Under the
scheme, government departments and
research councils fund up to 50 per cent of
the cost of research projects, with industry
providing the balance. LINK is now
operating through 43 programmes. More than
570 projects worth over £300 million have
been started, involving over 800 companies
and 130 research base institutions. The
Government relaunched LINK in March
1995, following a review which recommended
improvements to make the scheme more
flexible and effective in responding to the
needs of industry and the research base.
LINK will be an important mechanism for
implementing collaborative research
programmes arising from the Technology
Foresight Programme.
Forward Look
The second Forward Look of government-
financed science, engineering and technology
was published in May 1995. The purpose of
the Forward Look is to set out the
Government’s strategy for science, engineering
and technology, taking into account the
activities of the private sector and European
and other international developments. It also
reports on progress in implementing the 1993
White Paper’s objectives.
Public Awareness Campaign
A major policy initiative in the White Paper
was the announcement of a campaign to
promote the public awareness of science,
engineering and technology. This seeks to:
• increase public awareness and
appreciation of the contribution that
science, engineering and technology make
to Britain’s economic wealth and quality
of life; and
• raise levels of understanding of scientific
terms, concepts and issues, so that
public debate on controversial
scientific and technological issues
becomes better informed.
In implementing the campaign, the
Government supports a number of
programmes and events, such as the British
Association’s annual science festival and the
320
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
National Science, Engineering and
Technology Week. The second of these
weeks, held in March 1995, consisted of over
1,100 events in all parts of Britain attended
by more than 600,000 people.
Women in Science, Engineering and
Technology
A Development Unit was established in the
OST in 1994 to promote the role of women
in science, engineering and technology. It was
! set up in response to an independent report
which found that women were under¬
represented in these sectors, and that there
were too few women at senior levels; many
women drop out of a science career after
completing a PhD. OST funding of 12 Royal
Society Dorothy Hodgkin fellowships is
designed to help retain some of the best
women in science.
RESEARCH COUNCILS
Each research council is an autonomous body
established under Royal Charter, with
members of its governing council drawn from
the universities, professions, industry and
government. Councils support research, study
and training in universities and other higher
education institutions, through their own
institutes, and international research centres.
In addition to funding from the OST, the
research councils receive income for research
commissioned by government departments
and from the private sector. Income from
commissioned research is particularly
important for the BBSRC and NERC.
Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council
The EPSRC, the research council with the
largest R & D budget—over £341 million in
1995-96—has responsibility both for
sustaining particular disciplines (chemistry,
mathematics, physics and all branches of
engineering) and for developing close links
with the industries underpinned by these
disciplines. The physical sciences and
engineering are a vital foundation for wealth
creation.
1 he work of the EPSRC is divided into
14 programmes supporting research into core
disciplines in the physical sciences and
engineering, and in ‘generic technologies’.
These generic technologies and various
sector-based initiatives are relevant to a wide
range of industrial activities. Many of the
generic technologies were a key concern of
the Technology Foresight panels. The work
includes projects on information technology
and computing science, engineering materials
and design, and integrated production.
The EPSRC has the major responsibility
for a programme aimed at encouraging
innovative business processes and technology
in manufacturing industry. Working in
collaboration with the ESRC, BBSRC,
government departments and industry, the
Innovative Manufacturing Initiative focuses
on specific sectors of industry. The first four
sector targets are aerospace, construction,
land transport and process industries.
The Council’s environmental interests
include its clean technology programme, in
co-operation with the DTI, the Department
of the Environment, the BBSRC and ESRC.
The programme aims to find ways of
forestalling pollution in industrial processes
rather than removing it at the ‘end of the
pipe’. Priority areas include cleaner synthesis,
recycling and recovery, and sustainable cities.
The EPSRC is also engaged in:
• supporting training in core disciplines at
higher education institutions (involving
some 8,000 students) and in encouraging
technology transfer through collaboration
with universities and industrial
companies (for example, through the
Teaching Company Scheme—see p. 326);
• providing access for British researchers to
high quality national and international
facilities; and
• managing high performance computer
facilities for use by all the research
councils.
Medical Research Council
The MRC, with an R & D budget of
£277 million in 1995-96, is the main
government agency supporting medical
321
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
research. It promotes and supports research
and training aimed at maintaining and
improving human health, advancing knowledge
and technology, and providing well-trained
staff to meet the needs of user communities,
including the providers of health care and the
biotechnology, food, health care, medical
instrumentation, pharmaceutical and other
biomedical-related industries.
Immunology is one of the fastest
growing areas of the biomedical
sciences. Fundamental studies on the
body’s response to infection will provide
a better basis for future prevention and
treatment of a range of diseases. A new
centre to carry out this work is being set
up as a joint venture between the MRC,
BBSRC, the Department of Health and
Glaxo Wellcome. Based at the Institute
of Animal Health, Compton (Berkshire),
it will be named the Edward Jenner
Institute for Vaccine Research, after the
physician who pioneered vaccination in
the 18th century.
About half the MRC’s expenditure is made
through its own institutes and units, which have
close links with universities and medical schools,
the rest going mainly on grant support of
research in universities. The Council has three
large institutes—the National Institute for
Medical Research at Mill Hill in London, the
Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge
and the Clinical Sciences Centre at the Royal
Postgraduate Medical School, London. It has
40 research units and a number of smaller
teams, and funds about 1,500 research grants.
Areas in which the MRC is conducting
research include:
• Molecules and cells, and inheritance and
development—work which will help in
identifying novel pharmaceuticals and in
the detection, prevention and treatment
of genetic diseases.
• Infections and immunity—these areas
include work on developing new vaccines
and identifying novel targets for antiviral
chemotherapy. The Council has a major
research programme on HIV infection
and AIDS.
• Environmental health—to determine the
health impact of particular environmental
hazards.
• Cancer—to increase understanding of
tumour biology, develop methods of
detecting cancer, identify preventive
strategies, and develop and evaluate
better methods of early detection and
treatment. The MRC’s work
complements that of the medical research
charities and involves important
international collaboration.
• Neurosciences and mental health—
research aimed at improving
understanding of the central nervous
system. A wide range of mental diseases,
including psychoses, dementia and
addiction, are studied, and the work
should lead to better methods for their
diagnosis, prevention and treatment.
• Systems-oriented research—this concerns
main body systems, particularly
cardiovascular studies, haematology,
respiratory disease, reproduction, calcium
metabolism and bone disorders,
rheumatology, dental research, nutrition
and metabolism.
• Health services and public health
research—the Council works with the
government health departments, the
National Health Service (NHS) and
ESRC on research to examine and
improve the effectiveness of medical
practice and health care.
Particle Physics and Astronomy
Research Council
The main task of the PPARC, with an R & D
budget of £196 million in 1995-96, is to
sustain and develop Britain’s long tradition of
excellence in research into fundamental
physical processes. The PPARC maintains
four research establishments: the Royal
Greenwich Observatory at Cambridge, the
Royal Observatory at Edinburgh and overseas
observatories on La Palma in the Canary
Islands and on Hawaii. The PPARC is a
major source of funding for many leading
university physics departments in Britain.
322
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
The PPARC supports research in three
main areas:
• particle physics—theoretical and
experimental research into elementary
particles and the fundamental forces of
nature;
• astronomy (including astrophysics and
cosmology)—studying the origin, structure
and evolution of the universe, and the
life cycle and properties of stars; and
• planetary science (including solar
terrestrial physics)—studying the origin
and evolution of the solar system and the
influence of the Sun on planetary bodies,
particularly Earth.
The Council’s work is in fields where
international co-operation is particularly
important: substantial contributions are
made by it to the European Space Agency
(ESA) and the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics (CERN—see p. 333), where
the proposed Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
will become a major research interest.
Approval to go ahead with the project was
reached in 1994 and the facility will be
completed by 2008.
Current theories on the forces
controlling the universe do not
adequately explain how matter gets
its mass. Following the decision to
build the Large Hadron Collider, this
and other outstanding questions may
be answered. The facility will enable
elemental particles to be smashed
together at greater energies than have
been achieved before. Physicists will
look for evidence of the existence of a
theoretical particle which they believe
gives other particles their mass—the
Higgs boson, named after Professor
Peter Higgs of Edinburgh University.
including agriculture, pharmaceuticals,
chemicals and food.
Research at the Babraham Institute
near Cambridge has led to the
production of the world’s first calves
of predetermined sex. The technique
for separating sperm into fractions
which produce male and female
calves was developed in collaboration
with scientists in the United States
and the British biotechnology
company, Animal Biotechnology
Cambridge. It uses a process known
as flow cytometry and exploits the
fact that ‘female’ sperm carrying the
X chromosome contain 4 per cent
more DNA than ‘male’ sperm
carrying the Y chromosome. The
method has important implications
for the economics of the beef and
dairy industries.
The Council operates programmes in both
fundamental and strategic research. The
scientific themes are biomolecular sciences, in
conjunction with the EPSRC; genes and
developmental biology; biochemistry and cell
biology; plant and microbial sciences; animal
sciences and psychology; and engineering and
physical sciences. The Council funds
directed programmes on agricultural
systems, on chemicals and pharmaceuticals,
and on food. Research is supported in
eight institutes sponsored by the BBSRC, in
four interdisciplinary research centres and
in universities.
BBSRC has an important role in training
scientists and engineers; it has over 2,000
research studentships, including 600 funded
through the CASE and industry-led CASE
schemes (see p. 320), as well as an expanding
postdoctoral fellowship scheme.
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council
The BBSRC, with an R & D budget of
£161 million in 1995-96, sustains a broad
base of interdisciplinary research and training
to underpin the biology-based industries
Natural Environment Research Council
In 1995-96 NERC will spend £196 million
on R & D in the following areas:
• management of land, water and the
coastal zone, and the identification and
sustainable exploitation of land,
freshwater and marine-based resources;
323
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• understanding and protecting
biodiversity;
• waste management, biological treatment
of pollution, and land restoration;
• pollution of air, land, sea and freshwater
in relation to environmental and human
health;
• environmental risks and hazards,
including the release of genetically-
modified organisms and improved
prediction of future events; and
• global change, including prediction on a
range of time and space scales.
The Council supports research in its own
establishments as well as research and training
in universities. It also provides a range of
facilities for use by the environmental science
community, including a marine research fleet.
NERC establishments include the British
Geological Survey, the British Antarctic
Survey, the Centre for Coastal Marine Sciences
and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,
together with university-based units.
A new national centre for oceanographic
science and technology, the Southampton
Oceanography Centre, was opened in 1995. It
is a national focus for research, training and
support in oceanography, geology and aspects
of marine technology and engineering. The
Centre is a joint venture with Southampton
University and incorporates the former
NERC Institute of Oceanographic Sciences
Deacon Laboratory, as well as some
departments of the university.
NERC has a substantial income from
commissioned research—about £40 million a
year—and its staff provide a range of
expert services. Many NERC programmes
have important implications for
environmental conservation.
A comprehensive geological survey of
Britain’s inner continental shelf, undertaken
by the British Geological Survey, has yielded
a detailed picture of the area and associated
natural resources. Britain is the first country
to have completely mapped its offshore area
in this way.
Economic and Social Research Council
ESRC, with an R & D provision of
£63 million for 1995-96, supports research to
increase understanding of social and economic
change in order to enhance economic
competitiveness and the quality of life, and to
contribute to the effectiveness of public
services and policy. All research funded by
ESRC is conducted in higher education
institutions or independent research
institutes. The main areas for the Council’s
research are economic performance,
environmental change, social cohesion,
government and public service, health and
welfare, and human development and learning.
The Council devotes a substantial part of
its expenditure to training that will develop
and maintain a first-class research base in the
social sciences. Over 1,000 postgraduate
students are supported through research
training awards, advanced course awards and
fellowships. Through its participation in the
Teaching Company Scheme, ESRC promotes
partnerships between social scientists and
business by placing graduates in companies
for short-term projects.
Council for the Central Laboratory of
the Research Councils
The CCLRC was established as an
independent body with effect from April
1995. It promotes scientific and engineering
research by providing facilities and technical
expertise to meet the needs of the other
research councils and their user communities.
Among its facilities, the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory has the most
powerful laser devoted to civil
research in Europe—Vulcan—which is
capable of simulating conditions
inside stars. Its ISIS facility is the
world’s most powerful pulsed source
of neutrons and muons, and is used
by about 2,000 scientists from over 20
countries to investigate the
microscopic properties of materials.
The Daresbury Laboratory’s facilities
include the Synchrotron Radiation
Source, which generates intense
beams of electromagnetic radiation
for the study of materials.
324
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
The CCLRC is responsible for two
research establishments which were formerly
part of the EPSRC: the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory at Chilton in Oxfordshire and the
Daresbury Laboratory near Warrington in
Cheshire. These centres provide facilities too
large or complex to be housed by individual
academic institutions. They also undertake
contract and collaborative research with
industry and other research organisations,
both in Britain and overseas.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Department of Trade and Industry
Activities
Although most industrial research and
development is financed by industry, the
DTI gives assistance where there is a sound
case for doing so. In 1994-95 its net
expenditure on R & D was estimated at £248
million, covering general industrial
innovation, aeronautics, space (see p. 328),
nuclear and non-nuclear energy, and support
for statutory, regulatory and policy
responsibilities. A further £104 million was
allocated to technology transfer and related
activities, in particular:
• supporting technological opportunities
and potential partners, both in Britain
and overseas;
• continuing direct single-company support
to smaller firms under the SMART
competition and the SPUR scheme (see
p. 208) for the development of new
products and processes; and
• concentrating support from the DTEs
innovation budget for collaborative
industry R & D on those projects that will
result in exceptional economic benefits.
The DTI spent £27 million on non¬
nuclear energy research for the offshore oil
and gas industry, coal technology and
renewable energy sources in 1994-95.
Innovation
Innovation—the successful exploitation of
new ideas—is vital in maintaining an
economy based on competitive wealth
creation. Through its Innovation Unit, which
includes 20 seconded industrialists, the DTI
seeks to influence the thinking of business,
education, the media and government, as well
as the public, in various ways such as:
• strengthening the partnership between
government and industry;
• improving commercial exploitation of
Britain’s science and technology base;
• facilitating exchange of technology
between business sectors;
• improving communications between
investors and business regarding
innovation; and
• encouraging a more positive public
attitude to innovation, as well as to
science and technology.
In Northern Ireland the Industrial
Research and Technology Unit has a similar
role to that of the DTPs Innovation Unit.
The DTPs industrial innovation
programmes have shifted away from
supporting technology generation towards
concentrating on the exploitation and transfer
of technology and the promotion of
innovation. In particular, the DTI is:
• improving companies’ access to local
innovation services through Business
Links (see p. 208);
• encouraging industry to collaborate with
the science base in R & D projects under
the LINK scheme (see p. 320);
• putting more effort into helping firms
of all sizes work together to undertake
R & D projects, including those under
the EUREKA initiative (see p. 333); and
• facilitating companies’ access to best
practice and technology from overseas
and helping companies, especially small
and medium-sized concerns, to identify
technological opportunities and potential
partners, both in Britain and overseas.
Technology Transfer
The DTI is significantly improving
companies’ access to science and technology
by making innovation services available
locally, for example through Business Links.
325
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Many local innovation networks already exist
which bring together expertise in higher
education institutions, technical colleges,
industrial research organisations and other
bodies. The DTI intends to build on these
networks and improve access to them for
small and medium-sized establishments.
Academic—Business Partnerships
The Government supports the transfer of
knowledge, skills and technology through
partnerships between universities and business.
The Teaching Company Scheme (TCS)
enables young graduates to work in industry
for two years on technology transfer projects
under the joint supervision of academic and
company staff. There are currently over 500
TCS programmes. In addition, new Teaching
Company Scheme Centres for Small Firms
have been opened at selected universities to
help smaller businesses obtain easier access to
universities.
The Postgraduate Training Partnership
scheme enables postgraduates to undertake
practical research in research and technology
organisations under the joint guidance of
academics and industrialists. The aim is to
increase the number of people with PhDs
possessing the skills and experience needed
by industry.
The DTI partly funds another partnership
scheme, the Shell Technology Enterprise
Programme for undergraduates, which aims
to encourage smaller firms to employ
graduates while persuading undergraduates to
consider careers in small firms. In 1996 about
1,200 undergraduates will spend eight weeks
during their final summer holiday working on
a technology-based project identified by their
host company.
Aeronautics
The DTFs Civil Aircraft Research and
Demonstration Programme (CARAD) supports
research and technology demonstration in the
aircraft and aero-engine industry, helping it
to compete effectively in world markets. The
programme is part of a national aeronautics
research effort, with over half of the research
work supported being conducted in industry
and the universities, and the remainder at the
Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (see
p. 327). Priority areas are aircraft exhaust
emissions, advanced materials, and safety
problems such as explosion hazards. In 1995-96
the provision for aeronautics is £19.7 million.
Launch Aid is a means of providing
government assistance for specific
development projects in the aerospace
industry. Projects supported have included
British Aerospace’s contribution to three
types of Airbus aircraft, the Rolls-Royce
RB-211 and International Aero Engine
V2500 engines and the civil version of the
EH101 helicopter.
Industrial Research Establishments
The DTI acts as the main customer, on
behalf of industry, for the development of
new measurement standards under the
National Measurement System (NMS—see
p. 206) and materials metrology programmes.
Most of the work of the National Physical
Laboratory (NPL) is in support of these
programmes; part of the work of the
Laboratory of the Government Chemist
(LGC) and the National Engineering
Laboratory (NEL) also supports the NMS.
In common with other departments, the
DTI has reviewed the future of its
laboratories, having previously established
them as executive agencies. In 1994 the
Government decided that their future would
be in the private sector. In July 1995 a
private sector contractor was appointed to
run the NPL for five years; the NEL was
sold to a private sector firm in October 1995;
and the LGC is to be established as an
independent non-profit-making private sector
company by the end of 1995-96.
Ministry of Defence
Ministry of Defence provision for R & D
in 1995-96 is £2,460 million. About
£663 million of this is for medium- and
long-term applied research relevant to
military needs. With the ending of the Cold
War, the Government is committed to
achieving a gradual reduction in real terms
in spending on defence R & D.
326
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
In April 1995 the MoD’s Defence
Research Agency was enlarged with the
addition of most of the Ministry’s other
non-nuclear science and technology
establishments to form the Defence
Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA),
the largest single scientific employer in
Britain. Its role is to supply scientific and
technical services primarily to the Ministry
but also to other government departments.
The DERA subcontracts research to
industry and universities, ensuring that their
know-how is harnessed to meeting military
requirements. It also works closely with
industry in order to see that scientific and
technological advances are taken forward at
an early stage into development and
production. This technology transfer is not
just confined to the defence industry but has
also led to important ‘spin offs’ into civil
markets, in fields ranging from new materials
and electronic devices to advanced
aerodynamics. The latter in particular has
been instrumental in giving Britain a leading
role in civil aircraft design.
Recent innovations include the
development of an advanced composite rotor
for the Lynx helicopter; and the invention of
a special form of highly porous silicon, which
can be made to emit light when irradiated
with ultra-violet light, opening up the
technology of silicon opto-microelectronics.
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food
MAFF co-ordinates its research programme
with The Scottish Office Agriculture and
Fisheries Department, the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland and the
research councils, particularly the BBSRC (see
p. 323). It also covers the research interests
of the Welsh Office Agriculture Department.
The research programme reflects the
Ministry’s wide-ranging responsibilities for
protecting and enhancing the rural and
marine environment; protecting the public,
especially in food safety and quality, flooding
and coastal defence, and animal health and
welfare; and improving the economic
performance of the agriculture, fishing and
food industries.
The budget for research expenditure in
1995-96 is £140 million, including support
for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (see
p. 332). Research is contracted increasingly
through open competition with research
councils, the Ministry’s agencies,
non-departmental public bodies, higher
education institutions and other organisations.
The need to avoid overproduction of
food crops and put the land set aside
to good use has led MAFF to initiate
a major research programme in non¬
food areas. Research in the use of
crops to generate energy and
industrial raw materials is under way
and new work is planned on novel
fibres, pharmaceuticals and oils.
Department of the Environment
The Department of the Environment funds
research in several policy areas: environmental
protection, including radioactive substances;
water; the countryside; planning and inner
cities; local government; housing; building and
construction; and energy efficiency. The three
largest programmes are those on pollution-
related climate change, regional and urban air
quality, and the safe disposal of radioactive
waste. Total research expenditure in 1995-96
is estimated at £97 million.
Department of Health
The Department of Health has developed an
R & D programme for the National Health
Service (NHS) which will provide a scientific
basis for health promotion and health care. A
key aim is to increase the effectiveness of the
NHS by creating a sound base from which
strategies in health care, operational policy
and management can be defined and practice
improved. The Department also manages a
Health and Personal Social Service research
programme concerned with the needs of
ministers and policy-makers, with emphasis
on improved efficiency. Total research
expenditure in 1995-96 is estimated at
£74 million, with a further £413 million
likely to be spent by the NHS.
327
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
New arrangements to identify and
distribute funds for R & D carried out in the
Department, in NHS hospitals and by
non-departmental public bodies are due to be
introduced from April 1996. The funds will
be allocated through a single R & D budget,
administered by a central R & D committee.
Overseas Development Administration
The Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) commissions and sponsors research on
topics relevant to those geographical regions
designated as the primary targets of the aid
programme and of benefit to the poorest
people in those countries. Provision for
R & D in 1995-96 is £83 million.
The ODA’s support for R & D is
organised into five main programmes,
covering renewable natural resources;
engineering-related sectors (water and
sanitation, energy efficiency and geoscience,
urbanisation and transport); health and
population; economic and social development;
and education.
R & D is also carried out as part of
Britain’s bilateral aid to particular countries.
It draws upon a range of professional
expertise in agencies such as the Transport
Research Laboratory, the British Geological
Survey and the Institute of Hydrology. The
ODA contributes towards international
centres and programmes undertaking R & D
aimed at solving problems faced by
developing countries. It also contributes to
science and technology through the European
Union. The EU’s Science and Technology
for Development programme seeks to
stimulate simultaneous study in various
parts of the world of specific scientific issues
in health, nutrition and agriculture, which can
then contribute to progress in all developing
countries.
The Scottish Office
The Scottish Office both contracts and itself
undertakes a wide range of R & D
commissions. Total R & D planned
expenditure in 1995-96 is £77 million in
support of its policy responsibilities,
especially agriculture, fisheries, health, the
environment, education and home affairs. In
some areas—medicine, agriculture and
biological sciences, fisheries and marine
science—research in Scotland has an
international reputation.
Space Activities
Britain’s support for civil space research is
co-ordinated by the British National Space
Centre (BNSC), a partnership between
government departments and research
councils. BNSC encourages the
competitiveness of the space industry and the
exploitation of opportunities in space, based
on appraisal of project costs and potential
technological and commercial benefits.
Through BNSC, Britain spent around £194
million on space activities in 1994—95, with
funding mainly from the DTI, the research
councils, the Department of the Environment
and the Meteorological Office. Around two-
thirds of Britain’s space expenditure was
devoted to programmes shared with the
European Space Agency (ESA). The
remainder supported a programme of R & D
in higher education institutions, government
establishments and industry; over 400
companies and other organisations are
engaged in the space industry (see p. 244).
Around half of Britain’s space programme
is concerned with satellite-based Earth
observation (remote sensing) for commercial
and environmental applications. Britain has
committed around £115 million to ESA’s
ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites, which were
launched in 1991 and April 1995 respectively.
It provided two of the instruments on both
satellites: a synthetic aperture radar and an
along track scanning radiometer (ATSR).
The radar is capable of supplying high
resolution images of the Earth with 24-hour
coverage, irrespective of cloud cover
conditions. The ATSR measures global sea
surface temperature to a very high degree of
accuracy. British remote sensing instruments
are also at work on a number of other satellites.
The Earth Observation Data Centre at
Farnborough (Hampshire), operated by the
National Remote Sensing Centre, is one of
the ESA’s four main processing and
archiving facilities for storing and
328
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
distributing ERS data for both scientific and
commercial purposes.
Britain is also contributing ^284 million to
an important new Earth observation mission
due to be launched in 1998 and known as
ENVISAT-1. ENVISAT, carrying a new
generation of ESA environmental
instruments, including a new radar, will fly
on the British-led Polar Platform. Britain is
leading the development of ENVISAT’s
advanced radar, and an advanced version of
the precision instrument that measures infra¬
red emissions over land and sea.
Britain has a world class reputation for its
space science, and has to date participated in
all ESA’s science missions. A quarter of
Britain’s space budget is devoted to science,
including astronomy, planetary science and
geophysics. Science contributions have been
made to missions ranging from the Hubble
Space Telescope, for which British Aerospace
built the solar panels, to the Ulysses solar
space probe, which was the first spacecraft to
overfly the poles of the sun (the south solar
pole in 1994 and the north late in 1995).
Britain is contributing substantially to the
joint ESA-National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) Cluster and SOHO
missions to study the Sun, the Earth’s
magnetosphere and the solar wind, and to the
Infrared Space Observatory, all due to be
launched in 1996. It is also participating in
the ESA’s X-ray spectroscopy mission, due to
be launched in 1999.
British-built instruments will play a
important role in a project designed
to help explain how life started on
Earth. They will be aboard the
Cassini-Huygens mission to be
launched by the ESA and NASA in
1997. The mission will land a probe
on Titan, Saturn’s largest moon and
the only satellite with an atmosphere.
It is thought that conditions on Titan
resemble those which existed on Earth
before life began.
There are bilateral agreements for
scientific research between Britain and other
countries, such as the United States through
NASA, Russia through the Russian Space
Agency, and Japan. British groups have been
engaged in developing, for example, the
widefield camera for ROSAT (the German,
British and US X-ray satellite), a
spectrometer for the Japanese-built Yohkoh
satellite, and an X-ray telescope for the
Russian Spectrum-X mission.
Britain actively supports and provides
international co-ordination for research into
space debris.
A major area of British space expertise is
satellite communications. In Europe, Britain
is both a leading producer and user of
satellite communications technology (see
p. 242). It is contributing to preparations for
future ESA satellite communications
missions, including ARTEMIS, which will
provide important communications links for
the ENVISAT programme.
RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS
The higher education funding councils in
England, Scotland and Wales (see p. 444) are
the largest single source of finance for
universities and other higher education
institutions in Great Britain. About 40 per
cent of research carried out in higher
education institutions is financed from
resources allocated by these bodies. These
funds pay for the salaries of permanent
academic staff, who usually teach as well as
undertake research, and contribute to the
infrastructure for research. In Northern
Ireland academic institutions are funded by
the Department of Education for Northern
Ireland. The quality of research performance
of departments is a key element in the
allocation of funding. Every four years the
funding councils carry out a research
assessment exercise to measure the quality of
research in each subject across all higher
education institutions in Britain. The next
assessment will take place in 1996.
The research councils also support R & D
in higher education institutions in two main
ways. First, they provide awards to about
15,000 postgraduate students in science,
social sciences, engineering and technology.
Secondly, they give grants and contracts to
institutions for projects, particularly in new
329
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
or developing areas of research, and support
units and facilities for research. The research
councils have become responsible for meeting
all the costs of the projects they support in
higher education institutions, except for the
costs associated with the salaries of permanent
academic staff and the costs of premises and
central computing.
The other main channels of support for
scientific research in higher education
institutions are charities, government
departments, industry and the European
Union. Institutions are expected to recover
the full cost of short-term commissioned
research from the Government and industry.
The high quality of research in higher
education institutions, and their marketing
skills, have enabled them to attract more
funding from a larger range of external sources,
especially in contract income from industry.
Institutions undertaking research with the
support of research council grants have the
rights over the commercial exploitation of
their research, subject to the prior agreement
of the sponsoring research council. They may
make use of technology transfer experts and
other specialists such as BTG (see below) to
help to exploit and license commercially the
results of their research.
Science Parks
Science parks are partnerships between higher
education and industry to promote
commercially focused research and advanced
technology. At the end of 1994 there were 46
such parks in operation, generally at or near
universities. They are host to more than
1,200 companies and some of the larger parks
have in excess of 70 companies on site. Most
firms are engaged in work on computing,
robotics, electrical engineering, chemicals and
biotechnology. Research, development and
training are their most common activities,
rather than large-scale manufacturing. The
newest science park is the Staffordshire
Technology Park at Stafford, which opened
in May 1995. Another is planned at Dartford,
attached to the University of Greenwich.
A growing number of universities offer
industry interdisciplinary research centres
with exploitable resources. These include
access to analytical equipment, library
facilities and worldwide databases as well as
academic expertise.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Industrial Research and Technology
Organisations
Research and Technology Organisations
(RTOs) are independent organisations
carrying out commercially relevant research
and other services on behalf of industry,
often relating to a specific industrial sector.
Britain has the largest RTO sector in Europe,
consisting of around 70 organisations, which
together employ over 10,000 people.
Charitable Organisations
Medical research charities are a major source
of funds for biomedical research in Britain.
Their combined contribution in 1994-95 was
about £400 million. The three largest
contributors were the Wellcome Trust—the
world’s largest medical charity—with a
contribution of £149 million, the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund (£56.7 million) and
the Cancer Research Campaign (£45 million).
The Cancer Research Campaign opened
Britain’s largest multidisciplinary centre for
evaluating potential cancer treatments in May
1995 at the Institute of Cancer Research at
Sutton (Surrey).
BTG
The British Technology Group, privatised in
1992, has changed its name to BTG and was
floated on the London Stock Exchange in
July 1995. BTG is among the world’s leading
technology transfer companies. It identifies
commercially promising technology from
universities, research institutions and companies
worldwide; protects these technologies through
patents; negotiates licences with industrial
partners on a worldwide basis; and shares the
net revenues with the sources of the inventions.
BTG holds over 9,000 patents and patent
applications, covering 1,300 inventions with
470 current licence agreements. Its areas of
activity include pharmaceuticals, agribusiness,
330

BRITISH NEWSPAPER LIBRARY
The British Newspaper Library
in London is comprehensive from
the 1840s onwards, containing full
sets of the main London editions
of all national daily and Sunday
newspapers from the start of
publication until the present day.
The collections also contain many
items dating from well before
this period, as well as many
regional and overseas newspapers.
A journal dated 1846 is hand-sewn by a skilled craftswoman
in the Librarv’s binderv and conservation workshop.
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
automotive engineering, medical technology,
electronics and telecommunications.
Professional Institutions and
Learned Societies
There are numerous technical institutions
and professional associations in Britain, many
of which promote their own disciplines or
the education and professional well-being of
their members.
The Council of Science and Technology
Institutes has seven member institutes
representing biology, chemical engineering,
chemistry, food science and technology,
geology, hospital physics and physics.
The Engineering Council promotes the
study of all types of engineering in schools
and other organisations, in co-operation with
its 210 industry affiliates, which include large
private sector companies and government
departments. Together with 39 professional
engineering institutions, the Council accredits
courses in higher education institutions. It
also advises the Government on academic,
industrial and professional issues.
More than 300 learned societies play an
important role in advancing science and
technology through meetings, publications
and sponsorship.
Royal Society
The most prestigious learned society is the
Royal Society, founded in 1660. It has over
1,100 Fellows and more than 100 Foreign
Members. Many of its Fellows serve on
governmental advisory councils and
committees concerned with research. The
Society’s estimated net expenditure on
science and technology in 1995-96 is
£27 million. Almost 80 per cent of the
money which it distributes is derived from
the Government, the remainder coming from
private sources.
The Society encourages scientific research
and its application through a programme of
meetings and lectures, publications, and by
awarding grants, fellowships and other
funding. It recognises scientific and
technological achievements through election
to the Fellowship and the award of medals
and endowed lectureships. As the national
academy of sciences, it represents Britain in
international non-governmental organisations
and participates in a variety of international
scientific programmes. It also facilitates
collaborative projects and the exchange of
scientists through bilateral agreements with
academies and research councils throughout
the world. It gives independent advice on
scientific matters, notably to government, and
represents and supports the scientific
community as a whole.
The Royal Society is increasingly active in
promoting scientific understanding and
awareness among the general public, as well
as science education. It also supports research
into the history of science.
Royal Academy of Engineering
The national academy of engineering in
Britain is the Royal Academy of Engineering,
founded in 1976. The Academy has 1,010
Fellows, 62 Foreign Members and 14
Honorary Fellows. It promotes excellence in
engineering for the benefit of society. In
1995-96 it is receiving a grant of £2.6 million
from the OST and plans to raise over
£6 million from other sources.
The Academy’s programmes are aimed at
attracting first-class students into engineering,
raising awareness of the importance of
engineering design among undergraduates,
developing links between industry and higher
education, and increasing industrial
investment in engineering research in higher
education institutions.
Other Societies
In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by
awarding scholarships, organising meetings
and symposia, publishing journals and
awarding prizes. It also administers fellowship
schemes for postdoctoral research workers.
Three other major institutions publicise
scientific developments by means of lectures
and publications for specialists and
schoolchildren. Of these, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science
(BAAS), founded in 1831, is mainly
331
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
concerned with science, while the Royal
Society of Arts, dating from 1754, deals with
the arts and commerce as well as science. The
Royal Institution, which was founded in 1799,
also performs these functions and runs its
own research laboratories.
The Committee on the Public
Understanding of Science (COPUS), set up
in 1986 by the Royal Society, the BAAS and
the Royal Institution, acts as a focus for a
wide-ranging programme to improve public
awareness of science and technology.
Zoological Gardens
The Zoological Society of London, an
independent scientific body founded in 1826,
runs London Zoo, which occupies about 15
hectares (36 acres) of Regent’s Park, London.
The Society is responsible for the Institute of
Zoology, which carries out research in support
of conservation. The Institute’s work covers a
broad range of topics, including ecology,
behaviour, reproductive biology and conservation
genetics. The Society also operates the
Conservation and Consultancy Division,
which is concerned with practical field
conservation, primarily in East and Southern
Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia.
Whipsnade Wild Animal Park near
Dunstable (Bedfordshire) is also managed by
the Society. Other well-known zoos include
those in Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley
and Marwell (near Winchester).
Botanic Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, founded in 1759,
covers 121 hectares (300 acres) at Kew in
west London and a 187-hectare (462-acre)
estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, in West
Sussex. They contain the largest collections of
living and dried plants in the world. Research
is conducted into all aspects of plant life,
including physiology, biochemistry, genetics,
economic botany and the conservation of
habitats and species. Kew has the world’s
most comprehensive seed bank for wild
species and is active in programmes to return
endangered plant species to the wild. It
participates in joint research programmes in
more than 50 countries.
The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh,
founded in 1670, is a centre for research into
taxonomy (classification of species), for the
conservation and study of living plants and
for horticultural education.
Scientific Museums
The Natural History Museum has 67 million
specimens, ranging from a blue whale
skeleton to minute insects. It is one of the
world’s principal centres for research into
natural history, offering an advisory service to
institutions all over the world.
The Science Museum promotes
understanding of the history of science,
technology, industry and medicine. Its
extensive collection of scientific instruments
and machinery is complemented by
interactive computer games and audio-visual
equipment for visitors to use. In this way, the
museum explains scientific principles to the
general public and documents the history of
science, from early discoveries to space age
technology. These two museums are in
South Kensington, London. Other important
collections include those at the Museum of
Science and Industry in Birmingham, the
Museum of Science and Industry in
Manchester, the Museum of the History of
Science in Oxford, and the Royal Scottish
Museum, Edinburgh.
Science Festivals
Science festivals are a growing feature of
local co-operative efforts to further
understanding of the contribution made by
science to everyday life. Schools, museums,
laboratories, higher education institutions
and industry contribute to a large range of
special events.
The oldest and most widely publicised
science festival is the British Association
Annual Festival of Science, held at a British
university. The BAAS is also involved in
organising the National Science, Engineering
and Technology Week (see p. 321). The
largest science festival in one place is the
annual Edinburgh international science
festival; in 1995 it included 350 events and
attracted about 180,000 visitors.
332
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION
Britain has a key role in a wide variety of'
major international scientific facilities and
research programmes.
European Union
Since 1984 the EU has run a series of
R & D framework programmes in several
strategic sectors, with the aim of
strengthening the scientific and technological
basis of European industry and improving its
international competitiveness.
The Fourth Framework Programme runs
from 1994 to 1998. It has a budget of 12,000
million ECUs (about £10,200 million) and
provides funds for international collaborative
research in fields such as biotechnology,
industrial materials and information
technology. Britain played a significant role
in shaping its structure and priorities. It also
helped secure agreement that the EU should
develop ‘generic’ technologies with a broad
range of industrial applications, rather than just
funding research projects to meet the needs
of specific industrial sectors. The EU has also
agreed that more resources should be devoted
to disseminating technology from research
projects to small and medium-sized enterprises.
Examples of the many EU research
activities involving British organisations
include the following programmes:
• Britain contributes to the EU Nuclear
Fusion Programme, part of the Fourth
Framework Programme, in particular by
supporting the British programme of
research into fusion undertaken at

• The EU’s Information Technology
Programme, also part of the Fourth
Framework Programme, is a shared cost
collaborative programme, designed to
help build the services and technologies
that underpin the information society.
The programme is open to companies,
academic institutions and research bodies.
Britain is currently participating in 369
projects in the programme.
Other International Activities
Over 600 British organisations have taken
part in EUREKA, an industry-led scheme to
encourage European co-operation in
developing and producing advanced
technology products with worldwide sales
potential. Britain is currently involved in 282
projects, including research into a high-
quality digital audio broadcasting system and
a sub-programme for helping the projection
of ideas with an environmental theme. There
are 25 members of EUREKA, including the 15
EU countries and the European Commission.
The COST (European Co-operation in the
field of Science and Technical research)
programme encourages co-operation in
national research activities across Europe,
with participants from industry, academia
and research laboratories. Transport,
telecommunications and materials have
traditionally been the largest areas supported.
New areas include physics, neuroscience and
forestry and forest products. There are
currently 25 member states and Britain
takes part in almost all of about 120 current
COST actions.
Other examples of international
collaboration include the European Space
Agency (see p. 328) and CERN, the
European Laboratory for Particle Physics,
based in Geneva. Scientific programmes at
CERN aim to test, verify and develop the
‘standard model’ of the origins and structure
of the universe. There are 19 member states.
Britain’s programme is co-ordinated through
the CCLRC and the subscription is paid by
the PPARC.
Contributions to the high-flux neutron
source at the Institut Laue-Langevin and the
European Synchrotron Radiation Facility,
both in Grenoble, are paid by the EPSRC.
The PPARC is a partner in the European
Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility within the
Arctic Circle, which conducts research on
the ionosphere.
Through the MRC, Britain participates in
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
(EMBL), based in Heidelberg, Germany.
Britain was chosen as the location for the
European Bioinformatics Institute, an
outstation of the EMBL. The Institute, based
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in Cambridge, provides up-to-date
information on molecular biology and genome
sequencing for researchers throughout
Europe. It became fully operational in 1995.
The MRC pays Britain’s contribution to
the Human Frontier Science programme,
which supports international collaborative
research into brain function and biological
function through molecular level approaches.
It also pays Britain’s subscription to the
International Agency for Cancer Research.
NERC has a major involvement in
international programmes of research into
global change organised through the World
Climate Research Programme and the
International Geosphere-Biosphere
Programme. NERC also supports Britain’s
subscription to the Ocean Drilling Program
and is involved in a wide range of other
international activities.
Britain is a member of the science and
technology committees of international
organisations such as the OECD and NATO,
and of various specialised agencies of the
United Nations. Among non-governmental
organisations, the research councils, the Royal
Society and the British Academy are
members of the European Science
Foundation, and a number of British
scientists are involved in its initiatives.
Staff in British Embassies and High
Commissions promote contacts in science,
engineering and technology between Britain
and overseas countries and help to inform a
large number of organisations in Britain
about science, engineering and technology
developments overseas. There are science
and technology sections in Paris, Bonn,
Washington, Tokyo and Moscow.
The British Council (see p. 134)
promotes better understanding and
knowledge of Britain and its scientific and
technological achievements. It encourages
exchange of specialists, supplies specialised
information, and fosters co-operation in
research, training and education. The Council
also identifies and manages technological,
scientific and educational projects in
developing countries. The research councils
maintain, with the British Council, a joint
office in Brussels to promote European co¬
operation in research.

Home ownership, choice in renting and the effective use of resources to
provide help where it is needed are key themes in the Government’s housing
policies. Strategies to enhance the urban and rural environments include
improvements to housing and diversification of tenure, along with measures
such as land preparation and development, job creation and training. A
Single Regeneration Budget funds regeneration programmes in England. A
total of £1,329 million will be spent from this in 1995-96, in addition to
funding for schemes outside this budget and regeneration programmes in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Housing
In all, 200,000 dwellings were completed in
Britain in 1994, a rise of 8 per cent on 1993.
Growth in owner-occupation has been
particularly marked, increasing from 50 per
cent in 1971 to 67 per cent at the start of
1995. Both public and private sectors build
housing, but most dwellings are built by the
private sector for sale to owner-occupiers.
Local authorities are encouraged to see their
housing role as more of an enabling one,
working with housing associations and the
private sector to increase the supply of low-
cost housing for sale or rent without
necessarily providing it themselves. Housing
associations are now the main providers of
new ‘social housing’. This allows local
authorities to concentrate their resources on
improving the management of their own
stock. To stimulate the private rented sector,
which has been declining for most of this
century, rents on new private sector lettings
in Great Britain were deregulated in 1988.
Since then, the sector has grown to about
10 per cent of households.
Administration
The Secretary of State for the Environment
in England and the Secretaries of State for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are
responsible for formulating housing policy
337
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and supervising the housing programme.
The construction or structural alteration of
housing is subject to building regulations laid
down by the Government. In addition,
warranty arrangements provided by the
National House-Building Council cover many
new houses. It sets standards and enforces
them by inspection, and provides cover against
major structural defects for at least ten years.
White Paper
In June 1995 the Government set out its
housing policies in a White Paper Our Future
Homes. Key features of the White Paper
include commitments to:
• a sustainable expansion in home
ownership, based on low interest rates,
economic stability and stable house
prices, with a new grant scheme to help
housing association tenants to buy their
own homes;
• a sustained revival in private renting,
based on a deregulated private rented
sector and the establishment of housing
investment trusts to encourage financial
institutions to invest;
• the creation of a new framework for social
rented housing with rents remaining
affordable to tenants in low-paid work, a
greater diversity of social landlords, more
transfers of local authority housing to new
landlords outside the public sector and
commercial providers allowed to compete
alongside housing associations for grants
to provide social housing;
• a fairer system for allocating social housing,
with the retention of a safety net for
families and vulnerable people who lose
their homes through no fault of their own
and further funding to ensure there is no
necessity for people to sleep rough; and
• a target to build half of all new homes on
re-used sites.
Home Ownership
The number of owner-occupied dwellings in
Great Britain amounted to 15.8 million at the
end of 1994, compared with 4.1 million in 1950.
Mortgage Loans
Most people buy their homes with a
mortgage loan, using the property as security.
Building societies are the largest source of
such loans, although banks and other
financial institutions also take a significant
share of the mortgage market, while some
companies make loans for house purchase
available to their employees. The amount that
lenders are prepared to advance to a would-
be house purchaser is generally calculated as
a multiple of his or her annual income,
typically up to two-and-a-half or three times
earnings, and the term of the loan is
commonly 25 years. Owner-occupiers get
tax relief on interest payments on mortgages
of up to £30,000 on their main home; from
April 1995 this has been assessed at 15 per
cent rather than at the basic 25 per cent
rate of income tax.
The recent recession and difficulties in the
housing market have meant that some
homeowners have experienced problems, seeing
a fall in the value of their homes or having
trouble keeping up with mortgage payments.
The Government’s policies to overcome
these problems are based on maintaining a
healthy economy, low interest rates and
stable house prices which help keep home
ownership affordable. Numbers of

repossessions in the first half of 1995 were
down 35 per cent from their 1991 peak.
Right to Buy and Low Cost Ownership
With a few exceptions, secure public tenants
in England and Wales of at least two years
standing are entitled to buy their house or
flat at a discount dependent upon the length
of the tenancy. Similar provisions apply in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. A total of 2.0
million council, housing association and New
Town houses were sold in Great Britain
between 1979-80 and 1994-95. Sales are
continuing at a rate of about 60,000 a year.
Other schemes to encourage low-cost
home ownership include cash grants to help
tenants of social housing become home
owners, shared ownership schemes and
discounted sales of empty properties owned
by local authorities. Scottish Homes has a
scheme to encourage private developers to
build for owner-occupation or market rents in
areas they would not normally consider. In
1995-96 planned investment in the scheme is
about £34 million. A shared ownership
scheme in Northern Ireland is administered by
the Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing
Association. Detailed guidance for local
authorities and housing associations on the
range of low-cost home ownership initiatives
available was issued in Wales in 1993.
Privately Rented Housing
The proportion of households renting from
private landlords declined to a low point of
8.6 per cent in the late 1980s, but has now
increased to 10.0 per cent. The
Government’s policy is to increase the
availability of privately rented
accommodation by removing disincentives to
letting. To accomplish this, from January
1989 new private sector lettings were
deregulated, and two new forms of tenancy
were introduced:

• the assured tenancy, which gives the
tenant long-term security in return for a
freely negotiated market rent; and
• the assured shorthold tenancy (short
assured tenancy in Scotland), which is for
a fixed term of at least six months, again
at a free market rent.
A ‘Rent a Room’ scheme encourages
homeowners to let rooms to lodgers without
having to pay tax on the rent they receive; rents
of up to about £62 a week are now tax-free.
New proposals for housing investment trusts,
announced in the Government’s Housing White
Paper, are aimed at increasing institutional
investment in private rented housing.
In Northern Ireland the private rented
sector accounts for approximately 5 per cent
of the total housing stock. Less than half of
this is subject to statutory control. Rent levels
of controlled properties are linked to those of
the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. The
only assured tenancies in Northern Ireland
are those on properties made available under
the former Business Expansion Scheme;
shorthold tenancies are available.
Social Housing
Social rented housing is housing provided at
rents affordable to people on low incomes,
usually substantially below market rents. It
accounts for over a fifth of homes. It is
usually either owned by local authorities or
by housing associations.
Public Housing
Most social housing in Great Britain is
provided by 455 local housing authorities.1
At present these are:
• district councils, in those parts of
England with two-tier local government;
• London borough councils, metropolitan
districts and unitary authorities, in areas
with single-tier local government; and
• district and islands councils in Scotland
and the district councils in Wales.
1 The reorganisation of local government in Great Britain
(see p. 72) will change these arrangements as new local
authorities take over in places.
340
HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Public housing is also provided by Scottish
Homes (which has a stock of about 53,000
houses) and the Development Board for Rural
Wales, although the latter is to transfer all its
1,200 houses to other social landlords by
April 1996. The Northern Ireland Housing
Executive is responsible for the provision and
management of public housing in Northern
Ireland. Public housing authorities in Great
Britain own about 4.6 million houses and
flats; the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
owns over 152,000 homes.
Since 1988, 41 local authorities have
transferred all their housing stock to housing
associations—involving approximately 185,000
properties—and others are considering doing
so. The transfer of local authority housing
stock has raised £2,800 million of private-
sector finance for social housing.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of
modernising their stock by:
• borrowing from the Public Works Loan
Board (an independent statutory body set
up to make loans to local authorities) or
on the open market;
• using part2 of the proceeds from the sale
of local authority houses and other
assets; or
• drawing on their revenue accounts.
Councils must maintain housing revenue
accounts on a ‘ring-fenced’ basis to keep them
separate from other council funds. The
Government grants local authorities in
England and Wales Housing Revenue
Account Subsidy, mainly to cover the cost of
rent rebates. This is worth £4,118 million in
England and £227 million in Wales in
1995-96. In Scotland, Housing Support
Grant of £22 million is available in 1995-96
for those authorities which are in deficit on
their housing revenue accounts.
Local authority housing investment
programmes allocations, which control the
amount that local authorities can borrow for
council housing and other general purposes,
total £994 million in England for 1995-96,
and £299 million in Wales. In Scotland, local
authorities have received capital allocations
amounting to £424 million for investment in
In Scotland, all these proceeds can be used.
council homes. In Northern Ireland, the
Housing Executive’s capital programme is
financed mainly by borrowing from
government and receipts from house sales. In
1995-96 borrowing will total £81 million.
Revenue expenditure is funded from rental
income and by a government grant, which in
1995-96 is about £123 million.
Housing Associations
Housing associations, which are non-profit-
making, are now the main providers of new
low-cost housing for rent and for sale to
those on low incomes and in the greatest
housing need. Many associations specialise in
providing supported housing to meet the
special needs of those with learning
difficulties (mental handicap), drug and
alcohol problems, young people at risk and
the frail elderly. The housing association
sector is expanding rapidly. Associations own,
manage and maintain over 950,000 homes and
about 65,000 hostel and special-needs
bed-spaces in Great Britain, providing homes
for well over 1 million people.
In Great Britain new housing schemes
carried out by associations qualify for
Housing Association Grant if the association
concerned is one of about 2,800 registered
with the Housing Corporation (in England),
Scottish Homes or Housing for Wales.
These three organisations are statutory
bodies which supervise and pay grant to
housing associations in their respective
parts of Great Britain. Broadly similar
assistance is available to associations in
Northern Ireland.
The Housing Corporation’s approved
development programme provides for about
£1,200 million in grants in 1995-96. The
Government encourages housing
associations to increase the amount of
private finance they draw in. This allows
more homes to be built with the available
public resources. In 1995-96, Housing
Corporation funding will provide an
additional 58,000 lettings for rent or shared
ownership. Local authority resources might
provide a further 12,000.
In 1995-96 Scottish Homes’ development
programme expenditure is £320 million,
341
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
while the 1994—95 target for private finance
attracted was £175 million. Housing for
Wales is managing a net capital programme
of £93 million in 1995-96, with a target of
making available at least 3,400 new homes.
Government provision to the housing
association movement in Wales was almost
£500 million between 1991-92 and 1994—95.
Private sector finance generated over the
same period is forecast to reach almost
£264 million. Northern Ireland’s registered
housing associations started 1,000 units of
accommodation in 1994-95, and now have a
stock of about 15,000 units for rent. They
have a budget for building for rent of
£40.5 million in 1995-96, which, with an
additional £10 million of private finance, will
provide a further 1,200 units of rented
accommodation. Government plans allow for
total funding of £243 million over the period
1992-93 to 1996-97.
Other Voluntary Sector Bodies
As well as housing associations, other
voluntary sector bodies have a role to play in
housing matters. Such groups undertake a
number of roles, for example advising people
about their rights under housing law or
encouraging energy efficiency in the home.
The Government allocates grants to assist the
work of such bodies. In England in 1995-96
about £382,000 is being made available to 13
housing groups; in Scotland aid of over
£900,000 in 1995-96 is being given to about
20 voluntary bodies for work on homelessness
and other housing matters.
Tenants’ Rights
Local authority tenants in England, Scotland
and Wales have security of tenure and other
statutory rights, which are set out in a
Council Tenant’s Charter. In addition to the
right to buy (see p. 339), these include the
right to get certain urgent repairs done
quickly at no cost to themselves and the right
to be paid when they move home for certain
improvements they have made. Tenants also
have the right to take over the running of
their estates through tenant management
organisations (TMOs). Over 100 TMOs are
operational and about 100 more are under
development. Compulsory competitive
tendering is being introduced for council
house management; tenants must be kept
closely involved in the process.
In England and Wales the rights of
housing association tenants are protected
under Tenants’ Guarantees, which are
issued by the Housing Corporation and
Housing for Wales. They cover matters such
as tenancy terms, principles for setting rent
levels and the allocation of tenancies. Under
these guarantees, tenants receive contractual
rights in addition to their basic statutory
rights, and associations are required to set
and maintain rents at levels affordable by
those in low-paid employment. Similar non-
statutory guidance based on joint proposals
from Scottish Homes and the Scottish
Federation of Housing Associations, has
been implemented in Scotland. In Northern
Ireland, the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland has issued a Tenants’
Guarantee, similar to the English and
Welsh versions, for tenants of registered
housing associations.
Following a Citizen’s Charter
commitment, the Government launched a
Housing Association Tenants’ Ombudsman
Service in 1993 under the auspices of the
Housing Corporation. The scheme, which
covers England, allows independent
investigation of tenants’ complaints against
their housing association, giving them a
right similar to that for council tenants
through the local government ombudsman.
The Government announced in the housing
White Paper that it intends to make the
service statutorily independent. Similar
schemes have been launched in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
Housing for Older People
Sheltered housing, which comprises
accommodation with an alarm system and the
services of a resident warden, may be
provided for elderly people who need
support. Increasing emphasis is being placed
on schemes to help them to continue to live
in their own homes by, for example, adapting
their present homes to meet their needs. In
342
r
B England, home improvement agencies can
help elderly people, people with disabilities
and those on low incomes to carry out repairs
and improvements to their properties.
Corresponding provision is made for
Scotland under the Care and Repair scheme
co-ordinated by Scottish Homes.
Continuing government support for
home improvement agencies over a
further five-year period was
announced in 1994. In England alone,
£4.2 million of government help will
go to support 125 home improvement
agencies and Care and Repair Ltd., a
national co-ordinating body, in
1995-96.
Rural Housing
j| Where there is an identified need for low-
f cost housing in rural areas, local authorities
! can exceptionally allow housing in areas
j where development would not normally be
allowed, so long as the new housing can be
reserved to meet those needs. The Housing
f Corporation also funds a special rural
programme to build houses in small villages;
| between 1989-90 and 1994-95 it approved
i funding for the building of about 10,800
I such homes.
Housing for Wales has a major role in
i rural housing provision, with at least a
I; quarter of its programme devoted to rural
areas. The Welsh Office also supports low-
j cost schemes for rural housing. In February
1995 it announced nearly £1.5 million
i of help for 13 schemes. In Scotland,
considerable progress is being made through
I a range of initiatives launched in 1990 as part
I of the Scottish Homes Rural Strategy,
p Scottish Homes has invested over £325
million in rural areas since 1989-90,
providing 9,000 homes. In 1995-96 it will
! spend more than £60 million in rural areas
h making available 1,720 homes. The Northern
f Ireland Housing Executive operates a rural
strategy which directs special action both in
public housing and also on the house
renovation grant scheme for private housing,
M which it administers.
HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Improving Existing Housing
In urban areas of Britain, slum clearance and
redevelopment used to be major features of
housing policy, but there has been a trend in
recent years towards the modernisation and
conversion of sub-standard homes in order to
retain existing communities. Housing
conditions have improved considerably, but
problems remain in some areas where there
are concentrations of dwellings requiring
substantial repairs.
Social Housing
Under the Estate Action programme, central
government helped local authorities improve
run-down estates, investing in greater
security, transforming poorly-designed
blocks and introducing greater variety and
choice and more responsive management.
Over £2,000 million of public funds had
been spent through this programme by the
end of 1994—95 and 540,000 homes had
been improved in around 170 authorities.
The Government is building on this
approach through the Single Regeneration
Budget (SRB—see p. 345), which
encourages local authorities in England to
tackle social and economic problems
alongside housing improvements. In the first
bidding round for the SRB, about 40 per
cent of successful projects included
improvements to housing.
On some of the worst estates, tenants have
voted for housing action trusts to take over
their housing from the local authority; the
aim is to provide radical new solutions
promoting the physical, social, economic and
environmental regeneration of the areas. Six
trusts have now been established.
Over the next ten years, the Government
plans to tackle the problems of the most
deprived estates by:
• improving the physical quality of the estates;
• encouraging diversity of tenure,
increasing home ownership and renting
from private social landlords; and
• improving economic and social
conditions.
It will use a combination of public
343
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
investment and the transfer of estates to new
social landlords to bring in private finance.
In Wales, Estate Partnership funding is
available to tackle the problems of selected
estates; £10.6 million of central government
support has been allocated for this in 1995-96
to supplement local authority and private
sector contributions.
Private Housing
The Government also offers help through
house renovation grants to owners of private
housing who are on low incomes and unable
to afford necessary repairs and improvements.
Specific help is available to disabled people
who need adaptations to their home. Since
1990, house renovation grants, disabled
facilities grants, and minor works assistance
grants have provided up to 100 per cent
support for essential repairs and
improvements to the poorest home owners.
Over 350,000 grants were given in England
alone between 1990 and 1995, totalling more
than £1,000 million.
The Government has announced its
intention to legislate to reform the renovation
grant system to give local authorities
increased discretion in deciding claims for
renovation grant. The aim is to strengthen
the ability of local authorities to target
resources at:
• renewal areas declared by the local
authority;
• improving the housing conditions of
vulnerable people; and
• supporting community care policies and
enabling elderly, ill or disabled people to
continue to live independently.
In Scotland, local authorities award grants
for improvement and repair. Scottish Homes
also has the power to provide grants to
complement the role of local authorities in
private house renewal. In Northern Ireland,
grants are allocated on a similar basis to that
in England and Wales through the House
Renovation Grants scheme, administered by
the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. In
isolated rural areas, a grant to replace
dwellings which cannot be restored is also
available through this scheme.
Homelessness
Bv law, local authorities have a duty to secure
permanent accommodation for households I -
which they accept as unintentionally homeless
and in priority need. The latter category
includes pregnant women, people with
dependent children, and those who are
vulnerable because of old age, mental or
physical handicap or other special reasons.
The number of households in England j.
accepted as homeless has been falling since
1991 (see Table 21.1).
11
Grants totalling £6.9 million in i i
1995-96 are being made available to
voluntary organisations which provide :
direct assistance to single people in i
need of accommodation. (
The Government intends to reform the t
homelessness legislation. The aim will be to
give fairer access to long-term social housing, i
while ensuring a safety net for families and
vulnerable people who lose their home. In (
Scotland, w here the number of homeless

Most people accepted as homeless have
some form of accommodation, even though
this may be temporary, overcrowded or
otherwise unsatisfactory, and those entitled to t

homeless are ‘roofless’—that is, literally

tackle the problem in central London, with
resources of £96 million. This provided about
950 new places in short-term hostels and
about 1,800 permanent and 700 leased places
in accommodation for hostel dwellers to move
on into. A further £86 million has been made
available to continue the Initiative until 1996
to provide at least 1,500 more permanent
homes, together with the professional help
necessary to assist people to settle into a new
life. In the housing White Paper, the
Government announced that the Initiative
would be continued beyond March 1996 in
central London and that it would consider
assisting similar developments in areas outside
central London where rough sleeping is a
major problem.
Since 1990 more than £20 million has
been spent by the Department of Health on
the Homeless Mentally 111 Initiative, a
programme to provide accommodation and
psychiatric care for mentally-ill people who
have been sleeping rough in central London.
The Department has a long-term
commitment to help with the running costs of
the accommodation. It also funds, or has
recently funded, 34 health care projects
designed to ensure that homeless people have
access to health services. Some £3 million has
been made available over the three years to
March 1996 to enable doctors and other
health workers to visit hostels, day centres and
other places where homeless people congregate.
A voluntary sector count, held in May
1995, found that 270 people were sleeping
rough in central London, compared with
estimates of over 1,000 before the Rough
Sleepers Initiative began (see Table 21.2).
During the period 1991-94, extra capital
allocations of around £29 million were given
to housing authorities in Scotland for
homelessness projects. In January 1994 the
Government announced £4 million of
additional funding to tackle homelessness in
Wales. Local authorities were invited to
present bids.
Regeneration
Economic trends in recent decades have
altered traditional locations and patterns of
employment and brought profound changes
to local economies. Many inner city areas
have suffered from long-established industries
moving out or closing, leaving problems of
dereliction and unemployment. A report
commissioned by the Government, Assessing
the Impact of Urban Policy, was published in
1994. It concluded that the gap between 57
urban priority areas and other places in
England had narrowed in the period 1979-80
to 1990-91. Nevertheless, areas of deprivation
still exist. Likewise, rural areas have had to
adapt to the need in recent years to diversify
away from farm production.
The Government is tackling urban
problems in England with the Single
Regeneration Budget (SRB), which brought
together 20 previous programmes from five
government departments. Urban problems in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are being
tackled by Partnerships, the Programme for the
Valleys and Belfast Action Teams respectively,
as well as by many other government
programmes. Other programmes and policies
are addressing the needs of rural areas.
Single Regeneration Budget
The Secretary of State for the Environment
has overall responsibility for the SRB. It is
intended to promote more flexible and locally
responsive forms of regeneration, building on
the approach pioneered with the City
Challenge initiative (see below). It came into
operation in April 1994, with a total
expenditure of about £1,440 million in the
first year. Its 1995-96 allocation is
£1,330 million. Existing commitments from
the constituent programmes are being met,
345
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
but as these commitments expire the
money released is being allocated through a
bidding procedure.
More than 200 bids for SRB funding
were approved in December 1994,
with funding of £125 million in
1995-96, rising to £225 million in
each of the two following years.
These projects are expected to attract
£4 of private or other public money
for every £1 of SRB money awarded
to them. Benefits will include support
for over 7,500 voluntary groups and
the completion or improvement of
more than 50,000 homes. A new
bidding round is being held in 1995
for projects starting in April 1996.
Integrated Government Offices for the
Regions (GORs) combine the former regional
offices of the Departments of the
Environment, Employment, Trade and
Industry, and Transport. There are also
senior headquarters representatives in each
office. The main programmes funded by the
SRB are administered by the GORs.
City Challenge
Under the City Challenge initiative,
launched in 1991, local authorities were
invited, in partnership with the private and
voluntary sectors, local communities and
government agencies, to submit imaginative
and comprehensive plans for regenerating key
neighbourhoods by tackling the problems of
physical decay, lack of opportunity and poor
quality of life. The best of these proposals
are receiving government funding of
£37.5 million over five years, subject to
satisfactory progress being made towards
achieving agreed targets and objectives.
There have been two rounds of the City
Challenge competition. In the first pilot
round, 11 local authorities in England were
selected to draw up detailed plans for action,
which commenced in 1992. The 20
authorities successful in the second round
competition began work on their five-year
programmes in 1993.
In the five-year period to 1997-98,
£1,163 million of City Challenge money is
expected to attract over £3,500 million of
private sector investment. A national
evaluation of City Challenge is under way to
measure the effectiveness of the initiative.
Urban Development Corporations
Twelve urban development corporations
(UDCs) were set up in England by the
Government to reverse large-scale urban
decline, the first two, London Docklands and
Merseyside, in 1981. Ten others were
subsequently set up: Birmingham Heartlands,
Black Country (West Midlands), Bristol,
Leeds, Central Manchester, Plymouth,
Sheffield, Trafford Park (Greater
Manchester), Teesside, and Tyne and Wear.
These UDCs covered about 16,000 hectares
(about 40,000 acres), and public expenditure
on the programme will be £243 million in
1995-96, including spending on the
Docklands Light Railway (see p. 303). Leeds
was wound up in March 1995, with Bristol
scheduled to be wound up in December 1995
and Central Manchester in March 1996. All
the other UDCs are to be wound up by
March 1998.
Task Forces
Task Forces were first set up in 1986. These
are small teams of five or six people drawn
from government departments, local
authorities and the private and voluntary
sectors, which operate in the most deprived
urban areas in England. Task Forces
concentrate on the economic regeneration of
designated inner city areas, by:
• improving local people’s employment
prospects;
• supporting training and education
initiatives; and
• identifying and removing barriers to
employment.
They also aim to stimulate enterprise
development and strengthen the capacity of
communities to meet local needs. Task
Forces have a limited life; an important part
of their work is to build up local
346
HOUSING AND REGENERATION
, organisations to which they can hand over
as they withdraw. Since 1986 Task Forces
have spent over £148 million, which has
helped to provide over 37,000 jobs, more
t than 17,000 training places, and supported
i over 44,000 businesses.
English Partnerships
] English Partnerships, a government
regeneration agency, promotes the
development of vacant, derelict and
contaminated land throughout England. Its
i key objectives are to:
• stimulate local enterprise;
• create job opportunities; and
• improve the environment.
These objectives are expected to be
achieved in partnership with the public,
private and voluntary sectors. In 1994—95, its
first full year of operation, more than 250
new projects were approved, creating 13,200
jobs, reclaiming over 1,600 hectares (4,000
acres) and attracting £300 million in private
finance. For 1995-96 English Partnerships
has a total programme of about £270 million.
It is also eligible for assistance from the
European Regional Development Fund
(see p. 121).
Safer Cities
Higher than average crime rates, and the fear
of crime, are particular problems in inner city
areas. Safer Cities projects bring together all
sections of the local community to tackle
crime and the fear of crime. Since the
programme’s launch in 1988 3,600 crime
prevention and community safety measures
have been initiated, with funding of £22
million. Nine new projects in England
commenced in 1993, and a further 20 projects
in 1994. Examples of help include providing
activities for young people who might be
tempted to commit crime, and fitting good
quality locks to houses on estates with a high
burglary rate. Successes include a 40 per cent
reduction in burglaries on a Wolverhampton
estate and a 60 per cent reduction in car
crime in a Bradford car park.
Compacts
A large number of schools/industry
‘Compacts’ have been introduced since 1988
in urban areas in England. Employers work
with schools to guarantee a job with training
for all school-leavers aged 16 to 18 who meet
agreed targets for motivation and
achievement. In 1995-96 50 inner-city
Compacts are in operation in England,
involving 180,000 young people, 10,000
employers and 800 schools. Since 1992,
Compacts have been extended beyond
inner-city areas; there are now 53 compacts
in other areas.
Regional Enterprise Grants
The Regional Enterprise Grant programme
(see p. 209) has also been brought within
the SRB. This supports investment and
innovation projects in small firms in
designated areas. A total of £11.8 million was
paid out in 1994—95.
Other Measures
The first of a network of City Technology
Colleges was opened near Birmingham in
1988; 15 are currently operating. Intended to
raise educational standards, the colleges are
established jointly by government and
industry. While teaching the full National
Curriculum (see p. 435), they emphasise
science, technology and business understanding.
Training programmes such as Youth
Training (see p. 185) and Training for Work
(see p. 184) are helping many people in the
inner cities. About one-third of young people
participating in Youth Training are from
inner cities. There are over 100 Employment
Service ‘outreach’ staff based in or visiting
inner city areas, helping unemployed people
look for jobs and encouraging them to
participate in employment and training
programmes. These supplement normal
jobcentre services. In 1992-93 there were
about 500 inner city Jobclubs, many catering
for people with literacy and numeracy or
language difficulties. In addition, funds are
available for innovative projects to help
unemployed people in inner cities and other
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
deprived areas back into work or training.
Many of the independent Training and
Enterprise Councils (see p. 183) are working
in Task Force areas, City Challenge areas or
other pockets of deprivation; they often play
an important part in partnership approaches
to regeneration.
The Government encourages tourism as a
force for improving inner city areas. Several
major projects which create a cultural and
artistic focus for inner city regeneration have
been undertaken. Examples include the
development of the Royal Armouries
Museum at Clarence Dock in Leeds, due to
open in spring 1996 at a cost of £42 million,
and the International Convention Centre in
Birmingham. The English Tourist Board
and regional tourist boards encourage
promotional activities in inner city areas
through local initiatives bringing together
tourist boards, local authorities, the private
sector and other agencies.
In March 1994 the Government launched
the Urban Forum, a new national body that
brings together voluntary organisations
engaged in urban policy and regeneration. Its
aims are to:
• act as a communication channel between
the voluntary sector and the
Government;
• develop new ideas; and
• encourage local communities and
voluntary groups to engage in
regeneration partnerships.
The Department of the Environment is
making grants totalling £810,000 to 15
voluntary organisations for regeneration
projects in 1995-96 under its Special
Grants Programme.
City Pride
The Government announced its City Pride
initiative in 1993. Civic and business leaders
in three pilot cities—Manchester, London
and Birmingham—were invited to come
forward with proposals for building on the
strength of their areas. These were published
in September 1994, January 1995 and June
1995 respectively. The GORs will work
closely with representatives of these cities.
European Union Programmes
Run-down areas in Britain benefit from the
EU Structural Funds (see p. 121). These
mainly come from the European Regional
Development Fund (ERDF), which finances
infrastructure projects and support for
industry, among other things. Objectives for
the Funds include regenerating areas affected
by industrial decline and combating long¬
term unemployment, both problems common
in inner city areas. The Department of the
Environment is responsible for the
co-ordination of ERDF programmes in the
English regions. About £1,195 million has
been allocated to declining industrial regions
in England during the period 1994 to 1996.
Following a review of the Structural
Funds, the recommendations of which took
effect in January 1994, Merseyside qualified
for ‘Objective F support—to promote
economic development in underdeveloped
regions. This justifies the highest level of
Structural Funds support. Merseyside stands
to receive about £633 million from the Funds
between 1994 and 1999.
In March 1995 it was announced that six
non-Objective 1 urban areas in England
were to receive funding worth £37 million
under the URBAN Community Initiative, an
EU-wide scheme to promote urban
regeneration complementing domestic
programmes. This is in addition to £13 million
of URBAN funding previously announced for
the Objective 1 area, Merseyside.
Coalfield Areas Fund
The Coalfield Areas Fund was set up with the
aim of alleviating the economic effects of
colliery closures on local communities. A total
of £5 million was made available through the
Fund in 1993-94 and 1994-95. This supported
35 projects put forward by 17 local authorities.
It is estimated that about 1,700 jobs were
created in 1993-94 and that 19,000 sq m
(205,000 sq ft) of new or improved business
and commercial floorspace were provided.
Groundwork Trusts
Groundwork trusts seek to tackle
348
HOUSING AND REGENERATION
environmental problems arising from
dereliction and vandalism and to increase
public awareness of opportunities to change
and improve local environments. They work
in partnership with public bodies, the private
sector, voluntary organisations and
individuals. Traditionally, such trusts have
tended to concentrate on fringe urban or
suburban areas, but increasingly they are also
becoming involved in inner city areas. For
example, a trust has recently been set up in
the Hackney area of inner London. The
Groundwork Foundation is a national body
providing the trusts with advice and support.
Government funding for Groundwork in
1995-95 is £6.2 million in England. There
were 40 trusts in England and Wales by
March 1995, compared with 22 in 1990-91.
Enterprise and Simplified Planning
Zones
Since 1981 the Government has set up 28
enterprise zones, including four extensions.
Each zone runs for a period of ten years from
designation; most have therefore already
reached the end of their lives. Benefits in the
zones include:
• exemption from the national non¬
domestic rate (the local property tax
payable by non-domestic property
owners);
• 100 per cent allowances for corporation
and income tax purposes for capital
expenditure on industrial and commercial
buildings; and
• a much simplified planning system.
It is expected that there will be seven
zones operating in January 1996, including
one extension. At present it is not
intended to extend the enterprise zone
scheme by designating any further sites.
However, the Government has retained the
option of establishing further zones in
exceptional circumstances.
Simplified planning zones (SPZs) can help
local authorities to secure development in
parts of their areas. An SPZ scheme, which
also lasts for ten years, provides full planning
permission for specified types of
development. Like enterprise zones, from
which the concept was derived, SPZs are
useful as part of an overall package to
generate private sector interest in an area.
The procedures for establishing an SPZ have
been streamlined to encourage their use. By
March 1995 12 were in operation.
Rural Development
The economy of the countryside has come
under great pressure in recent years. Limited
job opportunities for school leavers and young
adults have caused a drift to urban areas,
mirrored by an influx into rural areas of
town-dwellers. However, this consists mainly
of commuters and retired people, and so the
opportunity to create new jobs is low. A
forthcoming rural White Paper, announced by
the Government in 1994, will examine the
economic, social and environmental changes
taking place in the countryside. It will also set
out the Government’s strategy for rural areas.
The first Rural Challenge competition
took place in 1994. This is an annual
competition, aimed at encouraging
public and private bodies and the
voluntary sector to form partnerships
to tackle local economic and social
problems. Up to £1 million in
funding can be obtained. Winning
projects in 1994 included the
renovation of an old pumping station
in Nottinghamshire. The second
round of Rural Challenge was
launched in March 1995.
The Rural Development Commission
(RDC) is the main government agency for
diversifying rural enterprise in England while
at the same time protecting the countryside.
The RDC gives financial support and
business and marketing advice to help
develop the rural economy, as well as
providing sites and work spaces. Its main
economic programmes are concentrated in
priority rural development areas, which cover
about 35 per cent of the area of England and
take in over 2.7 million people. The RDC
spent £35.4 million in 1992-93; this is
forecast to rise to £43.8 million in 1995-96.
Some rural areas are also eligible for help
349
- -
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
from the ERDF. Objective 5b is concerned
with promoting regeneration in rural areas by
speeding up agricultural adjustment and
assisting development. About £381 million
has been allocated to promote the development
of rural areas between 1994 and 1996.
Public Sector Land
The Department of the Environment
promotes the sale and development of vacant
and under-used public sector land.
Information is being assembled on key sites
with development potential, and where there
are no firm plans to market or develop land,
action will be taken to encourage and
promote the sale of sites. Since 1989,
registers of unused or under-used public
sector land have been maintained by the
owners. Under the ‘Public Request to Order
Disposal’ scheme, members of the public are
encouraged to request the Secretary of State
to order public bodies to dispose of such land
on the open market.
In 1994 the rules governing the way local
authorities can spend the proceeds of asset
sales were altered to encourage the sale of
surplus land. This has the effect of increasing
the proportion of the proceeds that councils
can spend on new capital projects in those
cases where they have had to spend money
preparing the land for sale.
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
Wales
A new Strategic Development Scheme was
launched in Wales in 1994, into which the
previous Urban Programme was subsumed.
Schemes worth £57 million were approved
for 1995-96, with economic and
environmental projects receiving priority. In
addition, Urban Investment Grant encourages
private sector developments on derelict and
run-down sites in urban areas; the 1995—96
budget is £8 million.
The Government aims to remove all
significant dereliction in Wales by the end of
the 1990s. The Welsh Development Agency
(see p. 25) may acquire and reclaim derelict
land or make grants to local authorities, other
public bodies and the private sector for this
purpose. It also undertakes substantial urban
and rural development and environmental
programmes; their combined budgets in
1995-96 are almost £40 million. Land use is
also encouraged by the Land Authority for
Wales, a statutory body with powers to make
land available for development in
circumstances where the private sector would
find this difficult or impossible.
The first Programme for the Valleys,
which ran from 1988 to 1993, was an
extensive scheme of economic and urban
regeneration, covering an area of about 2,200
sq km (860 sq miles) in the south Wales
valleys. In 1993 the Secretary of State for
Wales launched a new five-year Programme.
It builds on the success of the first
Programme by continuing many of its
measures, and also introducing new initiatives
for the social, economic and environmental
regeneration of the Valleys. The five aims of
the new Programme are to:
• create more, better-quality jobs;
• improve training, education and
transport, so that local people can
benefit;
• improve the quality of the environment;
• improve the quality and choice of
housing; and
• improve the health of local people.
The Cardiff Bay Development
Corporation was set up in 1987 to bring
forward redevelopment in an area of south
Cardiff, once its commercial centre.
Government support for the Corporation in
1995-96 will be £51 million. The
Corporation’s regeneration strategy includes
the construction of a £147 million barrage
across Cardiff harbour mouth, which will
create a large freshwater lake and 12 km
(7 miles) of waterside frontage. Work
commenced on the barrage in 1994 and is
scheduled to be completed in 1998. It is
expected that with the barrage more than
23,000 new jobs will be created in the
Cardiff Bay area, 4,400 new homes will be
built and over £1,200 million of private
investment be attracted.
350
HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Scotland
In 1988 the Government set out in the White
Paper New Life for Urban Scotland its
strategy for improving the quality of life for
people living on peripheral estates in
Scotland. The strategy builds on the
experience gained from inner city
regeneration schemes such as the Glasgow
Eastern Area Renewal. Its main aim was to
encourage residents to take more
responsibility for the improvement of their
own communities.
The focus of regeneration effort is four
Partnerships in areas of Dundee, Edinburgh,
Glasgow and Paisley. These are led by
The Scottish Office and involve other bodies
and groups, including Scottish Enterprise
(see p. 209), Scottish Homes (see p. 339),
local authorities, the private sector and
loca communities. Their objectives include
plans to:
• improve the quality and tenure mix of
housing available to local people;
• improve employment prospects by
providing increased avenues for training
and further education; and
• tackle social and environmental problems
on the estates.
Over 2,000 new homes have been or are
being built, and 7,000 improved.
Other peripheral estates and inner-city
areas continue to receive substantial support
through such sources as the Urban
Programme, Scottish Homes and Scottish
Enterprise. Scottish Homes is leading 15
Smaller Urban Renewal Initiatives, in which
it is investing ff>2 million in 1995-96. This
will provide 850 new or improved homes.
Five Safer Cities programmes have been
launched in Scotland, including schemes in
Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee.
Four are still in existence, and £253,000
will be spent on them by central government
in 1995-96.
The Local Enterprise Companies
(LECs—see p. 183), working under contract
to Scottish Enterprise, have substantial
budgets and a flexible range of powers and
functions to improve the environment and
encourage business and employment in their
areas. In particular, Scottish Enterprise
operates a Local Enterprise Grants for Urban
Projects scheme, which aims to foster private
sector investment for projects in deprived
areas. The areas of need in which the scheme
operates include the four Partnership areas,
and other areas showing similar
characteristics of deprivation. LECs can also
support projects in their areas. Responsibility
for derelict land reclamation rests with
Scottish Enterprise, LECs and Highlands
and Islands Enterprise. They may acquire
and reclaim land either by agreement or
compulsorily; increasingly they seek to work
with the private sector to bring land back
into use.
A review of urban regeneration policy
in Scotland, launched in 1993 and
completed by January 1995, concluded
that in future about two-thirds of
Urban Programme money would be
allocated to new ‘priority partnership
areas’, to be designated by The
Scottish Office following discussions
with city and district partnerships.
The remaining one-third would be
available to support regeneration
initiatives in other eligible
disadvantaged areas.
The Compact scheme (see p. 347) has
been introduced in Scotland, with 12
Compacts in operation. In all, 7,400 young
people participate in Compacts, as do many
of the 10,500 employers and business
organisations in Education Business
Partnerships in Scotland. The Training and
Employment Grants scheme is designed to
increase access to employment opportunities
for young and long-term unemployed people.
Northern Ireland
Urban Development Grant is the principal
urban regeneration measure in Northern
Ireland, with projected expenditure of
£5.4 million in 1995-96. It is targeted at the
most run-down parts of Belfast and
Londonderry. Grants may also be paid to
landowners who restore or improve derelict
sites in Northern Ireland.
351
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A comprehensive development programme
aims to revitalise the commercial areas of
Belfast. In 1995-96 regeneration programmes
have a combined allocation of £7.3 million.
The Making Belfast Work initiative, which
now includes the former Belfast Action
Teams, launched in 1988, is designed to
reinforce efforts to alleviate economic,
educational, social and environmental
problems in the most disadvantaged areas of
Belfast. In addition to extensive funding
already allocated to mainstream departmental
programmes, Making Belfast Work has
provided a further £169 million approximately
for the period 1988-89 to 1995-96. The
Laganside Corporation was established in 1989
to regenerate Belfast’s riverside area. Its
government grant in 1995—96 is £7.6 million.
The Community Regeneration and
Improvement Special Programme aims to
regenerate disadvantaged smaller towns. It is
jointly funded by the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland and the
International Fund for Ireland. A total of 35
small towns have been assisted since the
programme was started in 1990.

Conservation
Britain seeks to balance the demands for land from business, housing,
transport, farming and leisure, and to protect the environment by means of a
statutory system of land-use planning and development control. Government
agencies and voluntary bodies work to conserve Britain’s natural heritage and
historic monuments; over 500,000 important buildings and 6,700 sites of
special scientific interest receive statutory protection.

PLANNING
Direct responsibility for land-use planning in
Great Britain lies with local authorities. The
Secretaries of State for the Environment,
Wales and Scotland have overall responsibility
for the operation of the system. The
! Department of the Environment brings
: together the major responsibilities in England
for land-use planning, housing and
construction, countryside policy and
I environmental protection. The Welsh Office
and The Scottish Office have broadly
f equivalent responsibilities, which also extend
M to transport. In Northern Ireland the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland is responsible for planning matters; its
I six divisional planning offices work closely
I with the district councils.
In England the Department of the
lj Environment provides national and regional
guidance on planning, while strategic
planning at the county level is the
responsibility of the county councils. At
present, district councils are responsible for
local plans and development control, except
for minerals and waste, which are ‘county
matters’. In London and the former
metropolitan counties, there is a unitary
planning system. The boroughs and
metropolitan districts prepare unitary
development plans and are responsible for
development control. The local
government reorganisation (see p. 72) will
alter these arrangements.
In Wales, planning responsibilities are at
present split in the same way as in non¬
metropolitan parts of England, but from
April 1996 responsibility will rest with the
new unitary authorities (see p. 74). In
Scotland, The Scottish Office provides
national planning guidance. Regional and
district councils undertake planning functions
at present, dividing responsibilities on a basis
353
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
broadly similar to that in England and Wales.
In the more rural regions and the islands, the
regional and islands councils respectively have
responsibility for all planning functions. After
April 1996, the new unitary councils will take
over responsibility.
Development Plans
Development plans have a central role in
shaping development patterns in an area, as
planning decisions must be made in
accordance with the development plan unless
material considerations indicate otherwise.
The preparation of a district-wide
development plan is mandatory.
The present development plan system in
England and Wales involves structure, local
and unitary development plans:
• structure plans, setting out broad policies
for the development and use of land, are
adopted by county councils, which also
draw up local plans for minerals and, in
England, waste;
• local plans, prepared in general conformity
with the adopted structure plan, and
providing detailed guidance for
development, are adopted by district
councils and National Park authorities; and
• unitary development plans, setting out
both strategic and detailed land use and
development policies, are adopted by
metropolitan districts or London
boroughs.
Following local government reorganisation
(see p. 72), some district councils in England
will acquire unitary status. Unless these are
given a unitary development plan function,
they will become the structure plan authority
for their area. In most cases the Secretary of
State for the Environment has asked that
these unitary authorities work with the
surrounding county council or with
neighbouring unitary authorities on a joint
structure plan corresponding to the original
county area.
In Scotland regional or islands authorities
prepare structure plans. Local plans are
drawn up by those districts with planning
responsibilities, islands authorities, and in
some rural areas by regional planning
authorities. However, from April 1996, the
new councils will undertake plan preparation.
In some cases this may be done by a joint
committee of more than one council. Under
Northern Ireland’s single-tier system, plans
are prepared by the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland.
Members of the public are encouraged to
become involved in the formulation of plan
policies and proposals. They can formally
object and make their case in public to an
independent inspector. When formulating
their plans, planning authorities must take
account of any strategic or regional guidance
issued by the Secretary of State and any
statements of government planning policy.
An important element of the
Government’s strategy for sustainable
development is for full use—having regard to
the quality of the urban environment—to be
made of urban land in existing towns and
cities, so avoiding the need to develop ‘green
field’ sites and reducing transport demands.
Green Belts
‘Green Belts’ are areas intended to be left
open and free from inappropriate
development. Their purposes are to:
• restrict the sprawl of large built-up areas;
• safeguard the surrounding countryside;
• prevent neighbouring towns merging;
• preserve the special character of historic
towns; and
• assist in urban regeneration.
They also have a recreational role. Green
Belts have been established around major
cities, including London, Aberdeen,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Merseyside, Greater
Manchester and the West Midlands, as well
as several smaller towns. Some 1.5 million
hectares (3.8 million acres) are designated as
Green Belt in England and 155,000 hectares
(380,000 acres) in Scotland. The Government
attaches great importance to the protection of
Green Belts and expects local planning
authorities to do likewise when considering
planning applications.
354
PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
In January 1995 the Government
published strengthened planning
guidance on Green Belts in England.
This removed a former concession
allowing new institutional building
there, and brought in a new policy on
the re-use of buildings which includes
specific safeguards for the Green Belt.
Development Control
Most development requires specific planning
permission. Applications are dealt with in the
light of development plans and other material
planning considerations, including national and
regional guidance. In 1994 about 482,000
applications for planning permission were
received by district councils in England alone;
in total, about 380,000 applications were
granted in this period. The Government has
set local authorities in England a target of
deciding 80 per cent of applications within
eight weeks. In recent years there has been
good progress towards this target (see
Table 22.1). As part of the Citizen’s Charter
initiative (see p. 66), the Government publishes
planning performance checklists twice yearly,
showing how well each of these local planning
authorities are meeting this target.
Local planning authorities in England and
Wales are required to publicise planning
applications locally. Methods commonly
used include site notices, newspaper
advertising and notifying neighbours. In
Scotland the applicant is required to notify
the owners, occupiers and, in some cases,
lessees of neighbouring land and buildings
when the application is submitted to the
planning authority. Newspaper
advertisement is required for certain types
of development.
The applicant has a right of appeal to the
Secretary of State if the local authority
refuses planning permission, grants it with
conditions attached, or fails to decide an
application within eight weeks (or whatever
longer period is agreed with the applicant).
The majority of appeals are decided on the
basis of written submissions. However, either
party has the right to be heard by an
inspector (or ‘reporter’ in Scotland) at a
public local inquiry or, where a less formal
arrangement is appropriate, at a hearing. A
local inquiry is usually held for more
complicated or controversial applications.
Similar provision is made in Northern
Ireland for the hearing of representations at
public inquiries; for planning applications
which do not give rise to public inquiries, the
applicant has a right of appeal to the
independent Planning Appeals Commission.
The Secretaries of State can direct that a
planning application be referred to them for
decision. They generally only use this power
to ‘call in’ proposals which raise planning
issues of national or regional importance. The
applicant and the local planning authority
have the right to be heard by a person
appointed by the Secretary of State, and a
public inquiry will normally be held. In
Northern Ireland, major planning applications
are dealt with under the Planning (NI) Order
1991, which allows for a public inquiry in
certain circumstances.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Environmental Impact Assessment
Planning applications for certain types of
development must be accompanied by an
environmental impact assessment. This
should describe the likely environmental
effects and measures to minimise them.
These statements are available to the public
and to statutory bodies such as the
Countryside Commission and English Nature
(see p. 359). The planning authority must
consider the environmental statement, and
any representations received on it, before
granting planning permission.
Architectural Standards
The Government encourages high standards
in new building, although it advises local
planning authorities not to impose their
architectural tastes on developers. The
Department of the Environment, in
collaboration with the independent Royal
Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the
National House-Building Council, sponsors
the biennial Housing Design Awards Scheme
for England and Northern Ireland, with
categories for renovation and new building.
Scotland and Wales have similar award
schemes. Royal Fine Art Commissions for
England and Wales and for Scotland advise
government departments, planning authorities
and other public bodies on questions of
public amenity or artistic importance.
The RIBA, the principal professional body
for architects, together with the Architects
Registration Council of the United Kingdom,
exercises control over standards in
architectural education and encourages high
architectural standards in the profession. The
Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland
is allied to it, as is the Royal Society of
Ulster Architects.
CONSERVATION
Britain has a long tradition of conservation,
and for many years has had policies and laws
designed to protect both its natural
environment and built heritage. A wide variety
of designations are used to protect areas, sites
and monuments that are of special interest to
conservationists, and various organisations
work towards the conservation of different
aspects of Britain’s national heritage.
Britain participated fully in the United
Nations Conference on Environment and
Development (UNCED), popularly known as
the ‘Earth Summit’, held in Rio de Janeiro in
June 1992, and is committed to carrying the
process forward. Among the agreements
reached was a framework convention on
climate change (see p. 133), a convention on
biodiversity (see p. 133), ‘Agenda 21’ (an
action framework for the 21st century), a
declaration setting out clear principles for
sustainable development, and a declaration
for the management of forests.
In January 1994, Britain published its
national strategies for sustainable
development, climate change (see p. 373),
biodiversity (see p. 365) and forestry. The
sustainable development strategy describes
the likely state of the British environment
over the next 20 years, the pressures on it
and the ways in which various sectors of the
economy might develop more sustainably.
Britain’s impact on the world environment is
also described. The strategy included the
establishment of three bodies to assist policy
on sustainable development:
• an independent panel, which advises on
issues of major strategic importance to
sustainable development and produced its
first report in January 1995;
• a ‘round table’, which brings together
interests such as business, local
government and academics to discuss
these matters with ministers; and
• ‘Going for Green’, an independent
committee which will seek to persuade
individuals and groups to commit
themselves to sustainable development.
A steering group for the biodiversity action
plan (see p. 365) has members drawn from
central and local government, the nature
conservation agencies, business, farming and
land management, and the voluntary sector.
The Department of the Environment is
responsible for countryside policy and
environmental protection in England; the
Department of National Heritage has
356
PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
responsibility for the listing of buildings and
for scheduled ancient monuments. The Welsh
Office, The Scottish Office and the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland have broadly equivalent responsibilities.
Agencies such as English Nature, English
Heritage, the Countryside Commission and
their equivalents carry out many functions on
behalf of the Government. In addition, the
local authorities and a wide range of
voluntary organisations are actively involved
in environmental conservation and protection.
This Common Inheritance
The environment White Paper This Common
Inheritance, published in September 1990,
was the first comprehensive statement by the
Government of its policy on issues affecting
the environment. It summarised more than
350 proposals for tackling such diverse issues
as global warming, pollution control, the
regulation of land use and planning, the
rural economy, the countryside and wildlife.
Four progress reports have been published.
The most recent, published in March 1995,
sets out about 600 commitments, including
20 new ones. For the first time, it also sets
out the Government’s priorities for the year
ahead, and lists existing targets for air, water
and land.
Buildings and Monuments
Lists of buildings of special architectural or
historical interest are compiled by the
Government, in England with the advice of
English Heritage. In Scotland and Wales,
buildings are listed by Historic Scotland and
Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments, executive
agencies of the Scottish and Welsh Offices
respectively. It is against the law to demolish,
extend or alter the character of any ‘listed’
building without prior consent from the local
planning authority or the appropriate Secretary
of State. The local planning authority can
issue ‘building preservation notices’ to protect
unlisted buildings that are at risk for six months
while the Government considers whether they
should be listed. The Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland is directly
responsible for the listing of buildings there.
Ancient monuments are similarly
protected through a system of scheduling.
English Heritage, the government agency
responsible for the conservation of historic
remains in England, has embarked upon a
programme to evaluate all known
archaeological remains in England. This is
expected to result in a significant increase in
the number of scheduled monuments. A
similar effort is being made to increase the
number of listed buildings and scheduled
monuments in Wales.
The Government announced in March
1995 that in future owners and the
public would be asked for their views
on those proposals for listing that
result from a current English
Heritage study. A Green Paper, to be
published later in 1995, will look at
the question of consultation for other
listing proposals.
Many of the royal palaces and parks are
open to the public; their maintenance is the
responsibility of the Secretaries of State for
National Heritage and for Scotland. English
Heritage cares for over 400 properties on
behalf of the Secretary of State for National
Heritage, advises her or the Secretary of
State for the Environment on certain
categories of applications for consent to alter
or demolish scheduled monuments and listed
buildings, and gives grants for the repair of
ancient monuments and historic buildings in
England. Many of the properties in its care
are now being managed locally; 120
agreements for this are expected to have been
made by the end of 1995-96. Most of its
monuments are open to the public. Core
government funding for English Heritage is
£105 million in 1995-96.
In Scotland and Wales Historic Scotland,
which cares for 330 monuments, and Cadw,
which manages 129, perform similar
functions, with advice from an Ancient
Monuments Board and Historic Buildings
Council for each country. The Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland has
181 historic monuments in its care, and is
advised by a Historic Buildings Council and a
Historic Monuments Council.

flThis is the number of register entries, some of which cover more than one site. There are approximately 22,000 individual sites
in England.
Local planning authorities have designated
more than 8,000 ‘conservation areas’ of special
architectural or historic interest in England;
there are over 400 in Wales, 674 in Scotland
and 40 in Northern Ireland. These areas
receive additional protection through the
planning system, particularly over the proposed
demolition of unlisted buildings. Grants and
loans are sometimes available from the
appropriate historic buildings and monuments
body for works which make a significant
contribution towards the preservation or
enhancement of a conservation area.
In June 1995 the Government
strengthened the ability of local
planning authorities in England and
Wales to protect conservation areas.
New powers allow them to withdraw
‘permitted development’ rights for
certain types of development, giving
them greater influence over changes
that would affect the external
appearance of houses.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
helps towards the cost of acquiring,
maintaining or preserving land, buildings,
works of art and other items of outstanding
interest which are also of importance to the
national heritage. Government funding totals
£8.8 million in 1995-96. It also acts as the
distributing body for the heritage share of the
proceeds from the National Lottery (see p. 460).
Industrial, Transport and Maritime Heritage
Britain was the first country in the world to
industrialise on a large scale, and many
advances in manufacturing and transport
were pioneered in Britain. This has resulted
in a large industrial heritage, the importance
of which is being increasingly recognised.
Key sites are scheduled or listed; one of the
most important, the Ironbridge Gorge, where
Abraham Darby (1677-1717) first smelted
iron using coke instead of charcoal, has been
designated a World Heritage Site
(see p. 366). Other museums devoted to the
preservation of industrial buildings and
equipment have also been set up.
Britain, which pioneered railways, has a
fine heritage of railway buildings and
structures, and there is an active movement
to preserve it, with many volunteers. A large
number of disused railway lines have been
bought by railway preservation societies and
returned to operation, often using preserved
steam locomotives, and several railway
museums have been established. British Rail
formed a railway heritage committee in
February 1995 to oversee transfers of historic
railway artefacts and records to museums and
record offices.
In March 1995 the Government
announced a £50,000 grant to support
the compilation of a database listing
all ship preservation projects in
Britain. The database will help
inform future decisions on funding,
ensuring that available support is
directed to the most important
projects.
Reminders of Britain’s maritime past are
also preserved. At Portsmouth are
preserved HMS Victory, Nelson’s flagship,
HMS Warrior, the world’s first iron
battleship, and the remains of Mary Rose,
358
PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
an early 16th-century warship, raised from
the seabed in 1982. The Imperial War
i Museum has opened the cruiser HMS Belfast
to the public in the Pool of London.
Isambard Kingdom Brunei’s SS Great
Britain, the world’s first large screw-driven
ship, is preserved in Bristol.
A voluntary body, the Maritime Trust,
has been established to preserve vessels and
other maritime items of historic or
technical interest. The Trust’s vessels
include the clipper Cutty Sark at
Greenwich. In all, it is estimated that some
400 historic ships are preserved in Britain,
mostly in private hands.
Voluntary Sector
Among the organisations which campaign
for the preservation and appreciation of
buildings are:
• the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings;
• the Ancient Monuments Society;
• the Georgian Group;
• the Victorian Society;
• the Twentieth Century Society;
• the Architectural Heritage Society of
Scotland;
• the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society;
• the Architectural Heritage Fund; and
• the Council for British Archaeology.
While funded largely by private
donations, the national amenity societies
have paid professional staff and statutory
responsibilities, in recognition of which they
receive government support.
The National Trust (for Places of
Historic Interest or Natural Beauty), a
S charity with over 2 million members, owns
and protects 243 historic houses open to the
public, in addition to over 243,000 hectares
(600,000 acres) of land in England, Wales
. and Northern Ireland. Scotland has its own
j National Trust.
The Civic Trust makes awards for
development and restoration work which
enhances its surroundings. It undertakes
urban regeneration projects and acts as an
umbrella organisation for nearly 1,000 civic
societies. There are associate trusts in
Scotland, Wales and north-east England.
The Countryside and Nature
Conservation
Four government agencies are responsible for
countryside policy and nature conservation in
Great Britain:
• the Countryside Commission and
English Nature, which both act in
England;
• the Countryside Council for Wales
(CCW); and
• Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).
The Joint Nature Conservation
Committee (JNCC) is the mechanism
through which the three nature
conservation agencies in England, Wales
and Scotland fulfil their responsibilities for
international nature conservation matters
and those affecting Great Britain as a whole.
The JNCC also undertakes research in
connection with these responsibilities and
sets standards for data, monitoring and
other matters connected with nature
conservation. Important work in 1994—95
included the development of targets under
the biodiversity action plan. It
includes representatives from Northern
Ireland and independent members, and has
a supporting specialist staff. Its 1995-96
budget is about £5 million.
Countryside Agencies
The Countryside Commission, the CCW and
SNH are responsible for promoting the
enhancement of the natural beauty and
amenity of the countryside and encouraging
the provision of facilities for open-air
recreation. They are expected to respect the
needs of those who live and work in the
countryside. Activities undertaken by these
bodies include:
• advising the Government on countryside
matters;
359
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• assisting the provision by local authorities
and others of facilities for recreation in
the countryside, often within easy reach
of towns;
• providing and improving recreational
paths; and
• undertaking research projects.
Total funding for the countryside agencies
in 1995-96 is £42 million for the Countryside
Commission, £18 million for the CCW and
£40 million for SNH.
The Countryside Commission runs the
Countryside Stewardship scheme, launched in
1991, which offers incentives to farmers and
other land managers to enhance valuable
landscapes and habitats and improve access to
the countryside. The scheme is to transfer to
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food in April 1996. In Wales the CCW is
running a pilot scheme. Called Tir Cymen, it
adopts a slightly different approach in that it
applies to entire farms.
The Countryside Commission recognises
over 210 country parks and over 230 picnic
sites in England. A further 35 country parks
and about 30 picnic sites in Wales are
recognised by the CCW. In Scotland there
are 36 country parks, and many local
authority and private sector schemes for a
variety of countryside facilities have been
approved for grant aid by SNH.
Nature Conservation Agencies
English Nature, the CCW and SNH are the
Government’s statutory advisers on nature
conservation in their areas. Their work
includes:
• establishing and managing national nature
reserves and encouraging the
establishment of local nature reserves;
• advising the Government;
• identifying, notifying and monitoring
Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(SSSIs);
• providing general nature conservation
information and advice;
• giving grants; and
• supporting and conducting research.
English Nature’s funding for 1995-96 is
£40.4 million.
There are over 300 national nature reserves
covering some 190,000 hectares (468,000
acres) in Great Britain, and two statutory
marine nature reserves, surrounding the
islands of Lundy, off the Devon coast, and
Skomer, off the coast of Dyfed. About 6,700
SSSIs have been notified in Great Britain
for their plant, animal, geological or
physiographical features. Some are of
international importance and have been
designated for protection under the EC Birds
Directive or the Ramsar Convention (see
p. 365). Local authorities have declared about
395 local nature reserves in England, 17 in
Scotland and 21 in Wales.
In England, to assist those who have an
interest or involvement in environmental
planning and conservation action, English
Nature has mapped and is describing
‘Natural Areas’. These have a distinctive
character that derives from the underlying
geology, land forms, flora and fauna, and the
land uses and settlement patterns of the area.
The Natural Areas framework, which has
been subject to public consultation, will
underpin all of English Nature’s work in
future. This is being run in parallel with the
Countryside Commission’s Countryside
Character Programme.
English Nature enters into land
management agreements with owners and
occupiers of SSSI land, increasingly to
support management that is beneficial for its
wildlife and natural features. Payments made
under these agreements total £7 million a
year. Overall, English Nature’s grant schemes
provide more than £2 million a year to assist
local action to sustain biodiversity and
geodiversity. SNH and the CCW also enter
into land management agreements.
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland has responsibility for both
nature and countryside conservation. In
1995-96 funding for its conservation
measures is £6.6 million. The Council for
Nature Conservation and the Countryside
advises the Department on nature
conservation matters, including the
establishment and management of land and
marine nature reserves and the declaration of
360
PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
Areas of Special Scientific Interest. In all,
72 Areas of Special Scientific Interest had
been declared by March 1995, covering 75,000
hectares (185,000 acres), and 47 statutory
nature reserves have been established.
County wildlife trusts, urban wildlife
trusts and the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds (RSPB) play an
important part in protecting wildlife, having
established between them over 2,000
reserves. The county and urban trusts are
affiliated to a parent organisation, RSNC
The Wildlife Trusts. The RSPB is the
largest voluntary wildlife conservation body
in Europe.
Wildlife Protection
The principal piece of legislation protecting
wildlife in Great Britain is the Wildlife and
Countryside Act 1981. This has:
• extended the list of protected species;
• restricted the introduction into the
countryside of animals not normally
found in the wild in Britain; and
• afforded greater protection for SSSIs
than previously and made provision for
marine nature reserves.
There is also provision for reviews of the
list of protected species to be conducted by
the three official nature conservation
agencies, acting jointly through the JNCC,
every five years, and for recommended
changes to be submitted to the Secretary of
State for the Environment. In Northern
Ireland separate legislation on species and
habitat protection is in line with the rest
of Britain.
Species Recovery and Reintroduction
Extensive research and management are
carried out to encourage the recovery of
populations of species threatened with
extinction. The three nature conservation
agencies have also set up recovery
programmes for a number of threatened
species of plants and animals. English
Nature’s programme covers 32 species,
including the dormouse, the Plymouth
pear and the fen raft spider. The aim is to
ensure the survival of self-sustaining
populations of these threatened species in
the wild. SNH has a programme covering
17 species.
Schemes have been devised to
reintroduce species into areas in which they
used to be found. For example, the red kite
had died out in England and Scotland,
although it was still found in Wales and
mainland Europe. An international project
was co-ordinated by the JNCC and the
RSPB to bring adult birds from Sweden
and Spain and release them into the wild in
areas which the species no longer inhabited.
Other species reintroduced in recent years
include the white-tailed sea eagle and the
large blue butterfly. The Royal Botanic
Gardens at Kew holds seeds from about
3,000 plant species which are extinct or
under severe threat in the wild, and has had
some success with reintroduction projects.
The Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh
also plays a significant role.
Tree Preservation and Planting
Tree preservation orders enable local
authorities to protect trees and woodlands
in the interests of amenity. Once a tree is
protected, it is in general an offence to cut
down, reshape or generally wilfully
destroy it without permission. The courts
can impose substantial fines for breaches of
such orders.
Government approval for the last two
community forests in a programme
of 12 was given in March 1995. One
will be near Bristol, the other in south
Hertfordshire. The other ten forests
are near Bedford, in Greater
Manchester, east of London, near
Middlesbrough, in Nottinghamshire,
in Tyne and Wear and north-east
Durham, near Sheffield, in south
Staffordshire, near Swindon, and near
Warrington. The programme is run
by the Countryside Commission and
the Forestry Commission in
partnership with local authorities.

Where protected trees are felled in
contravention of an order or are removed
because they are dying, dead or dangerous,
replacement trees must be planted. Local
authorities have powers to enforce this.
Tree planting is encouraged through
various grant schemes. The planting of
broadleaved trees has increased tenfold
since 1985. Major afforestation projects
include the creation of a new national forest
in the Midlands.
The Coast
Local planning authorities are responsible for
planning land use at the coast; they also aim to
safeguard and enhance the coast’s natural
attractions and preserve areas of scientific
interest. The protection of the coastline against
erosion and flooding is administered centrally
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, the Welsh Office and The Scottish
Office. Operational responsibility lies with local
authorities and the National Rivers Authority
(see p. 368). New measures to protect the
coast of England were announced by the
Government in July 1994. These include the
establishment of a standing forum on coastal
management and a review of by-laws relating
to coastal management. Certain stretches of
undeveloped coast of particular beauty in
England and Wales are designated as heritage
coast; jointly with local authorities, the
countryside agencies have designated 45
heritage coasts, protecting 1,525 km (948 miles).
English Nature, through its Campaign for
a Living Coast, provides funds for groups
setting up voluntary marine nature reserves
or producing management plans for England’s
estuaries. So far, seven reserves have been
grant-aided and 21 estuary management plans
produced, covering 70 per cent of England’s
total estuarine area. There are 29 marine
consultation areas in Scotland. Statutory
bodies taking decisions that affect these areas
are asked to consult SNH.
362
PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
The National Trust, through its Enterprise
Neptune campaign, raises funds to acquire
stretches of coastline of great natural beauty
and recreational value. About £21 million has
been raised so far and the Trust now protects
884 km (550 miles) of coastline in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. The National
Trust for Scotland also owns large parts of the
Scottish coastline and protects others through
conservation agreements.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty and National Scenic Areas
The Countryside Commission and the CCW
can designate National Parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty (AONBs), subject to
confirmation by the Secretaries of State for the
Environment and for Wales respectively.
Ten National Parks have been established
in England and Wales. Their aim is first to
provide protection for the outstanding
countryside they contain and secondly to
provide opportunities for access and outdoor
recreation. They are ‘national’ in the sense
that they are of value to the nation as a
whole. However, most of the land remains in
private hands. Special National Park
authorities have been set up, one for each
park. Among other things, they:
• act as the development control authority
for their areas;
• negotiate land management agreements
and encourage farmers to manage their
land in the traditional way;
• look after footpaths and negotiate
agreements for public access; and
• set up information centres and employ
rangers.
At present, most of these authorities are
committees of county councils for the relevant
areas. However, under the Environment Act
1995 the Government is establishing new
independent authorities to run all the parks
from April 1997. This will allow better
protection and management of the park areas.
The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads have their
own independent authority and enjoy
protection equivalent to that of a National
Park. It is intended that the New Forest in
Hampshire should enjoy similar protection, and
in July 1994 the Government announced that
the planning policies that apply to a National
Park would also apply to the New Forest.
A total of 40 AONBs have been
designated, covering around 20,200 sq km
(7,900 sq miles) in England and 830 sq km
(320 sq miles) in Wales. They comprise
parts of the countryside which lack
extensive areas of open country suitable for
recreation and hence National Park status,
but which nevertheless have an important
landscape quality. Local authorities are
encouraged to give special attention to
AONBs in their planning and countryside
conservation work.
In Scotland there are four regional parks
and 40 National Scenic Areas, covering more
than 11,000 sq km (4,300 sq miles), where
certain kinds of development are subject to
consultation with SNH and, in the event of a
disagreement, with the Secretary of State for
Scotland. Working parties have made
recommendations for the management of the

Cairngorms and for Loch Lomond and the
Trossachs, two areas of outstanding natural
importance in Scotland. For the former, the
Government has announced a Cairngorms
Partnership, as recommended by the working
party. In the latter case, it is proposed that
the new local authorities will establish a joint
committee for the area. In the wider
countryside SNH provides grants for a range
of countryside projects.
In Northern Ireland the Council for Nature
Conservation and the Countryside advises the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland on the preservation of amenities and
the designation of areas of outstanding natural
beauty. In all, nine such areas have been
designated, covering over 2,800 sq km (1,100
sq miles); seven areas are being managed as
country parks and one as a regional park.
There are 11 forest parks in Great Britain,
covering some 2,400 sq km (950 sq miles) and
administered by the Forestry Commission.
There are nine in Northern Ireland, where
they are administered by the Forest Service of
the Department of Agriculture.
Public Rights of Way and Open Country
County and metropolitan district councils in
England and Wales are responsible for
keeping public rights of way signposted and
free from obstruction. Public paths are
usually maintained by these highway
authorities, which also supervise landowners’
duties to repair stiles and gates. In Scotland,
planning authorities are responsible for
asserting and protecting rights of way. Local
authorities in Great Britain can create paths,
close paths no longer needed for public use
and divert paths to meet the needs of either
the public or landowners. Farmers in
England and Wales are required by law
rapidly to restore public paths damaged by
agricultural operations. In England and Wales
there are some 225,000 km (140,000 miles) of
rights of way.
There are 17 approved national trails in
England and Wales, covering about 3,500 km
(2,200 miles), and three approved long¬
distance routes in Scotland, covering about
580 km (360 miles).
Approval for a new national trail along the
line of Hadrian’s Wall was announced in
October 1994, and formal consultations are
under way into the designation of the
Cotswold Way as a national trail. In Scotland,
a new Great Glen Way is at an advanced
stage of planning.
The Countryside Commission intends to
help authorities bring all rights of way in
England into good order by the end of the
century, and a Parish Path Partnership
scheme has been introduced, which is
designed to stimulate local involvement and
improvement. By early 1995, 28 local
authorities had joined the scheme, which is
receiving £3.8 million of government
funding. The CCW is also establishing a
network of public rights of way, and a Public
Paths Campaign has been introduced. In
Scotland a major new ‘Paths for All’
initiative is planned by SNH to promote
better access to countryside close to towns
and cities.
Approval for England’s first national
trail planned specifically for horse
riders and mountain bikers, the
Pennine Bridleway, was announced by
the Government in January 1995. The
cross-Pennine route will cover 333 km
(208 miles) from Cumbria to
Derbyshire.
There is no automatic right of public
access to open country, although many
landowners allow it more or less freely. A
scheme to encourage farmers to open
‘set-aside’ land (see p. 284) to the public was
launched in September 1994. Local planning
authorities in England and Wales can secure
access by means of agreements with
landow ners. If agreements cannot be reached,
authorities may acquire land or make orders
for public access. Similar powers cover
Scotland and Northern Ireland; in Northern
Ireland the primary responsibility lies with
district councils. In Scotland there is a
tradition of freedom to roam, based on
tolerance between landowners and those
seeking reasonable recreational access to
the hills.
Common land totals an estimated 600,000
hectares (1.5 million acres) in England and
364
PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
, Wales, but a legal right of public access exists
for only one-fifth of this area. Common land
| is usually privately owned, but people other
than the owner may have various rights over
it, for example, as pasture land. Commons are
protected by law and cannot be built on or
enclosed without the consent of the
Secretaries of State for the Environment or
Wales. There is no common land in Scotland
| or Northern Ireland.
! Voluntary Sector
| Many voluntary organisations are concerned
to preserve the amenities of the countryside,
including the Council for the Protection of
Rural England, the Campaign for the
Protection of Rural Wales, the Association
for the Protection of Rural Scotland and
the Ulster Society for the Preservation of
the Countryside.
International Action
Britain plays a full part in international action
to conserve wildlife. Its international
obligations include the Berne Convention on
the conservation of European wildlife and
natural habitats, and EC directives on the
conservation of wild birds (the Birds
Directive) and of natural habitats and wild
fauna and flora. The implementation of the
latter directive, which came into force in
October 1994, entails the designation of
Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).
! Together with Special Protection Areas
(SPAs) designated under the Birds Directive,
the SACs will contribute to a EU-wide
network of protected sites to be known as
‘Natura 2000’. In March 1995, the
Government published a draft list of over
280 areas for consultation. By August 1995,
107 SPAs had been designated.
Britain is also party to the Ramsar
Convention on wetlands of international
importance. By August 1995 a total of 90
sites in Britain had been designated under
this convention, together with a further
site in one of Britain’s dependent
territories. Britain is a party to the
Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora, which prohibits commercial trade in
highly endangered species and regulates trade
in less threatened species by means of a
permit system. Britain is supporting measures
to improve the enforcement of
the Convention.
The Convention on Biological Diversity
was signed by over 150 countries, including
Britain, at the June 1992 ‘Earth Summit’. It
requires countries to develop national
strategies for the conservation and
sustainable use of biological diversity.
Britain’s action plan for implementing this
was published in January 1994. Drawn up
after extensive consultation, it provides a
strategy for the protection of biodiversity in
Britain in the next 10-20 years. The key
objectives of this are to conserve and, where
practicable, enhance:
• the overall population and natural
ranges of native species, and the quality
and range of wildlife habitats and
ecosystems;
• internationally important and threatened
species, habitats and ecosystems;
• species, habitats and natural and managed
ecosystems that are characteristic of local
areas; and
• the biodiversity of natural and
semi-natural habitats where this has been
diminished over recent decades.
The plan commits the Government to
increasing public awareness of the
conservation of biodiversity and to
contributing to biodiversity conservation on
a European and global scale. A steering
group which is taking forward these
commitments will be responsible for
developing a range of targets for key species
and habitats for 2000 and 2010; these will be
published later in 1995.
The Darwin Initiative forms part of the
measures announced by Britain at the
UNCED meeting. It is intended to make
British experience available to developing
countries with important biological resources.
Some £9 million will be made available
over the first four years of the Initiative.
By March 1995, 53 projects, totalling
£5.6 million, had been approved.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Environmental Improvement
The Government assists local voluntary
organisations to promote projects such as
creating parks, footpaths and other areas of
greenery in cities; conserving the industrial
heritage and the natural environment; and
recycling waste. The Department of the
Environment makes grants through the
Environmental Action Fund, worth almost
£4 million in 1995-96, to support projects
which actively assist in tackling
environmental problems. The Civic Trust
manages a Local Projects Fund for the
Department, from which £260,000 will be
available in 1995-96.
The Scottish Office Environment
Department is making £430,000 available in
1995-96 to 46 environmental organisations
under its Special Grants (Environmental)
Programme to help them carry out
environmental conservation, improvement
and education work. Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise (see p. 205)
are responsible for environmental
improvement and land reclamation in
Scotland. The Government’s programme of
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (see p. 284)
supports environmentally sensitive practices
that protect and enhance the countryside.
World Heritage Sites
Britain is well represented in the World
Heritage List, which was established under
the World Heritage Convention to identify
and secure lasting protection for those parts
of the world heritage of outstanding universal
value. So far 13 sites in Britain have been
listed. These are:
• Canterbury Cathedral, with St
Augustine’s Abbey and St Martin’s
Church, in Kent;
• Durham Cathedral and Castle;
• Studley Royal Gardens and Fountains
Abbey, in North Yorkshire;
• Ironbridge Gorge, with the world’s first
iron bridge and other early industrial
sites, in Shropshire;
• the prehistoric stone circles at
Stonehenge and Avebury, in Wiltshire;
• Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire;
• the city of Bath, in Avon;
• Hadrian’s Wall;
• the Tower of London;
• the Palace of Westminster, Westminster
Abbey and St Margaret’s, Westminster,
also in London;
• the islands of St Kilda, in Scotland;
• the castles and town walls of King
Edward I, in north Wales; and
• the Giant’s Causeway and Causeway
Coast, in Northern Ireland.
Support for these sites under various
programmes can be considerable. For example,
Durham Cathedral received £95,000 in
government repair grant in 1994-95.

For more than a century Britain has been developing policies to protect the
environment against pollution from industry and other sources. Laws were
introduced at an early stage to control air and water pollution—for example,
the Alkali Act 1863 and, more recently, the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968.
Legislation, revised regularly to meet changing circumstances, sets out a wide
range of powers and duties for central and local government, covering all
types of pollution, from greenhouse gases to litter. Successes include a 60 per
cent reduction in lead inputs to coastal waters between 1985 and 1993, and a
fall of over 50 per cent in sulphur dioxide emissions since 1970.
Introduction Administration
Britain supports international co-operation on
matters of environmental protection. It
develops much of its legislation on pollution
control in collaboration with its partners in
the European Union and organisations such
as the Organisation for Economic Co¬
operation and Development and the United
Nations. With increasing scientific
understanding of global pollution problems,
the Government is considering how the
principle of ‘sustainable development’, the
theme of a major United Nations conference
in June 1992 (see p. 356), can further guide
its policies and actions. Assistance is also
given to developing countries for
environmental projects, while an
Environmental Know How Fund was set up
in 1992 to help central and eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union.
Executive responsibility for pollution control
is divided between local authorities and
central government agencies. Central
government makes policy, exercises general
budgetary control, promotes legislation and
advises pollution control authorities on policy
implementation. The Secretary of State for
the Environment has general responsibility
for co-ordinating the work of the
Government on environmental protection. In
Scotland and Wales the respective
Secretaries of State are responsible for co¬
ordinating pollution control within their
countries. In Northern Ireland, this
responsibility rests with the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland. Local
authorities also have important duties and
powers. They are responsible for matters
such as:
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• collection and disposal of domestic
wastes;
• keeping the streets clean from litter;
• control of air pollution from domestic
and from many industrial premises; and
• noise and general nuisance abatement.
The National Rivers Authority (NRA) is
responsible for monitoring water quality and
the control of water pollution in England and
Wales. It spent £89.9 million on pollution
control in 1994-95. In Scotland, the river
purification authorities have statutory
responsibility for water pollution control; the
aggregate annual expenditure of the seven
mainland authorities is more than £13 million.
In Northern Ireland, water quality is monitored
by the Environment Service of the Department
of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales Her Majesty’s
Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) has an
important role in the control of emissions to
land, air and water from certain industrial
processes through the mechanism of
‘integrated pollution control’ (see p. 369). Her
Majesty’s Industrial Pollution Inspectorate
(HMIPI) is the Scottish equivalent of HMIP.
The Environment Act 1995 includes
provisions to bring together the
functions of HMIP and the NRA,
together with those presently
exercised by waste regulation
authorities, into a single Environment
Agency. A Scottish Environment
Protection Agency will be set up to
combine the functions of HMIPI, the
river purification authorities and the
waste regulation and some of the air
pollution functions of the district and
islands councils. It is expected that
the environment agencies will come
into being in April 1996.
An independent standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution
advises the Government on national and
international matters concerning the pollution
of the environment, on the adequacy of
research and on the future possibilities of
danger to the environment. So far it has
produced 18 reports on a variety of topics,
for example the use of incineration in
refuse disposal.
Business and Consumer Involvement
The Government has launched a number of
initiatives to help business improve its
environmental performance, ensure business
concerns are taken into account when policy
is made, and help consumers assess firms’
environmental credentials. For example, the
Environmental Technology Best Practice
Programme provides information to business
about the cost-effective reduction of pollution
and waste. Priority areas for the programme
are chosen in consultation with industry. In
February 1995 the Government announced
the Small Company Environmental and
Energy Management Assistance Scheme,
which will make grants to small companies to
improve their environmental performance.
Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment
The Advisory Committee on Business and
the Environment comprises 26 business
leaders, appointed by the Government and
serving in a personal capacity. Its roles are:
• advising the Government on
environmental issues of concern to
business;
• providing a link with international
business initiatives on the environment;
and
• helping to mobilise the business
community through demonstrating good
environmental practice.
Much of the Committee’s work is carried on
through working groups which concentrate
on a particular area.
British Standard on Environmental
Management
In 1994 the British Standards Institution (see
p. 206) published BS7750, the world’s first
standard for environmental management
systems. Having been tested in a wide range
of businesses and other bodies, the standard
368
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
can be used by any organisation. BS7750
shares many features of the widely-used BS
EN ISO 9000—formerly BS5750—quality
management standard. The first BS7750
certificates were awarded to 20 companies in
March 1995.
Eco-Management and Audit
In 1993 the European Union adopted a
regulation setting up a voluntary eco-
management and audit scheme, which became
operational throughout the EU in April 1995.
Although it is intended primarily for the
manufacturing, power and waste disposal
sectors, its use can be extended to other
sectors on an experimental basis. The first
such adaptation was the British scheme for
local government. Registration covers
individual sites1 rather than companies’ entire
operations. An essential component is an
environmental management scheme such as
BS7750, which has been designed to be fully
compatible with the scheme. Those seeking
registration must first prepare and publish an
environmental statement which, together with
the management system, needs to be verified
by an accredited independent body. A full
cycle of review and verification must be
conducted at least once every three years.
In August 1995 five British companies
became the first in Europe to register
their sites for the eco-management
and audit scheme. This entitles them
to use a special statement and
graphic incorporating the European
gold stars on a blue background, so
that members of the public can
identify which sites are participating
in the scheme.
Integrated Pollution Control
Under the Environmental Protection Act
1990, a system of ‘integrated pollution
control’ (IPC) is being phased in to control
certain categories of industrial pollution. The
Or operational units in the case of local authorities.
potentially most harmful processes are
specified for IPC, and require authorisation
from HMIP. The NRA is responsible for
monitoring waters receiving discharges
authorised under IPC. Emissions to air from
more minor processes are controlled under a
parallel system of local authority air pollution
control. In granting authorisation for releases
under IPC, HMIP requires the use of the
best available techniques not entailing
excessive cost to prevent or minimise
polluting emissions and to ensure that any
releases are made harmless. The staff of the
Inspectorate has been increased considerably
to allow the full implementation of IPC, and
its performance report shows that the number
of regulatory visits is well above target.
In Scotland, IPC is administered by
HMIPI jointly with the river purification
authorities. In Northern Ireland broadly
similar controls are exercised by the
Environment Service, and proposals are being
formulated for the introduction of a system
of air pollution control similar to IPC. The
Government has secured agreement to the
introduction of IPC on the British model
within the EC, where a directive on
integrated pollution prevention and control is
expected to be adopted shortly.
Land
Certain local authorities are designated as
waste collection, waste disposal or waste
regulation authorities, responsible for
different parts of the process of dealing with
controlled wastes. Legislation has also
established a licensing system for waste
disposal sites, treatment plants and storage
facilities receiving controlled wastes.
‘special’—that is, hazardous—wastes are
subject to additional controls. Responsibility
for proper handling of waste falls on
everyone who has control of it from
production to final disposal or reclamation.
Operators now remain responsible for their
sites until the waste regulation authority is
satisfied that no future hazard is likely to
arise. In England and Wales local authorities’
waste disposal operations are being
transferred to ‘arm’s length’ companies or
private contractors so as to separate them
369
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
from the authorities’ other jobs of setting
policies and standards, and enforcement. The
new Environment Agency will take over local
authority waste regulation functions.
In Scotland, the district and islands
councils are responsible for the collection and
disposal of refuse. They are currently also the
waste regulation authorities, but the new
Scottish Environment Protection Agency will
take over that function. In Northern Ireland,
responsibility for the collection, disposal and
regulation of waste currently rests with the
district councils. However, the separation and
centralisation of waste regulation is proposed.
HMIP, the NRA and the Hazardous
Waste Inspectorate for Scotland may advise
local authorities on how to improve their
control of waste management and on how to
work towards environmentally acceptable
standards for dealing with hazardous wastes. In
Northern Ireland, similar advice is offered to
district councils by the Environment Service.
The Government has introduced a landfill
tax (see p. 162), which will provide a fiscal
incentive for waste minimisation and recycling.
Litter
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any
public place in the open air or to dump
rubbish except in designated places. The
maximum penalty was raised in 1992 to
£2,500. Local authorities have a duty to keep
their public land as free of litter and refuse
(including dog faeces) as practicable.
Members of the public have powers to take
action against those who fail to comply with
their responsibilities.
To help counteract the problem of litter,
financial support—totalling £3 million in
1995-96—is given to the Tidy Britain Group,
which is recognised as the national agency for
tackling litter. It provides a comprehensive
programme in collaboration with local
authorities and the private sector. The Group
secures sponsorship from industry to
undertake anti-litter programmes such as its
Neighbourhood Care Scheme.
Recycling and Materials Reclamation
The Government encourages the reclamation
and recycling of waste materials whenever
this is the best practicable environmental
option; its target is for half of all recyclable
household waste to be recycled by 2000.
Local authorities have to make plans for the
recycling of waste. Waste disposal authorities
in England must pay ‘recycling credits’ to
waste collection authorities to pass on the full
equivalent in disposal costs where waste is
recycled. In Wales and Scotland, the same
authorities handle waste collection and
disposal, so that the need for payments does
not arise. The Environment Act 1995 gives
the Government reserve powers to place an
obligation on businesses to re-use, recover or
recycle products and materials.
Britain’s first recycled products guide
was published in March 1995 by Waste
Watch, a national body promoting
waste reduction and recycling. The
guide lists over 400 products which
contain recycled materials.
The Government has supported pilot
recycling initiatives in Sheffield, Cardiff,
Dundee and the county of Devon, which
have tested a variety of collection and sorting
methods. Members of the public can deposit
used glass containers for recycling in bottle
banks. There are over 15,000 such sites in
Britain, and about 4,500 can banks. There are
also nearly 6,000 paper banks and, in some
places, plastics or textiles banks. In addition,
voluntary organisations arrange collections of
waste material, and the local authority can
pay them a recycling credit for doing so.
Water
All discharges to water in Britain require the
consent of the regulatory authority. In
England and Wales the NRA’s principal
method of controlling water pollution is
through the regulation of all effluent
discharges into groundwaters, inland and
coastal waters (except those releases subject
to IPC, which are controlled by HMIP). The
NRA maintains public registers containing
information about water quality, discharge
consents and authorisations from HMIP.
370
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
HMIP maintains registers of authorisations
and associated monitoring. The new
Environment Agency will take over these
functions from April 1996. Similar
arrangements apply in Scotland, where
control is exercised by the river purification
authorities. In Northern Ireland the
Environment Service is responsible for
controlling water pollution.
The Government introduced regulations
for a new system of classifying water quality
in England and Wales in 1994. This system
will provide the basis for setting statutory
water quality objectives (SWQOs). It is
intended that, following a pilot phase, these
will be phased in gradually, specifying for
each individual stretch of water the standards
that should be reached and the target date for
achieving them. The system of SWQOs will
provide the framework for the NRA to set
discharge consents. Once objectives are set,
the NRA will be under a duty to use its
powers to ensure that they are met. In
February 1995 the Government announced
consultations on a small batch of pilot
SWQOs. The experience gained from these
will be valuable in determining whether to
proceed in other water catchment areas and,
if so, what targets for implementation would
be realistic.
More than 95 per cent of the population in
Britain live in properties connected to a
sewer, and sewage treatment works serve over
80 per cent of the population. In England and
Wales the water industry is committed to an
investment programme of some £11,000
million over ten years for improvements to
water quality. Progressively higher treatment
standards for industrial waste effluents and
new measures to combat pollution from
agriculture are expected to bring further
improvements in water quality. In Scotland,
sewage treatment and disposal come within
the water and sewerage programme, which
will total more than £728 million in the three
years to 1995-96.
Over the past 30 years, notable progress
has been made in cleaning up the previously
heavily polluted major estuaries of the east
coast of Britain, including the Forth, Tees,
Thames and Tyne. Results from the
monitoring of inland waters in England and
Wales indicate good progress, with over
90 per cent of rivers and canals now of
good or fair quality.
Bathing Waters and Coastal Sewage Discharges
The water industry is investing roughly
£2,000 million to provide treatment of coastal
sewage discharges and improve the quality of
Britain’s bathing waters. In the 1994 tests of
bathing water quality, 82 per cent of
identified bathing waters (376 out of 457) in
Britain met the mandatory coliform bacteria
standards of the EC bathing water directive,
compared with 66 per cent of beaches in
1988. The bulk of the improvement
programme should be complete by about the
end of 1995. Sea dumping of sewage sludge
will cease by the end of 1998.
Marine Environment
In 1992 a new Convention for the Protection
of the Marine Environment of the North East
Atlantic was agreed in Paris. It covers both
land and sea, sets targets for the introduction
of additional safeguards for the area, and
requires contracting parties to take all
possible steps to prevent or eliminate
pollution through an action plan subject to
annual review. Britain is also a leading
participant in the series of North Sea
Conferences, an international forum of
countries bordering the North Sea. Good
progress is being made in meeting North Sea
Conference targets for reducing the input of
dangerous substances into the sea. For example,
direct and riverine inputs of cadmium, lead and
mercury to coastal waters were more than
halved between 1985 and 1993.
International action on the prevention of
pollution from ships is taken through the
International Maritime Organization (IMO).
Britain applies international requirements to
all ships in British waters and to British ships
wherever they are. Enforcement is
undertaken by the Department of Transport.
The Marine Pollution Control Unit
(MPCU), part of the Coastguard Agency, is
responsible for dealing with spillages of oil or
other hazardous substances from ships at sea.
The Government’s national contingency plan,
371
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which is developed and maintained by the
MPCU, sets out arrangements for dealing
with pollution. The Unit has at its disposal
various counter-pollution facilities, including:
• remote sensing surveillance aircraft;
• aerial and seaborne spraying equipment;
• stocks of oil dispersants;
• mechanical recovery and cargo transfer
equipment; and
• specialised beach cleaning equipment.
Licences for oil and gas exploration
include special conditions designed to protect
the environment. These conditions are set in
consultation with a number of bodies with
environmental interests, including the relevant
government departments and the Joint
Nature Conservation Committee (see p. 359).
Applicants for licences in sensitive areas must
demonstrate that they have addressed the
environmental concerns when developing
their work programme. Before commencing
offshore operations, the operators are
required to have oil spill contingency plans.
In addition, all discharges that contain oil are
controlled under the Prevention of Oil
Pollution Act 1971, and limits are set for the
permissible level of oil discharged. In
response to requests from the North Sea
Conference, progressively tighter limits on oil
discharged with drill cuttings have been set.
This has resulted in the quantity of oil
discharges from this source from installations
in British waters falling from 18,500 tonnes
in 1988 to 3,820 tonnes in 1994.
Britain ended the dumping of industrial
waste at sea in 1992. Waste has not been
licensed for incineration at sea since 1990.
Under the North East Atlantic Convention,
and the earlier convention it replaces, the
dumping at sea of most types of waste will be
phased out over the next few years. In
February 1994 Britain announced that it was
accepting an internationally-agreed indefinite
ban on the sea dumping of low and
intermediate level radioactive waste.
Air
Air quality in Britain has improved
considerably in the last 30 years. Total
emissions of smoke in the air have fallen by
over 85 per cent since 1960. London and
other major cities no longer have the dense
smoke-laden ‘smogs’ of the 1950s and in
central London winter sunshine has increased
bv about 70 per cent since 1958. However,
new concerns have arisen, especially over the
emissions from the growing number of motor
vehicles and the possible impact on health.
Measures have consequently been adopted to
reduce substantially emissions from new
vehicles (see p. 374).
Responsibility for clean air rests primarily
with local authorities. They may declare
‘smoke control areas’ within which the
emission of smoke from chimneys is an
offence. About two-thirds of the dwellings in
conurbations are covered by smoke control
orders—around 6,340 are in force. Those
industrial processes with the greatest
potential for harmful emissions are controlled
under the Environmental Protection Act
1990, enforced in England and Wales by
HMIP, and are becoming subject to IPC.
Processes with a significant but lesser
potential for air pollution require approval
from local authorities. Local authorities also
control emissions of dark smoke from trade
and industrial premises.
In October 1994 the Government
announced funding of £5 million for
a co-ordinated programme of
research on air pollution and
respiratory disease. Ten key areas will
be addressed, including the short- and
long-term effects of exposure to air
pollutants, and the development of
methods for measuring personal
exposure to air pollutants.
Britain’s automatic air quality monitoring
network is being extended and upgraded at a
cost of over £4 million a year. Since 1990, the
Department of the Environment’s Air Quality
Bulletins have made daily air pollution data
from the monitoring network available to the
public. These give the concentrations of three
main pollutants—ozone, nitrogen dioxide and
sulphur dioxide (SCL), together with an air
pollution forecast—and grade air quality on a
scale between ‘very poor' and ‘very good’. The
372
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
information features in television and radio
weather reports, and appears in many national
and local newspapers. The data are also
available on a special free telephone number,
on videotext systems and on the Internet.
The Environment Act 1995 provides a
new framework for air quality management,
including the publication by the Government
of a national strategy which will set air
quality standards and targets for the
II pollutants causing the most concern. It also
places new duties on local authorities to
assess air quality in their boundaries and to
prepare action plans where standards are not
met or are unlikely to be met in future.
Climate Change
The greenhouse effect is a natural
phenomenon keeping the earth at a
temperature which can sustain life. But
increasing man-made emissions of
‘greenhouse gases’, such as carbon dioxide
(C02), methane and nitrous oxide (N20), are
leading to greater concentrations of these
gases in the atmosphere, which could affect
climates worldwide. In 1988 the United
Nations Environment Programme and the
World Meteorological Organisation
established the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) to consider climate
change and possible responses to it. Britain
chairs the working group which assesses the
scientific evidence on climate change. In its
1990 report, last updated in 1994, the IPCC
concluded that man-made emissions would
lead to additional warming of the earth, and
that, without any change in emissions, global
average temperature would increase by about
0.3°C a decade, which would be faster than
at any time over the past 10,000 years. Such
changes could have major effects on the
world. The IPCC is currently preparing an
update of this assessment.
Britain is on target to exceed its
commitments under the United Nations
framework convention on climate change
signed at the ‘earth summit’ (see p. 356).
Chief among these is a pledge to return C02
emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. It is now
estimated that by 2000 these will be between
6 and 13 million tonnes lower than in 1990.
Britain’s national programme for combating
the threat of global climate change includes:
• the introduction of VAT on domestic fuel
and higher duties on road vehicle fuel;
• the creation of an Energy Saving Trust,
which aims to promote the efficient use
of energy, particularly in the home;
• tighter building regulations to promote
the energy efficiency of new houses and
business premises;
• government publicity on energy
conservation in homes and businesses; and
• targets for energy saving in central and
local government offices.
The UN framework convention was reviewed
in Berlin in March-April 1995, at which
Britain called for reductions in total
greenhouse gas emissions of 5 to 10 per cent
on 1990 levels by 2010. A deadline of 1997
was set for agreeing further reductions in
emissions. The meeting also agreed the
principle of joint implementation, under
which developed countries may sponsor
reduction measures in developing countries
and have the resultant saving credited against
their own quota.
Britain is conducting extensive research
into climate change. The research programme
includes the work of the Hadley Centre for
Climate Prediction and Research, w hich
was opened in 1990 to build on the
Meteorological Office climate modelling
programme, and the construction of an
advanced climate change detection instrument
for launch on a satellite towards the end of
the 1990s.
Ozone Layer
The Government is committed to the earliest
possible phasing out of all ozone-depleting
substances. Britain was one of the first 25
signatories to the Montreal Protocol, which
deals with the protection of the ozone layer.
The protocol was last strengthened in 1992,
and now requires chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), 1,1,1 trichloroethane and carbon
tetrachloride to be phased out by the end of
1995. The supply of halons was phased out
by the end of 1993. There is provision for
373

exemptions for any essential uses. Controls
were also introduced on methyl bromide and
on hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs—
transitional substances with less ozone-
depleting capacity than CFCs), which are
needed in a number of areas if industry is to
move away from CFCs quickly but which
will themselves be phased out by 2030.
European Community regulations required
CFCs and carbon tetrachloride to be phased
out by the end of 1994 (again with exemptions
for essential uses), have brought forward the
phase-out of HCFCs by 15 years and have
capped the supply of methyl bromide.
Emissions of Sulphur Dioxide and Oxides of
Nitrogen
S02 and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are the
main gases that lead to acid rain. The
principal sources are combustion plants that
burn fossil fuels, such as coal-fired power
stations, and, for NOx, road transport.
National S02 emissions have fallen by over
40 per cent since 1970 and a substantial
programme seeks to ensure that this fall
continues. For example, under the EC
directive on the control of emissions from
large combustion plants, the Government has
published a national plan setting out phased
reductions in emissions from existing plants
of NOx up to 1998 and of S02 up to 2003. A
new United Nations agreement on S02 was
reached in 1994, with Britain accepting an
80 per cent reduction on 1980 levels by
2010, with intermediate targets of 50 per cent
reductions by 2000 and 70 per cent by 2005.
The Government will consult on a draft
strategy to implement this during 1995.
The damaging effect of acid depositions
from combustion processes on freshwaters and
soils has been demonstrated by scientific
research. The Government is spending about
£10 million a year on an extensive research
programme into the causes and effects of acid
rain, and the likely results of possible abatement
technologies. Lower emissions of S02 over
the past 20 years (see graph) have led to the
first signs of a decrease in acidification in
some lochs in south-west Scotland.
Vehicle Emissions
Stringent emission standards for passenger
cars were introduced at the end of 1992,
which effectively require petrol-engined cars to
be fitted with catalytic converters. These
typicallv reduce emissions by over 75 per cent.
Diesel cars are also subject to strict controls
on particulate emissions. Since 1994, vans
have had to meet the same limit as cars.
Stricter controls for heavy diesel vehicles,
374
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
including lorries and buses, were introduced in
1993. Further cuts will be introduced in 1997.
Compulsory tests of emissions from
II vehicles in use are a key element in Britain’s
strategy for improving air quality. Britain has
introduced metered emission tests and smoke
I checks into the annual test for cars and vans
and into the annual roadworthiness test for
lorries and buses. In September 1995, in-
I service limits were further tightened, with
| special tests to be applied to catalyst vehicles
from January 1996. Enforcement checks
ii carried out at the roadside or in operators’
premises also include at least a visual check
| for excessive smoke. Wherever possible, a
smoke meter is used for borderline cases. The
Vehicle Inspectorate (see p. 296) carried out
more than 248,000 enforcement checks in
1993—94. In October 1994 the Secretary of
State for Transport announced that the
! Vehicle Inspectorate would—in addition to its
normal roadside enforcement activities—be
ii making special efforts to crack down on
polluting vehicles in a series of special
[ campaigns. This is set to continue for the
i foreseeable future.
As a result of these measures, a marked
and progressive decline in regulated
j pollutants is expected, which will continue
ii until well into the first decade of the
a 21st century.
Emissions of Carbon Dioxide
Sales of unleaded petrol have risen from
virtually nothing in the mid-1980s to over
60 per cent of all petrol sold. This is due
mainly to:
• a gradual increase in the differential in
duty between leaded and unleaded petrol;
• the requirement for all new cars from
October 1990 onwards to be capable of
running on unleaded petrol; and
• the necessity for cars fitted with catalytic
convertors to use unleaded petrol.
These measures have contributed to a 70 per
cent reduction of lead in the air.
The Government Car Service, which
among other things provides official
transport to ministers, took delivery^
of an environmentally-friendly
gas-powered car in October 1994.
Following trials of this car, an
assessment w ill be made of how far
to go in converting the rest of the
car fleet.
Regulations were introduced in 1994
which for the first time set compulsory limits
to the volatility of petrol. The expected
benefits include a reduction in volatile organic
compounds. The regulations also introduce a
new EC standard for low sulphur diesel fuel,
I million tonnes
375
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which will further reduce particulate
emissions from the whole diesel fleet.
In February 1995 the Government
announced a programme to cut vehicle
pollution in city streets. This included:
• new resources for a crackdown on
polluting vehicles in 23 cities and towns;
• the more rapid introduction of tighter
emission standards in the annual ‘MOT’
test of vehicle roadworthiness;
• a prosecutions crackdown, with fines of
up to £2,500;
• automatic prosecution for motorists and
vehicle operators who exceed limits by
ignoring vehicle maintenance; and
• an urgent study into the possibility of
roadside checks for vehicles burning too
much oil.
To tackle C02 emissions, in the
November 1993 Budget the Chancellor of the
Exchequer announced a long-term strategy of
annual increases in road fuel duties averaging
at least 5 per cent in real terms. This is
expected to save about 2.5 million tonnes of
carbon in the year 2000, representing a
quarter of the reduction in total C02 emissions
that Britain is required to make under the
framework climate change convention.
Internationally developed standards have also
been implemented in Britain to control the
emission of smoke, vented fuel and unburned
hydrocarbons from civil aircraft. International
standards to control NOx and carbon monoxide
will be incorporated into domestic legislation.
Noise
Local authorities have a duty to inspect their
areas for noise nuisance from premises and
vehicles, machinery or equipment in the
street, and to investigate complaints. They
must serve a noise abatement notice where
the noise is judged to be a statutory nuisance.
They can also designate ‘noise abatement
zones’ within which registered levels of noise
from certain premises may not be increased
without their permission. There are also
specific provisions in law to:
• control noise from construction and
demolition sites;
• control the use of loudspeakers in the
streets; and
• enable individuals to take independent
action through the courts against noise
nuisance.
The Government believes that
wherever possible attempts should be made
to resolve problems informally. However, this
may not always be possible, and in March
1995 it issued a consultation paper which
included a recommendation that
consideration be given to the creation of a
criminal offence of night-time noise
disturbance. This would involve an objective
standard, based on World Health
Organisation guidelines, on the levels of noise
likely to cause sleep disturbance.
Regulations set out the permissible noise
levels for various classes of new vehicle, and
a new EC noise directive is due to be
implemented by October 1996. Compensation
may be payable for loss in property values
caused by physical factors, including noise
from new or improved public works such as
roads, railways and airports. Regulations also
require highway authorities to make grants
available for insulation of homes that would
be subject to specified levels of increased
noise caused by new or improved roads.
Noise insulation may also be provided where
construction work for new roads will
seriously affect nearby homes for a substantial
period of time. Equivalent regulations for
new railways are being introduced.
Britain has played a leading role in
negotiations aimed at phasing out older,
noisier subsonic jet aircraft. Flying non-noise
certificated aircraft has been banned in
Britain, and since 1990 British operators have
no longer been allowed to add to their fleets
further ‘Chapter 2’ aircraft (noisier planes, as
classified by international agreement). The
phased implementation of a complete ban on
the operation of Chapter 2 aircraft began in
April 1995, and it is intended to phase out all
these types by April 2002. Various
operational restrictions have been introduced
to reduce noise disturbance further at
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, where the
Secretary of State for Transport has assumed
responsibility for noise abatement. These
measures include:
376
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
• restrictions on the type and number of
aircraft operating at night;
• the routeing of departing aircraft on
routes chosen to minimise noise nuisance;
and
• quieter take-off and landing procedures.
The Government has introduced a control
system for night flights combining a noise
quota with a ceiling on the total number of
movements. The population disturbed by
aircraft noise2 at Heathrow fell from 591,000
in 1988 to 429,000 in 1991, even though the
number of air transport movements increased.
This was largely because of the phasing out
of older, noisier aircraft. Under government
proposals announced in 1993, airfield
authorities would be given powers to enforce
noise amelioration schemes. The Secretary of
State would have powers to compel airfield
authorities to prepare such a scheme.
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents only a
small fraction of that to which the population
is exposed; most is naturally occurring. A
large proportion of the man-made
radioactivity to which the public is exposed
comes from medical treatments, such as X-
rays. Nevertheless, the man-made fraction is
subject to stringent control. Users of
radioactive materials must be registered by
HMIP in England and Wales or their
equivalents in Scotland and Northern Ireland;
authorisation is also required for the
accumulation and disposal of radioactive
waste. The Health and Safety Executive
(see p. 195), through its Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate, is responsible for granting
nuclear site licences for major nuclear
installations. No installation may be
constructed or operated without a licence
granted by the Executive.
The National Radiological Protection Board
(NRPB) provides an authoritative point of
reference on radiological protection. Following
the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power
That is, living within the 57 Leq noise contour, which is
regarded as the onset of disturbance. Using the older, broadly
comparable, 35 NNI measure, about 1.6 million people were
affected in 1979.
station in the then Soviet Union in 1986, the
Government set up a national radiation
monitoring network and overseas nuclear
accident response system (RIMNET). An
interim version began operating in 1988.
A larger and more fully automated system,
with 92 monitoring stations across Britain,
became operational in 1993.
In 1987 the Government announced
measures to deal with the problem of
radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas
which can accumulate in houses. These
included a free survey by the NRPB for
householders living in radon-affected
areas. The NRPB has designated several
‘radon-affected areas’, for example, Cornwall,
Devon, Northamptonshire and parts of
Derbyshire and Somerset. Householders in
these areas are eligible for free radon tests.
Radioactive Waste Disposal
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature and
level of activity, and the methods of disposal
reflect this. Some wastes can be disposed of
safely in the same way as other industrial and
household wastes. UK Nirex is responsible
for developing a deep disposal facility for
solid low-level and intermediate-level
radioactive waste. It is concentrating detailed
geological investigations on an area near the
British Nuclear Fuels site at Sellafield, in
Cumbria. As part of these studies, Nirex has
applied for planning permission for an
experimental underground rock laboratory,
known as a ‘rock characterisation facility’.
The Department of the Environment is
sponsoring research, in collaboration with
other countries, into disposal of high-level or
heat-generating waste. This waste will first be
stored in vitrified form for at least 50 years to
allow the heat and radioactivity to decay.
All contracts for reprocessing spent
nuclear fuel from overseas entered into since
1976 include provisions for the resulting
waste to be returned to the country of origin.
Genetically Modified Organisms
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have
many potential beneficial uses, for example,
improving crops or clearing up contaminated
377
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
land. However, their release into the
environment could have harmful effects
unless precautions are taken. The
Environmental Protection Act 1990 and
regulations which came into force in 1993
contain powers to ensure that any risks to the
environment, including mankind, from the
release of GMOs are prevented or minimised.
The new legislation sets up a consent system
for experimental releases of GMOs and for
the EU-wide approval of GMO products.
The Government has announced, in the
light of experience and developing
knowledge, ‘fast track’ procedures for the
approval of low-risk GMOs so that their
benefits may be enjoyed as soon as possible
with the least burden on industry consistent
with safety. The Government published an
advice booklet on genetic modification and
food in February 1995.
Environmental Research
Research into environmental protection is
essential to the Government’s environmental
policies. Total spending on environmental
research and development in 1994—93 was
very substantial, running into hundreds of
millions of pounds. The Department of the
Environment spent an estimated £113 million
on science and technology in 1994—45,
researching into subjects including:
• climate change;
• atmospheric pollution and its monitoring;
• toxic chemicals and GMOs;
• waste disposal; and
• water quality and health.
Other departments have substantial
programmes, notably the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, The
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries
Department and other official bodies such as
the NRA and the Meteorological Office.
Research Councils
Basic and strategic research is carried out
by government-funded research councils
(see pp. 321-5). Most have a role in
environmental protection research, but
particularly important is the Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC),
which has a Science Budget allocation of
£157 million in 1995-96. NERC
undertakes and supports research in the
environmental sciences and funds
postgraduate training. Its programmes
encompass the marine, earth, terrestrial,
freshwater, polar and atmospheric sciences.
NERC stresses international collaborative
work on global environmental issues. For
example, it is helping to develop global
atmospheric climate models and
strengthening atmospheric research in the
Arctic. A major research programme, the
Terrestrial Initiative in Global
Environmental Research, aims to assess the
likely impact of climate change on Britain
and elsewhere. NERC also co-ordinates the
development and operation of the
Environmental Change Network.

National Health Service spending in Britain was equivalent to 5.8 per cent of
the gross domestic product in 1994—95, compared with 4.7 per cent in 1978-79.
Key elements of the Government’s spending plans include: continued
expansion of primary care (family health services); improvements in the
mental health services and development of maternity care and services for
cancer patients; and a significant improvement in the standards of services
that patients can expect to receive under the Patient’s Charter.
The National Health Service (NHS) provides
a full range of medical services which are
available to all residents, regardless of their
income. Local authority personal social services
and voluntary organisations provide help and
advice to the most vulnerable members of the
community. These include elderly, physically
disabled and mentally ill people, those with
learning disabilities (mental handicap) and
children in need of care.
Central government is directly responsible
for the NHS, which is administered by a
range of local health authorities and health
boards throughout Britain, and for the
social security system. Personal social services
are administered by local authorities but
central government is responsible for
establishing national policies, issuing guidance
and overseeing standards. Joint finance and
planning between health and local
authorities aims to prevent overlapping of
services and to encourage the development
of community services.
Spending on the health service has
increased substantially in real terms since
1980, and is planned to grow further over the
next two years. More patients are being
treated than ever before. Spending on the
personal social services is determined by local
authorities. Central government has restricted
the total expenditure of individual local
authorities, but spending has risen
substantially in real terms since the late 1970s,
reflecting the priority given to this sector.
The NHS health programme consists of:
• Hospital and Community Health Services
(HCHS), providing all hospital care and
a range of community health services;
381
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• Family Health Services (FHS), providing
general medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and some ophthalmic services, and
covering the cost of medicines prescribed
by general practitioners (GPs);
• Central Health and Miscellaneous
Services (CHMS), providing services
most effectively administered centrally,
such as welfare food (which includes free
milk and vitamins to families with
children under five, and expectant
mothers, on Income Support) and
support to the voluntary sector; and
• the administrative costs of the health
departments.
Major Policy Developments
Reforms in Management
The NHS and Community Care Act 1990
introduced wide-ranging reform in
management and patient care in the health
and social care services. The NHS reforms,
which came into effect in 1991, aim to give
patients, wherever they live in Britain, better
health care and greater choice of service:
1. Health authorities and health boards have
been given a new role as purchasers of health
care on behalf of their local residents, and are
responsible for assessing local health care
needs and ensuring the availability of a full
range of services to meet identified health
needs. They ensure that those needs are met
within existing resources.
2. Each health authority is funded to buy
health care for its local residents through
arranging contracts with hospitals and other
health service units in either the public or the
private sector. For the first time hospitals are
directly funded for the number of patients
they treat, making it easier for GPs to refer
patients outside their area if treatment
elsewhere is faster and better. However,
powers exist for allocating resources where
the urgent need for treatment does not allow
NHS contracts to be arranged in advance.
3. The contracts agreed between health
authorities and hospitals set out the quality,
quantity and cost of the services to be
delivered during the year. The contracts
secured by each health authority are based on
wide consultation with all local GPs.
4. Hospitals may apply to become self-
governing NHS trusts (see p. 392),
independent of local health authority control
but remaining within the NHS. They are
accountable to the relevant health
department, treating NHS patients, and are
funded largely through general taxation,
under contracts with health authorities.
5. GPs from larger medical practices may
apply to join the general practitioner
fundholding scheme (see p. 390), under which
they receive an annual budget directly from
the health authority, enabling them to buy
certain hospital services for their patients.
The reforms in community care provision,
which came into force between 1991 and
1993, establish a new financial and managerial
framework which aims to secure the delivery
of good quality services in line with national
objectives. They are intended to enable
vulnerable groups in the community to live as
independently as possible in their own homes
for as long as they are able and wish to do so,
and to give them a greater say in how they
live and how the services they need should be
provided. (For fuller details see p. 406.)
Broadly similar changes have been
introduced under separate legislation in
Northern Ireland, where health and personal
social services are provided on an integrated
basis by health and social services boards.
Patient’s Charters
Patient’s Charters are part of the health
departments’ response to the Citizen’s
Charter (see p. 66). The Charters support the
objectives of the NHS reforms: to improve
standards of health care and sensitivity to
patients in the NHS. They set out for the
first time the rights of patients and the
standards of care they can expect to receive
from the NHS. The responsibility for
implementing the Patient’s Charters rests
with all parts of the NHS, English regional
offices, purchasers and providers of services
(see above), and is carried out mainly through
contract arrangements.
382
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
As well as restating the existing rights that
patients have under the NHS, the original
Patient’s Charter in England, which came
into force in 1992, introduced three new
rights. These are that patients must:
• be given detailed information on local
health services, including quality
standards and maximum waiting times;
• be guaranteed admission for treatment no
later than two years from the date of
being placed on a waiting list; and
• have any complaint about NHS services
investigated, and receive a full reply as
soon as possible.
In England the Patient’s Charter also sets
national charter standards, which are not legal
rights but specific standards of service that
the NHS aims to provide. These cover
respect for the individual patient; waiting
times for ambulances, clinical assessment in
accident and emergency departments and
appointments in out-patient clinics; and
cancellation of operations. Also included are
local charter standards of service which health
authorities aim to provide (see below).
Separate Patient’s Charters have been
developed for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
In England a new maternity services
charter, describing key standards and rights,
was published in 1994. This leaflet is the first
of a series of special documents based on the
Patient’s Charter. Others in preparation deal
with long-term NHS care services and health
services for children.
In England an updated and expanded
Patient’s Charter was issued in January 1995.
This has been extended to cover dental,
optical and pharmaceutical services and the
hospital environment, including cleanliness
and security. It sets out new rights and
standards, including:
• a guarantee that all patients will be
treated within 18 months of going on a
waiting list;
• a guarantee of no more than one year’s
waiting time for coronary artery by-pass
grafts; and
• a right to receive advance notification if
being admitted to a mixed sex ward.
All family health services authorities in
England have produced local charters, which
include statements of the standards of service
patients can expect to receive from the
authorities. Staff in GP practices are being
encouraged to produce their own practice
charters, setting out the standards of service
they offer their patients. By June 1995 nearly
three-quarters of GP surgeries in England
had their own practice charter.
Openness in the NHS
The Code of Practice on Openness in the
NHS came into force in June 1995.
Designed to make NHS organisations more
accountable and provide greater public
access to information, the Code will apply to
NHS Trusts, district and family health
services authorities and local health
practitioners such as GPs, dentists and
pharmacists. It sets out the information that
NHS Trusts and health authorities should
publish or otherwise make available.
These include, among other things:
• information about what services are
provided, the targets and standards set
and results achieved, and the costs and
effectiveness of the service;
• details of important proposals on health
policies or proposed changes in the way
the services are delivered; and
• information about how people can
have access to their own personal
health records.
A Code of Practice on Openness in the
Health and Personal Social Services is being
developed for Northern Ireland.
Developing Health Strategies
The Government emphasises the importance
of promoting health as well as treating illness.
Preventive health services such as health
education, and the responsibility that
individuals have for their own health, play a
major part in this. While great progress has
been made in eliminating infectious diseases
such as poliomyelitis and tuberculosis, there
is still scope for greater success in controlling
the major causes of early death and disability.
383
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The White Paper The Health of the
Nation, published in 1992, sets out a strategy
for improving health in England; its long¬
term aim is to enable people to live longer,
healthier lives. It set targets for
improvements in the following areas:
• coronary heart disease and stroke (the
major cause of premature death in
England);
• cancers (now the biggest cause of death
across all ages);
• accidents (the commonest cause of death
in those under 30);
• mental illness (a leading cause of
ill-health and also a cause of many
suicides); and
• HIV/AIDS and sexual health
(HIV/AIDS is perhaps the greatest new
public health threat this century—see
p. 400—and there is much scope for
reducing sexually transmitted diseases
and unwanted pregnancies, especially
among teenagers).
Targets were set for:
• reducing death rates (for example, from
coronary heart disease and stroke in those
under 65 by at least 40 per cent by the
year 2000);
• reducing ill-health (such as the incidence
of invasive cervical cancer by at least
20 per cent by 2000); and
• reducing risk behaviour (for example, the
percentage of smokers to no more than
20 per cent of the population by 2000).
The strategy is now well into full
implementation. In most areas there has been
steady progress towards the targets but in a
few cases, such as teenage smoking and
obesity, figures are either on the increase or
remain static. While the NHS has a central
role in working towards the targets, the
strategy also emphasises that there is a role
for everyone in improving the nation’s health.
Strategies have also been developed for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which
reflect the health variations in the different
parts of Britain. In Wales, where the first of
Britain’s four national health strategies was
published in 1990, areas for improvement
include, among others: cancers, cardiovascular
disease, maternal and early child health,
physical disability, mental handicap and
mental health, and injuries. Scotland’s
national strategy, Scotland's Health: A
Challenge to Us All, published in 1992, places
special emphasis on coronary heart disease,
cancer, HIV/AIDS, accidents, dental and
oral health, smoking, alcohol and drug misuse.
Northern Ireland’s strategy, published in
1991, sets targets for improvements in eight
key areas, which include circulatory diseases,
cancers, respiratory diseases, child and
maternal health, and mental health.
National activity in England includes, for
example, interdepartmental taskforces on
accident prevention, nutrition, smoking, the
workplace and physical activity, work with
professional and voluntary bodies, and the
provision of guidance setting out a range of
possible actions for each tier of the NHS. At
local level, the NHS is being encouraged to
form ‘healthy alliances’ with agencies ranging
from the voluntary sector through to industry
and the media. Progress towards the targets is
monitored regularly and formally reviewed,
and periodic progress reports are published.
Similar initiatives are being taken in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Government is working closely with
the World Health Organisation (WHO) in
presenting The Health of the Nation as one
possible approach for other countries
wishing to develop a strategic approach to
improving health.
Improving London’s Health Services
The Government’s strategy to improve health
services in the London area was launched in
February 1993. It proposed to:
• develop better, local and accessible
primary and community health services;
• provide a better-balanced hospital service,
on fewer sites;
• streamline specialist services; and
• consolidate medical education and
research, chiefly through mergers of
free-standing undergraduate medical
colleges with the multifaculty colleges of
London University.
384
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
As a result:
• a London Initiative Zone was
established as a focus for new investment
and new approaches in primary health
care and community-based services.
Since 1993-94 an extra £210 million has
been invested in developing primary care,
and capital funding of £170 million over
six years is being made available for
improving GP surgeries, health centres
and other premises;
• regional health authorities are continuing
to implement proposals for restructuring
the acute hospital service in London;
• plans to strengthen specialist services by
concentrating them in fewer, high-quality
centres of excellence were announced in
April 1995.
The Health Survey for England
The 1993 Health Survey for England was
published in March 1995. This was the
third annual survey designed to monitor
trends in the nation’s health. Some of its
main findings show:
• 44 per cent of men and 32 per cent of
women aged 16 and over were
overweight and a further 13 per cent of
men and 16 per cent of women were
found to be obese.
• Only one in ten adults (12 per cent of
men and 9 per cent of women) were free
from all of the four main modifiable risk
factors of cardiovascular disease—
smoking, raised blood pres, ure, raised
cholesterol, and lack of physical activity.
• among people who drank alcohol, 20 per
cent of men and 14 per cent of women
said that they felt that they ought to cut
down their drinking.
• Men were twice as likely as women to
have had a heart attack (4 per cent and 2
per cent respectively), but a quarter of
both men and women said that they had
a cardiovascular disorder diagnosed by a
doctor at some time in their lives.
• Among men participation in physical
activity decreased steadily with age but
among women there was little difference
in activity between the ages of 16 and 54.
Relatively low levels of activity among
young women (16-24) reflected the fact
that they were less likely to have taken
part in sports activities than men of the
same age and less likely to have done
housework, gardening or DIY than
women in older age-groups.
The National Health
Service
The NHS is based upon the principle that
there should be a full range of publicly
provided services designed to help the
individual stay healthy. The services are
intended to provide effective and appropriate
treatment and care where necessary while
making the best use of available resources.
All taxpayers, employers and employees
contribute to its cost so that those members
of the community who do not require health
care help to pay for those who do. Some
forms of treatment, such as hospital care, are
provided free; others (see p. 387) may be
charged for.
Growth in real spending on the health
service is being used to meet the needs of
increasing numbers of elderly people and to
take full advantage of advances in medical
technology. It is also used to provide more
appropriate types of care, often in the
community rather than in hospital, for
priority groups such as elderly and mentally
ill people and those with learning disabilities.
Increased spending has, in addition, been
allocated to combat the growing problems
arising from alcohol and drug misuse; and to
remedy disparities in provision between the
regions of Britain.
In June 1995 the Government announced
six national priorities for the NHS in England
over the next three to six years. These are:
• further developing a primary-care-led
NHS;
• securing a comprehensive range of
secure, residential, in-patient and
community services for people with
mental illness;
• improved cost-effectiveness;
385
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• giving greater voice to the users of
services, and their carers;
• securing better services to meet the
continuing health care needs of elderly,
disabled or vulnerable people; and
• developing NHS organisations as good
employers.
Similar priorities have been identified in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Voluntary Sector
Government grant aid to voluntary
organisations working in health and
personal social services in England exceeded
£19.5 million in 1994-95. The grants go
primarily to national organisations dealing
with children, elderly people, carers and
people from ethnic minorities, as well as
those looking after people with mental
illness, physical or learning disabilities, or
suffering from the effects of HIV/AIDS or
the misuse of alcohol or drugs. In Scotland
grants to voluntary organisations in social
welfare increased by 18 per cent in 1994—95,
with grants to a wide range of bodies. Health
authorities and local authorities have similar
powers to make grants to local organisations.
In Northern Ireland the Department of
Health and Social Services plans to spend
£17.7 million in support of the voluntary
sector in the period 1995-96 to 1997-98.
Market Testing
The Government stresses the need for
collaboration between the public and private
health sectors and for improving efficiency in
order to secure the best value for money in
the provision of health care services.
Since 1983 the market testing of catering,
laundry and domestic services has produced
cumulative savings of over £1,000 million,
which has been reinvested into direct
personal care. NHS managers have already
market-tested most non-clinical services,
including administrative and financial services
as well as various aspects of information
technology and communications. They are
now beginning to test clinical support
services such as pathology and pharmacy.
ADMINISTRATION
The Secretary of State for Health in England
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible
for all aspects of the health services in their
respective territories. The Department of
Health is responsible for national strategic
planning in England. Within the Department

HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
of Health the NHS Executive is responsible
for developing and implementing policies for
the provision of high quality health services.
The Scottish Office Home and Health
Department, the Welsh Office and the
Department of Health and Social Services in
Northern Ireland have similar responsibilities.
District health authorities in England and
Wales and health boards in Scotland are
responsible for securing hospital and
community health services in their areas. At
present England also has regional authorities
responsible for planning, resource allocation,
major capital building work and certain
specialised hospital services. The health
authorities and boards co-operate closely with
local authorities responsible for social work,
environmental health, education and other
services. Family health services authorities
(health boards in Scotland)—one for each
district—arrange for the provision of services
by doctors, dentists, pharmacists and
opticians, as well as administering their
contracts. There are community health
councils (local health councils in Scotland)
for each district, representing local opinion
on the health services provided.
In Northern Ireland health and social
services boards are responsible as agents of the
Department of Health and Social Services for
assessing the health and social care needs of
their resident populations. The representation
of public opinion on these services is provided
for by area health and social services councils.
Legislation passed in 1995 aims to
continue streamlining of the administrative
structure of the NHS in England and Wales.
The measures will be fully in force from
April 1996 and will:
• abolish the regional health authorities in
England, and replace them with eight
regional offices of the NHS Executive,
employing a maximum of 1,100 staff and
operating with a lighter touch; and
• replace district health authorities and
family health services authorities with
single all-purpose health authorities.
The abolition of regional health authorities
and merger of district health authorities and
family health services authorities will result
in savings approaching £60 million in
1996-97. By 1997-98, when the new
structure is fully implemented, these savings
will rise to nearly £150 million a year, and
will be retained by the NHS and reinvested
in patient care.
Finance
Almost 83 per cent of the cost of the health
service in Great Britain is paid for through
general taxation. The rest is met from:
• the NHS element of National Insurance
contributions, paid by employed people,
their employers, and self-employed
people (13 per cent);
• charges towards the cost of certain items
such as drugs prescribed by family
doctors, and general dental treatment (3.5
per cent); and
• other receipts, including land sales and
the proceeds of income generation
schemes (0.8 per cent).
Health authorities may raise funds
from voluntary sources. Certain hospitals
increase revenue by taking private patients,
who pay the full cost of their accommodation
and treatment.
Almost 80 per cent of medical prescription
items are supplied free. Prescription charges
do not apply to the following:
• children under 16 years (or young people
under 19 and still in full-time education);
• expectant mothers and women who have
had a baby in the past year;
• women aged 60 and over and men aged
65 and over;
• patients suffering from certain specified
medical conditions;
• war and armed forces disablement
pensioners (for prescriptions which relate
to the disability for which they receive a
war pension); and
• people in families who are receiving
Income Support, Family Credit or
Disability Working Allowance (and had
savings of £8,000 or less when Disability
Working Allowance was claimed—see
p. 421); and people or families with
low incomes.

There are proportional charges for most
types of NHS dental treatment, including
examinations. However, women who were
pregnant when the dentist accepted them for
treatment or who have had a baby in the past
year, anyone under the age of 18 (or 19 if in
full-time education), people in families
receiving Income Support or Family Credit,
and people in families assessed as having a
low income, do not have to pay.
Sight tests are free to children, full time
students under the age of 19, people in
families receiving Income Support, Family
Credit or Disability Working Allowance and
those with specified medical needs. A
voucher to help with the cost of spectacles is
also available for children, full-time students
under the age of 19, people receiving the
above benefits and those requiring certain
complex lenses. Other people on low incomes
may apply for help under the NHS Low
Income Scheme.
Hospital staff are salaried and may be
employed full time or part time. Family
practitioners (doctors, dentists, optometrists
and community pharmacists) are self-
employed or, in the case of pharmacists,
employed by a pharmacy company, and have
contracts with the NHS. GPs are paid by a
system of fees and allowances designed to
reflect responsibilities, workload and practice
expenses. Dentists providing treatment in
their own surgeries are paid by a combination
of capitation fees for treating children,
continuing care payments for adults registered
with the practice, and a prescribed scale of
fees for individual treatments. Community
pharmacists who dispense from their own or
their company’s premises are refunded the
cost of the items supplied, together with
professional fees. Ophthalmic medical
practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking
part in the general ophthalmic service receive
approved fees for each sight test carried out.
Staffing
The NHS is one of the largest employers in
the world, with a workforce of nearly
1 million people. Staff costs account for
two-thirds of total NHS expenditure and
70 per cent of current expenditure on
388
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
hospitals and community health services.
The sharp fall in the numbers of directly
employed ancillary staff and of maintenance
and works staff reflects the continuing effect
of competitive tendering (see p. 76). Between
1983-84 and 1993-94:
• The number of NHS medical and dental
staff in England rose by 21 per cent to
51,000, while in Scotland the increase
was 9 per cent to 7,000. In England on
average the number of hospital medical
consultants grew by 2.5 per cent a year
and the number of junior doctors by 1.8
per cent. In Scotland on average the
number of hospital medical consultants
grew by 1.7 per cent a year and the
number of junior doctors by 1.1 per cent.
• The number of scientific, professional
and technical staff in England rose by
33 per cent.
• The number of nursing and midwifery
staff, who make up 47 per cent of the
NHS workforce, decreased by 8 per cent.
The drop in their numbers in 1993
reflects the growth in bursaried students
under the Project 2000 nurse training
scheme—see p. 405. (Project 2000
trainees have full student status and are
not NHS employees.) The change masks
an underlying trend of an increase of 8
per cent in the number of qualified
nursing and midwifery staff since 1983.
• The number of general and senior
managers has risen in recent years, which
reflects the progressive introduction of
management posts in a series of phased
stages since 1986.
The Government’s aim throughout the
service is progressively to introduce greater
pay flexibility to allow managers to relate pay
to local markets and reward individual
performance. A number of measures are being
taken to provide a more effective workforce
through better management development,
education and training (see p. 404).
Health Service Commissioners
Health Service Commissioners (one each
for England, Scotland and Wales) are
responsible for dealing with complaints from
members of the public about health service
bodies. The three posts are at present held
by one person (with a staff of 80), who is
also Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (Ombudsman—see p. 60). As
Health Service Commissioner, he reports
annually to Parliament. In Northern Ireland
the Commissioner for Complaints has a
similar role.
The Health Service Commissioner can
investigate complaints that a person has
suffered injustice or hardship as a result of:
• a failure in a service provided by a health
service body;
• a failure to provide a service which the
patient was entitled to receive; or
• maladministration by an NHS
authority—that is, something that the
NHS authority failed to do or did in the
wrong way.
Complaints must be sent to the
Ombudsman in writing, and the health
service body concerned should first have been
given a reasonable opportunity to respond.
At present the Health Service
Ombudsman’s jurisdiction does not extend
to complaints about clinical judgment,
family practitioners, personnel matters and
the use of a health authority’s discretionary
powers. The Government proposes to
introduce legislation to extend the
Commissioner’s powers to cover cases
involving clinical judgments and those about
family health services.
New NHS Complaints System
Following an independent review of all
aspects of NHS complaints procedures
published in 1994, the Government is to
introduce a new complaints system from
April 1996. Under this, complaints to
hospitals, and to community health and
primary care services, will be dealt with in a
similar fashion at two distinct levels. The
new procedures aim to resolve complaints
speedily at a local level; independent panels
will be an option for dealing with complaints
that cannot be resolved simply and quickly.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES
The family health services are those given to
patients by doctors (GPs), dentists, opticians
and pharmacists of their own choice. They
remain the first point of contact most people
have with the NHS. Every year there are
about 250 million consultations with GPs and
about 6 million people visit a pharmacy every
day. Many of those who visit their GP or
dentist need no clinical treatment but instead
healthy lifestyle counselling and preventive
health care advice. The Government’s
longstanding policy has been to build up and
extend these services in order to improve
health and relieve pressure on the far more
costly secondary care sector (that is, hospital
and specialist services).
GPs provide the first diagnosis in the case
of illness, give advice and may prescribe a
suitable course of treatment or refer a patient
to the more specialised services and hospital
consultants. About four-fifths of GPs in
Britain work in partnerships or group
practices. Primary health-care teams also
include health visitors and district nurses,
midwives, and sometimes social workers and
other professional staff employed by the
health authorities. About a quarter of GPs in
Great Britain and about half in Northern
Ireland work in health centres. As well as
providing medical and nursing services,
health centres may also have facilities for
health education, family planning, speech
therapy, chiropody, assessment of hearing,
physiotherapy and remedial exercises. Dental,
pharmaceutical and ophthalmic services,
hospital out-patient and supporting social
work services, may also be provided.
There have been substantial increases in
primary health care staff in recent years. For
example, between 1984—85 and 1994—95 the
number of GPs in England increased by 11
per cent (to over 28,700); average patient list
size fell by 10 per cent (to just under 1,900);
and the number of family dentists increased
by 15.4 per cent (to nearly 15,800). The
wholetime equivalent number of GP practice
nurses increased by almost fivefold—to
9,600—and the number of opticians increased
by over 16 per cent (to 6,000).
Special funds have been earmarked by the
Government for improving the quality of
primary health care in inner city areas.
Efforts have also been made to improve
health services for ethnic minority groups.
The NHS Ethnic Health Unit, set up in
1993, works with health authorities, NHS
Trusts and GPs to ensure that people from
different ethnic backgrounds derive full
benefit from the Health of the Nation
strategy (see p. 384), local health purchasing
policies, the Patient’s Charter (see p. 382),
the Care in the Community initiatives and
the developing role of primary care. The
Unit achieves this through a number of
initiatives and project funding, which aim to
promote the voice of minority ethnic groups
in NHS decision-making at local level.
Funding of over £1 million in 1995 was
committed to projects, which included: a
Muslim health initiative in south London;
assessment of the needs of the Chinese
community for acute hospital services in
Birmingham; and monitoring experiences of
cancer patients from Asian communities in
north west England.
The Government has funded a number of
initiatives aimed at raising standards within
pharmacies and making fuller use of
pharmacists’ skills. At the local level a large
number of family health services authorities
have involved pharmacists in health
promotion campaigns and in working closely
with GPs in managing the drugs bill.
Recent Developments
GP Fundholders
In England and Wales GP practices with
7,000 patients or more (5,000 or more from
April 1996) may apply for fundholding
status.The corresponding figures in Scotland
are 6,000 and in Northern Ireland 5,000.
This is a voluntary scheme which gives larger
medical practices the opportunity to manage
NHS money for the benefit of their patients.
It aims to improve services for patients and
enable GPs to explore more innovative
methods of providing health care. GP
fundholders are responsible for part of their
own NHS budgets, enabling them to buy
certain non-urgent hospital services. NHS
390
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
costs of prescription charges and part of the
cost of running the practice are also covered.
Fundholders may negotiate for services
directly with hospitals from both public and
private sectors in any health authority or
health board in Britain. GP fundholders may
buy NHS community nursing services for
their patients, including district nursing and
health visiting services and (except in
Northern Ireland) community psychiatric and
community mental handicap nursing. In
1993-94 GP fundholders in England made
efficiency savings of £64 million, to be used
to benefit patients, for example, by buying
new equipment or more hospital care, or
improving premises.
A new option—community fundholding—
has been introduced for small practices with
at least 3,000 patients, or as a stepping stone
for larger ones who are not yet ready to
become standard fundholders.
By April 1995 some 10,400 GPs in over
2,600 practices in England had become
fundholders, and over 41 per cent of the
population are now registered with a
fundholding GP.
Contracts
The performance-related contract for GPs,
introduced in 1990, is designed to raise
standards of care, extend the range of services
available to patients and improve patient
choice. The changes are intended to make it
easier for patients to see their GP at times
convenient to them; or to change doctors; and
to encourage doctors to practise more
preventive medicine.
The new contract for dentists, introduced
in 1990, aims at improving care and
providing more information to patients about
general dental services. As a result NHS
dental care now includes preventive care as
well as restorative treatment. All adult
patients are now offered ‘continuing care’,
and dentists are encouraged to practise more
preventive dentistry for children. There are
also incentives for dentists to undertake
further training.
Plans to improve NHS dentistry were
announced in April 1995. Immediate
improvements to the existing system include:
• reinforcing the priority given to
children’s oral health by relating
payments to dentists to disease levels in
children most in need; and
• developing the community dental service
to meet the needs of patients in areas
where there may be difficulty in
obtaining NHS treatment under the
general dental service.
In the longer term the Government aims
to introduce a system of local contracts
between health authorities and dental
practices similar to that operating in other
parts of the health service.
GP/FHSA Links
Electronic links between GPs and family
health services authorities are being developed;
these aim to replace a paper-based system with
the interchange of electronic data. The main
benefits will be: speedier processing of claims;
faster transfer of patient medical records;
reduced clerical effort; and the elimination of
the risk of losing paperwork in transit.
Clinical Audit
Clinical audit is a programme that requires
all healthcare professionals to look
systematically at the procedures used for
diagnosis, care and treatment, examining
how associated resources are used and
investigating the effect care has on the
outcome and quality of life for the patient.
The Government has so far allocated £280
million for clinical audit; by March 1994 over
20,000 clinical audits had been established.
Midwives, Health Visitors and
District Nurses
Midwives provide care and support to women
throughout pregnancy, birth and the post¬
natal period (up to 28 days after the baby is
born). Midwives work in both hospital and
community settings.
Since October 1994 district nurses and
health visitors in eight pilot schemes in
England have been able to prescribe from a
limited list of drugs and medical appliances.
These schemes are based in GP fundholding
391
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
practices and are intended to reduce
significantly the time patients have to wait for
relief of their symptoms.
Health visitors are responsible for the
preventive care and health promotion of
families, particularly those with young
children. They have a public health role,
identifying local health needs and working
closely with GPs, district nurses and other
professions. District nurses give skilled
nursing care to people at home or elsewhere
outside hospital; they also play an important
role in health promotion and education.
HOSPITAL AND SPECIALIST
SERVICES
A full range of hospital services is provided
by district general hospitals. These include
treatment and diagnostic facilities for
in-patients, day-patients and out-patients;
maternity departments; infectious diseases
units; psychiatric and geriatric facilities;
emergency units; rehabilitation facilities; and
other forms of specialised treatment. There
are also specialist hospitals or units for
children, people suffering from mental illness,
those with learning disabilities, and elderly
people, and for the treatment of specific
diseases. Examples of these include the
world-famous Hospital for Sick Children
(Great Ormond Street) and the Moorfields
Eye Hospital, both in London. Hospitals
designated as teaching hospitals combine
treatment facilities with training medical and
other students, and research work.
Many of the hospitals in the NHS were
built in the 19th century; some trace their
origins to much earlier charitable foundations.
Much has been done to improve and
extend existing hospital buildings and many
new hospitals have been or are being opened.
• In England 85 major building schemes,
each costing over £\ million, were due
for completion in 1994—95. An additional
238 schemes, costing over £2,000 million
in the next three years, are planned.
• In Scotland in 1994-95 £183 million was
spent on hospital improvements; this is
increasing to £204 million for 1995—96.
Recent policy in England and Wales has
been to provide a balanced hospital service
centred around a district general hospital,
complemented as necessary by smaller, locally
based hospitals and facilities.
The hospital service is now treating more
patients a year than ever before. In England
between 1992-93 and 1993-94 the total
number of operations rose by 6 per cent to
5.4 million, with heart operations up by
14 per cent to 132,000. Over the same period,
the number of hip operations rose by 2 per
cent to over 58,000, and eye lens operations
went up a tenth to 131,000.
Waiting Times
Over the last few years there have been
substantial reductions in the number of
patients waiting more than 12 months for
in-patient or day case treatment.
• In England in March 1995 fewer than
32,000 patients had been waiting over a
year for hospital treatment, compared
with more than 200,000 in 1987. Since
March 1988 the average waiting time for
in-patient and day case treatment has
fallen from over nine months to four.
• In Scotland in 1994-95 the number of
patients waiting over a year for hospital
treatment fell from 4,193 to 1,588, while
the number waiting for over 18 months
fell from 1,838 to 99.
• In Wales in March 1995 the number of
patients waiting over a year for hospital
treatment was 4,100 compared with
10,100 in 1990. There were no patients
waiting longer than two years.
The expanded Patient’s Charter guarantees
for hospital patients, effective from April
1995, are shown on p. 383.
NHS Trusts
Under the NHS and Community Care Act
1990 hospitals and other health service units
(for example, ambulance services and
community health services) may apply to
become independent of direct local health
authority control and establish themselves as
self-governing NHS Trusts. Parallel
legislation was introduced in Northern
392
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Ireland to create Health and Social Services
Trusts, which are broadly similar to NHS
Trusts. The Trusts remain within the NHS,
accountable to the appropriate Secretary of
State and finally to Parliament. NHS Trusts
are required to publish their business plans
and annual reports and accounts, and to hold
at least one public meeting a year. From
September 1995 all annual reports must
contain information about management costs.
Each NHS Trust is run by a board of
directors. Trusts are free to employ their
own staff and set their own rates of pay,
although staff transferring to Trust
employment retain their existing terms and
conditions of service. Trusts are also free to
carry out research and provide facilities for
medical education and other forms of
training. They derive their income mainly
from NHS contracts to provide services to
health authorities and GP fundholders. They
may treat private patients and generate
income provided this does not interfere with
NHS obligations. By April 1995, 433 NHS
Trusts were running in England, delivering
nearly 100 per cent of NHS hospital and
community health services. At the same date
in Northern Ireland, 14 trusts were delivering
over 70 per cent of the health and personal
social services for the population.
Organ Transplantation
The United Kingdom Transplant Support
Service Authority provides a centralised organ
matching and allocation service. During 1994,
1,744 kidney transplants were performed. A
similar service exists for corneas and, in 1994,
2,536 were transplanted.
Heart transplant operations have been
conducted at Papworth Hospital in
Cambridgeshire and Harefield Hospital in
London since 1979. There are six other
designated heart transplant centres in
England, while Scotland’s first unit opened in
Glasgow in 1991. Programmes for combined
heart and lung and lung transplantation are in
progress and in 1994, 328 heart, 117 lung,
and 52 heart/lung transplants were
performed. The world’s first combined heart,
lungs and liver transplant operation was
carried out at Papworth in 1987.
There are six designated liver transplant
units in England and Scotland’s first
liver transplant centre opened in Edinburgh
in 1992. In 1994 635 liver transplants
were performed.
A voluntary organ donor card system
enables people to indicate their willingness to
become organ donors in the event of their
death. The NHS Organ Donor Register, a
computer database, was launched in October
1994. By October 1995 it contained over
2 million names.
Commercial dealing in organs for
transplantation is illegal.
Blood Transfusion Services
Blood transfusion services are run by the
National Blood Authority in England, the
Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service,
the Welsh Health Common Services Agency
in Wales and the Northern Ireland Blood
Transfusion Agency.
In England alone around 2.4 million
donations are given each year by voluntary
unpaid donors and separated into many
different life-saving products for patients.
Red cells, platelets and other products with
a limited ‘shelf life’ are prepared at blood
centres, and the more complex processing
of plasma products is undertaken at the
Bio Products Laboratory in Elstree
(Hertfordshire) and the Protein Fractionation
Centre in Edinburgh.
Each of the four national bodies
co-ordinates programmes for donor
recruitment, retention and education, and
donor sessions are organised regionally, in
towns, villages and workplaces. Donors are
normally aged between 18 (17 in Scotland)
and 65. Blood centres are responsible for
blood collection, screening, processing and
supplying hospital blood banks. They also
provide wide-ranging laboratory, clinical,
research, teaching and advisory services and
facilities. These are subject to nationally
co-ordinated quality audit programmes.
Britain is completely self-sufficient in
‘fresh’ blood products and the National Blood
Authority aims to meet fully the demand for
plasma products in England. Scotland is
already self-sufficient in all blood products.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ambulance and Patient Transport
Services
NHS emergency ambulances are available
free of charge for cases of sudden illness or
collapse, for accidents and for doctors’ urgent
calls. Rapid response services, in which
paramedics use cars and motor cycles to
reach emergency cases, have been
introduced in a number of areas, particularly
London and other major cities with areas of
high traffic density. Helicopter ambulances
serve many parts of England and an
integrated air ambulance service is available
throughout Scotland.
Non-emergency patient transport services
are available free of charge to NHS patients
considered by their doctor (or dentist or
midwife) to be medically unfit to travel by
other means. The principle applied is that
each patient should be able to reach hospital
in a reasonable time and in reasonable
comfort, without detriment to his or her
medical condition. In many areas the
ambulance service organises volunteer
drivers to provide a hospital car service for
non-urgent patients.
Patients on Income Support, Family
Credit or with low incomes may have their
travelling expenses reimbursed.
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation services are available for
elderly, young, and mentally ill people, and
for those with physical or learning disabilities
who need such help to resume life in the
community. These services are offered in
hospitals, centres in the community and in
people’s own homes through co-ordinated
work by a range of professionals.
Medical services may provide free artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical
supports, wheelchairs, and other appliances.
Following assessment, very severely
physically disabled patients may be provided
with environmental control equipment which
enables them to operate devices such as alarm
bells, radios and televisions, telephones, and
heating appliances. Nursing equipment may
be provided on loan for use in the home.
Local authorities may provide a range of
facilities to help patients in the transition
from hospital to their own homes. These
include the provision of equipment; help
with cleaning, shopping and cooking; care
from domestic help workers; and professional
help from occupational therapists and social
workers. Voluntary organisations also
provide services, complementing the work of
the statutory agencies and widening the
range of services.
Hospices
A number of hospices provide care for
terminally ill people (including children),
either directly in-patient or day-care units or
through nursing and other assistance in the
patient’s own home. Control of symptoms
and psychological support for patients and
their families form central features of the
modern hospice movement, which started in
Britain and is now worldwide. Some hospices
are administered entirely by the NHS; the
rest are run by independent charities, some
receiving support from public funds. The
number of voluntary hospices has more than
doubled in the past ten years. There are over
176 hospices in England and Wales,
providing over 2,682 beds; in Scotland 13
independent voluntary hospices provide
almost 236 beds; and in Northern Ireland
there are 4 independent hospices providing
64 beds.
From 1995-96 the funding allocated to
health authorities to support hospices and
similar organisations has been built into
authorities’ general allocations and is no
longer separately identified, except for the
£6.8 million allocated to health authorities
in England to enable them to arrange for
drugs to be supplied to hospices without
charge. The National Council for Hospice
and Specialist Palliative Care Services covers
England, Wales and Northern Ireland; its
Scottish counterpart is the Scottish
Partnership Agency for Palliative and
Cancer Care.
Private Medical Treatment

SOCIAL SERVICES
Many local authorities provide free or
subsidised travel, such as this specially
adapted bus in Aberdeen, for elderly
people within their areas.
There is a long tradition in
Britain of voluntary service to
the community, including the
provision of a range of personal
social services.

LEISURE
The proceeds from Britain’s National
Lottery, which started in November
1994, are used to help charities, sport,
the arts, heritage and the Millenium
Fund. Here presenter Noel Edmonds is
seen with the winner of the competition
to start the first prize draw.

HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
the independent sector in meeting the
nation’s health needs. It believes that this
will benefit the NHS by adding to the
resources devoted to health care and offering
flexibility to health authorities in the delivery
of services. Some health authorities share
expensive facilities and equipment with
private hospitals, and NHS patients are
sometimes treated (at public expense) in the
private sector to reduce waiting lists. The
scale of private practice in relation to the
NHS is, however, very small.
It is estimated that about three-quarters
of those receiving acute treatment in private
hospitals or NHS hospital pay-beds are
covered by health insurance schemes, which
make provision for private health care in
return for annual subscriptions. Over
3 million people subscribe to such schemes,
half of them within group schemes, some
arranged by firms on behalf of employees.
Subscriptions often cover more than one
person (for example, members of a family);
about 12 per cent of the population in
Britain are covered by private medical
insurance. Tax relief on private health
insurance premiums paid by people aged 60
and over is designed to encourage the
increased use of private health facilities.
Figures for 1994-95 show that approximately
550,000 people aged over 60 received this
tax relief at the cost of £95 million.
Many overseas patients come to Britain
for treatment in private hospitals and
clinics, and Harley Street in London is
an internationally recognised centre for
medical consultancy.
Parents and Children
Special preventive services are provided
under the NHS to safeguard the health of
expectant mothers and of mothers with
young children. Services include free dental
treatment, dried milk and vitamins; health
education; and vaccination and immunisation
of children against certain infectious diseases
(see p. 401).
Since 1994 government policy has been to
offer women more choice in maternity care
provision and to move towards greater
community-based care. Following
comprehensive reviews of maternity care
provision, the NHS is working towards
implementing recommendations that the
woman and her baby should be at the centre
of all planning and provision in decisions on
the care they receive.
A woman is entitled to care throughout
her pregnancy, the birth and the postnatal
period. Care may be provided by a midwife,
a community-based GP, a hospital-based
obstetrician, or a combination of these. The
birth may take place in a hospital maternity
unit, a midwife/GP-led unit, or at home.
Most babies are born in hospital. On return
home, a midwife will visit until the baby is at
least ten days old and after that a health
visitor’s services are available. Throughout
her pregnancy and for the first year of her
baby’s life, a women is entitled to free
prescriptions and dental care.
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance is provided for pre-school
children in clinics run by the community
health authorities, and increasingly by GPs.
This enables doctors, dentists and health
visitors to oversee the physical and mental
health and development of pre-school
children. Information on preventive services
is given and welfare foods are distributed.
The school health service offers health care
and advice for schoolchildren, including
medical and dental inspection and treatment
where necessary.
Child guidance and child psychiatric
services provide help and advice to families
and children with psychological or
emotional problems.
In recent years special efforts have been
made to improve co-operation between the
community-based child health services and
local authority social services for children.
This is particularly important in the
prevention of child abuse and for the health
and welfare of children in care (see p. 411).
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in
Britain in 1978, as a result of the technique
of in vitro fertilisation. This opened up new
horizons for helping with problems of
infertility and for the science of embryology.
395
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The social, ethical and legal implications
were examined by a committee of inquiry
under Baroness Warnock (1984) and led
eventually to the passage of the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, one
of the most comprehensive pieces of
legislation on assisted reproduction and
embryo research in the world.
This Act set up the Human Fertilisation
and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to
license and control centres providing certain
infertility treatments, undertaking human
embryo research or storing gametes or
embryos. The HFEA maintains a code of
practice giving guidance about licensed
centres, and reports annually to Parliament.
Commercial surrogacy agencies and
advertising of, or for, surrogacy services are
prohibited; legislation to ban the use of fetal
ovarian tissue in fertility treatment was
passed in 1994.
Family Planning
Free family planning advice and treatment
is available from GPs or from family
planning clinics. Clinics are also able to
provide condoms free of charge. The Health
of the Nation White Paper contains the
objective of ensuring the provision of
effective family planning services for those
who want them.
Abortion
Under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended,
a time limit of 24 weeks applies to the
largest category of abortion—risk to the
physical or mental health of the pregnant
woman—and also abortion for similar risk
to any existing children of her family.
There are three categories in which no time
limit applies: to prevent grave permanent
injury to the physical or mental health of
the woman; where there is a substantial risk
of serious fetal handicap; or where
continuing the pregnancy would involve a
risk to the life of the pregnant woman
greater than if the pregnancy were
terminated. The Act does not apply in
Northern Ireland.
Based on provisional figures, in 1994:
• 149,640 legal abortions were performed
on women resident in England, a
decrease of 1 per cent compared with
1993;
• 29 per cent of abortions in England were
carried out on women in their early 20s,
while only 13 per cent were on those
aged 35 and over; and
• 18 per cent of abortions in England were
on women aged under 20; of these, 11
per cent were on girls aged under 16.
Drug Misuse
Government Strategy
The misuse of drugs, such as heroin, cocaine
and amphetamines, is a serious social and
health problem, and the Government has
made the fight against such misuse a major
priority. In December 1993 the Central
Drugs Co-ordination Unit was set up to look
at existing government strategy in England
and to propose changes where appropriate.
After consultation, these changes were issued
in the White Paper, Tackling Drugs Together,
issued in May 1995. This contains a new
drugs strategy for England for 1995-98. The
strategy aims to take action by vigorous law
enforcement, accessible treatment and a new
emphasis on education and prevention to:
• increase the safety of communities from
drug-related crime;
• reduce the acceptability and availability
of drugs to young people; and
• reduce the health risks and other damage
related to drug misuse.
The Government considers that a multi¬
agency co-ordinated approach at both national
and local levels will be needed to achieve
these aims. The Department of Health will
be responsible for co-ordinating publicity
campaigns and developing a range of
materials aimed at increasing public
awareness of the risk of drug taking.
At a local level the strategy proposes
setting up new Drug Action Teams.
Largely based on district health authority
boundaries, the teams will consist of senior
representatives of the police, probation,
health and local authorities, and the prison
396
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
service where relevant. Their role will be to
ensure that action to implement the strategy
is taken locally and that progress is
monitored and evaluated.
Similarly in Scotland the report of the
Ministerial Drugs Task Force—Drugs in
Scotland: Meeting the Challenge—sets out the
framework for tackling drug misuse in a
coherent and co-ordinated way. Work on a
Northern Ireland policy statement began in
1994. Research on various aspects of drug
misuse is funded by several government
departments. The Government is advised on
a wide range of matters relating to drug
misuse and connected social problems by the
Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.
Drug Statistics
Recent drug statistics show that between
1993 and 1994:
i the number of drug addicts in Britain
notified to the Home Office increased by
21 per cent (to 34,000);
• the proportion of those notified who are
addicted to heroin, the most frequently
reported drug, fell to below 66 per cent,
but this is balanced by an increase in
notifications of addiction to methadone,
which now accounts for over 46 per cent
of notifications (an addict can be
reported as addicted to more than one
notifiable drug);
• there was no change to the proportion
of those who were reported to be
addicted to cocaine, at just over 9 per
cent of the total;
I in general the highest numbers of all
categories of notified addicts are to be
found in London, the north west of
England and some other conurbations;
and
I the proportion of addicts injecting
drugs fell slightly from 56 per cent to
54 per cent.
Prevention
The Government has run national mass
nedia publicity campaigns since 1985 to
persuade young people not to take drugs,
and to advise parents, teachers and other
professionals on how to recognise and
combat the problem. They have included
warnings of the dangers of heroin misuse
and of the risks of transmitting HIV, the
virus which causes AIDS (see p. 400),
through the sharing of injecting equipment.
Since 1991-92 the focus has changed to
give greater emphasis to locally-based
campaigns and includes work on solvent
misuse. A national television and press
campaign, aimed at raising parental
awareness, was launched in 1994, at a cost
of £2.6 million.
The Home Office Drugs Prevention
Initiative provides funding for local
drugs prevention teams in 12 areas in
England. The teams aim to strengthen
community resistance to drug misuse by
supporting a wide range of drugs
prevention activities. Since the Initiative
began in 1990 over 1,500 projects have been
supported. The 1995-96 budget for the
initiative is approximately £5.5 million and
funding will continue until March 1999.
The Initiative’s main objective until 1999
will be to assess the outcomes of the
various community-based approaches to
drugs prevention
The Government makes funds available
through local education authorities in
England and Wales to provide in-service
training for teachers involved in drug-
prevention work in schools. As part of the
National Curriculum in England and Wales
(see p. 435), children in primary and
secondary schools receive education on the
dangers of drug misuse. A circular on drug
prevention and schools, containing guidance
to help schools provide effective drug
education programmes, was launched in
May 1995.
Separate measures have been introduced
in Scotland to discourage drug misuse
through publicity campaigns and action in
the education service and the community.
National Drugs Helpline
A national drugs and solvents telephone
helpline, set up in April 1995, provides a
BRITAIN 19%: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
24-hour free confidential advice, counselling
and information service throughout Britain
to drug misusers, their families and friends,
and those wishing to know more about
drugs and solvent misuse.
Treatment and Rehabilitation
Treatment for drug dependence includes:
residential detoxification and rehabilitation;
community drug dependency services; needle
and syringe exchange schemes to combat the
spread of HIV/AIDS and other blood-borne
infections; advice and counselling; and after¬
care and support services. Facilities are
provided bv both statutory and independent
agencies. A task force has been set up to
review the effectiveness of treatment
services for drug misusers in England. Its
report is expected in January 1996.
The total amount available to health
authorities in England in 1995—96 is over
£26.7 million. An additional £1 million is
being made available to develop a range of
intervention services for young people at
significant risk, or at an early stage of drug
misuse. In addition, a specific grant is payable
each year to local authorities to enable them
to support voluntary organisations providing
services to drug and alcohol misusers.
In Scotland, £8 million is being made
available in 1995-96 for the support of drug
misuse services.
An increasing number of GPs also treat
drug misusers, but only a limited number of
doctors are licensed to prescribe certain
controlled drugs such as heroin and cocaine
to drug misusers. (However, any doctor may
prescribe these drugs for the treatment of
organic injury or disease, and any doctor
can prescribe methadone as a substitute
drug for drug misusers.) All doctors must
notify the authorities of any patient they
consider to be addicted to certain controlled
drugs, and guidelines on good medical
practice in the treatment of drug misuse
have been issued to doctors.
Other Services
A number of non-statutory agencies work
with and complement health service
provision. Advice and rehabilitation services,
including residential facilities, for example,
are provided by many voluntary
organisations. Support in the community is
provided by the probation service and local
social services departments (and in Scotland
by social work departments).
Solvent Misuse
Government policy aims to prevent solvent
misuse through educating young people,
parents and professionals and, where
practicable, restricting the sales of solvent-
based liquefied gas and aerosol products to
young people. National television and press
publicity campaigns, targeted at parents, were
run in 1992 and 1994.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it
is an offence to supply such substances to
children under 18 if the supplier knows or
has reason to believe they are to be used to
cause intoxication. In Scotland proceedings
can be taken under the common law.
The Department of Health funds a
hospital-based unit in London to collect and
publish annually the mortality statistics
associated with solvent misuse. The statistics
for 1993 show the number of deaths having
fallen to 73, the lowest figure for ten years.
Alcohol Misuse
Alcohol is consumed by over 90 per cent of
the adult population. It is estimated that
about 7.8 million people over 16 in England
and Wales (26 per cent of men and 11 per
cent of women) drink more than the
currently recommended sensible levels and
that 1.5 million people drink at a dangerous
level. An estimated 9 million working days
each year are lost through alcohol-related
absence. The costs of alcohol misuse to the
NHS have been estimated (at 1990 prices) at
£149 million a year, and the total cost to
society at £2,500 million.
The Government recognises the harm that
results from the misuse of alcohol; its
approach is to encourage people who wish to
drink to confine their drinking to sensible
levels and to appropriate occasions. It
considers that education about sensible
398
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
drinking helps individuals to make informed
choices about their drinking. It seeks to
tackle alcohol-related problems through a
co-ordinated programme of action across
government departments, and involving
health and local authorities, the independent
sector, employers and the alcohol industry.
In reports published in 1986 and 1987
the British medical profession advised that
sustained drinking above 21 units of alcohol
a week by men and 14 units a week by
women progressively increased the risk to
health, and that drinking over 50 units a
week by men and over 35 units by women
was definitely dangerous. (A unit is 8
grammes of pure alcohol: roughly
equivalent to half a pint of ordinary strength
beer or lager; or a glass of wine; or—in
England, Scotland and Wales—a pub
measure of spirits.)1 The Government
incorporated this advice in the Health of the
Nation targets relating to alcohol. The
sensible drinking message is currently under
review in the light of recent scientific and
medical research.
Part of the funds of the Health Education
Authority (see p. 402) are for promoting the
sensible drinking message in England, and
equivalent bodies are similarly funded in
other parts of Britain. At a local level this
requires co-ordinated action by a wide range
of organisations with an interest in the use
or misuse of alcohol.
Treatment and rehabilitation within the
NHS include in-patient and out-patient
services in general and psychiatric hospitals
and specialised alcoholism treatment units.
Primary care teams (GPs, community
psychiatric nurses and social workers) and
voluntary organisations providing treatment
and rehabilitation in hostels, day centres and
advisory services also play an important role.
The development of services to help
problem drinkers and their families is being
taken forward within the framework of
community care. Local authorities are
required to identify the need for alcohol
misuse services in their area, and to list the
services provided in their community care
1 In Northern Ireland a pub measure of spirits is bigger than in
the rest of Britain and is measured as one and a half units.
plans (see p. 406). They are then responsible
for arranging for the needs of individuals
with alcohol problems to be assessed, and for
buying an appropriate course of care.
There is close co-operation between
statutory and voluntary organisations. In
England the voluntary agency Alcohol
Concern, which is receiving a government
grant of about ^366,800 in 1995-96, plays a
prominent role in improving services for
problem drinkers and their families;
increasing public awareness of alcohol
misuse and harm-free drinking; and
improving training for professional and
voluntary workers.
Between 1990-91 and 1997-98 a total
government contribution of 0 million is
being allocated to Alcohol Concern for
improving and extending the network of care,
advisory and counselling services. In addition,
a grant of £2.5 million is being paid to local
authorities during 1995-96 to help voluntary
agencies improve and extend provision for
alcohol and drug misusers. The Scottish
Council on Alcohol undertakes similar work
in Scotland, with the help of a government
grant (j£200,000 in 1995-96). Research and
surveys on various aspects of alcohol misuse
are funded by several government departments.
Smoking
Cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable
cause of illness and death in Britain. It is
associated with around 110,000 premature
deaths and an estimated 50 million lost
working days each year, and costs the NHS
an estimated £610 million a year for the
treatment of related diseases (for example,
heart disease, lung cancer and bronchitis). In
addition, smoking by pregnant women is
associated with low birth weight in infants.
The Government is following an active health
education policy supported by voluntary
agreements with the tobacco industry (see
below) aimed at reducing the level of smoking.
The Government aims to reduce smoking
in England from the present 30 per cent of
adults to 20 per cent by the year 2000.
Smoking is also being tackled as a priority in
W ales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and
similar targets have been set for the year 2000.
399
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A three-year national campaign in
England, costing a total of £13.5 million a
year, started in 1994. Aimed at adult
smokers, particularly parents, the campaign is
being backed up by local activities to help
people to stop smoking. Education on the
harmful effects of smoking is included in the
National Curriculum for all pupils in publicly
maintained schools in England and Wales. In
Scotland the Health Education Board for
Scotland (see p. 402) operates a free
telephone helpline, ‘Smokeline’, which has
received over 280,000 calls since 1992 and
has been successful in helping a large number
of people to stop smoking. The Board will
spend some £712,000 on smoking initiatives
in 1995-96.
The Government also supports the work
of the voluntary organisation Action on
Smoking and Health (ASH), whose services
include a workplace services consultancy,
offering advice and help to employers in
formulating anti-smoking policies. The
Government is committed to creating a
smoke-free environment, with facilities where
appropriate for those who wish to smoke, and
has published a code of practice on smoking
in public places. Health authorities have been
asked to promote non-smoking as the normal
practice in health service buildings and to
give help and advice to people who want to
give up smoking. It is estimated that passive
smoking may cause a number of deaths
through lung cancer every year.
The Tobacco Control Alliance, founded in
1994 and supported by over 40 organisations,
calls for a concerted effort to eliminate
tobacco use in Britain, to create an
environment where children are relieved of
the pressure to start smoking, and to
encourage and help current smokers to quit.
Tobacco Advertising and Promotion
Controls
All tobacco advertising is banned on
television, and cigarette advertisements are
banned on radio. Other forms of
advertising and promotion of tobacco
products are regulated by two voluntary
agreements between the Government and the
tobacco industry.
• The first agreement bans tobacco
advertising in cinemas and in young
women’s magazines. It also prohibits
outdoor poster advertising within 200
metres outside schools; places an upper
limit on poster advertising expenditure;
and requires the tobacco industry to
remove all permanent shopfront
advertising by the end of 1996. It also
requires that government health
warnings appear on all tobacco
advertising, alerting the consumer to the
risks associated with smoking.
• The voluntary agreement on sports
sponsorship covers levels of spending,
restrictions on sponsorship of events
chiefly for spectators under 18 years, and
controls over the siting of advertising at
televised events.
The health warnings which appear on
packets of tobacco products are governed by
law and not by voluntary agreement. Packets
of cigarettes and rolling tobacco must carry
one of the following warnings:
• Smoking kills.
• Smoking causes heart disease.
• Smoking causes fatal diseases.
• Smoking causes cancer.
• Smoking when pregnant harms your
baby.
• Protect children: don’t make them
breathe your smoke.
All tobacco products must also carry the
warning ‘tobacco seriously damages health’.
AIDS
Up to the end of June 1995 a total of 11,051
cases of AIDS had been reported in Britain,
of whom 7,571 (69 per cent) had died; the
total number of recognised HIV infections
was 24,502. The latest medium-term
projection (published in June 1993) shows
that new cases of AIDS among homosexual
men will level out and that HIV infection is
declining among injecting drug misusers, but
there will be a steady increase in AIDS cases
through heterosexual contact.
400
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Government Strategy
Key elements of the Government’s strategy
for dealing with the disease include:
• encouraging appropriate behaviour
change by increased targeting of sections
of the population at particular risk,
including homosexual and bisexual men
and drug misusers;
• sustaining and improving general public
awareness;
• continuing to make HIV testing facilities
more widely known, and encouraging
health authorities to commission
additional accessible HIV testing sites;
and
• continued funding for the voluntary
sector.
The Government’s commitment to
policies in this area is demonstrated by its
inclusion of HIV/AIDS with sexual health
as one of the five key areas in the Health of
the Nation White Paper. HIV/AIDS has
also been identified as a health priority in
Scotland. A concerted approach is being
maintained, spanning government, the NHS,
local authorities and the voluntary sector
(including women’s groups, Britain’s
religious communities and organisations
working with ethnic minorities).
In England NHS funding for
HIV/AIDS increased from £211 million in
1994—95 to £245 million in 1995-96, and
local authority funding increased from
£12.9 million to £13.4 million. In Scotland
a record £24 million has been made
available to health boards for HIV/AIDS
and drug misuse in 1995-96, in addition to
their general allocations for HIV/AIDS-
related purposes, and within local authority
grant-aided expenditure around £3 million
has been identified for AIDS-related
work. Details of Britain’s contribution to
international co-operation on AIDS are given
in Chapter 9.
Voluntary Organisations
Voluntary agencies concerned with
HIV/AIDS include the Terrence Higgins
Trust, London Lighthouse, Body Positive,
National AIDS Trust, and Scottish AIDS
Monitor, which promote knowledge about the
disease and help people with AIDS and HIV.
Both London Lighthouse and the Mildmay
Mission Hospital, in London, provide hospice
care and community support. The
Government will continue distributing grants
on a yearly basis, taking into account
developing health priorities and the ability of
voluntary bodies to raise funds from other
sources for HIV/AIDS work.
Infectious Diseases
District health authorities (health boards in
Scotland and Northern Ireland) carry out
programmes of immunisation against
diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella,
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and
whooping cough.
A £20 million nationwide campaign to
immunise all children between 5-16 (5-18
in Scotland) with measles and rubella vaccine
was launched in November 1994—the
largest immunisation campaign yet mounted
in Britain.
A new immunisation, ‘Hib’, was introduced
in 1992, offering protection against invasive
haemophilus disease, a major cause of
meningitis in children under five years. As a
result, notifications of Hib infections in
England and Wales fell by 87 per cent between
October-December 1992 and October-
December 1993.
Immunisation is voluntary, but parents are
encouraged to protect their children. The
proportion of children being vaccinated has
been increasing since the end of 1978. GPs
who achieve targets of 70 and 90 per cent
uptake of child immunisation receive special
payments.
The Public Health Laboratory Service
provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England
and Wales which conduct research and
assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control
of communicable diseases. Similar facilities
are provided in Scotland by the Scottish
Centre for Infection and Environmental
Health and, as in Northern Ireland, by some
hospital laboratories.
401
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Cancer Care
Controlling cancer forms an enormous part
of the NHS’s work, consuming nearly
10 per cent of its total budget. In April 1995
the Government outlined proposals for
reorganising the provision of cancer ser\ ices
in Britain. It proposes care at three levels:
• primary care, with detailed discussions
between GPs and the hospital service to
clarify patterns of referral and follow-up;
• designated cancer units, which will be
created in many district hospitals and will
be large enough to support multi¬
disciplinary clinical teams, with sufficient
expertise and facilities to manage the
more common cancers; and
• designated cancer centres, which will treat
less common cancers, as well as
providing more specialised treatments
that are too technically demanding, or
require too much specialised equipment
to be provided for the cancer units.
The reduction of deaths and illness from
cancer is a key area in the Government’s
Health of the Nation White Paper. The
targets set are:
• to reduce breast cancer deaths among
women invited for screening by at least
25 per cent by the year 2000;
• to reduce the incidence of invasive
cervical cancer by at least 20 per cent by
the year 2000;
• to halt the year-on-year increase in the
incidence of skin cancer by 2005; and
• to reduce the death rate for lung cancer
under the age of 75 by at least 30 per
cent in men and by at least 15 per cent
in women by 2010.
Cancer Screening
Breast cancer is recognised as a major health
problem in Britain. In England and Wales
some 13,000 women die from it each year
and 1 in 14 women in England will develop
it. Britain was the first country in the
European Union to introduce a nationwide
breast screening programme, under which
women aged between 50 and 64 are invited
for mammography (breast X-ray) every three
years by computerised call and recall systems.
Some 1,600 women die each year in
England and Wales from cancer of the cervix.
The nationwide cervical screening programme
aims to reduce death from cancer of the
cervix by inviting women aged between 20
and 64 (20 and 60 in Scotland) to take a free
smear test at least every five years. Health
authorities must ensure that the results of a
smear test are returned from the laboratory to
the patient within a month.
Special payments are made to GPs who
achieve targets of 50 and 80 per cent for the
uptake of smear tests. The Government
estimates that over 98 per cent of GPs now
earn bonus payments for meeting cervical
screening targets.
Deaths from cervical cancer in England
and Wales have fallen since the programme
began, dropping from 1,942 in 1988 to
1,647 in 1992.
Health Education
Responsibility for health education in Britain
lies with four separate health education
authorities, which work alongside the national
health departments. All four authorities form
part of the NHS. They are the Health
Education Authority; Health Promotion
Wales; The Health Education Board for
Scotland; and the Health Promotion Agency
for Northern Ireland. All have broadly similar
responsibilities. Their aims are:
• to provide information and advice about
health directly to members of the public;
• to support other organisations and health
professionals who provide health
education to members of the public; and
• to advise the Government on health
education.
In addition, the Health Education Authority
has the major executive responsibility for
public education in Britain about AIDS. It
also assists in the provision of training for
HIV/AIDS workers, and provides a
national centre of information and advice
on health education. Major campaigns
carried out by the Authority include those
402
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
focusing on coronary heart disease, smoking
I and alcohol misuse.
Almost all health authorities have their
own health education service, which works
I closely with health professionals, health
| visitors, community groups, local employers
and others to determine the most suitable
local programmes. Increased resources in the
health service are being directed towards
health education and preventive measures.
I GPs receive special annual payments for
health promotion programmes.
Healthier Eating
There has been growing public awareness in
recent years of the importance of a healthy
diet. Medical research has shown that a diet
which is low in fats, especially saturates, and
rich in fruits, vegetables and starchy foods
contributes to good health and can reduce the
risk of certain serious illnesses, such as
coronary heart disease and stroke.
The Health of the Nation White Paper
followed the recommendations of the
Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy
I (COMA) that people should reduce their
average intakes of total fat and saturated fatty
acids in order to reduce cardiovascular disease.
It contained a number of dietary targets, and
the Nutrition Task Force was established to
devise a programme to achieve them.
Launched in March 1994, the programme is
being implemented through a number of
project teams in information and education,
catering, the NHS and the food chain.
In Scotland the Scottish Action Diet
Group is preparing an action plan designed to
deliver the changes recommended in a 1993
working party report on the improvements
required in the Scottish diet.
Nutritional labelling indicating the
energy, fat, protein and carbohydrate content
of food is being encouraged on a voluntary
basis. The major supermarket chains and
most food manufacturers have already
introduced voluntary labelling schemes.
Nutrition labelling is compulsory on products
for which a nutritional claim is made.
COMA’s recent reports have covered the
nutritional needs of elderly people (1992) and
weaning (1994).
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
In Britain there is no single government
department responsible for the whole
environmental health function. The role of
central government departments includes the
formulation of policy, drafting and processing
of legislation on environmental health
services, provision of guidance on the
legislation, and, in some areas, enforcement.
Environmental health services are mainly
operated at local level through regional and
district local government units.
Central government departments require
environmental health services to provide data
on housing conditions, inspection of food
premises, samples of food taken for analysis,
accidents at work and in the home, morbidity
and mortality; these are used in assessing
which services are meeting present needs and
in setting targets for future requirements.
Professionally trained environmental health
officers are mainly employed by district
councils. They are concerned with:
inspection, health education and regulation.
In Northern Ireland district councils are
responsible for noise control; collection and
disposal of refuse; clean air; and food
composition, labelling and hygiene.
The Institute for Environment and Health,
a public body established by the Medical
Research Council (see below) in 1993, is
concerned mainly with the chemical hazards
to which people may be exposed through the
environment. In Scotland the Scottish Centre
for Infection and Environmental Health
provides surveillance and advisory services on
environmental health matters.
Safety of Food
It is illegal to supply food unfit for human
consumption or to apply any treatment or
process to food which makes it harmful to
health. Places where food or drink is
prepared, handled, stored or sold must
comply with certain hygiene provisions.
Environmental health officers may take away
for examination samples of any food intended
for sale or human consumption. Specific
regulations control the safety of milk, meat,
ice-cream and shellfish. The Food Safety and
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Science Group within the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the
appropriate divisions in the Scottish and
Northern Ireland health departments help
ensure the safety and quality of Britain’s
food. The Departments work closely with the
food industry, local authorities, environmental
health departments and consumer bodies to
help ensure the provision of safe food in
order to protect public health. (For further
details on food safety, see Chapter 18.)
SAFETY OF MEDICINES
Only medicines which have been granted a
product licence may be sold or supplied to
the public. Licences are issued following
scientific assessment by the Medicines
Control Agency of the Department of Health.
(The Veterinary Medicines Directorate of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
is similarly responsible for animal medicines.)
A number of committees provide
independent advice to Ministers. The
Medicines Commission advises on matters
connected with the safety of human and
veterinary medicines; its duties also include
hearing appeals from companies against
advice that a product licence should not be
granted. The Committee on Safety of
Medicines advises on the safety, quality and
efficacy of medicinal products for human use.
In 1994, for example, a new homoeopathic
registration scheme was set up, covering
homoeopathic products for oral and/or
external use. Registered products have to
satisfy high standards of quality and safety
although no evidence of efficacy is required.
The Advisory Board on Homoeopathic
Products was also established in 1994.
RESEARCH
The Department of Health in England
manages a programme of health and personal
social services research. Priority areas include
population studies of health and social well¬
being and research into lifestyle issues,
prevention of illness, social care for adults
and children, and health services organisation.
Wales also participates in the Department
of Health’s programme of centrally
commissioned research. A research and
development strategy for the NHS in
Scotland was published in 1993.
It is intended that up to 1.5 per cent of
NHS expenditure will be used for research
and development by 1997.
A national centre for primary health
care research and development was opened
in June 1995. Based at Manchester
University, the centre is being supported by
a Department of Health grant of up to
£\.5 million a year over ten years.
The Department of Health is involved in
international research and development, and
takes part in the European Union’s medical
and public health research programme.
For further details of the NHS research
and development strategy, as well as
information on the work of the Medical
Research Council (the main government
agency for the support of biomedical and
clinical research) see Chapter 20.

Only people on the medical or dentists’
registers may practise as doctors or dentists
in the NHS. University medical and dental
schools are responsible for teaching; the NHS
provides hospital facilities for training. Full
registration as a doctor requires five or six
years’ training in a medical school and
hospital, with a further year’s experience in a
hospital. For a dentist, five years’ training at
a dental school is required.
An extensive review of specialist medical
training was carried out in 1992—93 and plans
for implementing its recommendations are in
progress. These are expected to have a major
impact on the organisation of NHS services
and on the role and responsibilities of
hospital doctors. They will include shorter,
more intensive and better structured training
programmes which, together with the
reduction from three to two training grades,
will shorten the minimum training time for
hospital specialists. The changes are expected
to increase the amount of service provided to
NHS patients by consultants rather than
those still in training.

HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
The regulating body for the medical
profession is the General Medical Council
and, for dentists, the General Dental
Council. The main professional associations
are the British Medical Association and the
British Dental Association.
Nurse, Midwives and Health Visitors
There are two routes to registration as a
nurse or midwife: either through a higher
education diploma or a degree course.
Most students undertake the
pre-registration Diploma in Higher
Education (Project 2000) programme, which
emphasises health promotion as well care of
the sick and enables students to work either
in hospitals or in the community. The
course lasts three years and consists of
periods of college study combined with
practical experience in hospitals or in the
community. The first half of the course
comprises a common foundation programme;
the second half comprises one of the
following specialist branches: adult nursing,
mental health nursing, learning disability
; nursing, and children’s nursing.
Midwifery training for registered general
nurses or registered general nurses (adult)
takes 18 months, but for others, including
direct entrants, the training lasts three years.
Health visitors are registered general
nurses or registered nurses (adult) who have
completed a course in health visiting. In
September 1995 new standards were
introduced and by 1988 all courses will be at
degree rather than at diploma level.
District nurses are registered general
j nurses or registered nurses (adult) who provide
care for clients in the community. As with
health visitors, new standards were
introduced in September 1995. By 1998 all
courses will be at degree rather than at
diploma level. In Northern Ireland health
visitors, district nurses and schools’,
community psychiatric, community mental
handicap and occupational health nurses
undertake a one-year diploma course.
The United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is
responsible for regulating and registering
these professions.
Pharmacists
Only people on the register of pharmaceutical
chemists may practise as pharmacists.
Registration requires three or four years’
training in a school of pharmacy, followed by
one year’s practical experience in a
community or hospital pharmacy approved
for training by the Royal Pharmaceutical
Society of Great Britain or the
Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland
(regulatory bodies for the profession).
Opticians
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician and
dispensing optician. Only registered
ophthalmic opticians (or registered
ophthalmic medical practitioners) may test
sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes
four years, including a year of practical
experience under supervision. Dispensing
opticians take a two-year full-time course
with a year’s practical experience, or follow a
part-time day-release course while employed
with an optician.
Other Health Professions
Chiropodists, dietitians, medical laboratory
scientific officers, occupational therapists,
physiotherapists and radiographers may, on
qualification, apply for state registration.
Each profession has its own board under the
general supervision of the Council for
Professions Supplementary to Medicine.
Applications for a further two boards have
been made from art, drama and music
therapists, and from orthotists and
prosthetists. State registration is mandatory
for employment in the NHS and local
authorities and is highly recommended in
other public services and the private sector.
Dental therapists and dental hygienists are
almost exclusively recruited from certified
dental nurses who have taken at least one
year’s training. Dental therapists then take a
two-year training course and dental hygienists
a one-year course; both carry out some
simple dental work under the supervision of a
registered dentist.
405
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
National and Scottish Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs and SVQs—see p. 184)
have been developed for health care support
workers, ambulance personnel, operating
department practitioners, physiological
measurement technicians and administrate e
and clerical staff.
HEALTH ARRANGEMENTS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES
The member states of the European
Economic Area (see p. 120) have special health
arrangements under which EEA nationals
resident in a member state are entitled to
receive emergency treatment, either free or at
a reduced cost, during visits to other EEA
countries. There are also arrangements for
referral for specific treatment in certain
circumstances and to cover people who go to
work or live in other EEA countries. In
addition, there are reciprocal arrangements
with some other countries under which
medical treatment is available to visitors to
Britain if required immediately. Visitors are
generally expected to pay if the purpose of
their visit is to seek medical treatment.
Visitors who are not covered by reciprocal
arrangements must pay for any medical
treatment they receive.
Personal Social Services
Personal social services help elderly people,
disabled people and their carers, children and
young people, people with mental illness or
learning disabilities, and families. Major
services include skilled residential and day
care, help for people confined to their homes,
and the various forms of social work. The
statutory services are provided by local
government social services authorities in
England and Wales, social work departments
in Scotland, and health and social services
boards in Northern Ireland. Alongside these
providers are the many and varied
contributions made by independent private
and voluntary services. Much of the care
given to elderly and disabled people is
provided by families and self-help groups.
There are an estimated 7 million informal
carers in Britain, at least 1.8 million of whom
provide over 20 hours of care a week.
Legislation passed in 1995 gives carers the
right to have their own needs assessed by local
authorities and gives those local authorities the
power to provide support and services.
Demand for personal social services is
rising because of the increasing number of
elderly people, who, along with disabled
and mentally ill people, or those with
learning disabilities, can lead more normal
lives in the community, given suitable
support and facilities.
Recent figures for services provided or
bought by local authorities show a marked
growth in the numbers of people being cared
for at home. For example, in England
between 1993 and 1994:
• the number of hours of home help and
home care provided increased by 24 per
cent (to 2.2 million), and the number of
households receiving care increased by 5
per cent (to 537,000);
• places provided at day centres increased
by 7 per cent (to 56,200), while
attendances increased by 6 per cent (to
446,000);
• the number of meals provided at home
and in luncheon clubs increased by 3 per
cent (to 794,000), while the number
receiving meals increased by 5 per cent
(to 300,000).
Almost all the growth in home help and
home care was in the independent sector,
where provision in 1994 amounted to 19 per
cent of the total compared with less than 5
per cent in 1993.
Management Reforms
New policies on community care in England,
Wales and Scotland have been implemented
in stages under the NHS and Community
Care Act 1990. In Northern Ireland similar
arrangements were introduced in April 1993
under equivalent legislation. Many of the
procedures which local authorities are
implementing correspond to similar
procedures being introduced in the NHS
(see p. 382). Local authorities increasingly
act as enablers and commissioners of
406
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
services after assessing their populations’
needs for social care.
They are now responsible for funding and
arranging social care in the community for
people who require public support. This
includes the provision of home helps or home
care assistants to support people in their own
homes, and making arrangements for
residential and nursing home care for those
no longer able to remain in their own homes.
Previously, residents of these homes who
obtained public funding received help
principally through special higher levels of
Income Support (see p. 422). In 1994-95 a
central government grant of over £1,000
million has been made available to local
authorities for community care in England.
This includes an extra £20 million for
developing respite and domiciliary care.
Local authorities are expected to have
community care charters in place by April 1996.
These will give local people more information
about the services and standards they can
expect under the community care reforms. In
Scotland the timetable for introduction will
be longer because of the reorganisation of
local government, with new councils coming
into force in April 1996 (see p. 72).
Elderly People
Between 1981 and 1991 the number of people
over 60 in Great Britain increased by about
500,000; little change is expected over the
period 1991 to 1996. The number of people
aged 75 and over in Britain is projected to
rise from 3.9 million in mid-1993 to
4.5 million in mid-2003—an increase of
14 per cent. About 5 per cent of those aged
65 or over live in residential homes.
Services for elderly people are designed
to help them live at home whenever
possible. These services may include advice
and help given by social workers, domestic
help, the provision of meals in the home,
sitters-in, night attendants and laundry
services as well as day centres, lunch clubs
and recreational facilities. Adaptations to the
home can overcome a person’s difficulties
in moving about, and a wide range of
equipment is available for people with
difficulties affecting their hearing or
eyesight. Alarm systems have been developed
to help elderly people obtain assistance in an
emergency. In some areas ‘good neighbour’
and visiting services are arranged by the local
authority or a voluntary organisation. Elderly
people who live in residential care homes or
nursing homes are subject to charging with a
means test. Those who cannot afford to pay
have their costs met by the State. Local
authorities may also levy charges for
domiciliary services.
Many local authorities provide free or
subsidised travel for elderly people within
their areas. Local authorities also provide
residential care for elderly people and those
in poor health.
As part of their responsibility for public
housing, local authorities provide homes
designed for elderly people; some of these
developments have resident wardens.
Housing associations and private builders also
build such accommodation.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Disabled People
Britain has an estimated 6 million adults with
one or more disabilities, of whom around
400,000 (7 per cent) live in communal
establishments. Over the past ten years there
has been increasing emphasis on rehabilitation
and on the provision of day, domiciliary and
respite support services to enable disabled
people to live independently in the
community wherever possible.
Local social services authorities help with
social rehabilitation and adjustment to
disability. They are required to identify the
number of disabled people in their area and
to publicise services. These may include
advice on personal and social problems
arising from disability, as well as on
occupational, educational, social and
recreational facilities, either at day centres or
elsewhere. Other services provided may
include adaptations to homes (such as ramps
for wheelchairs, and ground-floor toilets), the
delivery of cooked meals, and help in the
home. In cases of special need, help may be
given with installing a telephone or a
television. Local authorities and voluntary
organisations may provide severely disabled
people with residential accommodation or
temporary facilities to allow their carers
relief from their duties. Specially designed
housing may be available for those able to
look after themselves.
The Independent Living (1993) Fund is
an independent and discretionary trust which
provides financial help to very severely
disabled people of working age to enable
them to live independently in the
community. The Fund works in partnership
with local authorities, which are expected to
make a contribution in the form of services
equivalent to what they would have spent on
residential or nursing care.
Some authorities provide free or
subsidised travel for disabled people on
public transport, and they are encouraged to
provide special means of access to public
buildings. Special government regulations
cover the provision of access for disabled
people in the construction of new buildings.
The Disability Discrimination Act, passed
in 1995, is designed to tackle discrimination
against disabled people in Britain by
providing them with a more accessible
environment. The Act:
• provides a right for disabled people in
employment and places a duty on
employers with 20 or more staff to
consider reasonable adjustments to the
terms on which they offer employment
where these would help to overcome the
practical effects of a disability;
• provides a right of access to goods and
services which will make it unlawful to
refuse to serve a disabled person and may
require service providers to make
reasonable adjustments to their services
to make them more accessible; and
• establishes a National Disability Council
to advise the Government on its strategy
for eliminating discrimination against
disabled people. The Council will be
responsible for producing codes of
practice in the areas of goods and
services based on what is required by the
legislation.
People with Learning Disabilities
(Mental Handicap)
The Government’s policy is to encourage
the development of local services for
people with learning disabilities and their
families through co-operation between health
and local authorities, and voluntary and
other organisations.
Local authority social services
departments are the leading statutory agency
for planning and arranging services for
people with learning disabilities. They
provide short-term care, support for
families in their own homes, residential
accommodation and support for various types
of activities outside the home. The main aims
are to ensure that as far as possible people
with learning disabilities can lead full lives in
their communities and that no one is
admitted to hospital unless it is necessary on
health grounds.
The NHS provides specialist services
where the general health needs of people
with learning disabilities cannot be met by
ordinary NHS services, and residential care
408
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
for those with severe disabilities or whose
needs can only effectively be met by the NHS.
Mentally 111 People
; Government policy aims to ensure that people
with mental illnesses should have access to all
the services they need as locally as possible,
i The cornerstone of community care policy for
; mentally ill people is the Care Programme
Approach. Under this, each patient in contact
with the specialist services should receive an
assessment and a care plan, be appointed a
key worker to keep in touch with him or her,
and be given regular reviews. Implementation
of this approach is being closely monitored by
the NHS Executive.
While the total number of places for
mentally ill people in the large hospitals has
continued to fall, this has been matched by
increasing provision of alternative places in
smaller NHS hospitals, local authority
accommodation and private and voluntary
sector homes.
Arrangements made by social services
authorities for providing preventive care and
after care for mentally ill people in the
community include day centres, social centres
and residential care. Social workers help
patients and their families with problems
caused by mental illness. In some cases they
can apply for a mentally disordered person to
be compulsorily admitted to and detained in
hospital under the Mental Health Act 1993.
The Mental Health Act Commission provides
important safeguards for these patients to
ensure that the Act is used appropriately.
Different arrangements apply in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
A specific grant of £47.3 million for 1995-96
to local authorities in England is designed to
encourage them to increase the level of social
care available to mentally ill patients,
including those with dementia who need
specialist psychiatric care in the community.
Legislation before Parliament aims to
provide a new power of ‘supervised discharge’
for severely mentally ill patients in England
and Wales who need special support after
they leave hospital. Under this patients who
do not receive the services they need or
comply with any requirements placed on
them must have their care plans reviewed,
and where appropriate their readmission to
hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983
may be considered. In addition supervision
registers for discharged patients most at risk
were introduced in April 1994. These are to
be maintained by the providers of services
for mentally ill people and will allow
hospital staff to keep track of discharged
patients. Similar arrangements, called
community care orders, have been
introduced in Scotland under the same
legislation. For details of the Government’s
homeless mentally ill initiative, see p. 345.
The first government-backed national
survey of mental illness began in April
1993. The survey, which covers adults aged
16 to 64 living in communal establishments
as well as those living in private
households, aims to provide up-to-date
information on mental illness among adults,
as well as associated social disabilities. It is
also examining the varying use of health,
social and voluntary care services, and the
risk factors associated with mental illness.
Its first report was published in May 1995.
A three-year public information
campaign began in spring 1993 to increase
people’s awareness and understanding about
mental illness and suicide.
There are many voluntary organisations
concerned with those suffering from mental
illness or learning disabilities, and they play
an important role in providing services for
both groups of people.
Help to Families
Social services authorities, through their
own social workers and others in the
voluntary sector, give help to families
facing special problems. This help takes
the form of services for families with
children in need or at risk of harm or
neglect, including some who may need
care away from their own families; and
support for family carers who look after
elderly and other family members, in
order to give them relief from their duties.
There is also help for single parents.
Local authorities or voluntary organisations
now run many refuges for women,
409
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
often with young children, whose home
conditions have become intolerable. The
refuges provide short-term accommodation
and support while attempts are made to
relieve the women’s problems. Many
authorities also contribute to the cost of
support and counselling for families (such
as marriage guidance) carried out by
voluntary organisations.
The Government’s Parenting Initiative,
announced in 1994, provides funding to
organisations which help families seeking
practical help with parenting problems.
Projects for which grants have been awarded
include the provision of:
• an information pack on parenting for
schools (The Gulbenkian Foundation);
• advice and support to step- and
grandparents (Stepfathering
Association); and
• advice and information for separated
parents (National Family Mediation).
Day Care for Children
Day care facilities for children under five are
provided by local authorities, voluntary
agencies and privately. In allocating places in
their day nurseries and other facilities, local
authorities give priority to children with
special social, learning or health needs. Local
authorities also register and inspect
childminders, private day nurseries and
playgroups in their areas and provide
support and advice services. Day care figures
for 1994 show that the number of places for
children in day nurseries and with
childminders has continued to grow.
In 1993 the Government launched a
£45 million scheme to help create childcare
facilities in Great Britain for children over
five after school hours and during the
holidays. The scheme is operated through
Training and Enterprise Councils and Local
Enterprise Companies (see p. 183). These
organisations are developing local
partnerships with employers, schools,
parents, local authorities and voluntary
organisations. As a result of this initiative
over 26,000 new out-of-school child care
places have been created.
Child Protection
Cases of child abuse are the joint concern of
a number of different agencies and
professions. Area child protection
committees provide forums for discussion
and co-ordination and draw up policies and
procedures for handling these cases. The
Government’s central training initiative on
child abuse, established in England and
Wales in 1986, consists of a variety of
projects, including training for health
visitors, school nurses, and local authority
social services staff. Guidelines and training
packs have been developed for those
implementing the Children Act 1989 (see
below). The training initiative is now
combined with a treatment initiative which
began in 1990 to provide grant funding for a
range of child abuse treatment projects. In
Scotland the Government provides support
for child abuse training at the University of
Dundee and through a specific grant scheme
for local authorities.
The results of a wide-ranging research
programme into child abuse in Great Britain
were published in June 1995.2 Among its
findings researchers found that:
• about 160,000 children a year were
being referred into the protection
system. A third came from lone parent
families, and two-thirds were living in a
household that lacked a wage earner.
Domestic violence and mental illness
were features in 15 per cent of cases.
One in seven of the parents had
themselves been abused as children.
• about 40,000 enquiries ended without
any action being taken after
professionals had made informal checks.
In a further 80,000 cases matters were
quickly allowed to rest after parents had
been interviewed; and
• in the small number of cases where
abuse was established, 96 per cent of
children involved in such cases stayed at
home, and where they were removed, 70
per cent returned home within six
months.

HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
! Children in Care
i Local government authorities must provide
j accommodation for children who have no
parent or guardian, have been abandoned, or
I whose parents are unable to provide for them.
The Children Act 1989, which came into
I effect in England and Wales in 1991, recasts
• the legislative framework for children’s
I services, care and protection into a single
| coherent structure. It lays new duties on local
i authorities to safeguard and promote the
welfare of children. Under the Act parents of
children in care retain their parental
responsibilities but act as far as possible as
partners with the authority. There is a new
requirement to prepare a child for leaving the
local authority’s responsibility and to
continue to advise him or her up to the age
of 21. Local authorities are required to have
a complaints procedure with an independent
element to cover children in their care.
The figures confirm that the number of
children looked after by local authorities
continues to decline as local authorities
respond to the requirement of the Children
Act that wherever possible children should
remain at home with their families.
In March 1993:
• there were 51,000 children looked after
by local authorities in England and
Wales, 7 per cent fewer than in the
previous year;
• most of the children were in foster
placements. Although the total number of
children in foster placements decreased
from 31,700 in 1992 to 30,700 in 1993,
numbers in other types of
accommodation, such as residential
homes, fell more sharply. As a result
there was a small increase in the
proportion of foster children; and
• during the same period the number of
children on child protection registers
increased by 7 per cent to 34,900.
In England and Wales a child may be
brought before a family proceedings court if
he or she is neglected or ill-treated, exposed
to moral danger, beyond the control of
parents, or not attending school. The court
can commit the child to the care of a local
authority under a care order. Under the
Children Act 1989 certain preconditions have
to be satisfied to justify an order. These are
that the child is suffering or is likely to suffer
significant harm because of a lack of
reasonable parental care or because he or she
is beyond parental control. However, an
order is made only if the court is also
satisfied that this will positively contribute to
the child’s well-being and be in his or her
best interests. In court proceedings the child
is entitled to separate legal representation and
the right to have a guardian to protect his or
her interests.
All courts have to treat the welfare of the
child as the paramount consideration when
reaching any decision about his or her
upbringing. The family proceedings court
consists of specially trained magistrates with
power to hear care cases as well as all other
family and children’s cases.
Recent concerns over standards of care in
certain local authority children’s homes have
prompted a number of official inquiries
whose recommendations are now being
implemented. They include:
• Norman Warner’s inquiry into the
selection of staff in children’s homes and
the support and guidance available to
them after appointment (1992);
• the Howe inquiry into staff conditions,
and management and training for all
residential care staff in adult and
children’s homes (1992);
• the Skinner review of residential child
care in Scotland (1992); and
• a report by the Social Services
Inspectorate on children’s homes in
England (1993). This was the first
national report to come from a team of
both SSI Inspectors and young people
who had themselves been in care.
The Support Force for Children’s
Residential Care, set up in response to the
Warner Report, gives practical advice and
assistance to purchasers and providers of
residential care for children in England and
Wales. In June 1995 it published a code of
employment practice for people involved in
appointing staff in children’s residential care.
411
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Scotland children who have committed
offences or are in need of care and protection
may be brought before a children’s hearing,
which can impose a supervision requirement
on a child if it thinks that compulsory
measures are appropriate. Under these
requirements most children are allowed to
remain at home under the supervision of a
social worker but some may live with foster
parents or in a residential establishment while
under supervision. Supervision requirements
are reviewed at least once a year until ended
by a children’s hearing. The Children
(Scotland) Act 1995, which will come into
force within the next two years, implements
proposals in the White Paper Scotland's
Children: Proposals for Child Care Policy and
Law. In addition to the major legislative
changes, a number of improvements in child
care services, policy and practice have already
been made through administrative means,
increased funding has been devoted to the
training of social work staff.
In Northern Ireland the juvenile court
may place children who are in need of care,
protection or control into the care of a fit
person (including a health and social services
board or trust), or may make them subject to
a supervision order. Children in trouble may
be required to attend an attendance centre, be
committed to a training school, or may be
detained in a remand home. The Children
(Northern Ireland) Order 1995 provides
Northern Ireland with legislation broadly
equivalent to the Children Act 1989 in
England and Wales and creates a separation
between the treatment of children in need of
care and young offenders. The legislation is
expected to come into force in October 1996.
Fostering and Children’s Homes
When appropriate, children in care are placed
with foster parents, who receive payments to
cover living costs. Alternatively, the child
may be placed in a local authority, voluntary
or private children’s home or other suitable
residential accommodation, including
boarding school. In Scotland local authorities
are responsible for placing children in their
care in foster homes, in local authority or
voluntary homes, or in residential schools.
Similar provisions apply in Northern Ireland.
Regulations concerning residential care and
the foster placement of children in care are
made by central government.
Adoption
Local authorities are required by law to
provide an adoption service, either directly or
by arrangement with a voluntary organisation.
Agencies may offer adoptive parents an
allowance in certain circumstances if this
would help to find a family for a child.
Adoption is strictly regulated by law, and
voluntary adoption societies must be
approved by the appropriate Secretary of
State. The Registrars-General keep
confidential registers of adopted children.
Adopted people may be given details of their
original birth record on reaching the age of
18, and counselling is provided to help them
understand the circumstances of their
adoption. An Adoption Contact Register
enables adopted adults and their birth parents
to be given a safe and confidential way of
making contact if that is the wish of both
parties. A person’s details are entered only if
they wish to be contacted.
A government White Paper on adoption in
England and Wales was published in 1993. It
includes proposals to allow children aged 12
or over to agree to the making of their
adoption order and to have the right to take
part in their own adoption proceedings;
simpler alternatives to adoption for
step-parents, relatives or long-term foster
parents; and streamlined arrangements for
adopting from overseas.
In Scotland a review of adoption law
published in 1993 led to a number of changes
which were introduced in the Children
(Scotland) Act 1995.
Social Services Staff
The effective working of the social services
depends largely on professionally qualified
social workers. Training programmes in social
work are provided by universities and
colleges of higher and further education. The
Central Council for Education and Training
in Social Work is the statutory body
412
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
responsible for promoting and regulating
social work training. A programme to
introduce two-year courses leading to a new
professional qualification, the Diploma in
Social Work (DipSW), has been implemented.
National Vocational Qualifications are being
developed for other staff, including those in
residential day and domiciliary care services.
In England and Wales professional social
workers (including those in the NHS) are
employed mainly by the social services
departments of local authorities. In Northern
Ireland social work services are provided by
social workers employed by health and social
services boards and trusts. Others work in the
probation service, the education welfare
service, and in voluntary and private
organisations. In Scotland local authority
social work departments provide most
services, including those to the NHS and in
criminal justice. There is also a growing
voluntary sector.
The Government is committed to
improving social work training and each of
the four countries of Britain has a personal
social services training strategy whose
objectives include increasing the supply of
qualified social workers, improving the
quality of qualifying training and the training
of the existing workforce.

Administration 414 Arrangements with Other
Contributions 415 Countries
Social security is the Government’s largest expenditure programme.
Planned spending in 1995-96 is £86,300 million—almost one-third of public
expenditure. Developments during the last year include the reform of
benefits for unemployed people, measures to improve work incentives,
changes in the provision for incapacity, proposals to improve the system for
assessing child support, and measures to curb the growth in benefit
payments for housing costs.
As part of its long-term review of public
spending (see p. 159), the Government is
examining the social security programme and
reforming the structure of the present system
to ensure it involves:
• better targeting of those in need;
• encouraging more self-provision; and
• providing more incentives to work.
The social security system is designed to
secure a basic standard of living for people in
financial need by providing income during
periods of inability to earn (including periods
of unemployment), help for families and
assistance with costs arising from
disablement. Nearly a third of government
expenditure is devoted to the social security
programme, which provides financial help for
people who are elderly, sick, disabled,
unemployed, widowed, bringing up children
or on very low incomes.
Some benefits depend on the payment of
contributions by employers, employees and
self-employed people to the National
Insurance Fund, from which benefits are
paid. The Government also contributes to the
Fund. Other social security benefits are non¬
contributory and are financed from general
taxation; some of these are income-related,
being available to people whose income falls
below a certain level (see p. 422). Appeals
about claims for benefits are decided by
independent tribunals.
ADMINISTRATION
Administration in Great Britain is handled by
six separate executive agencies of the
Department of Social Security, together
employing a total of some 88,000 staff:
• the Benefits Agency, responsible for
paying the majority of social security
benefits;
• the Child Support Agency, responsible
for collecting and enforcing maintenance
payments for children (see p. 419);
• the Contributions Agency, responsible for
handling National Insurance contributions;
414
SOCIAL SECURITY
• the Information Technology Services
Agency, responsible for computerising
the administration of social security;
• the Resettlement Agency, responsible for
hostels for single homeless people; and
• the War Pensions Agency, set up in
April 1994, responsible for delivering
services to war pensioners.
The Employment Services Agency of the
Department for Education and Employment
pays unemployment benefits and income
support to unemployed people on behalf of
the Benefits Agency. The housing and
council tax benefit schemes are administered
by local authorities, which recover most of the
cost from the Government.
In Northern Ireland contributions as well
as social security benefits are administered
by the Social Security Agency. The
qualifying conditions for receipt of the
various benefits are the same as those for
Great Britain. The housing benefit scheme
is administered by the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive and the Rate Collection
Agency; council tax does not apply in
Northern Ireland.
A major programme to improve quality
and customer service is in progress. The
Benefits Agency, for example, is moving
towards one-stop service delivery (a single
contact point to handle each customer’s
business with the Agency where appropriate).
The Benefits, Contributions, Resettlement
and War Pensions Agencies publish
customer charters.
Anti-fraud Measures
Further measures are being introduced to
improve the prevention and detection of
social security fraud. These include:
• greater financial incentives to local
authorities to prevent and detect fraud in
the benefits they administer;
• better use of information technology; and
• better targeting of resources, and
additional resources where necessary.
In 1993-94 a record £654 million of
fraud was identified and stopped. In the
three years since its formation, the Benefits
Agency has saved over £1,500 million
through anti-fraud work.
Advice about Benefits
The demand for advice about benefits is
partly met by the Freeline Social Security
Service, which handles over 1 million calls
each year. The Ethnic Freeline Service
provides information on social security in
Urdu, Punjabi and Chinese. There is also a
freeline service in Welsh.
The Department of Social Security
produces a wide range of leaflets and posters
providing general information on entitlement
and liability. These are available in English
and a number of other languages.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Entitlement to National Insurance benefits
such as retirement pension, incapacity benefit,
unemployment benefit, maternity allowance
and widow’s benefit, is dependent upon the
payment of contributions. There are five
classes of contributions. The rates given
below are effective from April 1995 to
April 1996:
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers. Employees with earnings
below £58 a week do not pay Class 1
contributions. Contributions on earnings
of £58 a week and over are at the rate of
2 per cent of the first £58 of total
earnings and 10 per cent of the balance,
up to the upper earnings limit of £440 a
week. Employers’ contributions are subject
to the same threshold. On earnings above
the threshold, contributions rise in stages
from 3 per cent of total earnings up to a
maximum of 10.2 per cent when earnings
are £205 or more a week; there is no
upper earnings limit. The contribution is
lower if the employer operates a
‘contracted-out’ occupational pension
scheme (see p. 418).
• Class 1A—paid by employers who
provide their employees with fuel and/or
a car for private use. A Class 1A
contribution is payable on the cash
equivalent of the benefit provided.
415
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• Class 2—paid by self-employed people.
Class 2 contributions are at a flat rate of
£5.15 a week. The self-employed may
claim exemption from payment of Class 2
contributions if their profits are expected
to be below £3,260 for the tax year.
Self-employed people are not eligible for
unemployment and industrial injuries
benefits.
• Class 3—paid voluntarily to safeguard
rights to some benefits. Class 3
contributions are at a flat rate of £5.65
a week.
• Class 4—paid by the self-employed on
their taxable profits over a set lower limit
(£6,640 a year), and up to a set upper
limit (£22,880 a year) in addition to their
Class 2 contribution. Class 4 contributions
are payable at the rate of 7.3 per cent.
Employees who work after pensionable age
(60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay
contributions but the employer continues to
be liable. Self-employed people over
pensionable age do not pay contributions.
BENEFITS
For most contributory benefits there are
two conditions. First, before benefit can be
paid at all, a certain number of
contributions have to be paid. Second, the
full rate of benefit cannot be paid unless
contributions have been paid or credited to
a specific level over a set period. A reduced
rate of benefit is payable dependent on the
level of contributions paid or credited. For
example, a great many of those receiving
retirement pensions and widows’ benefits
receive a percentage-based rate of benefit.
Benefits are increased annually in line
with percentage increases in retail prices.
The main benefits (payable weekly) are
summarised on pp. 417-23. The rates
given are those effective from April
1995 until April 1996.

SOCIAL SECURITY
Retirement Pension
A state retirement pension is payable, if the
contribution conditions have been met, to
women at the age of 60 and men at the age
of 65. The Sex Discrimination Act 1986
protects employees of different sexes in a
particular occupation from being required to
retire at different ages. This, however, has
not affected the payment of the state
retirement pension at different ages for men
and women.
Legislation was introduced in 1995 to
equalise the state pension age for men and
women at 65. The change will be phased in
over ten years, starting from April 2010.
Women born before 6 April 1950 will not be
affected; their pension age will remain at 60.
d he new pension age of 65 will apply to
women born on or after 6 March 1955.
Pension age for women born between these
dates will move up gradually from 60 to 65.
The state pension scheme consists of a
basic weekly pension of £58.85 for a single
person and £94.10 for a married couple,
together with an additional earnings-related
pension. Pensioners may have unlimited
earnings without affecting their pensions.
Those who have put off their retirement
during the five years after state pension age
may earn extra pension. A non-contributory
retirement pension of £35.25 a week is
payable to people over the age of 80 w ho
meet certain residence conditions, and who

BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
have not qualified for a contributory pension.
People whose pensions do not give them
enough to live on may be entitled to income
support (see p. 422). Over 10 million people
in Great Britain received a basic state
pension in 1994.
Rights to basic pensions are safeguarded
for people whose opportunities to work are
limited while they are looking after a child or
a sick or disabled person. Men and women
may receive the same basic pension, provided
they have paid full-rate National Insurance
contributions when working. From April 1999
the earnings-related pension scheme will be
based on a lifetime’s revalued earnings instead
of on the best 20 years. It will be calculated
as 20 per cent rather than 25 per cent of
earnings, to be phased in over ten years from
1999. The pensions of people retiring this
century will be unaffected.
Occupational and Personal Pensions
Employers may ‘contract out’ their
employees from the state scheme for the
additional earnings-related pension and
provide their own occupational pension
instead. Their pension must be at least as
good as the state additional pension. Joining
an employer’s contracted-out scheme is
voluntary: employers are not free to contract
out employees from the earnings-related
pension scheme without the employees’
consent. The State remains responsible for
the basic pension.
Occupational pension schemes cover about
half the working population and have nearly
11 million members. The occupational
pension rights of those who change jobs
before pensionable age, who are unable or
who do not want to transfer their pension
rights, are now offered some protection
against inflation. Workers leaving a scheme
have the right to a fair transfer value. The
trustees or managers of pension schemes
have to provide full information about
their schemes.
Increasing numbers of pensioners receive
income from occupational pensions and
investment income. Around two-thirds of all
pensioners now receive an occupational
pension worth, on average, over £10 a week,
while more than three-quarters of pensioners
have some form of income from their
investments, receiving an average of over
£43 a week.
As an alternative to their employers’
scheme or the state additional earnings-
related pension scheme, people are entitled to
choose a personal pension available from a
bank, building society, insurance company or
other financial institution. Five million
people have contracted out of the state
earnings-related pension scheme and taken
out personal pensions. Legislation passed in
1995 requires occupational schemes to
provide equal treatment between men and
women and to make personal pensions more
flexible and attractive to a broader age range.
A Pensions Ombudsman deals with
complaints about maladministration of
pension schemes and adjudicates on disputes
of fact or law. A pensions registry helps
people trace lost benefits.
Parents and Children
Most pregnant working women receive
statutory maternity pay directly from their
employer. It is paid for a maximum of 18
weeks to any woman who has been working
for the same employer for 26 weeks and who
earns on average at least £58 a week. She will
receive 90 per cent of her average weekly
earnings for the first six weeks and a lower
rate of £52.50 a week for the remaining
12 weeks. Women who are not eligible for
statutory maternity pay because, for example,
they are self-employed, have recently changed
jobs or given up their job, may qualify for a
weekly maternity allowance, which is payable
for up to 18 weeks. This amounts to £52 a
week for working women and £45.55 a week
for those not in work.
All pregnant employees have the right to
take 14 weeks’ maternity leave.
A payment of £100 from the Social Fund
(see p. 418) may be available if the mother or
her partner are receiving income support,
family credit or disability working allowance
(see p. 421). It is also available if a woman
adopts a baby.
Non-contributory child benefit of £10.40
a week for the eldest qualifying child and
418
SOCIAL SECURITY
£8.45 for each other child is the main social
security benefit for children. Tax-free and
normally paid to the mother, child benefit is
payable for children up to the age of 16 and
for those up to 19 if they continue in full¬
time non-advanced education. In addition,
one-parent benefit of £6.30 a week is
generally payable to certain people bringing
up one child or more on their own, whether
as their parents or not. A non-contributory
guardian’s allowance of £11.05 a week for
an orphaned child is payable to a person who
is entitled to child benefit for that child. This
is reduced to £9.85 if the higher rate of child
benefit is payable for the child. In exceptional
circumstances a guardian’s allowance may be
paid on the death of only one parent.
At the end of 1994 child benefit was paid
for 12,600,600 children, an increase on the
previous year of 35,400.
Child Support Agency
An estimated 1.4 million lone parents bring
up over 2 million children in Britain. The
Child Support Agency (CSA), which started
work in April 1993, is gradually replacing the
court system for obtaining basic child
maintenance. The CSA is responsible for
assessing, collecting and enforcing child
maintenance payments and for tracing absent
parents. Assessments are made using a
formula which takes into account each
parent’s income and essential outgoings.
Changes to the child support arrangements
were introduced in February 1994 to take
account of concerns raised by members of the
public and MPs. The Government believes
that the formula approach to assessment of
maintenance is appropriate for most separated
parents. However, a case has been made for
further changes.
Legislation passed in 1995 introduces a
system of departures from the formula
assessment of child support to allow the
amount of maintenance payable to be varied
in a small proportion of cases from 1996-97.
Other measures are designed to improve the
review process in child support and to
introduce a child maintenance bonus worth
jap to £1,000 when the parent with care of
the child returns to work.
In its first two years the CSA has cleared
over 900,000 cases, including over 450,000
maintenance assessments.
In Northern Ireland the child support
maintenance scheme is operated by the
Northern Ireland Child Support Agency, which
was established at the same time as the CSA.
Although the two agencies operate under
separate legislation, reciprocal arrangements
are in place to ensure that they can deliver an
integrated service throughout Britain.
Childcare Changes
From October 1994 families claiming family
credit (see p. 423), disability working
allowance (see p. 421), housing benefit and
council tax benefit (see p. 423) and who pay
for childcare for children aged under 11, can
have up to £40 a week in childcare charges
offset against their earnings when their benefit
entitlement is worked out. This help is for
families who use formal childcare through
registered childminders and day nurseries. In
the long term it is estimated that around
150,000 families will gain from this initiative,
including about 50,000 who are expected to
take up work as a direct result of the change.
Widows
Widows under the age of 60, or those over 60
whose husbands were not entitled to a state
retirement pension when they died, receive a
tax-free single payment of £1,000 following
the death of their husbands, provided that
their husbands had paid a minimum number
of National Insurance contributions. Women
whose husbands have died of an industrial
injury or prescribed disease may also qualify,
regardless of whether their husbands had
paid National Insurance contributions.
A widowed mother with a young family
receives a widowed mother’s allowance of
£58.85 a week, with a further £9.85 for a
child for whom the higher rate of child
benefit is payable and £11.05 for each
subsequent child. A widow’s basic pension of
£58.85 a week is payable to a widow who is
55 years or over when her husband dies or
when her entitlement to widowed mother’s
allowance ends. A percentage of the full rate
419
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is payable to widows who are aged between
45 and 54 when their husbands die or when
their entitlement to widowed mother’s
allowance ends. Special rules apply for
widows whose husbands died before 11 April
1988. Entitlement continues until the widow
remarries or begins drawing retirement
pension. Payment ends if she lives with a
man as his wife. Widows also benefit under
the industrial injuries scheme.
A man whose wife dies when both are over
pension age inherits his wife’s pension rights
just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.
Sick and Disabled People
Statutory Sick Pay and Incapacity Benefit
A large variety of benefits is available for
people unable to work because of sickness or
disablement. Employers are responsible for
paying statutory sick pay to employees
from the fourth day of sickness for up to a
maximum of 28 weeks. Since April 1995
there has been a single rate of statutory sick
pay for all qualifying employees provided
their average weekly earnings are at least
equivalent to the lower earnings limit for the
payment of National Insurance contribution.
The weekly rate is £52.50.
A new benefit—incapacity benefit—
replaced the former sickness and invalidity
benefits from 13 April 1995. The aim is to
focus incapacity provision on people who
have a medical condition which makes it
unreasonable to expect them to seek or to be
available for work. Entitlement to incapacity
benefit begins when entitlement to statutory
sick pay ends or, for those who do not
qualify for statutory sick pay, from the first
day of sickness.
The new benefit has three rates:
• a lower rate of £44.40 a week for the
first 28 weeks;
• a higher rate of £52.50 a week between
the 29th and 52nd week; and
• a long-term rate of £58.85 a week from
the 53rd week of incapacity.
It comprises certain age additions and
increases for adult and child dependants. It is
taxable from the 29th week of incapacity.
A new, more objective medical test of
incapacity for work has been introduced for
incapacity benefit as well as for other social
security benefits paid on the basis of
incapacity for work. The new test usually
applies after 28 weeks’ incapacity for work
and assesses ability to perform a range of
work-related activities rather than the ability
to perform a specific job. Separate
arrangements exist for people who are
mentally ill or disabled.
Existing recipients of invalidity benefit
moved to the new incapacity benefit and will
receive transitional protection to prevent any
loss in income. Transitional protection may
be lost if there is a change in the claimant’s
circumstances. New and existing cases will be
subject to the new incapacity test except for a
number of specified exemptions. The changes
are expected to reduce public expenditure by
some £3,000 million in the first three years.
Severe Disablement Allowance
A severe disablement allowance of £35.55,
plus an age-related addition of up to £12.40 a
week, may be payable to people who have not
been able to work for at least 28 weeks
because of illness or disability and who
cannot get incapacity benefit because they
have not paid enough National Insurance
contributions. Claims may be made by people
aged between 16 and 65. Once a person has
qualified for the allowance, there is no upper
limit for receipt. Additions for adult
dependants and for children may also be
paid. From April 1995 new claimants must
satisfy the same incapacity test as used in
incapacity benefit (see above).
People who become incapable of work
after their 20th birthday must also be
medically assessed as at least 80 per cent
disabled for a minimum of 28 weeks. People
already in receipt of certain benefits, such as
the middle or higher rate of disability living
allowance, will automatically be accepted as
80 per cent disabled.
Other Benefits
Disability living allowance is a tax-free
benefit with two components for people
420
SOCIAL SECURITY
disabled before the age of 65 who need help
with personal care or with mobility. The care
component has three weekly rates—£46.70,
£31.20 and £12.40. The mobility component
has two rates—£32.65 and £12.40.
Motability, an independent charitable
organisation, helps disabled drivers to obtain
vehicles or powered wheelchairs on
favourable terms by using the higher rate
mobility component of disability living
allowance or the war pension mobility
supplement. Applications for vehicles
increased by over 10 per cent in 1993-94
compared with the previous year. Almost 5
per cent of all new cars registered in Britain
in 1994 were bought under the Motability
scheme, which currently has more than
! 200,000 customers.
A non-contributory, tax-free attendance
allowance of £31.20 or £46.70 a week may
be payable to people severely disabled at or
after age 65, who have personal care needs,
depending upon the amount of attention they
| require. The higher rate of attendance
allowance and/or disability living allowance is
paid to people who are terminally ill.
A non-contributory invalid care
allowance of £35.25 weekly may be payable
to people between 16 and pensionable age
who cannot take up a paid job because they
are caring for a person receiving either
attendance allowance or the higher or middle
care component of disability living allowance.
An additional carer’s premium may be paid if
the recipient is also receiving income support,
housing benefit or council tax benefit. It is
estimated that some 1.5 million adults in
Great Britain care for a disabled person for at
least 20 hours a week.
Disability working allowance is an
income-related tax-free benefit which helps
some disabled people aged 16 or over who
work an average of 16 hours a week or more
and have an illness or disability which puts
them at a disadvantage in getting a job.
Awards are for fixed periods of six months.
To qualify a person must either:
• be getting disability living allowance, or
an analogous benefit, such as constant
attendance allowance under the war
pensions or industrial injuries
disablement scheme; or
• have an invalid three-wheeler or other
vehicle under the NHS Act 1977; or
• have been entitled to one of the following
in at least one of the 56 days before the
date of claim: higher rate short-term
incapacity benefit; long-term incapacity
benefit; severe disablement allowance; or
the disability premium or higher
pensioner premium with income support,
housing benefit or council tax benefit.
4 he allowance is available to single people,
lone parents and couples. The rate depends
on the person’s income and size of family, and
the ages of any children. The allowance is not
payable if capital or savings exceed £16,000.
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefits
Various benefits are payable for disablement
caused by an accident at work or a prescribed
disease. The main benefit is industrial
injuries disablement benefit; disablement
benefit of up to £95.30 a week is usually paid
after a qualifying period of 15 weeks if a
person is 14 per cent or more physically or
mentally disabled as a result of an industrial
accident or a prescribed disease.
Basic disablement benefit can be paid in
addition to other National Insurance benefits,
such as incapacity benefit. It can be paid
whether or not the person returns to work
and does not depend on earnings. The degree
of disablement is assessed by an independent
adjudicating medical authority and the
amount paid depends on the extent of the
disablement and on how long it is expected to
last. Except for certain progressive respiratory
diseases, disablement of less than 14 per cent
does not attract disablement benefit. In
certain circumstances additional allowances,
such as constant attendance allowance and
exceptionally severe disablement allowance,
may be payable. In some cases reduced
earnings allowance may be payable.
Unemployment Benefit
Unemployment benefit of £46.45 a week for
a single person or £75.10 for a couple is
payable for up to a year in any one period
of unemployment. Periods covered by
421
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
unemployment or incapacity benefit,
maternity allowance or some training
allowances which are eight weeks or less
apart, are linked for unemployment benefit to
form a single period of interruption of work.
Everyone claiming unemployment benefit has
to be available for work, but unemployed
people wishing to do voluntary work in the
community may do so in some cases without
losing entitlement to benefit. People seeking
unemployment benefit must not have become
unemployed voluntarily or have lost their job
through misconduct. They are expected to
look actively for work and must have good
reasons for rejecting any job that is offered.
Income Support
Income support is payable to people who are
not in work, or who work fewer than 16 hours
a week, and whose financial resources are
below certain set levels. It consists of a
personal allowance ranging from £28 weekly
for a single person or lone parent aged under
18 to £73 for a couple, at least one of whom
is aged over 18. Additional sums, known as
premiums, are available to families, lone
parents, pensioners, long-term sick and
disabled people, and those caring for them
who qualify for the invalid care allowance.
The income support scheme sets a limit to
the amount of capital a person may have and
still remain entitled. People with savings or
capital worth more than £8,000 are ineligible;
savings between £3,000 and £8,000 will
reduce the amount received.
Although only about one-fifth of claims
from unemployed people result in payment of
unemployment benefit (see p. 421), a large
proportion of those signing on as unemployed
at any one time rely partly or wholly on
income support. This is either because they
are disqualified from unemployment benefit
or have not paid sufficient contributions to
qualify for it, or because their entitlement to
it has run out, or because they are entitled to
income support as well.
Planned Changes
Legislation passed in 1995 will replace
unemployment benefit and income support
for unemployed people with a jobseeker’s
allowance from October 1996. The new
benefit will be more clearly focused on
helping unemployed people into work. All
unemployed people will be required to enter
into a jobseeker’s agreement, setting out a
plan of action to seek work. Most recipients
will qualify through a means test, and the
benefit will be paid at rates determined by
family circumstances on a similar basis to
income support.
Those with a sufficient contribution record
will have a personal jobseeker’s allowance for
up to six months. To enhance incentives to
take up or keep part-time work, both
jobseeker’s allowance and income support will
incorporate a Back to Work Bonus scheme.
People who have been unemployed for three
months or more and work part time will keep
the first £5 of their earnings (£10 for couples,
£15 for lone parents, disabled people and
some people in special occupations) in any
week in which they work while receiving
benefit. An amount equal to half of any
earnings above that level will count towards
the build-up of a bonus amount. This will be
paid as a tax-free lump sum, up to a
maximum of £1,000, when the unemployed
person moves into employment which removes
entitlement to jobseeker’s allowance or income
support. The part-time earnings of a partner
will also count towards the build-up of the
bonus amount, and a bonus payment may be
made when it is the partner who moves into
work which removes entitlement to benefit.
The introduction of jobseeker’s allowance
will change the role of income support, which
will no longer offer a general safety net, but
rather provide support for certain groups in
defined circumstances. It will help those not
required to be available for work, such as
pensioners, disabled people, lone parents and
those who are longer-term sick.
The introduction of jobseeker’s allowance is
expected to reduce expenditure on benefits by
around £270 million in a full year of operation.
Housing Benefit
The housing benefit scheme assists people
who need help to pay their rent (rent and/or
domestic rates in Northern Ireland), using
422
SOCIAL SECURITY
general assessment rules and benefit levels
similar to those for the income support
scheme. At present people whose net income
is below certain specified levels qualify for
housing benefit of up to 100 per cent of their
rent. Unlike income support (see p. 422), the
housing benefit scheme sets a limit of
£16,000 on the amount of capital a person
may have and still remain entitled.
Proposed Changes
From October 1995 housing benefit will be
calculated by reference to the general level of
rents for similar properties in the same area.
The new measures are designed to ensure
that private sector tenants receiving benefit
have an incentive to choose better value for
money accommodation at the outset of a
tenancy. The changes will apply to new
claims to benefit from October 1995 and to
existing claimants when they change address.
Council Tax Benefit
Council tax benefit helps people to meet
their council tax payments. The scheme
offers help to those claiming income support
and others with low incomes. Subject to rules
broadly similar to those governing the
provision of income support and housing
benefit (see above), people may receive
rebates of up to 100 per cent of their council
tax. At present over 5 million households
receive such help. A person who is solely
liable for the council tax may also claim
benefit (called ‘second adult rebate’) for a
second adult who is not liable to pay the
council tax and who is living in the home on
a non-commercial basis.
Residence Test
In August 1994 a new residence test came
into force, requiring claimants to establish
that they are habitually resident in Britain
before a claim for income support, housing
benefit or council tax benefit can be paid.
The test brings Britain into line with most
other European countries, which already limit
access to their benefit systems to those who
have lived in the country for some time.
Family Credit
Family credit is payable to low-paid
employed and self-employed working
families with children. It is payable to
couples or lone parents. At least one parent
must work for a minimum of 16 hours a
week. The amount payable depends on a
family’s net income (excluding child benefit)
and the number and ages of the children in
the family. A maximum award, consisting of
an adult rate of £45.10 weekly, plus a rate
for each child varying with age, is payable if
the family’s net income does not exceed
£73 a week. The award is reduced by 70
pence for each pound by which net income
exceeds this amount. In certain cases where
children under 11 have formal childcare
arrangements, up to £40 a week can be
deducted from net income before family
credit is assessed. Family credit is not
payable if a family’s capital or savings
exceed £8,000.
Social Fund
The Social Fund consists of regulated
payments, which do not have limited
resources, and discretionary payments,
which are paid out of an annual budget
(£140 million in 1995-96).
The regulated payments are:
• maternity payment—£100 for each baby
born or adopted. Payable to those on
income support, family credit or
disability working allowance;
• funeral payment—includes up to £500
for specified funeral directors’ services,
plus the reasonable costs of all burial or
cremation expenses. Available to those
on income support, family credit,
housing benefit, council tax benefit or
disability working allowance; and
• cold weather payment—£7 a week
(£8.50 from November 1995) towards
the extra cost of heating in very cold
weather from October to March.
Payable to those on income support who
are elderly, disabled or have children
under five years.
423
BRITAIN 1995: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The discretionary payments are:
• community care grants to help, for
example, people resettle into the
community from care, or to remain in the
community, and to ease exceptional
pressure on families. Available to those
on income support;
• budgeting loans for difficult intermittent
expenses after 26 weeks on income
support; and
• crisis loans to help people facing an
emergency or disaster where there is a
serious risk to health or safety. There is
no qualifying benefit for this loan.
War Pensions and Related Services
Pensions are payable for disablement or death
as a result of service in the armed forces or
for certain injuries received in the merchant
navy or civil defence during wartime, or to
civilians injured by enemy action. The
amount paid depends on the degree of
disablement: the pension for 100 per cent
disablement is £101.10 a week.
There are a number of extra allowances.
The main ones are for unemployability,
restricted mobility, the need for care and
attendance, the provision of extra comforts,
and as maintenance for a lowered standard of
occupation. An age allowance of between
£6.75 and £20.80 is payable weekly to war
pensioners aged 65 or over whose disablement
is assessed at 40 per cent or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and
other dependants. (The standard rate of
pension for a private’s widow is £76.35 a
week.) At present the war widow’s pension is
withdrawn on re-marriage and a lump sum
worth one year’s pension is awarded.
Legislation passed in 1995 restores the
pension should the former war widow
remarry and become widowed again, divorced
or legally separated.
The War Pensions Agency maintains a
welfare service for war pensioners, war
widows and other dependants. It works
closely with ex-Service organisations and
other voluntary bodies which give financial
aid and personal support to those disabled or
bereaved as a result of war.

SOCIAL SECURITY
Concessions
Other benefits for which unemployed people
and those on low incomes may be eligible
include exemption from health service
charges (see p. 387), grants towards the cost
of spectacles, free school meals and free
legal aid.
Since April 1994 people on low incomes,
as well as all pensioners, widows and long¬
term sick people on invalidity benefit, have
received extra help to meet the cost of
VAT on their fuel bills. In 1994—95 some
15 million people will benefit, at a cost of
£381 million.
Reduced charges are often made to
unemployed people, for example, for adult
education and exhibitions, and pensioners are
usually entitled to reduced transport fares.
Taxation
The general rule is that benefits which
replace lost earnings are subject to tax, while
those intended to meet a specific need are not
(see Table 25.2). Various income tax reliefs
and exemptions are allowed on account of
age or a need to support dependants.
ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
As part of the European Union’s efforts to
promote the free movement of labour,
regulations provide for equality of treatment
and the protection of benefit rights for
employed and self-employed people who
move between member states. The
regulations also cover retirement pensioners
and other beneficiaries who have been
employed, or self-employed, as well as
dependants. Benefits covered include child
benefit and those for sickness and maternity,
unemployment, retirement, invalidity,
accidents at work and occupational diseases.
Britain also has reciprocal social security
agreements with a number of other countries
which also provide cover for some National
Insurance benefits and family benefits.
In 1994 675,000 British National Insurance
pensions were paid overseas, at a cost of
some £900 million.

Over half a million teachers are employed in Britain‘s 29,900 state,1 1,800
special and 2,500 fee-paying independent schools, which are attended by over
9 million pupils. About 67 per cent of pupils continue studying after the age
of 16. The proportion of young people entering universities and colleges has
risen from one in eight in 1980 to almost one in three. Continuing education
for adults is provided by a variety of colleges and institutions, including
universities, which have seen a 140 per cent increase in older students since
1979. Expenditure on education in Britain was £31,500 million in 1992-93.
HISTORY In 1944 a new Education Act raised the
England and Wales
Although government grants for education
were first made in 1833, it was the 1870
Education Act in England and Wales
which enshrined the idea of compulsory
elementary education with government aid.
There were two types of elementary school—
church voluntary schools and state schools
provided by school boards. Attendance at
school became compulsory in 1880 for
children aged between five and ten, and the
school leaving age was progressively raised to
14 by 1918.
A co-ordinated national system of
education was introduced for the first time by
the 1902 Education Act, under which local
government became responsible for state
education and for helping to finance the
voluntary schools. The system was supervised
by the Board of Education.
‘For ease of reference the term ‘state school’ is used to cover
schools maintained from public funds.
school leaving age to 15, and schools were
divided into primary and secondary. All
children were given a secondary education,
and the newly created Ministry of Education
was empowered to develop a national
education policy. Local government remained
responsible for administering the system.
Children were allocated to different
secondary schools—grammar, secondary
technical or secondary modern—on the basis
of selection tests taken at the age of 11. The
local education authorities were required to
prepare and submit to the Minister of
Education development plans covering the
whole process of primary and secondary
education and at the same time to proceed
with the planned development of technical
and adult education through schemes of
further education.
In the 1960s and 1970s the selective
system was gradually replaced by
comprehensive schools, which take pupils of
all abilities. The school leaving age was raised
to 16 in 1972-73.
426
EDUCATION
Scotland
In Scotland an Act passed in 1872
transferred responsibility for education from
the churches to elected school boards, which
provided compulsory education for children
between the ages of five and 13, and evening
schools for young people over 13. The
boards were also responsible for enforcing the
code of the then Scotch Education Department
(now The Scottish Office Education
Department), which was set up at about this
time to supervise the working of the new
system and to administer the distribution of
the parliamentary grant.
In 1901 the school leaving age was raised
to 14. An Act passed in 1918 replaced the
boards by local government authorities and
made the provision of secondary education
mandatory for all children wanting it. Church
schools were transferred to education
authorities, while preserving their
denominational character. The school
leaving age was raised to 15 in 1947 and to
16 in 1972-73.
Northern Ireland
Education in Northern Ireland was
brought into a single system by legislation
passed in 1923, under which local
government took over responsibility for its
administration, supervised by the Ministry
of Education. Children were required to
receive ‘elementary’ education between the
ages of six and 14. Secondary education
remained largely in the hands of voluntary
bodies, with assistance provided from
public funds. Technical education was
provided almost entirely by the local
education authorities. The school leaving
age was raised to 15 in 1947 and to 16 in
1972-73.
Reform
During the 1970s concern arose about the
quality of education provided by Britain’s
schools and the lack of a formal national
school curriculum. As a result, the three
education systems have undergone the most
far-reaching reforms since 1945.
ADMINISTRATION
The Secretary of State for Education and
Employment has overall responsibility for
school and post-school education in England.
The Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland exercise similar
responsibilities in those countries.
The government education departments
are the Department for Education and
Employment in England, the Welsh Office
Education Department, The Scottish
Office Education Department and the
Department of Education for Northern
Ireland. They formulate education policies
and are also responsible for the supply and
training of teachers.
Most state school education is the
responsibility of education authorities, which
are part of the local government system; the
rest is provided by self-governing grant-
maintained (GM) schools (see p. 428). In
Northern Ireland the education service is
administered locally by five education and
library boards.
Education authorities pay teachers and
other staff, provide and maintain buildings,
and supply equipment and materials.
Governing bodies in GM schools are
responsible for these functions.
SCHOOLS
Finance
LEA-maintained Schools
Local education authorities (LEAs) in
England and Wales are responsible for most
of the public expenditure on schools; a large
amount of this, however, is indirectly funded
by the Government through the Revenue
Support Grant, which is made to local
government councils. Councils are free to
decide how much of this grant should be
distributed to education and the other
services for which they have responsibility.
There are also central government grants
supporting expenditure made by LEAs on
items such as the National Curriculum (see
p. 435), local management of schools, teacher
recruitment, support for information
427
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
technology and health education in schools.
Finance also goes to inner city schools facing
particularly severe problems.
Additional government grants are made for
capital expenditure at voluntary-aided schools
(see below).
The rest of LEA expenditure on education
is met by local taxes and by the non-domestic
rates paid by business and commerce.
Grant-maintained Schools
State grant-maintained (GM) self-governing
schools are not financed by LEAs, as they have
chosen to opt out of LEA control (see below).
Instead, the Funding Agency for Schools in
England calculates and pays grants to GM
schools from public funds and is responsible
for financial monitoring. The Agency is
responsible to the Secretary of State for
Education and Employment, who appoints its
members. Grant-maintained schools in Wales
are funded by the Welsh Office.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scotland most state schools are provided
by local government authorities, which are
also education authorities; self-governing
schools are funded directly by the
Government. The education authorities are
financed in a similar way to those in England
and Wales.
The costs of the education and library
boards in Northern Ireland are met by the
Department of Education.
School Management
England and Wales
There are four kinds of state school that are
wholly or mainly supported from public funds:
• county schools, which are owned and
funded by LEAs;
• voluntary schools, mostly established by
religious denominations; the governors of
some types of voluntary school contribute
to capital costs;
• special schools; and
• self-governing GM schools (see below).
LEA-fmanced Schools
Each LEA-maintained county, voluntary and
special school has a governing body which
includes governors appointed by the LEA,
elected teacher and parent governors, and
people co-opted from the local community.
Voluntary schools also have governors from
the church associated with the school.
All LEA county and voluntary schools
manage their own budgets. LEAs allocate
funds to the schools, largely on the basis of
pupil numbers. The school governing body is
responsible for overseeing spending and for
most aspects of staffing, including
appointments and dismissals. LEAs also fund
special schools for pupils with special
educational needs (see p. 432); all these
schools will have full control over their
budgets by April 1996.
Each LEA is responsible for deciding
whether funds should be provided for
nursery education.
Grant-maintained Status
Some 15 per cent of secondary schools in
England are grant-maintained (GM) self-
governing schools. In Wales the proportion is
approximately 5 per cent. GM status is
achieved if the school’s parents support the
idea in a ballot and if the Secretary of State
approves the school’s proposals for GM
status. Under the 1993 Education Act the
governing bodies of non-GM state schools
must consider each year whether or not to
hold a ballot on GM status. If they decide
not to hold a ballot, they must give reasons
to parents for this decision.
The governing body for GM schools
consists of parents, teachers and people from
the community served by the school.
Governors take all decisions about school
management, employ and pay staff, are
responsible for school premises, and may
acquire or dispose of land.
City Technology Colleges
City technology colleges are non-fee-paying
independent schools created by a partnership
of government and private sector sponsors.
428
EDUCATION
The promoters own or lease the schools,
employ teachers and other staff, and make
substantial contributions towards the costs of
building and equipment. There is no LEA
involvement. The colleges teach the National
Curriculum but with an emphasis on
mathematics, technology and science. There
are 15 city technology colleges in England,
with over 11,000 pupils.
: Specialist Schools
The specialist schools programme was
launched in 1993 with the creation of
technology colleges. These are state
secondary schools which teach the National
Curriculum but with a special emphasis on
technology, science and mathematics. The
programme was extended in March 1995,
when a scheme for a national network of
language colleges was launched. These
j colleges concentrate on teaching modern
foreign languages while continuing to deliver
the full National Curriculum.
To become a technology or language
college, a school must have the backing of a
private-sector sponsor. Capital and annual
grants are available from public funds to
complement business sponsorship. There are
currently 101 technology colleges and six
language colleges in England.
! Scotland
| In Scotland most schools have school boards
| consisting of elected parent and staff
members as well as co-opted members. They
are required to promote contact between
parents, the school and the community,
and are involved in the appointment of
senior staff and the community use of
school premises.
Devolved management is to be in place in
primary and secondary schools by April 1996,
and in special schools by April 1997.
Devolved management does not have to be in
place until April 1998 for primary schools
with full-time teaching headteachers.
Parents of children at state schools can opt
for self-governing status following approval
by a ballot; the school then receives funding
directly from central government instead of
the education authority. The first self-
governing school came into existence in
April 1994.
Northern Ireland
The main categories of school supported by
public funds are:
• controlled schools, which are owned by
the education and library boards and
financed 100 per cent from public funds;
• voluntary maintained schools, most of
which are owned by the Roman Catholic
Church and are largely financed from
public funds;
• voluntary grammar schools, which may
be owned by denominational or non-
denominational bodies and are largely
financed from public funds; and
• grant-maintained or controlled integrated
schools, taking both Protestant and
Roman Catholic pupils.
All publicly financed schools are managed
by boards of governors, which include elected
parents and teachers among their members.
Although all schools must be open to
pupils of all religions, most Roman Catholic
pupils attend Catholic maintained schools or
Catholic voluntary grammar schools, and
most Protestant children are enrolled at
controlled schools or non-denominational
voluntary grammar schools.
The Government has a statutory duty to
encourage integrated education as a way of
breaking down sectarian barriers. There are 28
integrated schools and it is expected that pupil
numbers will rise from the current level of
some 5,000 (about 2 per cent of the school
population) to over 6,300 by 1997. Integrated
schools are financed by the Government.
Existing controlled, maintained and voluntary
grammar schools can apply to become integrated
following a majority vote by parents.
All nursery, primary and secondary
schools are financed on the basis of a formula
which relates a major part of each school’s
resources to the number of pupils it can
attract. All secondary schools have delegated
budgets under which the Board of Governors
decides spending priorities. Nursery and
429
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
primary schools have partially delegated
budgets with responsibility for the non-staff
elements of their budgets. In 1995-96 most
primary schools had full delegation of budgets
on a voluntary basis.
School Places
Education authorities are responsible for
providing school places, with the exception of
GM schools in England and Wales, where
governing bodies are responsible.
Under the 1993 Education Act the
Funding Agency for Schools in England may
take on some responsibility for securing
enough school places in individual LEA areas.
In areas where between 10 and 75 per cent of
pupils are being educated in GM primary or
secondary schools, the LEA and the Agency
may be jointly responsible. Once 75 per cent
of primary or secondary pupils are in GM
schools, the Agency may be solely responsible
for the provision of school places. The
Agency can only be involved in the provision
of school places if the Secretary of State
makes an order to that effect.
Pupils
Parents are required by law to see that their
children receive efficient full-time education, at
school or elsewhere, between the ages of five
and 16 in Great Britain and four and 16 in
Northern Ireland. About 93 per cent of pupils
receive free education financed from public
funds, while the others attend independent
schools paid for by fees from parents.
Boys and girls are taught together in most
primary schools. More than 80 per cent of
pupils in state secondary schools in England
and Wales and about 64 per cent in Northern
Ireland attend mixed schools. In Scotland all
state secondary schools are mixed. Most
independent schools (see p. 433) for younger
children are mixed; the majority providing
secondary education are single-sex, although the
number of mixed secondary schools is growing.
Nursery and Primary Schools
Although there is no statutory requirement to
educate under-fives, nearly 55 per cent of
three- and four-year-olds in Britain attend
nursery schools or classes. In addition,
many children attend pre-school playgroups,
most of which are organised by parents
and incorporated in the Pre-School
Learning Alliance.
In July 1995 the Government launched a
voucher scheme to provide a pre-school place
for every four-year-old in Britain whose
parents wish to take it up. Every parent with
a child in this age group will be given a
voucher worth £1,100, which they can
exchange for:
• a part-time place in a nursery class in an
independent, voluntary or state school; or
• a full-time place in a reception class in a
state school; or
• up to a full-time place in any other
private or voluntary institution, such as a
playgroup or private nursery.
The first places under the scheme will be
available from April 1996, and the scheme
will become fully operational one year later.
Different voucher arrangements are to be
made in Northern Ireland, where children
start school at an earlier age than in the rest
of Britain.
Compulsory education begins at five in
Great Britain and four in Northern Ireland,
when children go to infant schools or
departments; at seven many go on to junior
schools or departments. The usual age for
transfer from primary to secondary schools is
11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
but some local authorities in England have
established first schools for pupils aged five
to eight, nine or ten, and middle schools for
age-ranges between eight and 14. In Scotland
primary schools take children from five to
12, when they transfer to secondary schools.
For information on independent schools,
see p. 433.
Secondary Schools
Around nine-tenths of the state secondary
school population in Great Britain attend
comprehensive schools. These take pupils
without reference to ability or aptitude and
provide a wide-ranging secondary education
for all or most of the children in a district.
430
EDUCATION
Schools in England and Wales can be
organised in a number of ways. They include:
• those that take the age-range from 11 to 18;
• middle schools (see p. 430); and
• schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to
16, combined with a sixth-form college
or a further education college for pupils
over 16.
Most other children attend grammar or
secondary modern schools, to which they are
allocated after selection procedures at the
age of 11.
Scottish secondary education is almost
completely non-selective; the majority of
schools are comprehensives covering the
age-range 12 to 18.
In Northern Ireland secondary education is
organised largely along selective lines, the 71
grammar schools admitting some 59,000
pupils on the basis of tests in English, maths
and science. Over 89,000 pupils attend non¬
grammar secondary schools. Some secondary
schools are run on a non-selective basis.

Rights of Parents
Parents must be given general information
about a school through a prospectus and the
school’s annual report or, in Scotland, the
school’s handbook. They also have a statutory
right to express a preference for a particular
school for their child, and there is an appeal
system if their choice is not met.
In England and Wales parents choosing
among local secondary schools have the right
to see:
• national performance tables showing
the latest public examination results,
vocational qualification results and rates
of absence on a school-by-school basis;
and
• information in each school’s prospectus
on public examination results, vocational
qualification results, attendance rates and
the destinations of school leavers.
National tables are published on the
performance of all secondary schools
throughout Britain, including information on
the 16 to 18 age group. Summaries of
school inspection reports (see p. 439) are
given to parents.
All state schools in England and Wales
have to give parents a written annual report
on their child’s achievements, containing
details about:
• the child’s progress in all subjects and
activities;
• the child’s general progress and
attendance record;
• the results of National Curriculum
assessments and of public examinations
taken by the child;
• comparative results of pupils of the same
age in the school and nationally; and
• information about the arrangements for
discussing pupils’ school reports with
teachers.
All parents are invited to an annual
meeting in order to discuss the governors’
annual report.
In Scotland national guidelines to schools
on reporting to parents advise that they
should provide information about their child’s
attainment in the various subjects, teachers’
comments on his or her progress and details
about steps to build on success or overcome
difficulties. One main school report each
year is advised, together with one brief
update report.
The Northern Ireland system for
reporting to parents is broadly similar to that
in England and Wales.
431
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parents’ Charters
The Government has published parents’
charters for England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland which explain the rights of
parents in the education of their children.
Updated parents’ charters for England and
Wales were published in June 1994, and a
revised charter for Scotland was published in
January 1995.
Failing Schools
If school inspectors in England and Wales
identify a school failing to give its pupils an
acceptable standard of education, the LEA
can appoint new governors and withdraw
delegated management from the school. As
an alternative, central government can put
the school under new management until its
performance reaches a satisfactory level. The
new management is financed from central
government. After further advice from the
schools inspectorate (see p. 439), the
Secretary of State decides whether to end the
new management’s period of care for the
school; if this is done, the school becomes
grant maintained.
Ethnic Minority Children
Most school-aged children from ethnic
minorities were born in Britain and tend to
share the interests and aspirations of children
in the population at large. Nevertheless, a
substantial number still have particular needs
arising from cultural differences, including
those of language, religion and custom.
The education authorities have done much
to meet these needs. English language
teaching continues to receive priority, with a
growing awareness of the value of bilingual
support in the early primary years. Schools
may teach the main ethnic minority
community languages at secondary level in
England and Wales as part of the National
Curriculum. Schools have to take account of
the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of
pupils, and curricula should reflect ethnic
and cultural diversity. Measures have been
taken to improve the achievement of
ethnic minority pupils, and to prepare all
children, not just those of ethnic minority
origin, for living in a multi-ethnic society.
Special Educational Needs
Special educational needs comprise learning
difficulties of all kinds, including mental and
physical disabilities which hinder or prevent
learning. LEAs are required to identify
children whose learning difficulties are very
severe or complex and to assess and meet
their needs. They should also enable parents
to be involved in decisions about their child’s
special education in partnership with the
school.
If the LEA believes that it should
determine the education for the child, it must
draw up a formal statement of the child’s
special educational needs and the action it
intends to take to meet them.
In England and Wales parents have a right
of appeal to the Special Educational Needs
Tribunal if they disagree with the LEA
decisions about their child’s special
educational needs. The Tribunal’s verdict is
final and binding on all parties.
Under the 1993 Education Act there are
statutory time limits within which LEAs in
England and Wales must carry out
procedures for making assessments and
statements. Similar timetables for Scotland
are operated through guidance from The
Scottish Office Education Department. A
state school named in a statement of
special educational needs is required to admit
the child.
Wherever possible, children with special
educational needs are educated in ordinary
schools. Placement in an ordinary school
must be compatible with the needs of the
child and with the provision of efficient
education for the other children in the
school. The LEA is required to comply with
parents’ choice of school unless this is
inappropriate for the child, involves an
inefficient use of resources or is incompatible
with the efficient education of other children.
A Code of Practice has been issued by the
Government offering practical guidance to all
LEAs and state schools in England and Wales
on how to identify, assess and monitor all
pupils with special educational needs. A series
432
EDUCATION
of measures to monitor the implementation
of the Code has also been set up.
Each school in England and Wales must
formulate a policy on pupils with special
educational needs and must publish
information about that policy. Annual reports
to parents must report on the success of
these policies.
In Scotland the choice of school is a
matter for agreement between education
authorities and parents. In January 1995 HM
Inspectors of Schools published a report
which reviewed practice in pre-school
provision, schools and further education
colleges in Scotland. The report sets out
clear, basic principles which emphasise the
importance of partnership between all
involved in meeting special educational needs.
In Northern Ireland steps are being taken
to introduce changes similar to those in
England and Wales.
There are nearly 1,800 special schools
(both day and boarding) in Britain for pupils
with special educational needs. Some of these
are run by voluntary organisations and some
are established in hospitals. They cater for
some 115,000 pupils. The pupil/teacher ratio
in special schools is 5.8 to 1 compared with
10.5 to 1 in 1970-71.
The Government has published guidance
for parents of children with special needs in
England, Wales and Scotland which sets out
the rights and responsibilities of parents in
their child’s education.
Health and Welfare of Schoolchildren
Physical education, including organised
games, is part of the curriculum of all
maintained schools, and in England and
Wales playing fields must be available for
pupils over the age of eight. Most secondary
schools have a gymnasium.
Government health departments are
responsible for the medical inspection of
schoolchildren and for advice on, and
treatment of, medical and dental problems.
The education service seeks to help prevent
and deal with juvenile drug misuse and to
help prevent the spread of AIDS. In England
government funds support the training of
teachers with responsibility for drug education.
Guidance on drug prevention in England’s
schools was issued by the Government in
May 1995. The document outlines how to
teach pupils about the dangers of drug
misuse and advises schools on developing
policies in drug education and prevention.
Additional guidance is provided in a
government White Paper—Tackling Drugs
Together—also published in May 1995.
LEAs and GM schools are responsible for
providing school meals for pupils. They are
free to decide the nature of the meals service,
taking account of local circumstances. In
Northern Ireland school meals must be
provided for primary, special and grant-aided
nursery school pupils.
Free meals must be provided for children
whose parents receive a social security benefit
called income support, but all other pupils
have to be charged for meals. Although LEAs
do not have to provide milk to any pupil,
they must, if they choose to do so, provide
free milk to pupils of parents in receipt of
income support and can offer subsidised milk
to other pupils.
LEAs must provide or arrange free of
charge the transport they consider necessary
to enable pupils living in their area to attend
school. The most common grounds for
this are distance, safety or pupils’ special
educational needs. LEAs must publish details
each year about their school transport policies.
Corporal punishment is prohibited by law
in state schools in Britain, and for pupils in
independent schools whose fees are met
wholly or partly from public funds.
Independent Schools
Fee-paying independent schools must register
with the appropriate central government
education department and are open to
inspection. They can be required to remedy
serious shortcomings in their accommodation
or teaching and to exclude anyone regarded
as unsuitable to teach in or own a school.
About 7 per cent of schoolchildren attend
independent schools.
There are nearly 2,500 independent
schools in Britain educating over 600,000
pupils of all ages. They charge fees varying
from around £300 a term for day pupils at
433
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
nursery age to over £4,000 a term for senior
boarding pupils. Many offer bursaries to help
pupils from less well-off families. Such pupils
may also be helped by LEAs—particularly if
the authorities’ own schools cannot meet the
needs of individual children—or by the
Government’s Assisted Places Scheme, under
which financial assistance is given according
to parental income. Over 38,000 places are
offered in England, Wales and Scotland under
the scheme. The Government also gives income-
related help with fees to about 550 pupils at
five music schools and the Royal Ballet
School; there are also a limited number of
similar scholarships at cathedral choir schools.
Independent schools range from small
kindergartens to large day and boarding
schools, and from new and, in some cases,
experimental schools to ancient foundations.
The 600 boys’, girls’ and mixed preparatory
schools prepare children for entry to senior
schools. The normal age-range for these
preparatory schools is from seven-plus to 11,
12 or 13, but many have pre-preparatory
departments for younger children. A number
of independent schools have been established
by religious orders and ethnic minorities.
Independent schools for older pupils
from 11, 12 or 13 to 18 or 19—include about
550 which are often referred to as ‘public
schools’. These belong to the Headmasters’
Conference, the Governing Bodies
Association, the Society of Headmasters and
Headmistresses of Independent Schools, the
Girls’ Schools Association and the Governing
Bodies of Girls’ Schools Association.
In Northern Ireland there are 20
independent schools educating nearly 1,000
pupils. These schools are subject to
inspection by the Department of Education.
Teachers
England and Wales
Teachers in state schools in England and
Wales are appointed by LEAs or school
governing bodies. They must hold
qualifications approved by the Department
for Education and Employment.
Almost all entrants to teaching in state
schools in England and Wales complete an
approved course of teacher training. These
courses are offered by university departments
of education as well as other higher education
establishments (see p. 443). One of the two
main qualifications is the four-year Bachelor
of Education (BEd) honours degree. The
other is the successful completion of a three-
year degree course, topped up by a one-year
Postgraduate Certificate in Education
(PGCE) course.
Formal teacher appraisal is being
introduced in English and Welsh
schools. By September 1995 all
teachers had entered the first year of
their two-year appraisal cycle, which
is intended to assist professional
development, strengthen the
management of schools and improve
the quality of education provided to
pupils. Consideration is being given to
ways of ensuring that teachers’ pay is
more closely related to performance.
Reform of Initial Teacher Training
Under new government reforms in England
and Wales, schools can play a much larger
part in initial teacher training by taking on
more responsibility for planning and
managing courses and for the selection,
training and assessment of students, usually
in partnership with institutions. The reforms
enable schools to train students to teach their
specialist subjects, assess pupils and manage
classes. The first courses following the new
criteria began in 1994.
The reforms allow consortia of schools to
run courses for postgraduate students if they
wish to do so. Other courses, including all
undergraduate courses, are run by universities
and colleges in partnership with schools.
In September 1995 the new Teacher
Training Agency became responsible for
financing initial teacher training courses,
ensuring that national standards are met and
promoting teaching as a career.
In Wales, responsibility for the funding of
initial teacher training remains with the
Higher Education Funding Council for
Wales, which will also be able to fund such
434
EDUCATION
training in schools. The Funding Council will
also assume responsibility for accrediting
institutions and schools providing courses.
Other Training
Under the Licensed Teacher Scheme, a
trainee teacher is appointed to the school,
which provides training and pays a salary; on
successful completion of a two-year period of
in-service training, qualified teacher status is
granted. Qualified teachers from other
European Union countries are usually granted
qualified teacher status.
Scotland
All teachers in education authority schools
must be registered with the General
Teaching Council (GTC) for Scotland. The
GTC is responsible for disciplinary
procedures under which teachers guilty of
professional misconduct may be removed
permanently or temporarily from the register.
Advice is given by the GTC to the Secretary
of State on teacher supply and the professional
suitability of teacher-training courses.
All entrants to the teaching profession are
graduates. New primary teachers qualify
either through a four-year BEd course or a
one-year postgraduate course at a higher
education teacher-training institution. In
addition, the University of Stirling offers
courses which combine academic and
professional training for future primary and
secondary teachers. Teachers of academic
subjects at secondary schools must hold a
degree containing two passes in the subjects
which they wish to teach. Secondary school
teachers must undertake a one-year
postgraduate training course.
Under new guidelines on initial teacher¬
training courses, students on the one-year
postgraduate course for secondary teachers
spend 22 weeks in school during their
courses. The overall school placement for the
undergraduate BEd degree for primary school
teachers is 30 weeks over the four-year period
of the course. On the one-year postgraduate
course for primary school teachers, students
spend 18 weeks in school and 18 weeks in
college-based study.
All new pre-service and major in-service
courses provided by teacher training
institutions must be approved by The
Scottish Office Education Department and a
validating body.
Education authorities have developed
schemes to implement national guidelines for
staff development and appraisal. Schemes
must ensure that all teachers have been
appraised at least once by the end of the
1995-96 school session.
Northern Ireland
Teacher training is provided by Queen’s
University, in Belfast, the University of
Ulster, two colleges of education and the
Open University (OU—see p. 445). The
principal courses are BEd Honours (four
years) and the one-year Postgraduate
Certificate of Education. The OU course is
part time and lasts 18 months. Education and
library boards have a statutory duty to ensure
that teachers are equipped with the necessary
skills to implement education reforms and the
Northern Ireland school curriculum.
School Curriculum
England and Wales
The National Curriculum consists of core
subjects, which are compulsory for five- to
16-year-olds, and foundation subjects, which
must be studied to the age of 14 at least. In
England the core subjects of the curriculum
are English, mathematics and science, and the
foundation subjects are technology (design
and technology, and information technology),
history, geography, music, art, physical
education and, for secondary school pupils, a
modern foreign language.
This is also the case in Wales but, in
addition, Welsh is a core subject in Welsh¬
speaking schools and a foundation subject in
non-Welsh speaking schools. Nearly all
primary schools in Wales teach Welsh as a
first or second language and about a quarter
use Welsh as the sole or main medium of
instruction. In secondary schools, Welsh is
compulsory for pupils aged 11 to 16 in
Welsh-speaking schools and for pupils aged
435
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
11 to 14 in other schools. By August 1999
Welsh will be compulsory for almost all 11-
to 16-year-old pupils.
There is more choice in the curriculum for
pupils aged 14 to 16. History, geography, art
and music are all optional subjects, as are
technology and a modern foreign language in
Wales. In England a modern foreign language
and technology are currently optional subjects
for 14- to 16-year-olds, but will become
compulsory in September 1996.
Religious education is required for all
pupils as part of the basic curriculum and all
secondary schools must provide sex
education. Parents have a right to withdraw
their children from these subjects.
Following a thorough review in 1994, a
revised National Curriculum is being
introduced for five- to 14-year-olds in
September 1995 and for 14- to 16-year-olds
from September 1996. The new streamlined
requirements are designed to release more
time for schools to use outside the statutory
curriculum and give teachers more scope to
use their professional discretion.
The National Curriculum now gives
greater emphasis to information technology
(IT), with the publication of separate
programmes of study and attainment targets.
Schools are also required to provide pupils
with the opportunity to develop IT skills in
all other National Curriculum subjects.
National testing and assessment of pupils’
performance at the ages of seven, 11 and 14
is confined to the core subjects. All 11-
and 14-year-olds are tested in English,
mathematics and science, whereas seven-year-
olds are tested in mathematics and English
only. In Wales the three age groups are also
tested in Welsh.
The General Certificate of Secondary
Education (GCSE) is the major qualification
taken by pupils at the end of compulsory
schooling at the age of 16. The proportion of
pupils with five or more GCSEs at grades A
to C has risen significantly in recent years. In
England the proportion rose from nearly 33 per
cent in 1988-89 to over 43 per cent in 1993-94.
General oversight of examination standards
rests jointly with the School Curriculum and
Assessment Authority in England and the
Assessment Authority for Wales.
The Independent Appeals Authority for
School Examinations hears appeals against
grades awarded in GCSE and GCE A level
and AS examinations (see p. 440) when the
appeals procedures of the examining body
concerned have been exhausted.
A new vocational course for pupils
aged 14 to 16 was announced in
November 1994. The new Part One
General National Vocational
Qualification (GNVQ) is broadly
equivalent to two GCSE courses and
is being piloted in 115 secondary
schools in England and Wales from
September 1995. It covers three
subject areas—business, health and
social care, and manufacturing. Three
new subject areas will be introduced
in 1996: art and design, information
technology, and leisure and tourism.
New GCSE (Short Course) qualifications
are to be introduced from September 1996.
These will take half the time typically allotted
to a GCSE and will be available in modern
foreign languages, religious education, design
and technology, and information technology.
Further courses are being developed in art,
geography, history, music and physical
education. For schools in Wales a GCSE
(Short Course) qualification in Welsh will
be introduced.
Scotland
The content and management of the
curriculum are not prescribed by statute and
responsibility rests with education authorities
and headteachers, though guidance is
provided by the Secretary of State and the
Scottish Consultative Council on the
Curriculum. The Council has recommended
that secondary level pupils should follow a
broad and balanced curriculum consisting of
English, mathematics, science, a modern
European language, social studies, technological
activities, art, music or drama, religious and
moral education, and physical education.
A major programme of curricular review
and development has been carried out for the
five to 14 age-range. The Government has
436
EDUCATION
issued guidance on English language,
mathematics, expressive arts, Latin, Gaelic,
modern languages, environmental studies and
religious and moral education. Under new
arrangements, standardised tests in English
and mathematics are given to pupils in the
five to 14 age group whenever they complete
one of five levels. A major programme to
extend modern language teaching to primary
schools is in progress.
Provision is made for teaching in Gaelic in
Gaelic-speaking areas and in some other areas
where education authorities have identified
| this as a priority.
Pupils take the Scottish Certificate of
Education (SCE) at Standard Grade at the
end of their fourth year of secondary
education, normally around the age of 16.
The proportion of pupils leaving school with
no SCE qualification has fallen significantly
from one pupil in four in 1983-84 to fewer
than one in ten in 1993-94.
The Higher Grade can be taken in the
fifth and/or sixth year of secondary
education. Some pupils also sit examinations
for the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies or
take vocational National Certificate units
(see p. 441).
Northern Ireland
The common curriculum in all publicly
financed schools is made up of religious
education and six broad areas of study:
English, mathematics, science and technology,
the environment and society, creative and
expressive studies, and, for secondary schools,
language studies.
The school curriculum also includes four
compulsory cross-curricular themes: cultural
heritage, education for mutual understanding,
health education and information technology.
Secondary schools have two additional themes—
economic awareness and careers education.
Following reviews of the curriculum, new
arrangements are to take effect from
September 1996. These are broadly similar to
those taking place in England and Wales and
i will allow schools and pupils more
flexibility in the choice of subjects in the
curriculum as a whole. Teaching of the
statutory curriculum in primary schools will
take up about 85 per cent of teaching time.
Programmes of study for pupils aged 12 to 14
are being reviewed to take account of the
changes proposed for primary school children.
Arrangements to assess pupils’ progress
at the ages of eight, 11 and 14 were piloted
again in 1994—95. Statutory pupil
assessment will be introduced in the 1996-97
school year. As in England and Wales, the
GCSE examination is used to assess 16-year-
old pupils.
Religious Education and Collective Worship
in Schools
In England and Wales state schools must
provide religious education and a daily act of
collective worship for all registered pupils.
Every LEA has to produce an agreed
religious education syllabus, which must be
reviewed every five years. Syllabuses must
reflect Christianity while taking account of
the other main religions practised in Britain.
In July 1994 model syllabuses for
religious education in England were
published. These were developed by the
School Curriculum and Assessment Authority
along with representatives of Christian
denominations, other faith communities and
teachers. The syllabuses are intended to help
promote the quality and standing of religious
education and to assist LEAs to prepare
syllabuses. LEAs may adopt one of the
models in full or draw on them when
preparing the local syllabus. Parents have the
right to withdraw their children from
religious education classes and from
collective worship. Voluntary-aided schools
provide the opportunity for denominational
religious education.
Scottish education authorities are
required to see that schools practise
religious observance and give pupils religious
instruction; parents may withdraw their
children if they wish. Certain schools
provide for Roman Catholic children, but in
all schools there are safeguards for
individual conscience.
In Northern Ireland, schools must provide
religious education and collective worship,
although parents have the right to withdraw
their children from both. A core syllabus has
437
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
been approved by the four main churches in
Northern Ireland and this must be taught in
all grant-aided schools.
Sex Education
Under the 1993 Education Act all state
secondary schools in England and Wales are
required to provide sex education for all
pupils registered at the school. This must
include education about HIV and AIDS and
sexually transmitted diseases. In state primary
schools the governors must consider whether
sex education should be offered beyond the
requirements of the National Curriculum
Science Order.
Sex education in state schools must
encourage young people to have regard to
moral considerations and the value of family
life. Parents are entitled to withdraw their
children from sex education classes other than
those required by the National Curriculum
Science Order. All state schools must publish
in their prospectus a summary of the content
and organisation of any sex education provided.
In Scotland, government guidance on sex
education is provided to education authorities
and headteachers, who are responsible for its
content.
Curriculum Development and
Assessment
The School Curriculum and Assessment
Authority in England and the Curriculum
and Assessment Authority for Wales are
responsible for:
• keeping all aspects of the school
curriculum and of school examinations
under review;
• advising the Government on the
curriculum, and assessment and
examination arrangements; and
• publishing information about the
curriculum.
All GCSE and other qualifications offered
to pupils of compulsory school age in state
schools in England and Wales must be
approved by the Government. Associated
syllabuses and assessment procedures must
comply with national guidelines and be
approved by the relevant curriculum and
assessment authority.
In Scotland curriculum development is
undertaken by the Scottish Consultative
Council on the Curriculum in close
consultation with The Scottish Office
Education Department. The Scottish
Examination Board liaises with the Council
on links between the curriculum and
assessment.
The Northern Ireland Council for the
Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment is
responsible for the curriculum and its
assessment as well as the conduct of
examinations in Northern Ireland.
Information Technology
The National Curriculum places a strong
emphasis on the use of information
technology (IT) to ensure that all children are
appropriately versed in the new technologies.
In England the average number of pupils per
microcomputer in primary schools in 1993-94
was 18 compared with 25 in 1991-92 and 107
in 1984-85. In secondary schools the average
number of pupils per microcomputer was ten
in 1993-94 compared with 13 in 1991-92 and
60 in 1984-85.
In 1995-96 the Department for Education
and Employment (DFEE) is continuing to
support the provision of microcomputers,
software and training in IT in schools
through the Grants for Education and
Support Training (GEST) programme.
Other DFEE programmes include
funding for:
• development and use of CD-ROM
technology in schools;
• investigating the potential of interactive
multimedia technology as a teaching aid
and assessing its full use for curriculum
development in schools; and
• consultation on the use of information
superhighways in education.
In Wales the Welsh Office also has a grant
programme to support microcomputers in
schools and has financed the installation of
satellite television equipment in all secondary
schools. This is used to teach modern foreign
languages and other subjects such as
438
EDUCATION
geography and science. There is also a
scheme to supply all primary schools in
Wales with CD-ROM equipment.
The Government also finances the
National Council for Educational Technology,
which promotes the development and
effective use of new technologies throughout
the education system. The corresponding
body in Scotland is the Scottish Council for
Educational Technology.
In Scotland computing studies are
included in the five to 14 national guidelines
on environmental studies. In most secondary
schools, first and second year pupils take a
short course in computing; third and fourth
year pupils choose between a Standard Grade
course or a National Certificate module.
Similarly, fifth and sixth year pupils are able
to choose between Higher Grade and a
number of National Certificate modules.
In Northern Ireland, IT is one of the four
compulsory educational cross-curricular
themes forming part of the curriculum for
primary and secondary pupils in publicly
financed schools.
Other Educational Aids
The BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation)
and the independent broadcasting companies
transmit radio and television programmes
designed for schools. Teachers’ notes, pupils’
pamphlets and computer software accompany
many broadcast series.
School Inspections
Various inspectorates report to the
Government on the quality of education
provided by schools.
England
In England the independent Office for
Standards in Education (OFSTED) advises
the Secretary of State on quality, standards
and efficiency, and regulates a system of
school inspections. The inspection cycle
began in September 1993 for secondary
schools and in September 1994 for primary
and other schools.
Every school has to be inspected every
four years by a team of independent
inspectors—headed by a registered inspector
—containing educationists and lay people.
Inspections take place according to agreed
national standards monitored by OFSTED.
Parents are sent a summary of the inspection
report, which is published. School governing
bodies have to prepare action plans to follow
it up and then report back to parents on their
progress. OFSTED is headed by Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools.
Wales
Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools for
Wales has similar functions to those of
OFSTED. All schools are inspected every
five years in the first instance.
Scotland
In Scotland HM Inspectors of Schools are
responsible for independent evaluation of
education standards and for advising the
Secretary of State. Full reports on inspections
are published and a short summary given to
parents. The Inspectorate’s Audit Unit
collects, analyses and publishes evidence
about the performance of schools and
education authorities. Evidence is published
on a comparative basis, and recommendations
are made for action and improvement.
Northern Ireland
The Education and Training Inspectorate
advises on quality and standards in schools.
Each school has to be inspected every five
years, and reports of inspections are
published. From 1996 general inspection
teams will include lay people. Boards of
Governors respond to inspectors’ findings by
indicating any action planned and submitting
details to the Department of Education.
Schools, Careers and Business
One of the Government’s key objectives is to
help young people develop the skills the
economy needs.
Education Business Partnerships,
consisting of representatives from industry,
SL
439
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
education and the wider community, aim to
bring about closer links between education
and industry in Great Britain and ensure that
young people develop the skills to help them
succeed in the labour market. They are
supported by Training and Enterprise Councils,
Local Enterprise Companies and LEAs.
One of the main schemes managed by the
Partnerships is the Teacher Placement
Service (TPS), funded by the Government.
The TPS organises placements in business
for teachers and lecturers to extend their
professional and personal development,
improve learning opportunities for young
people, and provide better careers education
services. Since 1989 some 100,000 teachers
have been on placements.
Compacts bring together employers, young
people, schools, colleges and other bodies
involved in training in order to help young
people achieve more at school, and to
continue education and training after the age
of 16. Under Compact schemes, young people
work towards agreed goals; in return for
achieving them, employers provide a number
of incentives.
Careers
Most schools have a written policy
statement on careers education and guidance,
a careers co-ordinator and an agreement
with their local careers guidance service about
the co-ordinated contribution they will make
to student development. LEAs are active
participants in the majority of careers service
organisations.
Careers services in schools and colleges are
supported by materials produced by the
Careers and Occupational Information Centre.
In Northern Ireland careers education is one
of the six compulsory education themes forming
part of the secondary school curriculum (see
p. 437). The Careers Service is part of the
Training and Employment Agency.
All state secondary schools in England
and Wales have to provide leavers with a
National Record of Achievement setting out
their school attainments, including public
examination and National Curriculum
assessment results. In Scotland the Record is
not compulsory.
In Northern Ireland all pupils in
secondary education are issued with a record
of achievement on leaving school, and from
1997-98 this will apply to primary schools.
EDUCATION AFTER 16
About 67 per cent of pupils choose to continue
in education after 16. This takes place in
school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges,
further education colleges, universities and
other higher education institutions.
Broadly speaking, education after 16 is
divided into further and higher education.
Further and adult education is largely
vocational and covers courses up to and
including GCE A level and AS qualifications,
GNVQ_ Advanced level or their equivalents
(see p. 441). Higher education covers
advanced courses at levels higher than GCE
A level or equivalent.
Almost 4 million people were enrolled on
further education courses in 1992-93. By
1995-96 every 16- and 17-year-old leaving
full-time education in Great Britain will be
encouraged to undertake vocational education
or training by the offer of a Youth Credit,
enabling them to buy training from the
establishment of their choice (see p. 186).
In 1992-93 there were 1.4 million home
and overseas students in higher education, of
whom 47 per cent were women.
In 1993 the Government published
charters for the users of further and higher
education in England, Wales and Scotland,
setting out the standards of service which
users should expect. Further education
colleges also have individual charters.
Similar charters are to be published in
Northern Ireland.
Credit accumulation and transfer schemes
are in use in many English and Welsh post¬
school establishments. In Scotland a credit
accumulation scheme covers courses in all
further and higher education. Similar
schemes in higher education in Northern
Ireland are compatible with those of
institutions in the rest of Britain.
The national computer-based Educational
Counselling and Credit Transfer Information
Service (ECCTIS) provides prospective
students and their advisers with quick and
440
EDUCATION
asy access without charge to information
bout 100,000 course opportunities at over
00 universities and colleges of higher and
urther education throughout Britain.
^CCTIS, which is available to subscribing
nstitutions on CD-ROM, can be found at
iver 4,500 locations in over two-thirds of
econdary schools with sixth forms, as well as
he majority of further education colleges,
ligher education institutions, careers offices
nd training and enterprise councils;
XCTIS is also available at British Council
•ffices throughout the world.
Schools and Sixth-form Colleges
4aving taken the GCSE examination (see
>. 436), students in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland can stay on at school or be
ducated in a further education college,
itudents in England and Wales can also
tudy at sixth-form colleges. They study for
laminations which are the main standard for
■ntry to higher education or professional
raining. These include the academic General
I Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced (A)
evel, the Advanced Supplementary (AS)
:xamination, Advanced General National
/ocational Qualifications (GNVQs) and
National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). The
3CE A level is taken at the age of 18 or 19
fter two years’ study; part of the qualification
s based on course work and the rest on
vritten test papers. AS levels enable sixth-form
mpils to study a wider range of subjects.
Students specialising in the arts, for example,
:an continue to study technological subjects
it this level. Requiring the same standard of
vork as A levels, an AS level occupies half
he teaching and study time of an A level.
Equality of status for academic and
vocational qualifications is being promoted in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
lew GNVQs for young people in full-time
iducation between the ages of 16 and 18
irovide a broad-based preparation for a
ange of occupations and higher education,
ind are designed to have parity of esteem
vith GCE A levels. There are three GNVQ
evels—Advanced, Intermediate and
foundation. An Advanced GNVQ;—called
he vocational A level—requires a level of
achievement broadly equal to two GCE A
levels. GNVQs may also be taken in
combination with other qualifications, such as
GCE A levels or GCSEs.
A study of GCE A level and GCSE
examination standards is to be carried out by
the School Curriculum and Assessment
Authority and the Office for Standards in
Education, following the eighth successive
annual increase in 1995 in the pass rate for
A levels.
Scotland
Pupils staying on at school after the end of
compulsory education study for the Higher
Grade Scottish Certificate of Education exam
at the age of 16-18; passes at this grade are
the basis for entry to higher education or
professional training. The Certificate of Sixth
Year Studies (CSYS) is for pupils who have
completed their Higher Grade main studies
and who wish to continue studies in
particular subjects.
A flexible system of vocational courses for
16- to 18-year-olds has been introduced in
schools and colleges in disciplines such as
business and administration, engineering and
industrial production. These courses are also
intended to meet the needs of many adults
entering training or returning to education.
The courses lead to the award of the non-
advanced National Certificate, intended for
students over 16 who have successfully
completed a programme of vocational courses
based on short study units. Similar unit-based
courses are also available at advanced levels.
General Scottish Vocational Qualifications
(General SVQs) are designed to meet the
needs of 16- to 19-year-olds at school or in
further education colleges. Broadly
compatible with the GNVQs in the rest of
Britain, General SVQs are a stepping-stone
to higher education or further training. They
are accredited and awarded by the Scottish
Vocational Education Council (SCOTVEC).
A new system of courses and awards for
fifth- and sixth-year pupils will take effect in
the late 1990s. Under this, Highers will
remain but courses will be based on units
called modules. The recommended study
time for each Higher will be extended from
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
120 hours to 160 hours. Existing courses
validated by the Scottish Examinations Board
and SCOTVEC will be drawn into a unified
system of curriculum and assessment.
Advanced Higher courses will be developed,
incorporating the current Certificate of Sixth
Year Studies and building on Highers to
provide a two-year 320-hour course.
Further Education Colleges
People over the age of 16 can also take
courses in further education colleges. Much
further education is work-related and
vocational. Further education institutions
supply much of the education element in
government-sponsored training programmes,
such as Jobskills.

colleges and adult education centres.
Many students on further education
courses attend part time, either by day release
or block release from employment or during
the evenings. The system has strong ties with
commerce and industry, and co-operation
with business is encouraged by the
Government and its agencies. Employers are
normally involved in designing courses.
Courses are run by nearly 580 institutions
of further education, many of which also offer
higher education courses (see p. 443). In
England and Wales each is controlled by an
autonomous further education corporation
and governing body with substantial
representation from business. Scottish
colleges are controlled by an autonomous
board of management.
Funds are allocated to institutions by
further education funding councils in England
and Wales; part of the funding is not cash
limited and is directly related to student
numbers. The Scottish Office Education
Department distributes funds to colleges in
Scotland. In Northern Ireland further
education colleges are financed via the
education and library boards by the
Department of Education.
Institutions in England, Wales and
Scotland are obliged to publish information
about the use of their financial and other
resources. Expenditure plans provide for a
record 25 per cent rise in full-time equivalent
student numbers in England and a 28 per
cent rise in Wales over the three-year period
from 1993. The number of full-time
equivalent students in Scotland is projected
to rise by more than 25 per cent between
1991 and 1996.
Funding councils in England and Wales
send out independent inspectors to assess the
quality of the education provided by colleges.
Inspectors publish reports containing quality
assessments, and colleges are obliged to
explain how they will put things right if there
are major criticisms. Each college has to
publish information about its examination
results annually. Colleges in Scotland are
inspected by the Schools Inspectorate and in
Northern Ireland by the Education and
Training Inspectorate.
Vocational Qualifications
The National Council for Vocational
Qualifications (NCVQ) is establishing a new
framework of National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs) in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. These are based on
national standards that define the
competence, knowledge and understanding
that employers need. Awarding bodies have
been reforming their qualifications for
accreditation by the National Council.
The following five levels of NVQs have
been established:
Level 1—Foundation
Level 2—Basic craft
Level 3—Technician, advanced craft,
supervisor
Level 4—Higher technician, middle
management
Level 5—Middle to higher management.
442
EDUCATION
NVQs consist of units setting out the
standards which the individual must reach
in a range of job-related tasks.
Performance of candidates is assessed by
observation in the workplace. This assessment
consists of practical work, oral questioning,
course work and tests. NVQs are designed
mainly for people in work, although they
can also be studied in colleges and some
schools. NVQs at levels 1 to 4 are available
in most occupations. In Scotland there is a
similar system of Scottish Vocational
Qualifications (SVQs).
NVQs and SVQs have equal recognition
throughout Britain. The GNVQ^and General
SVQ^ system for students in full-time
education is described on p. 441.
Examining Bodies
About 90 per cent of vocational qualifications
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are
assessed by three examining bodies and
accredited by the NCVQ:
• The Business and Technology
Education Council (BTEC) plans and
administers a unified national system of
courses at all levels; the most popular
subjects are business, engineering and
construction.
• The City and Guilds of London
Institute provides mostly part-time
qualifications in areas such as
engineering, construction, catering,
hairdressing and community care.
• The RSA Examinations Board is the
largest provider of information
technology qualifications throughout
Britain and offers qualifications in areas
ranging from management/customer
service to retailing and wholesaling.
These three main vocational awarding
bodies offer GNVQs and a wide range of
NVQs, which will eventually replace most of
their existing awards. Other vocational
qualifications are awarded by a large number
of professional bodies. The Scottish
Vocational Education Council (SCOTVEC)
is the main accreditation and awarding body
in Scotland.
National Targets for Education and
Training
The Government has endorsed new national
targets for education and training announced
in 1995 by the National Advisory Council for
Education and Training Targets. The main
targets, which have been set for the year
2000, are that:
• by age 19, 85 per cent of young people
should achieve five GCSEs at Grade C
or above, an Intermediate GNVQ^or an
NVQ Level 2; and
• by age 21, 60 per cent of young people
should achieve two GCE A levels, an
Advanced GNVQ^or an NVQ^ Level 3.
Higher Education
Higher education, which consists of degree
and equivalent courses, has experienced a
dramatic expansion since the 1980s. The
total number of higher education students
in Britain almost doubled between 1979
and 1993 to some 1.5 million. The
proportion of young people entering full¬
time higher education in Britain rose from
12 per cent in 1979 to some 30 per cent
in 1993.
In order to maintain British expertise in
technology, recent government schemes have
sought to expand higher education and
research in electronics, engineering and
computer science by making available extra
student places, offering bursaries to able
young students to study for engineering
degrees and providing additional staff and
research fellowships.
Higher education institutions are
responsible for providing high-quality
education. The Higher Education Quality
Council, financed by subscriptions from
institutions, ensures that satisfactory quality
control arrangements are in place. The higher
education funding councils for England,
Scotland and Wales (see p. 444) carry out
assessments of the education provided by
institutions, publish regular reports on their
findings and aim to ensure that any serious
problems are put right by the university or
college concerned. Acting on behalf of the
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Department of Education for Northern
Ireland, the Higher Education Funding
Council for England publishes reports on the
quality of education in the two Northern
Ireland universities.

Finance
Higher education is largely financed by public
funds, tuition fees for students paid through
the student awards system and income
received by institutions from research
contracts and other sources.
Government finance for higher education
institutions in England, Scotland and Wales is
distributed by higher education funding
councils responsible to their respective
Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland grant
is paid direct to the two universities by the
Department of Education, following advice
from the Northern Ireland Higher Education
Council. The private University of Buckingham
does not receive any public grants.
Finance from the funding councils helps
meet the costs of teaching, research and
related activities in all publicly funded
universities and higher education colleges. In
addition to teaching students, institutions
undertake paid training, research or consultancy
for commercial firms (see p. 326). Many
establishments have endowments or receive
grants from foundations and benefactors.
Student Grants and Loans
Over 95 per cent of full-time students
resident in England and Wales on first degree
and other comparable higher education
courses receive mandatory awards covering
tuition fees and a maintenance grant. The
level of the grant depends on the income of
the student and of the student’s parents or
spouse. Awards are made by LEAs in
England and Wales. The Government
reimburses in full the amount spent by
education authorities on mandatory awards.
Similar schemes are administered by the
Student Awards Agency for Scotland and the
Northern Ireland education and library
boards. LEA grants for other courses can be
given at their discretion.
Most students on courses of full-time,
non-postgraduate higher education can also
take out a loan to help pay their maintenance
costs. Loans are not means tested and
repayments are indexed to inflation. The
scheme is designed to share the cost of
student maintenance more equitably between
students, parents and the taxpayer. In
1993-94 loans worth £317 million were made
to 430,000 students in Britain, representing
47 per cent of those eligible. Loans are
administered by the Student Loans Company
in Glasgow.
Limited access funds administered by
universities and colleges are available to
people in cases where access to higher and
further education might be inhibited by
financial considerations or where students
face real financial difficulties. In 1995-96,
there is provision of £27.7 million in England
and £4.1 million in Scotland for this purpose.
Grants for postgraduate study are offered
by the government education departments
and by the research councils. Increasing
numbers of scholarships are available from
research charities, endowments and particular
industries or companies.
Access Courses
Access and foundation courses provide a
preparation and an appropriate test before
enrolment on a course of higher education for
prospective students who do not possess the
standard entry qualifications (GCE A levels
and equivalent qualifications). Many are from
the ethnic minority communities. The
growth of access courses has been very
rapid in recent years; about 1,200 are now
available nationwide.
444
EDUCATION
The Scottish Wider Access Programme
(SWAP) is designed to promote greater
participation in higher education by mature
students and those without the normal
entry requirements. Successful completion of
a SWAP course guarantees a higher
education place.
Universities
There are some 90 universities, including the
Open University. They are governed by royal
charters or by Act of Parliament and enjoy
academic freedom. They appoint their own
staff, decide which students to admit, provide
their own courses and award their own
degrees. The universities of Oxford and
Cambridge date from the 12th and 13th
centuries, and the Scottish universities of St
Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh
from the 14th and 15th centuries. All the
other universities in Britain were founded in
the 19th and 20th centuries. The 1960s saw
considerable expansion in the number of new
universities. The number of universities also
jumped considerably in 1992, when
polytechnics and some other higher education
establishments were given the freedom to
become universities and chose to exercise it.
Applications for first degree courses are
usually made through the Universities and
Colleges Admission Service (UCAS), in
Cheltenham.
First degree courses are mainly full time
and usually last three years in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. However, there
are some four-year courses, and medical and
veterinary courses normally require five
years. All traditional first degree courses in
Scotland require a minimum of three years’
study. The ratio of staff to full-time students
in Britain is about 1 to 13.2.
Universities offer courses in a wide range
of subjects, including traditional arts subjects
and science and technology. Some courses
lead to the examinations of the chief
professional bodies, and to qualifications such
as those of the BTEC.
Many universities have close links
with commerce and industry, with some
| students having a job and attending on a
part-time basis.
Degree titles vary according to the
practice of each university. In England,
Wales and Northern Ireland the most
common titles for a first degree are Bachelor
of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc)
and for a second degree Master of Arts
(MA), Master of Science (MSc), and Doctor
of Philosophy (PhD). In the older Scottish
universities Master is used for a first degree
in arts subjects. Uniformity of standards
between universities is promoted by
employing external examiners for all
university examinations.
The Open University and other
universities are responsible for validating
degrees at higher education institutions
without degree-awarding powers.
Many staff combine research with teaching
duties. The number of postgraduates has
increased by over 60 per cent in the last
decade; two-thirds are on taught courses. The
Government is encouraging universities to
co-operate closely with industry on research.
Around 50 science parks have been set up by
higher education institutions in conjunction
with industrial scientists and technologists to
promote the development and commercial
application of advanced technology.
The Open University
The Open University is a non-residential
university offering degree and other
courses for adult students of all ages in
Britain and the other member countries of
the European Union.
The University uses a combination of
specially produced printed texts,
correspondence tuition, television and radio
broadcasts, audio/video cassettes and
computing. For some courses, there are
residential schools. There is a network of
study centres for contact with part-time
tutors and counsellors, and with fellow
students. Formal academic qualifications are
not required to register for most courses, but
the standards of the University’s degrees are
the same as those of other universities. Its
first degrees are the BA (Open) or the BSc
(Open), which are general degrees awarded
on a system of credits for each course
completed. In 1995 there were some 92,000
!L
445
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
registered undergraduates, and in all some
157,000 first degrees have been awarded since
the University started its courses in 1970.
The University also has a programme of
higher degrees. About 9,000 students were
registered on higher degree courses in 1995.
There are also programmes for professionals
in a variety of fields.
The University has advised many other
countries on setting up similar institutions,
and has contributed to projects such as the
European Distance Education Network. It is
financed by the Higher Education Funding
Council for England.
Further Education for Adults
Further education for adults is provided by
further education institutions, adult centres
and colleges run by LEAs, and voluntary
bodies such as the Workers’ Educational
Association. The duty to secure it is shared
by the further education funding councils,
The Scottish Office Education Department
(SOED) and LEAs.
The councils and the SOED fund formal
academic and vocational courses, courses
providing access to higher education and
courses in basic literacy and numeracy,
including English for speakers of other
languages. LEAs are responsible for the less
formal leisure and recreational courses. The
councils, the SOED and the LEAs must take
account of adult students with special
educational needs.
University departments of continuing
education also provide courses for adults.
Basic Skills Agency
The Basic Skills Agency (BSA) is concerned
with adult literacy, numeracy and related
basic skills in England and Wales. It provides
consultancy and advisory services; funds local
development projects, including research;
publishes materials for teachers and students;
and organises and sponsors staff training.
Government funding of the BSA is worth
about £4 million in 1995-96.
Following a recent government review, the
BSA has become a more general basic skills
unit. Its responsibilities now cover basic skills
training in the workplace for the unemployed
and for young people as well as its traditional
work with adults.
National Organisation of Adult Learning
The National Organisation of Adult
Learning—formerly the National Institute
of Adult Continuing Education and still
known as NIACE—is the national body
representing adult learners in England and
Wales. It convenes conferences, seminars
and meetings, collects and disseminates
information, conducts enquiries and research,
undertakes special projects and works with
other organisations.
Open and Distance Learning
The terms ‘open’ and ‘distance’ learning
broadly mean learning undertaken without
the direct supervision of a tutor through use
of various media, such as television. More
and more further education colleges are
incorporating many distance learning materials
and methods in their mainstream courses.
Scottish Community Education Council
The Scottish Community Education Council
advises the Government and promotes all
community education matters, including adult
literacy and basic education, and youth work.
Educational Research
Educational research is supported financially
by government departments, the Economic
and Social Research Council, philanthropic
organisations, higher education institutions,
teachers’ associations and other agencies.
The major research institutions outside the
universities are the autonomous National
Foundation for Educational Research in
England and Wales and the Scottish Council
for Research in Education.
LINKS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
Large numbers of people come to Britain
from other countries to study, and British
people work and train overseas. The British
446
EDUCATION
lid programme encourages links between
educational institutions in Britain and
developing countries.
There has been an expansion of interest in
European studies and languages, with
exchanges of teachers, schoolchildren and
students taking place.
European Union Schemes
Exchange of students is promoted by the EU
scheme ERASMUS. Under the scheme,
grants are provided to enable EU students
and those from other countries belonging to
the European Economic Area (see p. 120) to
study in other states. The programme covers
all academic subjects, and the period of study
normally lasts between three and 12 months.
In 1992-93 over 8,000 British students
studied in Europe under the scheme.
LINGUA is an EU programme which
aims to promote competence in foreign
languages. LINGUA offers funding which
contributes towards in-service training for
teachers, student exchanges based on
project work, and the development of new
teaching methods.
A new EU education programme—
SOCRATES—was adopted by the
Council of Ministers in March 1995.
The programme is the first major EU
initiative to encourage practical
co-operation across all levels of
education throughout the European
Union. Under the scheme, schools
in different European countries will
be able to develop partnerships with
one another so that pupils will be
able to participate in a variety of
educational projects throughout the
European Union.
The ERASMUS and LINGUA
programmes have been incorporated into
SOCRATES, which has a budget of £689
million over five years.
Youth for Europe III aims to bring
| together young people from different cultural
and social backgrounds in the European
| Union through a wide range of exchanges.
The five-year programme started in 1995 and
has an EU budget of £102 million.
A new EU vocational training programme
—LEONARDO DA VINCI—came into force
in January 1995 and replaces a number of
previous programmes, including COMETT
(university/industry co-operation) and
PETRA (training of young people).
EU member states have created nine
European schools, including one at Culham,
Oxfordshire, for pupils aged between four and
19 to provide a multilingual education for the
children of staff employed in EU institutions.
Overseas Students in Britain
British universities and other further and
higher education establishments have built up
a strong reputation overseas by offering
tuition of the highest standards and
maintaining low student-to-staff ratios.
In 1992-93 there were nearly 105,000
overseas students at publicly funded higher
and further education institutions in Britain.
Their numbers have increased by 76 per cent
since 1982-83.
In general, overseas students following
courses of higher or further education in
Britain pay fees covering the full cost of
their courses.
Nationals of other member countries of
the European Union generally pay the lower
level of fees applicable to British students; if
their courses are designated for mandatory
awards, they may be eligible for fees-only
awards from LEAs. Students attending
Scottish institutions apply either to the
Student Awards Agency for Scotland or the
regional or island councils.
Government Scholarship Schemes
The Government makes considerable
provision for foreign students and trainees
under its overseas aid programme and
through other award and scholarship schemes.
In 1993-94 some 21,000 overseas students
were supported, at a cost of £147 million.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office
(FCO) finances the British Chevening
Scholarships, a worldwide programme
offering outstanding graduate students and
young professionals the opportunity to spend
447
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
time studying at British universities and other
academic institutions. In 1994-95 the FCO
spent some £30 million on about 5,000
scholarships for students from 146 countries.
These included jointly funded scholarships
for overseas students co-sponsored by the
FCO, business and industry, grant-giving
foundations, the Churches and universities;
nearly 800 scholarships were provided under
these arrangements in 1994—95.
Outside the aid programme, the Overseas
Research Students Awards Scheme, funded
by the Department for Education and
Employment, provides assistance for overseas
full-time postgraduate students with
outstanding research potential.
Other Schemes
Many public and private scholarships and
fellowships are available to students from
overseas and to British students who want to
study overseas. Among the best known are
the British Council Fellowships, the
Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship
Plan, the Fulbright Scholarship Scheme, the
British Marshall Scholarships, the Rhodes
Scholarships, the Churchill Scholarships and
the Confederation of British Industry
Scholarships. Most British universities and
colleges also offer bursaries and scholarships for
which graduates of any nationality are eligible.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The youth service—a partnership between
local government and voluntary organisations
—is concerned with the informal personal
and social education of young people aged
11 to 25 (Five to 25 in Northern Ireland).
Many of the voluntary organisations were
established at the end of the 19th century and
in the first decade of the 20th. In 1944 the
Education Act provided for the development of
a youth service in England and Wales by LEAs
in partnership with the voluntary organisations.
Local authorities maintain their own youth
centres and clubs and provide most of the
public support for local and regional
voluntary organisations. The service is said to
reach around 5 million young people, the
voluntary organisations contributing a
significant proportion of overall provision.
The Department for Education and
Employment’s Youth Service Unit gives
grants to the national voluntary youth
organisations to meet 50 per cent of the
cost of programmes designed to promote
access to the youth service, support training
for voluntary youth workers and help
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
the organisations.
Funded primarily by central government,
England’s National Youth Agency provides:
• support for those working with young
people;
• information and publishing services; and
• support for curriculum development.
It is also responsible for the accreditation
of training and staff development for
youth workers.
The Welsh Office provides grant aid to
national youth service bodies with
headquarters in Wales and has established a
Wales Youth Agency.
In Scotland the youth service forms part
of the community education provision made
by local authorities. It is also promoted by
the Scottish Community Education Council.
The Scottish Office gives grants to voluntary
youth organisations to assist them with their
headquarters expenditure and staff training
and development.
In Northern Ireland the education and
library boards provide and fund youth clubs
and outdoor activity centres, help pay the
running costs of registered voluntary youth
units, advise and support youth groups and
assist young people visiting the rest of
Britain, Ireland and overseas in connection
with annual camps and award schemes. The
Youth Council for Northern Ireland advises
the education system on the development of
the youth service, promotes provision of
facilities and encourages cross-community
activity among young people.
Voluntary Youth Organisations
National voluntary youth organisations
undertake a significant share of youth
activities through local groups, which raise
most of their day-to-day expenses by their
448
EDUCATION
own efforts. Many receive financial and other
help from LEAs, which also make available
facilities in many areas. The voluntary
organisations vary greatly in character and
include the uniformed organisations, such as
the Scouts and Girl Guides. Some
organisations are church-based. Some also
represent Jews and Muslims. Sport and the
arts are catered for by various bodies. In
Wales, Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh
League of Youth) provides cultural, sporting
and language-based activities for young
Welsh speakers and learners.
Thousands of youth clubs encourage their
members to participate in sport, cultural and
other creative activities. Some youth clubs
provide information, counselling and advice.
Many local authorities and voluntary
youth organisations make provision for the
young unemployed, young people from the
ethnic minorities, young people in inner cities
or rural areas and those in trouble or
especially vulnerable. Other areas of concern
are homelessness and provision for
handicapped young people.
Many authorities have youth committees
on which official and voluntary bodies are
represented. They employ youth officers to
co-ordinate youth work and to arrange in-
service training.
Youth Workers
In England and Wales a two-year training
course at certain universities and higher
education colleges produces qualified
youth and community workers; several
undergraduate part-time and postgraduate
courses are also available. In Scotland one-,
two- and three-year courses are provided at
colleges of education. Students from
Northern Ireland attend courses run in
universities and colleges in Britain and the
Irish Republic.
Other Organisations Concerned with
Young People
Finance is provided by many grant-giving
foundations and trusts for activities involving
young people. The Prince’s Trust and the
Royal Jubilee Trust provide grants and
practical help to individuals and
organisations; areas of concern include urban
deprivation, unemployment, homelessness,
and young offenders. Efforts are also made to
assist ethnic minorities.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme
challenges young people from Britain and
other Commonwealth countries to meet
certain standards in activities such as
community service, expeditions, social and
practical skills and physical recreation.
Voluntary Service by Young People
Thousands of young people voluntarily
undertake community service designed to
help those in need, including elderly and
disabled people. Many schools also
organise community service work as part of
the curriculum.

Everyone in Britain has the right to religious freedom without interference
from the community or the State. Religious organisations and groups ma>
own property, conduct ceremonies such as weddings and funerals, run
schools, and promote their beliefs in speech and writing. There is no religious
bar to the holding of public office.
INTRODUCTION
Most of the world’s religions are represented
in Britain. There are large Hindu, Jewish,
Muslim and Sikh communities, and also
smaller communities of Baha’is, Buddhists,
Jains and Zorastrians, but Britain is
predominantly Christian. Non-religious
alternatives for humanists and atheists are
offered by organisations such as the British
Humanist Association and the National
Secular Society, although most humanists and
atheists do not belong to organised groups.
Religious Freedom
Britain has a long tradition of religious
tolerance. Freedom of conscience in religious
matters was achieved gradually from the 17th
century onwards. The laws discriminating
against minority religious groups were
gradually enforced less harshly and then
finally repealed. Heresy ceased to be a legal
offence with the passage of the Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction Act 1677, and the Toleration Act
1688 granted freedom of worship to
Protestant minority groups.
In 1828 the repeal of the Test and
Corporation Acts gave nonconformists full
political rights, making it possible for them to
be appointed to public office. Roman
Catholics gained political rights under the
Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, and the
Jewish Relief Act 1858 enabled Jews to
become Members of Parliament. The
religious tests imposed on prospective
students and academic staff of the universities
of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham were
successively abolished by Acts of 1854, 1856
and 1871. Similar restrictions on the staff of
Scottish universities were formally removed
in 1932.
The past 30 years have seen an
increasingly diverse pattern of religious belief
and affiliation in Britain. This has been
linked both to patterns of immigration and
to new religious directions among some
of the indigenous population. Social
structures have been gradually changing to
accommodate this. For example,
arrangements are made at many places of
work to allow the members of the various
faiths to follow their religious observances.
450
RELIGION
Relations with the State
There are two established churches in
Britain, that is, churches legally recognised as
official churches of the State: in England the
Church of England, and in Scotland the
(Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. Ministers
of the established churches, as well as clergy
belonging to other religious groups, work in
services run by the State, such as the armed
forces, national hospitals and prisons, and are
paid a salary for such services by the State.
Voluntary schools provided by religious
denominations may be wholly or partly
maintained from public funds. Religious
education in publicly maintained schools is
required by law throughout Britain, as is a
daily act of collective worship (see p. 437).
Religious broadcasting is subject to some
legislative controls (see p. 487).
The State does not contribute to the
general expenses of church maintenance,
although some state aid does help repair
historic churches. In 1994—95, for instance,
English Heritage grants to churches totalled
£12 million as compared to the £120 million
spent on the buildings by parishes. Assistance
is also given to meet some of the costs of
repairing cathedrals and comparable
buildings; some £4 million is being made
available in 1995-96. This funding is not
restricted to Church of England buildings.
The Government shares with the Church
of England the upkeep of nearly 300
churches of special architectural or historic
importance which are no longer required for
regular parish use and for which no
alternative use can be found. The
contribution for the period 1994 to 1997 will
be about £7.2 million. In 1993 the Historic
Chapels Trust was launched, with the aim of
preserving the redundant chapels and places
of worship of other denominations and faiths.
Involvement in Social Issues
Religious involvement in broader social issues
was highlighted in the Church of England
report Faith in the City: A Call for Action by
Church and Nation, published in 1985. This
led to the establishment in 1988 of the
Church of England’s Church Urban Fund,
which aims to raise money for the Church’s
work in inner cities and other priority areas.
By June 1994 it had raised over £20.7 million
and given grants to 1,176 inner city projects.
Organisations belonging to other churches
and religious groups are also closely involved
with a wide range of social issues.
The Inner Cities Religious Council is a
consultative body created by the Department
of the Environment in 1992 to advise it on
issues relating to Britain’s inner cities. The
Council aims to provide religious groups with
a new way of w orking together in the inner
cities and deprived urban areas. It is chaired
by a government minister at the Department
of the Environment and its members are
drawn from the Christian, Hindu, Jewish,
Muslim and Sikh faiths.
Statistics on Religious Affiliation
There is no standard information about the
number of members of religious groups since
questions are not normally asked about
religious beliefs in censuses or for other
official purposes, except in Northern Ireland.
Each group adopts its own way of counting
its members, and the membership figures in
this chapter—often supplied by the religious
groups themselves—are therefore approximate.
There has been a fall in recent years in
the number of full-time ministers and the
number of adults recorded as members of
most of the larger Christian churches. At the
same time there has been significant growth
in a range of independent churches, and in
new religious movements. Surveys have also
revealed that many people who do not belong
to religious groups claim to be religious and
say they believe in God.
ESTABLISHED CHURCHES
Church of England
The Church of England, founded by St
Augustine of Canterbury in AD 597, became
the established church during the
Reformation in the 16th century. Its form of
worship was set out in successive versions of
the Book of Common Prayer from 1549
onwards. The Church of England’s
451
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
relationship with the State is one of mutual
obligation, since the Church’s privileges are
balanced by certain duties it must fulfil.
People who are not members of the Church
of England are entitled to a Church of
England wedding or funeral.
The Monarch is the ‘Supreme Governor’
of the Church of England and must always be
a member of the Church, and promise to
uphold it. Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans of cathedrals are appointed
by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime
Minister, although the Crown Appointments
Commission, which includes lay and clergy
representatives, plays a decisive part in the
selection of archbishops and diocesan bishops.
All clergy swear allegiance to the Crown. The
Church can regulate its own worship. The
two archbishops (of Canterbury and York),
the bishops of London, Durham and
Winchester, and 21 other senior bishops sit in
the House of Lords. Clergy of the Church,
together with those of the Church of
Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the
Roman Catholic Church, may not sit in the
House of Commons.
The Church has two provinces:
Canterbury, comprising 30 dioceses, including
the Diocese in Europe; and York, with 14
dioceses. The dioceses are divided into
archdeaconries and deaneries, which are in
turn divided into about 13,000 parishes,
although in practice many of these are
grouped together. There are, altogether,
about 10,450 full-time stipendiary Church of
England clergy—men and women—working
within the diocesan structure, excluding
mainland Europe. In 1993 an estimated
206,000 people were baptised into the Church
in the two provinces, excluding the Diocese
in Europe; of these, 160,000 were under one
year old, representing 25 per cent of live
births. In the same year there were 51,780
confirmations. Attendances at services on a
normal Sunday are around 1.1 million. In
1992, 96,828 marriages were solemnised in
the Church of England. These accounted for
67 per cent of all marriages with religious
ceremonies, and 33 per cent of all marriages
in England. Many people who rarely, if ever,
attend services still regard themselves as
belonging to the Church of England.
The central governing body is the General
Synod, which comprises separate houses of
bishops, clergy and lay members. Lay people
are also concerned with church government
in the parishes. The Synod is the centre of
an administrative system dealing with such
matters as missionary work, inter-church
relations, social questions, and recruitment
and training for the ministry. It also covers
other church work in Britain and overseas,
the care of church buildings and their
contents, church schools (which are
maintained largely from public funds),
colleges and institutes of higher education,
and voluntary and parish education.
The Church’s investment income from
historic sources is managed mainly by the
Church Commissioners. Most of the
remainder of the Church’s income is
provided by local voluntary donations.
The average annual stipend of a Church of
England priest is about £13,450; the average
value of additional benefits, including free
housing and a non-contributory pension, is
estimated to be about £8,322.
In 1992 the General Synod voted in
favour of legislation allowing the ordination
of women to the priesthood. The measure
was subsequently approved by both Houses
of Parliament and received the Royal Assent.
The first women priests were ordained in
1994 and there are now 800 stipendiary
women clergy. The measure also provided for
those unable to accept the ordination of
women, including the payment of
compensation to clergy who feel they have to
leave the ministry of the Church. So far
nearly 300 clergy have received compensation
payments under the measure. Three bishops
have been appointed to provide additional
pastoral care to those members and parishes
of the Church who remain opposed to the
ordination of women to the priesthood.
Women priests can now be appointed to all
offices in the Church except those of
archbishop or bishop.
Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian
form of government, that is, government by
church courts, composed of ministers and
452
RELIGION
elders, all of whom are ordained to office,
and members of the diaconate. It became the
national church following the Scottish
Reformation and legislation enacted by the
Scottish Parliament. Its status was then
consolidated in the Treaty of Union of 1707
and by the Church of Scotland Act 1921, the
latter confirming its complete freedom in all
spiritual matters. It appoints its own office
bearers, and its affairs are not subject to any
civil authority.
The adult communicant membership of
the Church of Scotland is 715,571; there are
about 1,217 ministers serving in parishes.
Both men and women may join the ministry.
About 1,303 churches are governed locally by
Kirk Sessions, consisting of ministers and
elders. Above the Kirk Session is the
Presbytery. The General Assembly, consisting
of elected ministers and elders, meets annually
under the presidency of an elected moderator,
who serves for one year. The Monarch is
normally represented at the General
Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner.
There are also a number of independent
Scottish Presbyterian churches, largely
descended from groups which broke away
from the Church of Scotland.
WALES
The Church in Wales became part of the
Anglican Church at the Reformation. The
Bible was translated into Welsh by Bishop
Morgan in 1588. During the 18th and 19th
centuries a powerful nonconformist (or Free
Church—see below) movement developed
throughout Wales: a census of religion in
1851 found that over 80 per cent of those at
worship attended a nonconformist chapel.
This strength was reflected in the
disestablishment of the Church in Wales in
1920. The Church in Wales has around
97,000 members. The Church is responsible
for the care of the country’s medieval
churches and cathedrals; at present only men
may join its priesthood.
THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION
The Anglican Communion comprises 36
autonomous Churches in Britain and abroad,
and three regional councils overseas with a
total membership of about 70 million. In the
British Isles there are four Anglican
Churches: the Church of England, the
Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal
Church, and the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years the Lambeth Conference
meets for consultation between all Anglican
bishops. The last Conference was held in
Canterbury in 1988. Presided over by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Conference
has no executive authority, but enjoys
considerable influence. The Anglican
Consultative Council, an assembly of lay
people and clergy as well as of bishops, meets
every two or three years and is intended to
allow consultation within the Anglican
Communion. The Primates Meeting brings
together the senior bishops from each Church
at similar intervals.
FREE CHURCHES
The term ‘Free Churches’ is often used to
describe some of the Protestant churches in
Britain which, unlike the Church of England
and the Church of Scotland, are not
established churches. Free Churches have
existed in various forms since the
Reformation, developing their own traditions
over the years. Their members have also been
known as dissenters or nonconformists. All
the major Free Churches allow both men and
women to become ministers.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the
Free Churches, with over 400,000 adult full
members and a community of more than
1.2 million, originated in the 18th century
following the evangelical revival under John
Wesley (1703-91). The present church is
based on the 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. It has 3,600
ministers and 6,950 places of worship.
The Salvation Army was founded in the
East End of London in 1865 by William
Booth (1829-1912). Within Britain it is
second only to the Government as a provider
of social services. It is the largest provider of
hostel accommodation, offering 3,488 beds
every night. Other services include work with
alcoholics, prison chaplaincy and a family
tracing service which receives 4,935 enquiries
453
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
each year. The Army in Britain is served by
over 1,776 officers (ordained ministers) and
runs more than 993 worship centres.
The Baptists first achieved an organised
form in Britain in the 17th century. Today
they are mainly organised in groups of
churches, most of which belong to the
Baptist Union of Great Britain (re-formed in
1812), with about 157,000 members, 1,864
ministers and 2,130 places of worship. There
are also separate Baptist Unions for Scotland,
Wales and Ireland, and other independent
Baptist Churches.
The United Reformed Church, with some
106,000 members, 1,800 ministers and 1,800
places of worship, was formed in 1972
following the merger of the Congregational
Church in England and Wales (the oldest
Protestant minority in Britain, whose origins
can be traced back to the Puritans of the 16th
century) with the Presbyterian Church of
England, many of whose members are
descended from Scottish Presbyterians. This
was the first union of two different churches
in Britain since the Reformation in the
16th century. In 1981 there was a further
merger with the Reformed Association of the
Churches of Christ.
Among the other Free Churches are the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the
Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist)
Church of Wales and the Union of Welsh
Independents. There are also groupings of
‘Black Majority’ Churches.
ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
The formal structure of the Roman Catholic
Church in England and Wales, which ceased
to exist after the Reformation, was restored in
1850. The Scottish Church’s formal structure
went out of existence in the early 17th
century and was restored in 1878. However,
throughout this period Catholicism never
disappeared entirely. There are now seven
Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain,
each under an archbishop, and 30 dioceses,
each under a bishop (22 in England and
Wales and eight in Scotland, independently
responsible to the Pope). There are almost
3,400 parishes and about 7,000 priests (only
men may become priests). Northern Ireland
has six dioceses, some with territory partly in
the Irish Republic. About one British citizen
in ten claims to be a Roman Catholic. The
Pope is represented diplomatically in Britain
by an Apostolic Pro-Nuncio.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches
great importance to the education of its
children and requires its members to try to
bring up their children in the Catholic faith.
Almost 5 per cent of the teachers in
Britain’s 2,500 Catholic schools are members
of religious orders. These orders also
undertake other social work; about 250
Roman Catholic religious orders,
congregations and societies are represented in
Britain, as are congregations representing
about 25 different nationalities who live in
Britain. Most Catholic schools are maintained
out of public funds.
OTHER CHRISTIAN CHURCHES
Other Protestant Churches include the
Unitarians and Free Christians, whose origins
are traceable to the Reformation, and the
Pentecostalists, whose movement began in the
early 20th century. The two main
Pentecostalist organisations operating in
Britain are the Assemblies of God
(approximately 50,000 members) and the
Elim Pentecostal Church (approximately
42,000 members). Recently both Pentecostal
Churches have applied to join the Free
Church Federal Council (see p. 455).
The Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers), with about 17,500 adult members
in Britain and 450 places of worship, was
founded in the middle of the 17th century
under the leadership of George Fox
(1624—91). Silent worship is central to its life
as a religious organisation. Emphasis is also
placed on social concern and peace-making.
The Christian Brethren are a Protestant
body organised in their present form by J. N.
Darby (1800-82). There are two branches:
the Open Brethren and the Closed or
Exclusive Brethren.
The Christian ‘house church’ movement
(or ‘new churches’) began in the early 1970s.
Services were originally held in private
houses but now groups use a variety of hired
buildings. These non-denominational
454
RELIGION
congregations may come together as ‘streams’,
of which some of the better known are New
Frontiers, Pioneer and Ichthus.
Many Christian communities of foreign
origin, including the Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various
European countries, and the Coptic Orthodox
Church and the Armenian Church, have
established their own centres of worship,
particularly in London. All these churches
operate in a variety of languages. The largest
is probably the Greek Orthodox Church,
many of whose members are of Cypriot
origin. It is represented in many cities
throughout Britain.
There are also several other religious
organisations in Britain which were founded
in the United States in the last century.
These include the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the
Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church), the Seventh-
Day Adventists, the Christian Scientists and
the Spiritualists.
Co-operation among the Churches
The Council of Churches for Britain and
Ireland was established in 1990, replacing the
former British Council of Churches and
taking over its role as the main overall body
for the Christian churches in Britain. The
Council co-ordinates the work of its 31
member churches, which are also grouped in
separate ecumenical bodies for England,
Scotland, Wales and Ireland.
The Free Church Federal Council, with
20 member churches, includes most of the
Free Churches of England and Wales. It
promotes co-operation among the Free
Churches (especially in hospital chaplaincy
and in education matters) and is a channel for
communication with government.
Inter-church discussions about the search
for unity now take place through international
as well as national bodies. The Roman
Catholic, Orthodox and Lutheran Churches
are represented on some of these, as are the
Anglican and some of the Free Churches. In
March 1995 the Church of England and the
Methodist Church had an informal meeting
to consider moves towards unity.
The Anglican Churches, the Church of
Scotland and the main Free Churches are also
members of the World Council of Churches.
This organisation links some 340 churches in
over 100 countries around the world.
OTHER RELIGIONS
The Jewish Community
Jews first settled in England at the time of
the Norman Conquest and remained until
banished by royal decree in 1290. The
present community in Britain dates from
1656, having been founded by those of
Spanish and Portuguese origin, known as
Sephardim. Later more settlers came from
Germany and Eastern Europe; they are
known as Ashkenazim.
The present Jewish community in Britain,
numbering about 300,000, is the second
largest in Western Europe. About 70 per cent
are affiliated to synagogues. It is divided into
two main groups. Of these, some 77 per cent
are Ashkenazi Jews, most of whom
acknowledge the authority of the Chief
Rabbi. The small Sephardi Orthodox element
follow their own spiritual head. The recently
established Masorti movement, the Reform
movement, founded in 1840, and the Liberal
and Progressive movement, established in
1901, account for most of the remaining
23 per cent.
Jewish congregations in Britain number
about 350. About one in three Jewish
children attend Jewish schools, some of
which are supported by public funds. Several
agencies care for elderly and handicapped
people. The officially recognised
representative body is the Board of Deputies
of British Jews, which was established in 1760.
The Muslim Community
Figures for the size of the Muslim
community in Britain have ranged from
three-quarters of a million to 2 million.
Recent estimates, based on extrapolations
from the 1991 census, suggest the population
is around 1.5 million, while estimates from
within the Muslim community suggest
between 1.5 million and 2 million. The
largest number originate from Pakistan and
455
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Bangladesh, while sizeable groups have come
from India, Cyprus, the Arab world,
Malaysia and parts of Africa. A growing
community of British-born Muslims, mainly
the children of immigrant parents, includes
an increasing number of converts to Islam.
There are over 600 mosques and
numerous Muslim prayer centres throughout
Britain. Mosques are not only places of
worship; they also offer instruction in the
Muslim way of life and facilities for
educational and welfare activities.
The first mosque in Britain was
established at Woking, Surrey, in 1890.
Mosques now range from converted houses
in many towns to the Central Mosque in
Regent’s Park, London, and its associated
Islamic Cultural Centre, one of the most
important Muslim institutions in the Western
world. The Central Mosque has the largest
congregation in Britain, and during festivals
it may number over 30,000. There are also
important mosques and cultural centres in
Liverpool, Manchester, Leicester,
Birmingham, Bradford, Cardiff, Edinburgh
and Glasgow.
Many of the mosques are administered by
various local Muslim organisations, and both
the Sunni and the Shia traditions within
Islam are represented among the Muslim
community in Britain. Members of some of
the major Sufi traditions have also developed
branches in British cities. The Ismaili Centre
in London provides wide ranging pastoral
care and a place of worship for Shi’a Imami
Ismaili Muslims, whose current Imam is
Prince Karim Aga Khan.
The Sikh Community
A large British Sikh community, of over
300,000, originates mainly from India. The
largest groups of Sikhs are in Greater
London, Manchester, Birmingham,
Nottingham and Wolverhampton. Sikh
temples, or gurdwaras, cater for the
religious, educational, social welfare and
cultural needs of their community. The
oldest gurdwara in London was established in
1908 and the largest is in Southall, Middlesex
(to the west of London). There are over 140
gurdwaras in Britain.
The Hindu Community
The Hindu community in Britain comprises
around 320,000 members and also originates
largely from India. The largest groups of
Hindus are to be found in Leicester, different
areas of London, Birmingham and Bradford.
The first Hindu temple, or mandir, was
opened in London in 1962 and there are now
over 150 mandirs in Britain.
Buddhism
The Buddhist community in Britain consists
largely of adherents of British or Western
origin. There are well over 400 Buddhist
groups and centres, including some 15
monasteries and temples. All the main
schools of Buddhism are represented. The
Buddhist Society, founded in 1924, promotes
the principles of Buddhism; it does not
belong to any particular school of Buddhism.
Other Religious Communities
Other religious communities include about
30,000 Jains, whose religion is of ancient
Indian origin. A deresar, or Jain temple,
opened in Leicester in 1988. The
Zoroastrian religion, or Mazdaism,
originated in ancient Iran. It is mainly
represented in Britain by the Parsi
community, who are by origin from the
South Asian sub-continent. The Baha’i
movement, originating in 19th-century Iran,
regards all the major religions as divine in
origin; there are an estimated 6,000
Baha’is in Britain.
New Religious Movements
A large number of new religious
movements or cults, mainly established
since the Second World War and often with
overseas origins, are active in Britain.
Examples include the Church of
Scientology, the Transcendental Meditation
movement and the Unification Church
(popularly known as the ‘Moonies’). In
response to public concern about the
activities of some of these cults the
Government provided start-up funding from
456
RELIGION
1987 to 1993 for the Information Network
Focus on Religious Movements (INFORM),
which is a group supported by the main
churches. It seeks to provide objective
information about new religious movements.
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN FAITHS
A number of organisations exist which seek to
develop relations between different religions
in Britain. They include the Inter-Faith
Network for the United Kingdom, which
links a wide range of organisations with an
interest in inter-faith relations, including
representative bodies from the Baha’i,
Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain, Jewish,
Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian faith
communities. Other organisations include the
Council of Christians and Jews, which works
for better understanding among members of
the two religions and deals with issues in the
educational and social fields.
Within each faith tradition there are
organisations and individuals working to
further good relations with other faiths. For
example, the Council of Churches for Britain
and Ireland (see p. 455) have a Commission
on Inter Faith Relations.

Britain’s artistic and cultural life covers a wide range of activities at both
professional and amateur level. In 1994 nearly 17 million people attended
events in one or more of the major art forms, while Britain s museums and
galleries were visited by about 80 million people. In the past ten years cinema
admissions have doubled and there has been a steady increase in the
popularity of opera.
INTRODUCTION
Britain’s artistic and cultural heritage is one
of the richest in the world. The origins of
English literature, one of the world’s most
influential bodies of writing, can be traced
back to medieval times, while over the
centuries Britain has amassed some of the
finest collections of works of art. The
performing arts also have a long and
distinguished history.
London is one of the leading world centres
for the arts. Other large cities, including
Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Edinburgh,
Glasgow and Cardiff, have also sustained and
developed their reputations as centres of
artistic excellence in recent years. Arts festivals
attract wide interest. Many British playwrights,
craftspeople, composers, film-makers,
painters, writers, actors, singers, musicians
and dancers enjoy international reputations.
They include, for example, Harold Pinter, Sir
Colin Davis, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber,
David Hockney, Sir V.S. Naipaul, Vanessa
Redgrave and Sir Ian McKellen. Television
and radio bring a wide range of arts events
to a large audience. At an amateur level,
numerous groups and societies for the arts
make use of local talent and resources.
Department of National Heritage
The Secretary of State for National Heritage,
who is a member of the Cabinet, is
responsible for government policy in support
of the arts for England. The Department of
National Heritage (see p. 530) determines
government policy and administers
expenditure on national museums and art
galleries in England, the Arts Council of
England (see p. 460), the British Library and
other national arts and heritage bodies. Other
responsibilities include the regulation of the
film industry, broadcasting, press regulation,
the National Lottery and the export licensing
of antiques.
The Secretaries of State for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland are
responsible for the arts in their countries,
including the national museums, galleries and
libraries and their respective Arts Councils.
The Government’s arts policies aim to:
458
THE ARTS
• develop a high standard of artistic and
cultural activity throughout Britain;
• encourage innovation; and
• promote public access to, and
appreciation of, the arts, crafts and the
cultural heritage.
The Department of National Heritage and
the home departments provide funds and
advice, and encourage partnership with the
private sector, including business
sponsorship. National museums and galleries
are given an incentive to increase their
resources—for example, through trading and
other activities. An important concept in
funding policy is the ‘arm’s length’ principle,
by which government funds are distributed to
arts organisations indirectly, through bodies
such as the Arts Councils, the British Film
Institute and the Scottish Film Council. This
principle helps to avoid political influence
over funding decisions by ensuring that funds
are allocated by those best qualified to do so.
Local Authorities
Local authorities maintain around 1,000 local
museums and art galleries and a network of
over 4,000 public libraries. They also support
many other arts buildings, arts organisations
and artistic events in their areas, providing
grant aid for professional and voluntary
bodies, including orchestras, theatres, and
opera and dance companies. They undertake
direct promotions of the arts and contribute
to the cost of new or converted buildings for
the arts. In England revenue support from
local authorities is estimated to be about
£190 million a year; arts education in schools,
colleges, evening institutes and community
centres is the responsibility of central
government education departments, in
partnership with local education authorities
and voluntary bodies. In Scotland revenue
support is around £35 million a year.
Finance
Planned central government expenditure
through the Department of National
Heritage, excluding sport, amounts to
£945 million in 1995-96, of which about
£191 million is channelled through the Arts
Council of England mainly to support the
performing and visual arts; over £80 million
goes to the British Library. Grants are also
made to the British Film Institute, the Crafts
Council, certain other museums and arts
bodies, and to the National Heritage
Memorial Fund. The Fund helps organisations
wishing to acquire, for the public benefit,
land, buildings, works of art and other
objects associated with the national heritage.
Planned 1995-96 expenditure by the Arts
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland is £24.4 million, £14.2 million and
£6.6 million respectively. The Scottish Office
is providing £45 million for Scotland’s
National Galleries and Museums and National
Library, while the Welsh Office is providing
£27 million for Wales’s National Museum
and National Library. Planned spending by
the Department of Education for Northern
Ireland on the three major museums there
amounts to nearly £9 million in 1995-96.
Business Sponsorship
Industrial and commercial companies offer
vital sponsorship to a wide range of arts.
Managed by the Association for
Business Sponsorship of the Arts
(ABSA), the Pairing Scheme aims to
encourage businesses in Great Britain
to sponsor the arts. Under the
scheme, government funding of
between £1,000 and £35,000 is awarded
to arts organisations to match the
sponsorship from private businesses.
Launched in 1985, the sponsorship
scheme has brought over £87 million
into the arts (including a government
contribution of £29 million). In
1995-96 the Government is making
available £5.5 million to match new
sponsorships. A similar scheme exists
in Northern Ireland.
Some business sponsorships during 1995
include:
• productions at the English National
Opera and Opera Factory in London
(British Airways, KPMG and SPERO
Communications);
459
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• London City Ballet’s Giselle (ADT); and
• the National Gallery’s Spanish Still Life
exhibition (Glaxo).
Among the many business sponsorships
that took place around Britain in 1995 were
the Cardiff Singer of the World (BP) and
Citroen’s outdoor concerts at Macclesfield,
Warwick Castle, Burghley House
(Lincolnshire) and Audley End (Essex).
Under the ABSA’s Business in the Arts
scheme, the private sector gives part-time
management expertise to arts organisations.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was
set up in 1991 by the Pool Promoters
Association to channel funds into sport and
the arts. About one-third of the £67 million
annual revenue is used to benefit the arts and
is distributed in the form of awards to a
variety of organisations.
National Lottery
The National Lottery (see p. 512) is already
beginning to generate substantial funds for
the arts and Britain’s national heritage. Since
the Lottery began in November 1994, grants
of over £100 million have been distributed by
the Arts Councils and the National Heritage
Memorial Fund (see p. 417) to a wide range
of arts projects, including:
• £6,640,000 to renovate Cambridge Arts
Theatre;
• £40,000 to the Inner Sense Percussion
Orchestra (a band specialising in samba,
jazz and reggae);
• £609,000 to Isle of Arran Theatre of Arts
to convert a church into an arts centre;
and
• £135,000 to the Yorkshire Air Museum
in Elvington.
Substantial funding is also to be channelled
into the British film industry (see p. 469).
Arts Councils
The main channels for government aid to
the arts are the independent Arts Councils
of England, Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
The aims of the Arts Councils are to:
• develop and improve the knowledge,
understanding and practice of the arts;
• make the arts more accessible to the
public; and
• advise and co-operate with central
government departments, local authorities
and other organisations.
The Arts Councils give financial help and
advice to organisations ranging from the
major arts centres and opera, dance and
drama companies to small touring theatre
companies and experimental performance
groups. They also provide funds for the
training of arts administrators and help arts
organisations to develop other sources of
income, including sponsorship and local
authority support. They encourage a variety
of art forms, including ballet and
contemporary dance, drama, mime, literature,
music, opera and photography, and help
professional creative writers, dramatists,
choreographers, dancers, actors, musicians,
composers, artists and photographers. The
Councils also promote art exhibitions and
tours of arts events and performances, make
funds available for some specialist training
courses in the arts and promote the work of
artists in education. Emphasis is being placed
on obtaining funds through partnership
arrangements with local authorities and other
agencies, and from commercial sources.
Arts Funding
In England the Arts Council and ten
Regional Arts Boards comprise the
integrated arts funding system. Together,
they aim to ensure that a wide range of
high-quality arts is accessible to people across
the country. The Regional Arts Boards offer
financial assistance to artists and arts
organisations and advise on, and sometimes
help to promote, arts activities. They are
financed mainly by the Arts Council of
England, with smaller sums from the
British Film Institute and Crafts Council, as
well as from local authorities. The Boards
also concentrate on business development
460
THE ARTS
and sponsorship and many have established
‘Business in the Arts’ schemes in their areas.
Through a system of forward planning and
budgeting, the Boards are accountable to
their national funders. One-third of the
members of each Board are nominated by
local authorities. Boards also include
representatives of the regional business
community as well as others with expertise
and interest in the arts.
The Boards are responsible for most of the
funding of organisations within their region.
The Arts Council of England continues to be
responsible for the funding of the national
companies—Royal Opera, Royal Ballet and
the Birmingham Royal Ballet, the English
National Opera, the Royal Shakespeare
Company, the Royal National Theatre and
the South Bank Centre. It is also responsible
for touring companies without a regional base
and for other arts organisations which have a
national strategic role.
Cultural Diversity and Disability
The arts activities undertaken by Britain’s
diverse communities embrace both traditional
and new forms of artistic expression. The
Arts Council of England is establishing
specialist programmes to make the arts more
accessible to specific communities, to develop
the knowledge, understanding and practice of
diversity in the arts, and to increase
involvement in a wide range of arts.
Black and Asian Arts
The Arts Council of England and the
Regional Arts Boards jointly support the
National Black Arts Network, a group of
individuals and agencies which is helping to
develop an infrastructure for black and Asian
arts across England. The Arts Council also
supports other umbrella organisations,
including Asian Arts Access and ADiTi, and
has helped in the setting up of the Institute
of International Visual Arts. This body
supports, for example, Afro-Caribbean and
Asian music circuits, an education officer in
South Asian music, a funding programme for
black video and film-makers and the
development of black theatre companies.
Arts and Disability
The Arts Council of England has access to
experts in disability arts, and all its art-form
advisory panels include disabled representatives.
The Council has a bulletin on quality of service
for disabled people which provides practical
information and advice for Council and
Regional Arts Boards staff. Funding agreements
with arts organisations state that they must
have an equal opportunities policy; they are also
encouraged to adopt the code of practice on
employment issued by the Equal Opportunities
Commission (see p. 37).
The National Disability Arts Forum and
other national agencies are funded by the
Arts Council of England, as are creative
organisations, such as Candoco and Graeae.
The Council also supports an apprenticeship
scheme for disabled people in major arts
organisations, such as the Royal Shakespeare
Company, which is part of an initiative aimed
at increasing employment opportunities in the
arts for disabled people.
Other schemes supported by the Arts
Council of England include an audit of deaf
arts conducted by Deafworks and projects
involving disabled artists in schools. The
Scottish Arts Council supports Art Link and
Project Ability, which provide opportunities
for people with disabilities to develop
creativity in a range of art forms.
The provision of access for the disabled to
arts buildings is a basic criterion for all grants
made from the National Lottery (see p. 460).
Arts Centres
Over 200 arts centres in Britain give people
the chance of enjoying and taking part in a
range of activities, with educational projects
becoming increasingly important. Nearly all
arts centres are professionally managed and
most are supported by volunteer groups.
They are assisted mainly by Regional Arts
Boards and local authorities, while the Arts
Council of England funds two national
centres—the South Bank Centre and the
Institute of Contemporary Arts. Many
theatres and art galleries also provide a focal
point for the community by making available
facilities for other arts.
461
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The British Council
The British Council (see p. 134) is Britain’s
international network for culture,
development and education, and maintains
libraries (including film libraries) in many of
the 109 countries in which it is represented.
The Visiting Arts Office, an autonomous
body administered by the British Council,
fosters an appreciation and understanding of
the arts of other countries. It acts as a broker
between Britain and overseas arts
organisations, advises on touring matters and
makes awards for projects.
Broadcasting
BBC radio and television and the independent
companies (see Chapter 29) broadcast a wide
variety of drama, opera, ballet and music, as
well as general arts magazine programmes and
documentaries. These have won many
international awards at festivals such as the Prix
Italia and Montreux International Television
Festivals. Independent television companies also
make grants for arts promotion in their regions.
Broadcasting is a major medium for
making the arts available to the public and is
a crucial source of work for actors, musicians,
writers, composers, technicians and others in
the arts world. It has created its own forms—
nothing like arts documentaries or drama
series, for instance, exists in any other
medium. Broadcasters commission and
produce a vast quantity of new work.
Television and radio provide critical debate,
information and education about the arts.
The BBC has six orchestras, which employ
many of Britain’s full-time professional
musicians. Each week it broadcasts about 100
hours of classical and other music (both live
and recorded) on its Radio 3 (FM) channel.
BBC Radio 1 (FM) broadcasts rock and pop
music 24 hours a day, and a large part of the
output of BBC Radio 2 (FM) is popular and
light music. There are at present two
national commercial radio stations which
broadcast music:
• Classic FM, which broadcasts mainly
classical music; and
• Virgin 1215, which plays broad-based
rock music.
Much of the output of Britain’s local radio
stations consists of popular and light music.
The BBC regularly commissions new
music, particularly by British composers, and
sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals.
Each summer it presents and broadcasts the
BBC Promenade Concerts (the ‘Proms’),
the world’s largest music festival, at the
Royal Albert Hall.
The Press
Many national and local newspapers devote
considerable space to coverage of the arts,
and developments in the arts are also covered
in periodicals such as the Spectator and New
Statesman and Society (see Chapter 29).
Weekly ‘listings’ magazines, including Time
Out, provide details of cultural and other
events in London and other large cities.
There are also a large number of specialist
publications which cover specific aspects of
the arts, including Classical Music, Art
Monthly, Dance Theatre Journal and Opera. A
number of publications publish original
literature, including the London Magazine and
Granta, which publishes fiction as well as
cultural journalism. New Musical Express
(NME) and Melody Maker cover rock and
pop music. The newspaper Stage and
Television Today is directed at professional
actors and others in the industry.
Festivals
Some 650 professional arts festivals take place
in Britain each year. The annual Edinburgh
International Festival, featuring a wide range
of arts, is held in August and September and
is the largest of its kind in the world. Other
festivals held in Edinburgh include the annual
International Jazz Festival, the International
Film and Television Festivals and the biennial
Book Festival. The international arts Mayfest
takes place in Glasgow. Some well-known
festivals concentrating on music are the Three
Choirs Festival, which has taken place
annually for more than 260 years in
Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford; the
Cheltenham International Festival of Music,
largely devoted to contemporary British
music; and the Aldeburgh festival.
462
THE ARTS
Among other festivals catering for a
number of art forms are the Royal National
Eisteddfod of Wales, the Royal National
Gaelic Mod in Scotland, the Belfast Festival
at Queen’s University, and the festivals in
Brighton, Buxton, Chester, St Davids,
Harrogate, Llangollen, Malvern, Perth, and
York. Many smaller towns also hold arts
festivals. A major event in London is the
Netting Hill Carnival, which is largely
organised by the Afro-Caribbean community.
Arts 2000
Arts 2000 is an Arts Council initiative which
celebrates the approach of the millennium.
During each year between 1992 and 2000, a
city, town or region in Britain has been
nominated to celebrate a particular art form.
Manchester was the City of Drama in 1994,
while Swansea was the City of Literature in
1995. The Northern Region is the Region of
Visual Arts for 1996. Future years have been
designated as follows:
• the Eastern Region as the Region of
Opera and Musical Theatre for 1997;
• Yorkshire and Humberside as the Region
of Photography and the Electronic Image
for 1998; and
• Glasgow as the City of Architecture and
Design for 1999.
Arts 2000 is a competitive process judged
by expert Arts Council selection committees.
Winners are offered £350,000 from Arts
Council funds, and are expected to match
this to create a wide-ranging and imaginative
programme with a strong European context.
DRAMA
Britain is one of the world’s major centres for
theatre, and has a long and rich dramatic
tradition. There are many companies based in
London and in many other cities and towns;
in addition, numerous touring companies visit
theatres, festivals and other venues, including
arts and sports centres and social clubs.
There were more than 250 companies in
receipt of Arts Council or Regional Arts
Boards subsidies in 1994-95.
Contemporary British playwrights who
have received international recognition, with
examples of their works, include:
• Harold Pinter—The Caretaker, The
Homecoming',
• Alan Bennett—The Madness of George ///;
• Tom Stoppard—Arcadia, Indian Ink',
• Caryl Churchill—Top Girls, The Skriker,
and
• David Hare—The Absence of War,
Skylight.
The musicals of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber
have been highly successful both in Britain
and overseas; his more recent works are The
Phantom of the Opera and Sunset Boulevard.
Among the best-known directors are Sir
Peter Hall, Richard Eyre, Nicholas Hytner,
Trevor Nunn, Adrian Noble, Jonathan
Miller, Deborah Warner and Terry Hands,
while the many British performers who enjoy
international reputations include Kenneth
Branagh, Dame Judi Dench, Albert Finney,
Sir John Gielgud, Sir Alec Guinness, Sir
Derek Jacobi, Sir Ian McKellen, Helen
Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave, Dame Diana
Rigg, Dame Maggie Smith and Juliet
Stephenson. British stage designers such as
John Bury, Ralph Koltai and Carl Toms are
internationally acclaimed.
Britain has about 300 theatres intended for
professional use which can seat between 200
and 2,300 people. Some are privately owned,
but most are owned either municipally or by
non-profit-making organisations. Over 40 of
these have resident theatre companies
receiving subsidies from the Arts Councils
and Regional Arts Boards. In summer there
are also open air theatres, including one in
London’s Regent’s Park and the Minack
Theatre, which is on a clifftop near Land’s
End in Cornwall.
Most theatres are commercially run and
self-financing, relying on popular shows and
musicals to be profitable. By contrast,
companies funded by the Arts Councils tend
to offer a variety of traditional and
experimental productions. Experimental or
innovative work is often staged in ‘fringe’
theatres in London and other cities; these are
smaller theatres which use a variety of
buildings, such as rooms in pubs.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
London
London has about 100 theatres, 15 of them
permanently occupied by subsidised
companies. These include:
• the Royal National Theatre, which stages
a wide range of modern and classical
plays in its three auditoriums on the
South Bank;
• the Royal Shakespeare Company, which
presents plays mainly by Shakespeare and
his contemporaries as well as some
modern work, in Stratford-upon-Avon
and in its two auditoriums in the City’s
Barbican Centre—from 1996 the
Company is also to tour other parts of
Britain for six months of the year; and
• the English Stage Company at the
Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square,
which stages the work of many new
playwrights.
The largest concentration of London’s
commercial theatres is around Shaftesbury
Avenue. West End theatre attendance was
over 11 million in 1994; over half of these
went to musicals.
In 1989 the partial remains of the Globe
Theatre, where Shakespeare acted, and
the Rose Theatre, where his plays were
performed during his lifetime, were excavated
on the south bank of the 4 hames; both have
since been listed as ancient monuments. A

modern reconstruction of the Globe Theatre,
near its original site, is in progress and is due
for completion in 1996.
Regional Theatres
Outside London most cities and many large
towns have at least one theatre. Older
theatres which have been restored include the
Theatre Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne, which
dates from the 18th century; the Alhambra,
Bradford; the Lyceum, Sheffield; the Theatre
Royal, Bristol; and the Grand Opera House,
Belfast, all dating from the 19th century.
Others, such as the West Yorkshire
Playhouse, Leeds, and the Theatre Royal,
Plymouth, have been built to modern
designs. Edinburgh’s rebuilt and restored
Empire Theatre, reopened as the Edinburgh
Festival Theatre in 1994, provides an
international venue for large-scale
productions. A custom-built theatre for new
writing recently became the new home of the
Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh. Several
universities have theatres which house
professional companies playing to the public.
Most regional repertory companies mount
about eight to ten productions a year; several
have studio theatres in addition to the main
auditorium, where they present new or
experimental drama and plays of specialist
interest. Repertory theatres also often
function as social centres by offering
concerts, poetry readings and exhibitions, and
by providing restaurants, bars and shops.
Regional theatre companies with major
reputations include the Citizens’ Theatre,
Glasgow; the Royal Exchange, Manchester;
Bristol Old Vic; West Yorkshire Playhouse;
the Festival Theatre, Chichester; and
Nottingham Playhouse, one of the first
modern regional theatres. Successful
productions from regional theatre companies
often transfer to London’s West End. In
addition, the largest regional theatres receive
visits from the Royal National Theatre or the
Royal Shakespeare Company, which has
three theatres at its base in Stratford-upon-
Avon. The Cambridge Theatre Company,
Oxford Stage Company and English Touring
Theatre Company tour the English regions
and worldwide.
464
THE ARTS
Theatre for Young People
Unicorn Theatre for Children and Polka
Children’s Theatre, both in London, present
plays specially written for children; and the
Whirligig Theatre tours throughout Britain.
The Young Vic Company in London and
Contact Theatre Company in Manchester
stage plays for young people. Numerous
Theatre-in-Education companies perform in
schools. Some of these companies operate
independently—Theatre Centre, for example,
plays in London and tours further afield.
Others are attached to regional repertory
theatres such as the Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich,
and Greenwich Theatre. Most regional
repertory theatres also mount productions for
younger audiences, and concessionary ticket
prices are generally available for those at
school, college or university. The first
Festival of Theatre for Children and Young
People took place in London in 1995.
There has been a marked growth in youth
theatres, which number more than 500 in
England alone; both the National Youth
Theatre in London and the Scottish Youth
Theatre in Glasgow offer early acting
opportunities to young people.
Dramatic Training
Training for actors, directors, lighting and
sound technicians and stage managers is
provided mainly in drama schools, among
them the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art
(RADA), the Central School of Speech and
Drama, the London Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art, and the Drama Centre (all in
London), the Bristol Old Vic School, the
Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama
(Glasgow) and the Welsh College of Music
and Drama (Cardiff). Theatre design courses,
often based in art schools, are available for
people wanting to train as stage designers. A
number of universities and colleges offer
degree courses in drama.
Amateur Theatre
There are several thousand amateur dramatic
societies throughout Britain. They use a
variety of buildings, including schools and
public halls. Their work is encouraged by a
number of organisations, such as the Central
Council for Amateur Theatre, the National
Drama Conference, the Scottish Community
Drama Association and the Association of
Ulster Drama Festivals. A nationwide
representative body, the Voluntary Arts
Network, was established in 1991. Amateur
companies sometimes receive financial support
from local government and other bodies.
MUSIC
People in Britain are interested in a wide
range of music, from classical to different
forms of rock and pop music. Jazz, folk and
world music, and brass bands also have
substantial followings.
The fourth National Music Day took place
in June 1995. Over 1,500 separate events
were organised, ranging from musical fetes
and marathons to activities involving local
churches, schools and charities.
Orchestral and Choral Music
Seasons of orchestral and choral concerts are
promoted every year in many large towns and
cities. The principal concert halls in central
London are the Royal Festival Hall in the
South Bank Centre, next to which are the
Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room,
which accommodate smaller scale
performances; the Barbican Hall (part of the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences in
the City of London); the Royal Albert Hall in
Kensington; the Wigmore Hall, a recital
centre; and St John’s, Smith Square.
Birmingham has its own recently built
concert hall, the Symphony Hall, and a
2,400-seat international concert hall is being
erected for Manchester’s Halle Orchestra.
The leading symphony orchestras in
London include the London Symphony, the
Philharmonia, the London Philharmonic, the
Royal Philharmonic and the BBC Symphony.
Important regional orchestras include the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle, the City of
Birmingham Symphony, the Bournemouth
Symphony, the Ulster, and the Royal
Scottish National Orchestras and the BBC
National Orchestra of Wales. The BBC’s six
465
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
orchestras give broadcast concerts which are
often open to the public. There are also
chamber orchestras, such as the City of
London Sinfonia, the Academy of St Martin-
in-the-Fields, Northern Sinfonia, the
Bournemouth Sinfonietta and the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra. Specialised ensembles
include the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment, the English Baroque Soloists
and the English Concert. The London
Sinfonietta and the Birmingham
Contemporary Music Group specialise in
contemporary music.
British conductors such as Sir Colin
Davis, Vernon Handley, Sir Charles
Mackerras, John Eliot Gardiner, Andrew
Davis, Sir Simon Rattle, Christopher
Hogwood, Jane Glover, and Richard Hickox
reach a wide audience through their
recordings as well as by their performances.
The works of living composers such as Sir
Michael Tippett, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies
and Sir Harrison Birtwistle enjoy
international acclaim. Other well-established
British composers include Michael Berkeley,
John Tavener, Sir Malcolm Arnold, Oliver
Knussen, Nicola le Fanu, George Lloyd,
David Matthews, Mark Anthony Turnage,
John Casken and Judith Weir. The Master of
the Queen’s Music, Malcolm Williamson,
holds an office within the Royal Household
with responsibility for organising and writing
music for state occasions. Percussionist
Evelyn Glennie and clarinettist Emma
Johnson are among solo performers currently
enjoying great acclaim.
The principal choral societies include the
Bach Choir, the Royal Choral Society, the
Huddersfield Choral Society, the Cardiff
Polyphonic Choir, the Edinburgh
International Festival Chorus and the
Belfast Philharmonic Society. Almost all the
leading orchestras maintain their own
choral societies. The English tradition of
church singing is represented by choirs such
as those of King’s College Chapel,
Cambridge, and Christ Church Cathedral,
Oxford, while other choirs such as the
Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral
choir are also well known. There are many
male-voice choirs in Wales and in certain
parts of England.
Pop and Rock Music
Hundreds of hours of pop and rock music are
broadcast through BBC and independent
radio stations every week. Television
programmes of both live and recorded music
also feature pop and rock, which is by far the
most popular form of music in Britain. This
covers a diversity of styles, ranging from
dance to heavy metal.
In the 1960s and 1970s groups such as the
Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin
and Pink Floyd achieved international
success. British groups continue to be
popular throughout the world and are often
at the forefront of new developments in music.
The British record industry recognises the
most talented British performers at the
annual Brit Awards. These were dominated
in 1995 by Blur, who won a record four
categories, including best British group and
best album {Parklife). Other winners were
Paul Weller (best British male solo artist),
Eddi Reader (best British female artist), M
People (best dance act) and Oasis (best
British newcomer). Other nominated artists
included Eternal, Prodigy, Portishead,
Des’ree and Lisa Stansfield. Great success
has also been achieved in recent years by
Take That, Wet Wet Wet and East 17, whose
lead singer—Tony Mortimer—won the Ivor
Novello Songwriter of the Year Award in 1995.
The pop and rock music industry
contributes significantly to Britain’s overseas
earnings through the sale of recordings,
concert tours, and promotional material,
including clothing and books. The recording
industry in Britain has an estimated annual
turnover of £1,000 million.
Jazz
Jazz has a large following in Britain and is
played in numerous clubs and pubs. There is
also a jazz radio station, Jazz FM, which
began broadcasting in 1991. The London Jaz:
Festival attracts international stars, such as
the bandleader Django Bates, saxophonists
Pharoah Saunders and Joshua Redman, and
the singer Jean Carn. British musicians such
as Barbara Thompson, Stan Tracey, Julian
Joseph, David Jean Baptiste, Tommy Smith
466
THE ARTS
and Courtney Pine have established
international reputations. Festivals of jazz
music are held throughout Britain, including
Cardiff Bay, Brecon, Edinburgh, Glasgow
and Birmingham.
Training
Professional training in music is given
mainly at colleges of music. The leading
London colleges are the Royal Academy of
Music, the Royal College of Music, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and
Trinity College of Music. The City
University’s music industry course provides
training in business practice aimed
specifically at musicians and music
administrators. Outside London the main
centres are the Royal Scottish Academy of
Music and Drama in Glasgow, the Royal
Northern College of Music in Manchester,
the Welsh College of Music and Drama,
Cardiff, and the Birmingham Conservatoire.
Many universities also offer courses in music.
Other Educational Schemes
Many children learn to play musical
instruments at school, and some take the
examinations of the Associated Board of the
Royal Schools of Music. Music is one of the
foundation subjects in the National
Curriculum (see p. 435). In Scottish schools
music and the expressive arts are also well
developed. The National Youth Orchestras of
Great Britain, Scotland, Ulster and Wales,
and other youth orchestras have established
high standards. Nearly a third of the players
in the European Community Youth
Orchestra come from Britain. There is also a
National Youth Jazz Orchestra.
Youth and Music, an organisation affiliated
to the international Jeunesses Musicales,
encourages attendance by young people at
opera, dance and concert performances.
OPERA
Interest in opera has been growing markedly
in Britain, with an estimated 3 million of the
adult population attending opera performances
in 1994: some 25 per cent more than in 1986.
A number of British singers—Thomas Allen,
Anne Evans, Philip Langridge, Felicity Lott,
Ann Murray and Bryn Terfel, for example—
have now established themselves in the
international opera houses.
An opera season for which
international casts are specially
assembled is held every summer at
Glyndebourne in East Sussex. This is
followed by an autumn tour by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera, using
casts drawn from the chorus of the
festival season. Since 1994 the
summer season at Glyndebourne
has taken place in a new enlarged
1,200-seat opera house, built at a cost
of £33 million. All the funding came
from private sources.
Regular seasons of opera are held at the
Royal Opera House, Covent Garden,
London. The English National Opera stages
opera in English at the London Coliseum.
Scottish Opera has regular seasons at the
Theatre Royal in Glasgow, and tours mainly
in Scotland and northern England. Welsh
National Opera presents seasons in Cardiff
and other cities; Music Theatre Wales has
become well known for its contemporary
work. Leeds-based Opera North tours
primarily in the north of England and has
gained an international reputation. Opera
Factory in London presents experimental
work in opera and music theatre. English
Touring Opera takes opera to towns
throughout England. Opera Northern Ireland
presents seasons at the Grand Opera House,
Belfast, and tours the province.
The National Opera Studio provides
advanced training for young singers.
DANCE
An estimated 6 million people take part in
dance, making it one of Britain’s leading
participatory activities, and audiences are
attracted to a widening range of
professional dance.
The Royal Ballet and the Birmingham
Royal Ballet, English National Ballet,
Northern Ballet Theatre and Rambert
467
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Dance Company rank among the world’s
leading companies and are supported by
professional orchestras.
Subsidised Dance Companies
Subsidised dance companies include the
Birmingham (formerly Sadler’s Wells) Royal
Ballet, which tours widely in Britain and
overseas; English National Ballet, which
divides its performances between London and
the regions; Northern Ballet Theatre, which
is based in Halifax and also tours; and
Scottish Ballet, based in Glasgow. Other
subsidised companies are the Cardiff-based
Diversions Dance Company and the Dundee
Repertory Dance Company.
The Arts Councils also subsidise a wide
range of other companies and dance
organisations, including Rambert Dance
Company (one of Britain’s leading
contemporary dance companies), Adzido Pan
African Dance Ensemble, Shobana Jeyasingh
Dance Company and Richard Alston Dance
Company. Also subsidised is Dance
Umbrella, which promotes an annual festival
of contemporary dance in London. The Arts
Councils and the Regional Arts Boards support
many smaller companies, such as the Phoenix
Dance Company, Adventures in Motion
Pictures and the Candoco Dance Company.
Matthew Bourne, Christopher Bruce,
Richard Alston, Lloyd Newson, Ashley Page,
Shobana Jeyasingh, Siobhan Davies, Neville
Campbell and Jonathan Burrows are among
the foremost British choreographers. Leading
dancers include Darcey Bussell, Marion Tail,
Gill Clarke, Adam Cooper and Deborah Bull.
Training
Professional training for dancers and
choreographers is provided mainly by
specialist schools, which include the Royal
Ballet School, the Central School of Ballet,
the Northern School of Contemporary Dance
(Leeds) and the London Contemporary
Dance School; these, with many private
schools, have helped in raising British dance
to its present standard. Dance is a subject for
degree studies at a number of institutions,
including the Laban Centre (University of
London), the University of Surrey,
Darlington College of Arts in Devon and
Middlesex University.
Courses for students intending to work
with community groups are available at
several institutions. The Royal Ballet is
running a scheme that aims to widen access
to ballet training for children from a broader
range of cultural backgrounds.
National Dance Agencies
A network of agencies for professional and
amateur dancers has been established in
Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, London,
Newcastle upon Tyne, Swindon and Suffolk.
The agencies, which receive Arts Council
support, offer classes, provide information
and advice, help to co-ordinate activities, and
commission dance artists to create work. All
ten Regional Arts Board areas have a national
dance agency or are preparing to set one up.
Other Educational Schemes
The Arts Council of England runs Taped, a
scheme to finance dance videos for use in
education, while the Video Place provides a
library of videotape documentation of dance
performances for viewing by promoters,
choreographers, dancers, teachers and
students. The Scottish Arts Council
supports Dance Base, which offers a range
of classes in dance.
All government-funded dance companies
provide dance workshops and education
activities. Many have won awards for major
projects, such as Phoenix Dance Company’s
‘Urban Exchange’ and English National
Ballet’s ‘Striking a Balance’. Ludus Dance
Company, based in Lancaster, works mainly
with young people; and Scottish Ballet has a
programme of work in schools in Scotland.
The Performing Arts and Technology School
in Croydon, Surrey, offers studies in drama,
music and dance to pupils aged from 14 to
18, with the emphasis on the application of
technology to the performing arts.
The National Youth Dance Company
provides opportunities for young dancers
to work with professionals and to create
and perform dance. Similar opportunities
468
THE ARTS
exist for young people to join youth dance
companies throughout the country.
FILMS
British films, actors, and producers as well as
the creative and technical services supporting
them are widely acclaimed. British
performers who enjoy international
reputations include Kenneth Branagh,
Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Ralph
Fiennes, Hugh Grant, Sir Anthony Hopkins,
Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, Miranda
Richardson, Alan Rickman, Greta Scacchi
and Emma Thompson. Successful British
directors include Alan Parker, Mike Newell,
Mike Leigh, Sally Potter and Ken Loach.
The award-winning Four Weddings and a
Funeral, which was released in 1994, has
become the most successful British film ever.
Funded by Channel 4, it has grossed more
than £160 million worldwide.
There are about 1,800 cinema screens in
Britain, and estimated attendances are
currently running at about 1.9 million a week.
Seating capacity in cinemas increased during
the late 1980s, due almost entirely to the rise in
the number of multi-screen cinema complexes.
Cinema admissions in 1994 were 124
million—twice as many as in 1984. In
London and other large cities a number of art
or repertory cinemas show films which have
not been more widely distributed. These
include low-budget films from Britain and
abroad; other foreign films, often with
English subtitles; and older films which are
being shown again, sometimes in a newly
edited form. Arts centres often include cinemas,
and film societies use a range of buildings
including, for example, public libraries.
Animation
The resurgence of interest in animation in
Britain is due in part to the pioneering work
of British animators, who have created 3D
animation and computer animation. British
animated films have won four Oscars in
recent years, including in 1994 Nick Park’s
The Wrong Trousers (BBC-commissioned) and
in 1995 a ‘short’ by David Fine and Alison
Snowdon called Bob's Birthday for Channel 4.
Television has proved an important source of
production finance. Welsh television channel
S4C, for example, funded Operavox, a six-
part series of half-hour animated films of
famous operas sung by Welsh National Opera.
Government Support
An annual government grant of about
£17 million is made to the British Film
Institute and one of over £1 million to the
Scottish Film Council and the Scottish Film
Production Fund. Since 1993 Britain has
been a member of Eurimages, the Council of
Europe’s film co-production support scheme,
contributing approximately £5.5 million over
the first three years of membership.
Eurimages aims to develop the European
cinema and audio-visual industry by
providing financial support for feature-length
fiction films, creative documentaries and
distribution. Since 1993, 32 productions with
British participation have received loans
worth about £8 million.
In addition, more than £80 million from
the National Lottery (see p. 460) will be
provided by the Arts Council of England to
support film-making over the next five years.
British Film Commission
The British Film Commission was launched
in 1991, with government funding of
£3.5 million over four years. The
Commission aims to attract film productions
from overseas by offering a service to assist
film-makers. Fifteen foreign-produced films
went into production in Britain in 1994.
The Government is also to contribute
funding to help create a London Film
Commission. This will complement the work of
the British Film Commission and will attempt
to attract film productions to the capital.
British Screen Finance
British Screen Finance, a private sector
company, provides finance for new film¬
makers with commercially viable productions
who have difficulty in attracting funding.
The company, investing its own money
together with contributions from the
469
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Government, part-finances the production of
low- and medium-budget films involving
largely British talent. It encourages the early
stages of film project development and the
production of short films. The Government
funds the company with £2 million a year.
British Screen supported 15 films in 1994.
Successful films include Naked, Camilla and
An Awfully Big Adventure.
European Co-Production Fund
Funded by the Government with fl million
a year, the European Co-Production Fund
(ECPF) offers loans of up to 30 per cent of a
film’s budget, enabling British producers to
collaborate in the making of films in Europe.
It has invested fb.5 million in 19 feature
films. In 1994 the ECPF-funded film
Before the Rain was the winner at the Venice
Film Festival.
British Film Institute
The development of film, video and television
as art forms is promoted by the British Film
Institute (BFI) and in Scotland by the
Scottish Film Council. The BFI offers some
direct financial and technical help through its
Production Board.
The BFI runs the National Film Theatre
in London and the National Film and
Television Archive, and has the world’s
largest library of information on film and
television. It holds extensive international
collections of books, periodicals, scripts, stills
and posters. Its Education Department aims
to enable as many people as possible to
discover new ways of appreciating film, video
and television.
The National Film and Television Archive
contains over 200,000 films and television
programmes, including newsreels, dating from
1895. BFI South Bank comprises the
Museum of the Moving Image, which traces
the history of film and television, and the
National Film Theatre. The latter has three
cinemas showing films of historical, artistic or
technical interest, and is unique in offering
regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations. In November
each year it hosts the London Film Festival,
at which some 250 new films from all over
the world are screened.
The BFI promotes, and helps to fund, a
network of 35 regional film theatres, and is
involved in establishing film and television
centres with a range of activities and
facilities. It also co-operates with the Regional
Arts Boards and grant-aids their film work.
The Wales Film Council acts as the BFI’s
agent in Wales, and also receives funding
from the Arts Council of Wales. The BFI’s
charter extends to Northern Ireland, where the
BFI works with the Northern Ireland Film
Council (NIFC). The NIFC receives funds
from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
Scottish Film Council
The Scottish Film Council supports regional
film theatres, promotes and provides material
for media education and administers the
Scottish Film Archive. Financial assistance to
develop film scripts is available through the
Scottish Film Production Fund. Scottish
Screen Locations provides advice to film
makers on suitable locations for film-
productions in Scotland.
Children’s Film
The Children’s Film and Television
Foundation produces and distributes
entertainment films for children, shown
largely through video and television.
The Children’s Film Unit makes feature
films for children (mainly for Channel 4) and
runs weekly workshops for children on all
aspects of film-making. The Unit caters for
about 80 children at any time and has
produced 14 feature films.
The Northern Ireland Film Council runs
Cinemagic, an award-winning international
film festival for young people.
Training in Film Production
The National Film and Television School is
financed jointly by the Government and by
the film, video and television industries. It
offers postgraduate and short course training
for directors, editors, camera operators,
animators and other specialists. The School
470
THE ARTS
enrols about 30 full-time students a year and
about 500 on short course programmes. In
1995-96 it is receiving a government grant of
£1.85 million. The School is to move from
its present location in Buckinghamshire to the
BBC film studios at Ealing.
The London International Film School, the
Royal College of Art, and some universities
and other institutions of higher education also
offer training in film production.
Cinema Licensing and Film
Classification
Cinemas showing films to the public must be
licensed by local authorities, which have a
legal duty to prohibit the admission of
children under 16 to unsuitable films, and
may prevent the showing of any film. In
assessing films the authorities normally rely
on the judgment of an independent non-
statutory body, the British Board of Film
Classification (BBFC), to which films must
be submitted. The Board was set up on the
initiative of the cinema industry to ensure a
proper standard in films shown to the public.
It does not use any written code of
censorship, but can require cuts to be made
before granting a certificate; on rare
occasions, it refuses a certificate.
Films passed by the Board are put into
one of the following categories:
• U (universal)—suitable for all;
• PG (parental guidance), in which some
scenes may be unsuitable for young
children;
t 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
those ages; and
• Restricted 18, for restricted showing only
at segregated premises to which no one
under 18 is admitted—for example,
licensed cinema clubs.
Videos
The BBFC is also legally responsible for
classifying videos under a system similar to
that for films. It is an offence to supply
commercially a video which has not been
classified or to supply it in contravention of
its classification—for example, to sell or
hire a video classified 18 to a person under
the age of 18.
VISUAL ARTS
State support for the visual arts consists
largely of funding for the national museums
and galleries, purchase grants for municipal
museums and galleries, and funding through
local authorities, the Museums and Galleries
Commission and the area museum councils.
It also includes funding for the production,
exhibition and distribution of work by
contemporary artists and photographers and
for the promotion of art to the public,
channelled through the Arts Councils, the
Crafts Council and the Regional Arts
Boards, and grants towards the cost of art
education. The Government encourages high
standards of industrial design and
craftsmanship through grants to the Design
Council (see p. 206).
All national museums and galleries are
financed chiefly from government funds.
They may charge for entry to their
permanent collections and special exhibitions.
All the national collections are managed by
independent trustees.
Museums and art galleries maintained by
local authorities, universities, independent
museums and private funds may receive help
in building up their collections through
grants administered by the Museums and
Galleries Commission (for England) and the
Museum Councils in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Support to national and
regional public and independent museums
and galleries is also given by the Arts
Councils and by trusts and voluntary bodies,
including the Henry Moore Foundation, the
Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the
National Art Collections Fund. National
Lottery proceeds are being distributed in the
form of capital grants by the National
Heritage Memorial Fund, the Arts Councils
and the Millennium Commission.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
also distributes grants for the purchase of
works of art and items of national
significance. In recent years, for example,
the Fund has helped towards the acquisition
of masterpieces by Hans Holbein and
471
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Jacques-Louis David (bought by the National
Gallery) and by El Greco (the National
Gallery of Scotland).
Pre-eminent works of art are accepted by
the Government in place of inheritance tax
and are allocated to public galleries; items
thus acquired in 1994—95 include paintings by
Francis Bacon, Marc Chagall and the
Elizabethan miniaturist Nicholas Hilliard.
In collaboration with the Regional Arts
Boards, the Arts Council of England provides
some strategic funding for galleries;
educational institutions from art schools and
universities to schools; commercial galleries
and publishers; artists’ agencies; and media
centres. It also supports touring exhibitions
and the presentation of works of art in a
variety of public spaces. The Arts Council of
England’s unique collection of 20th century
British art, with the National Touring
Exhibition Service, is managed on its behalf
by the South Bank Board, which also runs
the Hayward Gallery.
The Council also supports the Institute of
Contemporary Art in London and five other
independent galleries: the Whitechapel and
the Serpentine in London, the Museum of
Modern Art in Oxford, Ikon in Birmingham
and Arnolfini in Bristol, as well as the
Institute of International Visual Arts, based in
London. The ten Regional Arts Boards also
fund galleries and centres and provide direct
support for artists.
Support for galleries is also given by the
Arts Councils in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
British artists, photographers, architects
and sculptors with international reputations
include David Hockney, Lucian Freud, David
Bailey, Sir Richard Rogers and Sir Anthony
Caro. Younger artists with a similar standing
include Richard Deacon, Tony Cragg and
Anish Kapoor.
Museums and Art Galleries
About 80 million people a year, across all
social groups, attend more than 2,000
museums and galleries open to the public,
which include the major national collections
and around 1,100 independent museums,
some receiving support from local authorities.
Government provision for the national
museums and galleries is £218 million in
1995-96. The Museums and Galleries
Improvement Fund, which is jointly financed
by the Government and the Wolfson
Charities and the Family Charitable Trusts,
is providing an annual budget of £4 million
over five years from 1991-92 for
refurbishment. The Fund is already
supporting over 100 projects at national and
other museums and galleries, including work
in Luton, Newcastle upon Tyne and Ullapool.
The Government takes advice on policy
from the Museums and Galleries
Commission. The Commission also promotes
co-operation between national and regional
institutions. Ten area museum councils
supply technical services and advice on
conservation and the environment, display,
documentation and publicity.
The Government encourages the loan of
objects from national and regional collections
so that works of art can be seen by as wide a
public as possible. The Arts Council of
England, through a National Collections
Training Scheme and the National Training
Exhibition Service, is also broadening access
to the national collections.
The Museum Training Institute is
responsible for developing training standards
and programmes within museums; the Arts
Council of England supports an MA course

at the Royal College of Art for curating and
commissioning contemporary art, and
promotes professional practice among artists
and curators.
Museums Association
The independent Museums Association, to
which many museums and art galleries and
their staffs belong, and which has many
overseas members, facilitates exchange of
information and discussion of matters relating
to museums and galleries. It provides
training, seminars and research; its
publications include the monthly Museums
Journal and a new technical periodical,
Museums Practice.
National Collections
The national museums and art galleries,
many of them located in London, contain
some of the world’s most comprehensive
collections of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and
general interest. They are:
• the British Museum (including the
ethnographic collections of the Museum
of Mankind);
• the Natural History Museum;
• the Victoria and Albert Museum (the
V&A, which displays fine and decorative
arts);
• the Science Museum and its two regional
institutes—the National Railway
Museum (York) and the National
Museum of Photography, Film and
Television (Bradford);
• the National Gallery (which houses
western painting from around 1260
to 1920);
• the Tate Gallery, London (British
painting and modern art);
• the Tate Gallery, Liverpool;
• the Tate Gallery, St Ives (St Ives School
and contemporary art);
• the National Portrait Gallery;
• the Imperial War Museum;
• the National Army Museum;
• the Royal Air Force Museum;
• the National Maritime Museum;
• the Wallace Collection (which includes
paintings, furniture, arms and armour;
and objets d’art); and
• the National Museums and Galleries on
Merseyside.
The Sainsbury Wing of the National
Gallery provides a venue for major
international touring exhibitions and other
events. London is to be the location of the
Tate’s new museum of modern art.
In Scotland the national collections are held
by the National Museums of Scotland and the
National Galleries of Scotland. The former
include the Royal Museum of Scotland, the
National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland,
the Scottish United Services Museum and
the Scottish Agricultural Museum, in
Edinburgh; the Museum of Flight, near
North Berwick; and the Museum of Costume
at Shambellie House near Dumfries. A new
Museum of Scotland is being built next to
the Royal Museum to house the National
Museums’ Scottish collection.
The National Galleries of Scotland
comprise the National Gallery of Scotland,
the Scottish National Portrait Gallery and the
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. In
1994-95 the National Museums of Scotland
attracted 1.5 million visitors and the National
Galleries of Scotland some 900,000.
The National Museum of Wales, which
has opened new galleries at its main building
in Cardiff, has a number of branches,
including the Welsh Folk Museum at
St Fagans and the Industrial and Maritime
Museum in Cardiffs dockland.
Northern Ireland has two national
museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and
the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum in
County Down.
Other Collections
Other important collections in London
include the Museum of London; Sir John
Soane’s Museum; the Courtauld collection;
and the London Transport Museum. The
Queen’s Gallery in Buckingham Palace has
exhibitions of pictures from the extensive royal
473
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
collection. The Royal Armouries, Britain’s
oldest museum, has been housed in the Tower
of London for 900 years. A new headquarters
for the collection is being built in Leeds. Due
to open in 1996, the project is a pioneering
joint public and private sector venture.
Most cities and towns have museums
devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually administered by the local
authorities but sometimes by local learned
societies or by individuals or trustees. Both
Oxford and Cambridge are rich in museums.
Many are associated with their universities,
such as the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford
and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.
Many private collections of art and antiques
in historic family mansions, including those
owned by the National Trusts and English
Heritage (see p. 357), are open to the public.
An increasing number of open air
museums depict the regional life of an area or
preserve early industrial remains. These
include the Weald and Downland Museum in
West Sussex, and the Ironbridge Gorge
Museum in Shropshire. Skills of the past are
revived in a number of ‘living’ museums,
such as the Gladstone Pottery Museum near
Stoke-on-Trent and the Quarry Bank Mill at
Styal in Cheshire.
Among recently opened museums are:
• the Museum of Science and Industry in
Manchester;
• the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth,
housing the restored wreck of the flagship
of Henry VIII;
• the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life
and Art in Glasgow, containing artefacts
representing the world’s major religions;
and
• Eureka!, the first museum designed
specifically for children, in Halifax,
West Yorkshire.
The Burrell Collection in Glasgow houses
world-famous tapestries, paintings and
objets d’art. The Design Museum in
London’s Docklands contains a collection of
20th-century mass-produced consumer objects.
There are also a number of national art
exhibiting societies, the most famous being the
Royal Academy of Arts at Burlington House
in London. The Academy holds an annual
Summer Exhibition and other important
exhibitions during the rest of the year. The
Summer Exhibition is the world’s largest
open contemporary art exhibition and brings
together a wide range of work by established
artists and by others exhibiting for the first
time. The Royal Scottish Academy holds
annual exhibitions in Edinburgh. There are
also children’s exhibitions, including the
National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Crafts
The crafts in Britain have an annual turnover
estimated at £400 million. Government aid
for the crafts, amounting to an estimated
£3.2 million in 1995-96, is administered in
England and Wales by the Crafts Council.
The Council supports craftspeople by
promoting public interest in their work, and
encouraging the creation of works of
contemporary craftsmanship. Grants are
available to help with setting up workshops
and acquiring equipment. The Crafts
Council runs the national centre for crafts in
London, which houses a gallery, reference
and picture libraries, and a gallery shop. It
organises the annual Chelsea Crafts Fair,
and co-ordinates British groups at
international trade fairs. Crafts Council
exhibitions tour nationally and internationally,
and grants are made to encourage exhibitions,
projects and organisations.
Funding is given to the Regional Arts
Boards and the Arts Council of Wales for the
support of crafts, and to Contemporary
Applied Art, a membership organisation that
holds exhibitions and sells work through its
London gallery.
Craftworks, an independent company, is
the crafts development agency for Northern
Ireland, providing training, marketing and
business counselling for the crafts sector. The
Arts Council of Northern Ireland also funds
crafts promotion, as does the Scottish Office
through the Scottish Arts Council.
Training in Art and Design
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in the art colleges and fine and
applied art departments of universities: these
474
THE ARTS
include the Slade School of Art and
Goldsmith’s College of Art, London; and in
further education colleges and private art
schools. Many of these institutions award
degrees at postgraduate level. Art is also
taught at an advanced level at the four
Scottish Central (Art) Institutions.
Courses at universities concentrate largely
on academic disciplines, such as the history
of art. The leading institutions include the
Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the
University of London and the Department of
Classical Art and Archaeology at University
College, London. The Open University also
offers courses in art history and theory of art.
Art is one of the foundation subjects in the
National Curriculum. The Society for
Education through Art encourages, among
other activities, the purchase by schools of
original works of art by organising an annual
Pictures for Schools exhibition.
The Open College of the Arts offers
correspondence courses in art and design,
painting, sculpture, textiles, photography
and creative writing to people wishing to
study at home.
Export Control of Works of Art
London is a major centre for the international
art market, and sales of works of art take
place in the main auction houses (two of the
longest established being Sotheby’s and
Christie’s), and through private dealers.
Certain items are covered by export control.
These are:
• works of art and collectors’ items over 50
years old and worth £20,000 or more
(£5,000 or more in the case of British
historical portraits);
• photographic material over 50 years old
and valued at £500 or more an item; and
• documents, manuscripts and archives
over 50 years old, irrespective of value.
A licence from the Department of
National Heritage is required before such
items can be exported. If the Department’s
advisers recommend withholding a licence,
the matter is referred to the Reviewing
Committee on the Export of Works of Art. If
the Committee considers a work to be of
national importance, it can advise the
Government to withhold the export licence
for a specified time to give a public museum,
art gallery, or private collector an opportunity
to buy at a fair price.
LITERATURE AND LIBRARIES
A number of literary activities receive public
subsidy through the Arts Councils. In 1995,
for example, there was continued support for
a programme of tours by writers from other
countries, for innovative broadcasting projects
promoting reading and writing, and for
literary magazines and independent publishers.
There are free public libraries throughout
Britain (see p. 477), private libraries and
several private literary societies. Book reviews
are featured in the press and on television
and radio, and numerous periodicals
concerned with literature are published (see
p. 462). Recognition of outstanding literary
merit is provided by a number of awards,
some of the most valuable being the Booker
and Whitbread prizes. The 1994 Booker Prize
was won by James Kelman for How Late it
Was, How Late.
In 1995 Harold Pinter was awarded the
second David Cohen British Literature Prize
for a lifetime’s achievement by a living
British writer. A part of the £40,000 prize,
which is awarded every two years, enables
winners to commission new works from
younger writers. Other awards to encourage
young authors include those of the Somerset
Maugham Trust Fund and the E.C. Gregory
Trust Fund.
Many writers from overseas, often from
Commonwealth countries, also live and work
in Britain, writing books in English which
have a wide circulation in Britain and overseas.
Distinguished British poets include Ted
Hughes (the Poet Laureate), James Berry,
Gillian Clarke, Carol Ann Duffy, Gavin
Ewart, Alison Fell, Tony Harrison, Geoffrey
Hill, Elizabeth Jennings and Carol Rumens.
As the Poet Laureate, Ted Hughes is a
member of the Royal Household and receives
an annual stipend from the Civil List—see
p. 47. His most recent commemorative verse
was written on the occasion of the Queen
Mother’s 95th birthday.
475
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Many British writers are internationally
recognised. Well-known living novelists, with
examples of their works, include:
• Martin Amis—London Fields, Money, The
Information',
• Dame Muriel Spark—The Prime of Miss
fean Brodie, Memento Mori',
• Julian Barnes—Talking it Over, The
Porcupine', and
• P.D. James—The Children of Men,
Original Sin.
English literature is taught extensively at
schools, colleges and universities throughout
Britain. Creative writing is also taught at a
wide variety of institutions; one of the best
known is the University of East Anglia, in
Norwich, where writers such as Ian McEwan
and Kazuo Ishiguro have studied. The
University also houses the British Centre for
Literary Translation.
Authors’ Copyright and Performers’
Protection
Original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
works, films, sound recordings and
broadcasts are automatically protected by
copyright in Britain. This protection is also
given to works from countries party to
international copyright conventions. The
copyright owner has rights against
unauthorised reproduction, public
performance, broadcasting and issue to the
public of his or her work; and against
dealing in unauthorised copies. In most cases
the author is the first owner of the copyright,
and the term of copyright is the life of the
author and a period of 50 years after death
(50 years from the year of release for films
and sound recordings and 50 years from the
year of broadcast for broadcasts).
The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988 reformed copyright law and introduced
the concept of moral rights, whereby authors
have the right to be identified on their works
and to object to derogatory treatment of them.
The Act also updated the rights which protect
performers against making and trading in
unauthorised recordings of live performances,
the term of protection for these rights then
being 50 years from the year in which the
performance was given. From July 1995 that
protection was extended to 70 years.
Literary and Philological Societies
Societies to promote literature include the
English Association and the Royal Society of
Literature. The leading society for studies in
the humanities is the British Academy for the
Promotion of Historical, Philosophical and
Philological Studies (the British Academy).
Other specialist societies are the Early
English Text Society, the Bibliographical
Society and several societies devoted to
particular authors, the largest of which is the
Dickens Fellowship. Various societies, such
as the Poetry Society, sponsor poetry
readings and recitals.
Libraries
The British Library
The British Library, the national library of
Britain, is one of the world’s greatest libraries,
with a collection of more than 150 million
separate items. These include books, journals,
manuscripts, newspapers, stamps, maps and
recorded sound. Publishers must deposit in
the Library a copy of everything published.
A new building for the British
Library’s reference collections is being
constructed at St Pancras, London, at
a cost of £496 million; it is due to be
completed at the end of 1996. The St
Pancras building will offer, for the
first time, a purpose-built home for
the national library with
environmentally controlled storage,
increased reader space and seating
and greatly improved public facilities,
including three exhibition galleries, an
auditorium and a bookshop.
The Library’s collection grows by about
five shelf miles a year and consists of
bequests, donations and purchases
collected over a period of more than 200
years. It is also the guardian of treasures such
as the Magna Carta and Shakespeare’s First
Folio. Some 450,000 reader visits are made
476
THE ARTS
to the Library each year; admission to all
reading rooms is free of charge.
The Library’s Document Supply Centre at
Boston Spa (West Yorkshire) is the national
centre for inter-library lending within Britain
and between Britain and countries overseas. It
dispatches over 4 million documents a year.
The Research and Development
Department is a major source of funding for
research and development in library and
information services.
Other Libraries
The National Libraries of Scotland and
Wales, the Bodleian Library of Oxford
University and the Cambridge University
Library can also claim copies of all new
British publications under legal deposit. The
first phase of a new building for the National
Library of Scotland was opened in 1989,
accommodating a map library, lending
services and the Scottish Science Library.
The second stage was opened in May 1995.
A major extension of the National Library of
Wales was completed in 1995.
Some national museums and government
departments have important libraries.
• The Public Record Office in London and
in Kew, Surrey, houses the records of
the superior courts of law of England and
Wales and of most government
departments, as well as famous historical
documents. The Office has many millions
of documents, dating from the time of
the Norman Conquest to the present day.
Public records, with few exceptions, are
available for inspection by members of
the public 30 years after the end of the
year in which they were created.
• The Scottish Record Office in Edinburgh
and the Public Record Office of
Northern Ireland, Belfast, serve the
same purpose.
Besides a number of great private
collections, such as that of the London
Library, there are the libraries of the learned
societies and institutions, such as the Royal
Institute of International Affairs, the Royal
Geographical Society and the Royal Academy
of Music. The Poetry Library in the South
Bank Centre, owned by the Arts Council of
England, is a collection of 20th-century
poetry written in or translated into English;
the library houses about 60,000 volumes.
University Libraries
The university libraries of Oxford and
Cambridge are unmatched by those of the
more recent foundations. However, the
combined library resources of the colleges
and institutions of the University of London
total 9 million volumes, the John Rylands
University Library of Manchester contains
3.5 million volumes, Edinburgh 2.5 million,
Leeds 2.3 million, and Birmingham, Glasgow,
Liverpool and Aberdeen each have over
1 million volumes. Many universities have
important research collections in special
subjects—the Barnes Medical Library at
Birmingham and the British Library of
Political and Economic Science at the
London School of Economics, for example.
University libraries also have on-line access to
library information worldwide.
Special Libraries
Numerous associations and commercial and
industrial organisations run library and
information services. Although most are
intended primarily for use within the
organisation, many can be used, by
arrangement, by people interested in the area
covered, and the specialist publications held
are often available for inter-library lending.
Public Libraries
Local authorities in Great Britain and
education and library boards in Northern
Ireland have a duty to provide a free lending
and reference library service, and Britain’s
network of about 4,100 public libraries has a
total stock of over 130 million books. Public
libraries issue an average of ten books a year
for every person in Britain. Of these, 58 per
cent are works of fiction. Over half of the
total population are members of public
libraries. Some areas are served by mobile
libraries, and domiciliary services cater for
people unable to visit a library.
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Many libraries have collections of
compact discs, records, audio- and video¬
cassettes, and musical scores for loan to the
public, while a number also lend from
collections of works of art, which may be
originals or reproductions. Most libraries hold
documents on local history, and nearly all
provide children’s departments, while
reference and information sections and art,
music, commercial and technical departments
meet the growing demands in these fields.
The information role is one of
increasing importance for many libraries, and
greater use is being made of information
technology, including microcomputers and
reference databases.
The Government remains committed to
providing a free basic library service—the
borrow ing and consultation of printed
materials—but believes there is scope for
greater private sector involvement.
Public libraries charge for some services,
such as research services and the lending of
non-printed materials.
The Government is advised by the Library
and Information Commission, which is a
forum for policy on library and information
provision in general, and the Advisory Council
on Libraries, which advises Government on
public libraries in England. The Commission
also advises the Government on Britain’s
representation abroad and research strategy.
The Government is reviewing the scope and
value of services provided by public libraries
in England and the feasibility of contracting
out the delivery of some parts of their service.
The Library Association
The Library Association is the principal
professional organisation for those engaged in
library and information services. Founded in
1877, the Association has 25,000 members. It
maintains a Register of Chartered Librarians
and publishes books, pamphlets and an
official journal.
The Library Association is the designated
authority for the recognition of qualifications
gained in other EU member states.
Public Lending Right Scheme
The Public Lending Right Scheme gives
registered authors the right to receive
payment from a central fund (totalling £4.9
million in 1995-96) for the loans made of
their books from public libraries in Britain.
Payment is made in proportion to the
number of times the authors’ books are lent
out. In 1994-95, 110 authors received the
maximum payment of £6,000 and
altogether about £4.3 million was
distributed among 19,000 authors.
Books
In 1994 British publishers issued about
88,700 separate titles. The British
publishing industry devotes much effort to
developing overseas markets, and in 1994
the estimated value of exports of British
books amounted to £700 million.
Among the leading organisations
representing publishing and distribution
interests are the Publishers Association,
which has 200 members; and the
Booksellers’ Association, with 3,300
members. The Publishers Association,
through its International Division,
promotes the export of British books. The
Welsh Book Council supports the
production of books in the Welsh language.
Historical Manuscripts
The Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts locates, reports on, and gives
information and advice about historical
papers outside the public records. It also
advises private owners, grant-awarding
bodies, record offices, local authorities and
the Government on the acquisition and
maintenance of manuscripts. In addition,
the Commission maintains the National
Register of Archives (the central collecting
point for information about British
historical manuscripts) and the Manorial
Documents Register, which are available
to researchers.

Media Ownership 501
The media have an increasingly central role in Britain’s democratic and
cultural life. The public interest requires the protection of media plurality
and diversity; it also requires a healthy and growing media industry. To that
end, the Government has announced new proposals to regulate media
ownership into the next century (see p. 501) which, while avoiding interference
in the dynamics of the market, aim to ensure that no organisation is allowed
to dominate and unduly influence the media.
Television and Radio
Broadcasting in Britain has traditionally been
based on the principle that it is a public
service accountable to the people through
Parliament. While retaining the essential
public service element, it now embraces the
principles of competition and choice.
Three public bodies have the main
responsibility for television and radio services
to which nearly everyone has access:
• the BBC (British Broadcasting
Corporation) broadcasts television and
radio programmes;
• the ITC (Independent Television
Commission) licenses and regulates non-
BBC television services, including cable
and satellite services; and
• the Radio Authority licenses and
regulates all non-BBC radio services,
including cable and satellite.
These authorities work to broad
requirements and objectives defined by
Parliament, but are otherwise independent in
their day-to-day conduct of business.
The government department responsible
for overseeing the broadcasting system is
the Department of National Heritage. The
Secretary of State for National Heritage
is answerable to Parliament on broad
policy questions.
Television
Television viewing is by far Britain’s most
popular leisure pastime: 96 per cent of
households have a colour television set and 73
per cent a video recorder. People spend an
average of over three and a half hours a day
watching television, including video playbacks.
There are currently four terrestrial
television channels (a fifth is planned—see
p. 484), offering a mixture of drama, light
479
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
entertainment, films, sport, educational,
children’s and religious programmes, news
and current affairs, and documentaries.
The BBC provides two complementary
national networks—BBC 1 and BBC 2—
which are financed predominantly by a
licence fee. The ITC regulates two television
services—ITV (Channel 3) and Channel 4
which complement each other and are largely
funded by advertising. In Wales, S4C (Sianel
Pedwar Cymru) broadcasts programmes on
the fourth channel. All four channels
broadcast on 625 lines UHF (ultra-high
frequency) and over 99 per cent of the
population live within range of transmission.
British television productions continue to
win many international awards, and in 1994
film and television companies received
£185 million in export earnings.
Radio
Practically every home has a radio, and the
widespread ownership of portable sets
(including personal stereos) and car radios
means that people can listen to radio
throughout the day. About 70 per cent of the
population listen to the radio on a normal day
and more than 85 per cent do so over the week.
The BBC has five national networks,
which together transmit all types of music,
news, current affairs, drama, education, sport
and a range of features programmes. The
Radio Authority regulates three national
commercial radio stations—Classic FM,
Virgin 1215 and Talk Radio UK (see p. 485).
There are 37 BBC local radio stations
serving England and the Channel Islands, and
regional and community radio services in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. About
180 independent local radio (ILR) services
are also in operation. Stations supply a
comprehensive service of local news and
information, sport, music and other
entertainment, education and consumer advice.
‘Phone-in’ programmes allowing listeners to
express their views on air are popular.
GOVERNMENT ROLE
In recent years broadcasting in Britain has
seen radical changes. The availability of more
radio frequencies, together with satellite,
cable and microwave transmissions, has made
a greater number of local, national and
international services possible. Moreover,
the technical quality of sound and pictures
is improving.
In response to rapidly developing
technology and rising public demand for a
wide choice of programmes and services, the
Broadcasting Act 1990 was passed with the
aim of making the regulatory framework for
broadcasting more flexible and efficient, and
giving viewers and listeners access to a
greater range of services. At the same time
the Act aimed to promote competition and to
maintain high standards of taste and decency.
Changes under the
Broadcasting Act 1990
The Broadcasting Act 1990 overhauled the
regulation of independent television and radio
and opened the way for many more services.
In 1991 the IB A (Independent
Broadcasting Authority) was replaced by the
ITC (Independent Television Commission),
the Radio Authority and a transmission
and engineering company, National
Transcommunications Limited (NTL—see
below). At the same time the Cable
Authority was made part of the ITC and the
Radio Authority.
The ITC and the Radio Authority
issue licences to commercial broadcasters
and enforce rules to ensure diversity of
ownership. The 1990 Act made
provision for setting up a new national
independent television station—Channel
5—and three national commercial radio
stations, with opportunities for launching
hundreds of independent local radio and
television channels.
In 1991 the IB A networks and other
facilities were transferred to National
Transcommunications Limited, a public
company. NTL was then sold for £70 million
to a company formed for the purpose by
Mercury Asset Management. NTL transmits
television services for the independent
television companies, Channel 4, S4C, and
radio services for about 100 independent local
radio stations.

THE MEDIA
For the Act’s provisions on media
ownership see p. 501.
Programming Obligations
Licence-holders of the independent television
Channel 3 (and the proposed Channel 5) need
to pass demanding quality tests (see p. 484).
ITC regulations place a limit on the
proportion of non-European material
broadcast. Since 1993 both the BBC and
commercial television licensees have been
required to ensure that at least 25 per cent of
their original programming comes from
independent producers. This percentage does
not include news and news-related daily
current affairs programmes.
Programme Standards
Recognising that broadcasting is an extremely
powerful medium with the potential to
offend, exploit and cause harm, the
Broadcasting Act 1990 contained guarantees
on programme standards which are extended
to all British-based broadcasters. These
guarantees cover taste, decency, accuracy and
balance. The Government can proscribe
unacceptable foreign satellite services
receivable in Britain, and anyone in Britain
supporting such a service can be prosecuted.
THE BBC
The constitution, finances and obligations of
the BBC are governed by a Royal Charter and
by a Licence and Agreement. The
Corporation’s board of 12 governors,
including the chairman, vice-chairman and a
national governor each for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland, is appointed by the
Queen on the advice of the Government. The
board of governors is ultimately responsible
for all aspects of broadcasting by the BBC.
The governors appoint the Director-General,
the Corporation’s chief executive officer, who
heads the board of management—the body in
charge of the daily running of the Corporation.
The BBC has a regional structure
throughout Britain. The three English
regions—BBC North, BBC Midlands & East
and BBC South—and BBC Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland make programmes for
their local audiences as well as contributing
to the national network.
The National Broadcasting Councils for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
advise on the policy and content of
television and radio programmes intended
mainly for reception in their areas. Ten
Regional Councils in England advise the
board of governors on the needs and concerns
of audiences.
Finance
The domestic services of the BBC are
financed predominantly from the sale of
television licences. Households with a
television must buy an annual licence costing
£86.50 for colour and £28.50 for black and
white. Nearly 20.8 million licences were
current on 31 July 1995; of these, 20 million
were for colour.
Licence income is supplemented by profits
from trading activities, such as television
programme exports, sale of recordings,
publications and other merchandise connected
with BBC programmes, hire and sale of
educational films, film library sales, and
exhibitions based on programmes. The BBC
World Service’s radio broadcasting operations
(see p. 489) are financed by a grant-in-aid from
the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (£136
million in 1995-96), while BBC Worldwide
Television (see p. 489) is self-financing.
TV Licensing, a subsidiary company of
the Post Office, undertakes the licence
administration on behalf of the BBC. Since
1988 annual rises in the licence fee have been
linked to the rate of inflation, and will
continue to be until the end of 1996; this is
intended to improve the BBC’s efficiency
even further and encourage it to continue to
develop alternative sources of revenue.
Future of the BBC
A government White Paper, entitled The
Future of the BBC: Serving the Nation,
Competing Worldwide, was published in July
1994. It considered the BBC’s future after
the expiry of its current Royal Charter at the
end of 1996 and proposed that:
481
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• the BBC should remain a public service
broadcaster, maintaining its current radio
and television services, and this should
be its main role. A new Royal Charter
and Agreement should provide the
framework for the BBC’s activities for
ten years from 1997;
• the BBC should be more accountable and
responsive to its audiences, publishing
objectives for its programmes and
services;
• a reasonable proportion of the BBC’s
network programmes should be made in
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and
the English regions;
• the licence fee should be the main source
of income for the BBC’s public services
in Britain until at least 2001;
• World Service Radio should continue,
funded by grant-in-aid;
• the BBC should develop its commercial
activities in Britain and abroad, in
partnership with the private sector, and
should evolve into an international
multimedia organisation. These
commercial activities should be distinct
from its public services, and should not
be subsidised from the licence fee; and
• the Government and the BBC would
explore options for injecting private
finance into the Corporation’s
transmission services. Privatisation, either
in whole or in part, would be among the
options under consideration.
BBC Television
The two domestic channels are BBC 1 and
BBC 2:
• BBC 1, the channel of broad appeal,
broadcasts news and current affairs,
major documentaries, sport, popular
drama and light entertainment, and
children’s programmes;
• BBC 2 is more innovatory. Its programmes
complement those on BBC 1 and cater for
minorities within the general audience,
embracing music and the arts, comedy and
challenging drama, as well as education,
community and special needs programmes.
Together, BBC 1 and BBC 2 transmit
over 18,000 hours of programmes a year for
national and regional audiences.
Programmes are made by, commissioned
from, or acquired through London-based
production departments and six BBC
regions. BBC Television departments
throughout Britain commission a wide
range of programmes from independent
producers. Feature films, mini-series,
children’s series, cartoons and overseas sport
are also acquired from other organisations
around the world.
In April 1994 the BBC pledged to increase
the proportion of network television and
radio programmes produced outside London
from one-fifth to broadly one-third by
1997-98. The BBC enters into agreements
with overseas television corporations in order
to share the cost of some new programmes.
BBC Focus
BBC Focus is the Corporation’s specialist
night-time television service. It is a unit
within the BBC’s Education Directorate and
broadcasts education, training, and
professional information and updating
programmes as part of BBC 2’s night-time
service, The Learning Zone.
BBC Focus does not make any of the
programmes that it broadcasts, but works
with a variety of public bodies and charities
to enable them to communicate with specific
audiences as part of the BBC’s educational
service. All programmes are ‘open access’ and
free. They are designed for recording on
video and viewing at a later date.
BBC Network Radio
BBC Network Radio serves an audience of
28 million a week in Britain, broadcasting
around 38,000 hours of programmes each
year on its five networks:
• BBC Radio 1 FM broadcasts pop music,
as well as live concerts, social action
campaigns and comedy, 24 hours a day;
• BBC Radio 2 transmits popular music
and light entertainment, also for 24 hours
a day;
482
THE MEDIA
• BBC Radio 3 broadcasts mainly classical
music, but presents jazz, drama, poetry,
documentaries and school programming
as well;
• BBC Radio 4 (broadcast with some
differences on FM and LW) provides
news and current affairs coverage,
together with drama, comedy,
documentaries and panel games; it also
carries parliamentary coverage, and
cricket in season on LW; and
• BBC Radio 5 Live, which superseded
Radio 5 in March 1994, is a 24-hour
news and sport network.
INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING
Independent Television Commission
Like the Radio Authority and S4C, the ITC’s
constitution and finances are governed by the
Broadcasting Act 1990. The ITC is
responsible for licensing and regulating non-
BBC television services operating in or from
Britain. These include:
• ITV (Channel 3);
• Channel 4;
• the proposed Channel 5;
• cable and other local delivery services;
• independent teletext services; and
• satellite services transmitted from Britain.
The ITC monitors the licences and
licence conditions but is not involved in
detailed scheduling of programmes. It is
advised by committees on educational
broadcasting, religious broadcasting, charitable
appeals and advertising. Ten viewer
consultative councils also comment on the
commercial services’ programmes.
ITV Programmes
The first regular ITV programmes began in
London in 1955. ITV programmes are
broadcast 24 hours a day throughout the
country. About one-third of the output
comprises informative programmes—news,
documentaries, and coverage of current
affairs, education and religion. The remainder
covers sport, comedy, drama, game shows,
films, and a range of other programmes with
popular appeal. Over half the programmes
are produced by the programme companies
and ITN (Independent Television News—
see below).
ITV (Channel 3) Programme Companies
ITV is made up of 15 regionally based
television companies which are licensed to
supply programmes in the 14 independent
television geographical regions. There are two
licences for London, one for weekdays and
the other for the weekend. An additional ITC
licensee provides a national breakfast-time
service, transmitted on the ITV network.
The licensees operate on a commercial
basis, deriving most of their revenue from
selling advertising time. The financial
resources, advertising revenue and
programme production of the companies vary
considerably, depending largely on the
population of the areas in which they operate.
Although newspapers may acquire an interest
in programme companies, safeguards exist to
ensure against concentration of media
ownership (see p. 501).
Each programme company plans the
content of the programmes to be broadcast in
its area. These are produced by the company
itself, or by other programme companies, or
are bought from elsewhere.
A common news service is provided by
ITN. ITN has been appointed to supply a
service of national and international news to
the ITV network for a ten-year period from
January 1993.
ITV Network Centre
The ITV Network Centre, which is
wholly owned by the ITV companies,
independently commissions and schedules
those television programmes which are
shown across the ITV network. Programmes
are commissioned from the ITV companies as
well as from independent producers. The
Centre also promotes the ITV network and
co-ordinates developments in technology
and training.
483
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Licences
The ITV licences for Channel 3, which came
up for renewal at the end of 1992, were
awarded by the ITC in October 1991.
Channel 3 licences are awarded for a ten-year
period by competitive tender to the highest
bidder who has passed a quality threshold. In
exceptional cases a lower bid can be selected,
for instance, where an applicant is able to
offer a significantly better quality of service
than that offered by the highest bidder.
There are safeguards for quality
programming, with licensees being required to
provide a diverse programme service calculated
to appeal to a wide variety of tastes and
interests. They also have to show high quality
news and current affairs programmes and a
reasonable proportion of other programmes of
high quality. There is a statutory duty to
present programmes made in and about the
region. There is also a requirement for
district and regional programming to be
aimed at different areas within regions.
Channel 3 licensees are obliged to operate a
national programme network. Networking
arrangements are subject to the approval of the
ITC and the Director General of Fair Trading
so that anti-competitive practices are avoided.
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4, which began broadcasting in 1982,
provides a national television service
throughout Britain, except in Wales, which
has a corresponding service—S4C (Sianel
Pedwar Cymru). In January 1993 Channel 4
became a public corporation, licensed and
regulated by the ITC, and funded by selling
its own advertising time. It was previously a
public limited company owned by the ITC.
Channel 4’s remit is to provide programmes
with a distinctive character and to appeal to
tastes and interests not generally catered for by
Channel 3. It must present a suitable
proportion of educational programmes and
encourage innovation and experiment. Channel
4 commissions programmes from the ITV
companies and independent producers and
buys programmes from overseas. It broadcasts
for around 139 hours a week, about half of
which are devoted to informative programmes.
In Wales programmes on the fourth channel
are run and controlled by S4C. Its members
are appointed by the Government. S4C is
required to see that a significant proportion of
programming, in practice about 23 hours a
week, is in the Welsh language and that
programmes broadcast between 18.30 and 22.00
hours are mainly in Welsh. At other times S4C
transmits national Channel 4 programmes.
Like Channel 4, S4C has sold its own
advertising since January 1993. S4C is
expected to cover only 10 per cent of its costs
from advertising, with the remainder financed
by the Government.
Gaelic TV Fund
The Gaelic Television Committee, appointed
by the ITC, was set up under the Broadcasting
Act 1990 to administer government finance for
making television programmes in Gaelic. The
Gaelic Television Fund was created and
programmes thus financed came on screen
from January 1993. In 1994 the Government
paid £8.4 million to the ITC, which was
credited to the Fund. The Fund has increased
the output of Gaelic television programmes
from 100 to about 300 hours each year.
Channel 5
A new national terrestrial television channel I
Channel 5—was originally intended to come
into operation in late 1994, financed through
advertising, subscription or sponsorship. The
ten-year licence was to be awarded by
competitive tender. However, in 1992 the
ITC rejected the single bid it had received,
and in September 1994 announced that it was
again inviting applications for the licence; by
the closing date of 1 May 1995, four
consortia had submitted bids.
In July 1994, the Government
announced new frequency allocations for
Channel 5 and for up to 12 digital terrestrial
television services.
Local Television
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990 licences for
the delivery of local television services are
awarded by competitive tender; there is no
484
THE MEDIA
quality threshold. ITC licence-holders can
supply national and local television
channels using both cable and microwave
transmission systems.
The Radio Authority
Independent local radio (ILR) is based on
principles similar to those of ITV. The
programme companies operate under licence to
the Radio Authority and are financed mainly
by advertising revenue. The Radio Authority is
required to ensure that licensed services,
taken as a whole, are of a high quality and
offer a range of programmes calculated to
appeal to a variety of tastes and interests.
The Authority awards national radio
licences by competitive tender to the
highest bidder. There are three independent
national services:
• Classic FM, which broadcasts mainly
classical music, together with news and
information, came on air in September
1992;
• Virgin 1215, which plays broad-based rock
music, came on air in April 1993; and
• Talk Radio UK, which is a speech-based
service, came on air in February 1995.
Since the early 1990s more local radio
stations have continued to come on the air,
some of which are neighbourhood and
‘community of interest’ stations. The
Authority has awarded 54 new local radio
licences since it came into operation in 1991.
Local radio licences are not allocated by
competitive tender; the success of licence
applications is in part determined by the
extent to which applicants meet the needs and
interests of the people living in the area and
in part by whether they have the necessary
financial resources to sustain programme
plans for the eight-year licence period.
Some of the locations have been selected
with small-scale ‘community radio’ in mind.
As part of its brief to develop a wide range of
radio services, the Authority is establishing a
number of more specialist stations.
The Radio Authority also issues restricted
service licences. These are issued at the
discretion of the Authority (subject to certain
conditions and frequency availability), usually
for a maximum of 28 days. They enable local
events—such as sports events, arts festivals
and conferences—to be covered by a
temporary radio service in a limited area, for
example, part of a city or town or an arena.
TELETEXT, CABLE AND SATELLITE
SERVICES
Teletext
The BBC and independent television each
operate a teletext service, offering constantly
updated information on a variety of subjects,
including news, sport, travel, weather
conditions and entertainment. The teletext
system allows the television signal to carry
additional information which can be selected
and displayed as ‘pages’ of text and graphics
on receivers equipped with the necessary
decoders. Both the BBC and Channels 3 and
4 provide subtitling for certain programmes
for people with hearing difficulties. Channel
3 and Channel 4 are required to offer
subtitling services for at least 50 per cent of
their programmes by 1998. Around 50 per
cent of households in Britain with television
have teletext sets.
Licences
The Broadcasting Act 1990 introduced a
regulatory system for licensing spare capacity
within the lines of the television signal. This
allows more varied use of the capacity—data
transfer, for instance—but the position of
teletext and subtitling on commercial
television is safeguarded.
In 1991 the ITC advertised three teletext
licences. These ten-year licences are awarded
by competitive tender, with applicants having
to satisfy certain statutory requirements
before their cash bid can be considered. The
ITC awarded the main teletext licence to
Teletext Ltd, which replaced Oracle in January
1993, and awarded one of the additional
commercial service licences on Channel 3 to
the only bidder, Data Broadcasting
International. The other additional commercial
service licence on Channel 4/S4C was
readvertised in June 1994 and awarded in
October 1994 to SimpleActive Ltd.
485
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Cable Services
Cable services are delivered to consumers
through underground cables and are paid for
by subscription. The franchising of cable
systems and the licensing of cable television
services are carried out by the Cable and
Satellite Division of the ITC, while the Radio
Authority issues cable radio licences.
‘Broadband cable’, the cable systems
currently being designed and built, can carry
between 30 and 45 television channels,
including terrestrial broadcasts, satellite
television, and channels delivered to cable
operators by video. Cable systems usually
carry a local channel.
Interactive services such as home
shopping, home banking, security and alarm
services, electronic mail and remote meter
readings are also possible. BBC Worldwide
Television (see p. 489) has provided 450 hours
of BBC programming for a BT interactive
television trial involving 2,500 customers in
the towns of Colchester and Ipswich,
beginning in August 1995. It is involved with
another ten trials around the world.
Cable franchises have already been granted
covering areas which include two-thirds of all
homes and nearly all urban areas in Britain.
By April 1995 there were 86 broadband cable
franchises in operation in Britain, 21 of which
had been set up within the previous year.
Regulation is as light as possible to encourage
the development of a wide range of services,
and flexible enough to adapt to new
technology. The ITC awards only one
broadband cable franchise in each area so that
the new franchisee is protected from direct
competition in the early stages. At present
there are nearly 4.5 million homes able to
receive broadband cable services and there
are over 964,000 subscribers.
ITC licences are required for systems
capable of serving more than 1,000 homes.
They are awarded for each area on the basis
of competitive tendering. Systems extending
beyond a single building and up to 1,000
homes require only an individual licence from
OFTEL (see p. 311). Cable investment must
be privately financed.
There are no quality controls on cable
services. However, if cable operators also
provide their own programme content as
opposed to just conveying services, they
require a programme services licence from
the ITC, which includes consumer
protection requirements.
Direct Broadcasting by Satellite
Direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS), by
which television is transmitted directly by
satellite into people’s homes, has been
available throughout Britain since 1989. The
signals from satellite broadcasting are received
through specially designed aerials or ‘dishes’.
Several British-based satellite television
channels have been set up to supply
programmes to cable operators and viewers
with dishes in Britain and, in some cases,
throughout Europe. While some offer general
entertainment, others concentrate on specific
areas of interest, such as sport, music and
children’s programmes.
Licences are granted, on a non-competitive
basis, to programme services which are likely
to meet consumer protection standards and
are run by suitably qualified people.
The largest satellite programmer is BSkyB
(British Sky Broadcasting), which provides
nine channels devoted to light entertainment, !
news, feature films, sport and home shopping l
transmitted from the Astra satellite.
Other satellite channels available to British
viewers include Eurosport (sport), CNN
(news), MTV (pop videos), and TV Asia (for
Asian viewers). The choice available to
viewers is expanding steadily.
BBC Worldwide Television (see p. 489) is
a shareholder in an entertainment satellite
channel—UK Gold—on the Astra satellite.
Programmes include drama, soaps, comedy,
children’s television and quizzes.
OTHER ASPECTS
Educational Broadcasting
Both the BBC and Channel 4 broadcast
educational programmes for schools and
Continuing Education programmes for adults.
Broadcasts to schools deal with all subjects of
the National Curriculum (see p. 435), while
programmes for adults cover many areas of
486
THE MEDIA
learning and vocational training. Books,
pamphlets, computer software, and audio and
video cassettes are produced to supplement
the programmes. Ninety-seven per cent of
primary schools and 95 per cent of secondary
schools in Britain use BBC schools television;
80 per cent of primary schools use BBC
schools radio. The ITC has a duty to ensure
that schools programmes are presented on
independent television.
During 1994 the BBC broadcast 447 hours
of radio and 660 hours of television on behalf
of the Open University (see p. 445).
Advertising and Sponsorship
The BBC may not obtain revenue or any
consideration in kind from the broadcasting
of advertisements or from commercial
sponsorship of programmes. Its policy is to
avoid giving publicity to any firm or
organised interest except when this is
necessary in providing effective and
informative programmes. It does, however,
cover sponsored sporting and artistic events.
Advertising and sponsorship are allowed
on independent television and radio subject to
controls. The ITC and the Radio Authority
operate codes of advertising standards and
programme sponsorship.
Advertisements on independent television
and radio are broadcast between programmes
as well as in breaks during programmes.
Advertisers are not allowed to influence
programme content. Advertisements must be
distinct and separate from programmes. The
time given to them must not be so great as to
detract from the value of the programmes as
a medium of information, education or
entertainment. Television advertising is
limited to an average of seven minutes an
hour during the day and seven and a half
minutes in the peak evening viewing period.
Advertising is prohibited in broadcasts of
religious services and in broadcasts to schools.
The service provided by Teletext Ltd (see
p. 485) carries advertisements.
The ITC and the Radio Authority’s codes
governing standards and practice in advertising
give regulations on the forms of advertisement
which are prohibited, alongside rules and
guidance on scheduling and creative matters.
Political advertising and advertisements for
betting (other than the National Lottery and
the football pools) are prohibited. All tobacco
advertising is banned on television and
cigarette advertisements are banned on radio.
Religious advertisements may be broadcast
on commercial radio and television, provided
they comply with the guidelines issued by the
ITC and the Radio Authority.
Both the ITC and the Radio Authority
can impose severe penalties on any television
or radio company failing to comply with
their codes.
Sponsorship in Independent Broadcasting
In Britain sponsorship is a relatively new way
of helping to finance commercial
broadcasting, although the practice has long
been established in other countries. In return
for their financial contribution, sponsors
receive a credit associating them with a
particular programme.
The ITC’s Code of Programme
Sponsorship and the Radio Authority’s
Advertising and Sponsorship Code aim to
ensure that sponsors do not exert influence
on the editorial content of programmes and
that sponsorships are made clear to viewers.
News and current affairs programmes may
not be sponsored. Potential sponsors for other
categories of programme may be debarred if
their involvement could constrain the
editorial independence of the programme
maker in any way. References to sponsors or
their products must be confined to the
beginning and end of a programme and
around commercial breaks; they must not
appear in the programme itself. All
commercial radio programmes other than
news bulletins may be sponsored.
Government Publicity
Government publicity material to support
non-political campaigns may be broadcast on
independent television and radio. This is paid
for on a normal commercial basis. The
Central Office of Information (COI) produces
short public service items, concerning health,
safety and welfare, for free transmission by
the BBC and independent television and
487
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
radio. All government advertisements and
public service information films are subtitled
via electronic text to support people with
hearing difficulties.
Broadcasting Standards
The independence enjoyed by the
broadcasting authorities carries with it
certain obligations over programme content.
Programmes must display, as far as
possible, a proper balance and wide range of
subject matter, impartiality in matters of
controversy and accuracy in news coverage,
and must not offend against good taste.
Broadcasters must also comply with
legislation relating to obscenity and
incitement to racial hatred.
The BBC, the ITC and the Radio
Authority apply codes providing guidance on
violence and standards of taste and decency
in television programmes, particularly during
hours when children are likely to be viewing.
The BBC opened its own Programme
Complaints Unit in early 1994 to investigate
serious complaints about BBC television or
radio programmes.
Broadcasting Standards Council
The Broadcasting Standards Council (BSC)
acts as a focus for public concern about the
portrayal of violence and sex, and about
standards of taste and decency. Its remit
covers television and radio programmes and
broadcast advertisements, and includes
monitoring programmes broadcast into
Britain from abroad.
The Council has statutory powers
requiring the codes of practice of the BBC
and other broadcasting regulatory bodies to
reflect the BSC’s own code. The BSC
monitors programmes, examines complaints
from the public and undertakes research. In
1994-95 a total of 2,032 complaints falling
within the Council’s remit were received. Of
these, 303 were upheld in full or in part.
Broadcasting Complaints Commission
The Broadcasting Complaints Commission,
an independent statutory body, deals with
complaints of unfair treatment in broadcast
programmes and of unwarranted infringement
of privacy in programmes or in their
preparation. In 1994-95 the Commission
received 1,135 complaints of unfair or unjust
treatment in broadcast programmes.
The White Paper on the future of the BBC
(see p. 481) proposed that the Broadcasting
Standards Council and the Broadcasting
Complaints Commission be merged in order
to simplify the system of broadcasting
regulation. Detailed proposals for a merger,
requiring legislation, are being developed by
the Department of National Heritage.
Parliamentary and Political
Broadcasting
The proceedings of both Houses of Parliament
may be broadcast on television and radio, either
live, or more usually in recorded and edited
form on news and current affairs programmes.
The BBC and the commercial services
provide time on radio and television for an
annual series of party political broadcasts.
Party election broadcasts are arranged
•following the announcement of a general
election. In addition, the Government may
make ministerial broadcasts on radio and
television, with opposition parties also being
allotted broadcast time.
Audience Research
Both the BBC and the independent sector are
required to keep themselves informed on the
state of public opinion about the programmes
and advertising that they broadcast. This is
done through the continuous measurement of
the size and composition of audiences and
their opinions of programmes. For television,
this work is undertaken through BARB (the
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board),
owned jointly by the BBC and the ITV
Network Centre. For radio, joint research is
undertaken for BBC radio and for
commercial radio by RAJAR (Radio Joint
Audience Research).
Both the BBC and the independent
sector conduct regular surveys of audience
opinion on television and radio services.
Public opinion is further assessed by the
488
THE MEDIA
BBC and ITC through the work of their
advisory committees, councils and panels.
Regular public meetings are also held to
debate services, and consideration is given
to letters and telephone calls from listeners
and viewers.
Training
All ITV (Channel 3) licensees are obliged to
provide training. Channel 4 also provides a
range of training for staff and for the
independent production sector.
The BBC Centre for Broadcast Skills
Training (part of BBC Resources) operates on
a commercial basis and provides a full
programme of courses on all technical aspects
of broadcasting, including craft skills.
Courses can be mounted specially to meet
particular requirements.
In addition BBC World Service Training
runs courses for radio and television
broadcasters and their managers from all over
the world. The department is working with
some 25 countries in Eastern Europe, the
Arabic-speaking world, Asia and Africa.
Courses and training programmes are tailor-
made and carried out both in Britain and in
the countries concerned.
The Government finances overseas
students on broadcasting training courses at
the BBC, the British Council and the
Thomson Foundation; the Foundation also
conducts courses overseas in broadcast
journalism, media management, radio and
television production, and technology.
INTERNATIONAL SERVICES
The BBC
In May 1994 the Corporation announced a new
organisational structure—BBC Worldwide—for
the development of its international and
commercial strategy. It focuses the activities
into three separate divisions—BBC World
Service, BBC Worldwide Television and BBC
Worldwide Publishing—operating across six
distinct regions of the world: Europe, the
Americas, Africa and the Middle East, South
Asia, Asia-Pacific, and the former Soviet
Union and South West Asia.
BBC World Service
BBC World Service broadcasts by radio in
English and 40 other languages worldwide,
and also produces the television news
programming for BBC Worldwide Television
(see below). It has a measured global
audience of 133 million regular listeners. The
core programming of news, current affairs,
business and sports reports is complemented
by a wide range of cultural programmes,
including drama, literature and music.
BBC World Service programmes in English
and many other languages are made available
by satellite for rebroadcasting by agreement
with local or national radio stations, networks
and cable operators. BBC World Service Radio
International sells recorded programmes to
other broadcasters in over 100 countries.
BBC English specialises in teaching the
English language on radio and television, and
through associated publications, audio and
video cassettes, reaching audiences in more
than 120 countries.
BBC MPM—Marshall Plan of the Mind—
was set up in 1992 to provide a range of
business, economic and associated political
programmes to the countries of the former
Soviet Union. It is mainly funded by the
British Government’s Know How Fund
(see p. 124).
BBC Monitoring, the international media
monitoring arm of BBC World Service,
provides transcripts of radio and television
broadcasts from over 140 countries. As well
as providing a vital source of information to
the BBC, this service is also used by other
media organisations, government
departments, the commercial sector and
academic institutions.
BBC Worldwide Television
BBC Worldwide Television was created in
May 1994 by the merger of the television
activity of BBC Enterprises and the channel
businesses of BBC World Service Television.
BBC Worldwide Television has two major
areas of operation:
• Programme Licensing to international
broadcasters and the generation of
co-production business; and
489
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• Channel Activity, led by the development
of BBC branded satellite and cable
channels around the world.
In 1994-95 BBC Worldwide
Television licensed more than 14,500
hours of programming to over 80
countries around the world, making
the BBC Europe’s largest exporter of
television programmes. It also invests
in programming; in 1994-95 a total of
111 co-production agreements were
made with broadcasting organisations
in 14 countries.
The BBC and Pearson pic have
established a strategic global alliance
under which joint venture companies
will distribute a range of BBC
branded channels.
BBC World, the BBC’s 24-hour
international news and information channel,
is available to more than 40 million homes
across Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe
and the Middle East.
BBC Prime, a 24-hour entertainment
channel, is broadcast to three million
subscribers across continental Europe. It is
marketed and distributed by a joint venture
company, European Channel Management,
which is owned by the BBC, Thames
Television (wholly owned by Pearson pic)
and Cox Communications.
BBC Arabic Television, an Arabic
language news and information channel, is
produced at Television Centre in London
and supplied to Orbit, a subscription-funded
network broadcasting throughout the Middle
East and North Africa.
BBC Worldwide Publishing
BBC Worldwide Publishing produces a wide
range of books, spoken word audio tapes,
videos, magazines and language learning
materials linked to BBC programme output,
which are marketed and distributed
internationally. It also handles the licensing
of BBC properties and brands for all forms of
merchandising. From 1996 the multimedia
division will be marketing CD-ROMs and
on-line services.
COI Overseas Radio and Television
Services
The Central Office of Information, which
provides publicity material and other
information services on behalf of government
departments and other public agencies,
produces radio programmes for overseas.
Recorded material is sent to radio stations
all over the world. COI television services
also distribute material such as documentary
and magazine programmes, commissioned
and purchased by the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office, or acquired from
television broadcasters.
News Agencies
WTN (Worldwide Television News),
owned bv ITN, ABC (the American
Broadcasting Corporation) and Channel 9 in
Australia, supplies news and a wide range of
television services to about 1,000 broadcasters
in over 90 countries, as well as to
governments and international corporations.
It also produces British Satellite News, an
international satellite news service, for the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office. The
service, under FCO editorial control,
transmits programmes five days a week.
These are distributed, mainly by satellite, free
to television stations throughout Eastern
Europe, the Middle East and Southern Africa
for use in news bulletins. WTN provides
services through the Eurovision network (see
below) and by satellite.

International Relations
European Agreements
Britain has implemented two important
European agreements on cross-border
broadcasting: the European Community
Directive on Broadcasting and the Council
of Europe Convention on Transfrontier
Television. Under these, countries have to
remove restrictions on the retransmission of
programmes originating from other
participating countries. They must also

ensure that their own broadcasters observe
certain minimum standards on advertising,
sponsorship, taste and decency and the
portrayal of sex and violence on television.
European Broadcasting Union
The BBC and the Radio Authority are
members of the European Broadcasting
Union, which manages Eurovision, the
international network of television news and
programme exchange. The Union is
responsible for co-ordinating the exchange of
programmes and news over the Eurovision
network and intercontinental satellite links. It
also maintains a technical monitoring station
where frequency measurements and other
observations on broadcasting stations are
carried out. The Union provides a forum
linking the major public services and
national broadcasters of Western Europe and
other parts of the world, and co-ordinates
joint operations in radio and television.
International Telecommunications Union
The BBC takes part in the work of the
International Telecommunications Union, the
United Nations agency responsible for
regulating and controlling all international
telecommunications services, including radio
and television. The Union also allocates and
registers all radio frequencies, and promotes
and co-ordinates the international study of
technical problems in broadcasting.
Other International Bodies
The BBC is an associate member of the
Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union and also
belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting
Association, which meets every two years to
discuss public service broadcasting issues.
TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
The introduction of computer-based
digital production equipment for both
television and radio is one of the most
significant technical advances in recent years
affecting the broadcasting industry in
Britain. It allows programmes to be made
more quickly and more effectively, with
the sound and vision information being
held and manipulated on computer disc
storage units. A significant proportion of
programmes produced by the BBC and
independent companies is edited on this
type of equipment.
Other recent advances include:
• the introduction of ‘all-digital’ studios
(including digital video recorders and
control desks) at both the BBC and
independent companies;
• the introduction of digital transmission
links, mainly based on optical fibre
technology, between studios and from
studios to the transmitters;
• the use of miniature cameras and
transmitters;
• the increased use of remote controlled
cameras in studios and at remote
locations; and
• an increasing use by radio broadcasters
of digital sound links using ‘dial-up’
ISDN lines.
The BBC and the ITC also undertake
long-term research into broadcast technology.
The key topics under investigation include:
• digital television transmission;
• the transmission of digital radio
broadcasting from terrestrial transmitters
and by satellite;
• digital widescreen and high definition
television (HDTV), and its associated
surround sound;
• audio descriptive systems for delivering
additional television sound channels that
can be used to describe the programme
for people with impaired sight; and
• realistic computer-generated 3D ‘virtual’
sets for television production.
Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting
In August 1995 the Government published a
policy document on digital terrestrial
television and radio in Britain (see Further
Reading, p. 501). Its main proposals include:
491
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• six frequency channels (‘multiplexes’) for
digital terrestrial television would be
available initially, each able to carry at
least three television channels, with
potential coverage ranging from 60 to
over 90 per cent of the population; and
• seven radio frequency channels, each
with capacity to offer at least six digital
stereo programme services (one of these
has already been allocated to the BBC for
its national services and another will be
allocated for independent national radio).
In addition:
• the ITC and the Radio Authority would
be responsible for awarding licences to
operate multiplexes;
• existing national television and radio
broadcasters, including the Channel 3
and Channel 5 licence holders, would be
offered a guaranteed place on a
multiplex; and
• ownership regulations for digital
terrestrial television and radio would be
broadly in line with those for analogue.
However, in recognition of the
potentially larger number of television
channels available, companies would be
able to control any number of digital
terrestrial television licences subject to a
ceiling of 25 per cent of the available
digital terrestrial capacity (provided they
remain within a limit of 15 per cent share
of total television audience).
The Press
More daily newspapers, national and regional,
are sold for every person in Britain than in
most other developed countries. On an
average day 60 per cent of people over the
age of 15 read a national morning newspaper;
about 70 per cent read a Sunday newspaper.
National papers have an average total
circulation of over 14 million on weekdays
and about 16 million on Sundays, although
the total readership is considerably greater.
Men are more likely to read newspapers than
women, and more people in the 45-64 age
group read a daily newspaper than in any
other age group.
There are about 1,400 regional and
local newspaper titles and over 7,700
periodical publications.
Several newspapers have had very long
and distinguished histories. The Observer,
for example, first published in 1791, is the
oldest national Sunday newspaper in the
world, and The Times, Britain’s oldest
daily national newspaper, began publication
in 1785. The weekly Berrom’s Worcester
Journal, established in 1690, claims to
be the world’s oldest newspaper in
continuous circulation.
The press caters for a range of political
views, interests and levels of education.
Newspapers are almost always financially
independent of any political party. Where
they express pronounced views and show
obvious political leanings in their editorial
comments, these derive from proprietorial
and other non-party influences.
Nevertheless, during General Election
campaigns many newspapers recommend
their readers to vote for a particular political
party. Even newspapers which adopt strong
political views in their editorial columns
include feature and other types of articles
by authors of different political persuasions.
In order to preserve their character
and traditions, some newspapers and
periodicals are governed by trustee-type
arrangements. Others have management
arrangements that ensure their editors’
authority and independence.
In recent years working practices
throughout the newspaper industry have
undergone major changes in response to the
challenges posed by computer-based
technology and the need to contain costs.
Newsprint, about three-quarters of which is
imported, forms about a quarter of average
national newspaper costs; labour represents
over half. In addition to sales, many
newspapers and periodicals earn
considerable amounts from their
advertising. Total yearly spending of around
£5,600 million on press advertising makes
the press by far the largest advertising
medium in Britain. Unlike most of its
European counterparts the British press
receives no subsidies and relatively few tax
and postal concessions.
492
THE MEDIA
New Printing Technology
Publishers have been able to reduce production
costs in recent years by using advanced
computer systems for editing and production
processes. The ‘single keying’ system, for
example, allows journalists and advertising
staff to input copy directly into a computer
terminal, and then to transfer it electronically
into columns of type. Many newspapers
arrange page layouts on screen and output
full pages to photographic paper bromides or
film which are then used to make plates for
the printing press. A number of newspapers
still output columns in bromide format from
the computerised typesetting operation; these
are then pasted up into pages before being
sent to the camera room for negatives to be
produced from which the plates are made.
News International, publisher of three daily
and two Sunday papers, has at its London
Docklands headquarters more than 500
computer terminals, one of the largest systems
installed at one time anywhere in the world.
The Financial Times runs its printing plant in
Docklands with about 170 production workers,
compared with the 600 formerly employed in
the City of London. Associated Newspapers, at
its Docklands plant, is the only newspaper
company to use flexography, an advanced
printing process. Most other newspapers print
by offset lithography, a method whereby the
printed image is transferred, or offset, from the
printing plate to a rubber blanket (cylinder) and
then on to the paper. A number of the national
newspapers print their regional and northern
editions on regional newspaper presses.
There has been a tendency within Britain’s
regional and local press in recent years for
weekly newspapers to close ageing press
plants and contract out the printing of their
titles to larger groups. Many of these groups
have invested heavily in state-of-the-art full
colour printing plants to meet their own
requirements and those of a growing number
of contract customers.
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL TITLES
Ownership of the national, London and
regional daily newspapers lies in the hands of
a number of large press publishing groups.
Although most enterprises are organised as
limited liability companies, individual and
partner proprietorship survives. The large
national newspaper and periodical
publishers are major corporations; many are
involved in the whole field of publishing
and communications.
The National Press
The national press consists of 11 morning
daily papers and nine Sunday papers (see
Table 29.1). Formerly they were produced in
or near Fleet Street in central London with,
in some cases, northern editions being
printed in Manchester. All the national
papers have now moved their editorial and
printing facilities to other parts of London or
away from the capital altogether; some use
contract printing. The Independent, for
example, is printed in Bradford,
Northampton and Portsmouth. Scottish
editions of the Sun, Today, the News of the
World and the Sunday Times (Scottish
Section) are printed in Glasgow.
In order to improve distribution and sales
overseas, editions of the Financial Times are
printed in Frankfurt, Roubaix (northern
France), New Jersey and Tokyo, while the
Guardian prints an international edition in
Frankfurt. The European, a weekly English-
language international newspaper, is printed
in Britain, France, Germany and Hungary.
National newspapers are often described as
either ‘quality’, ‘popular’ or ‘mid-market’
papers on the basis of differences in style and
content. Five dailies and four Sundays are
usually described as ‘quality’ newspapers,
which are directed at readers who want full
information on a wide range of public matters.
Popular newspapers appeal to people wanting
news of a more entertaining character,
presented more concisely. ‘Mid-market’
publications cover the intermediate market.
Quality papers are normally broadsheet
(large-sheet) in format and mid-market and
popular papers tabloid (small-sheet).
Many newspapers are printed in colour and
most produce colour supplements as part of
the Saturday or Sunday paper, with articles on
travel, food and wine, and other leisure topics.

There is a growing market for news and
information in the electronic media, and
quality papers such as the Financial Times
and the Daily Telegraph provide material for
use on databases and videotext services.
Regional Newspapers
There are about 100 daily (Monday to
Saturday) and Sunday newspapers, and about
1,300 weekly paid-for and free newspapers
(not including business, sporting and religious
newspapers). It is estimated that 88 per cent
of adults read a regional or local newspaper.
England
Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post
(Leeds), the Northern Echo (Darlington) and
the Eastern Daily Press (Norwich), each has a
circulation of approximately 78,000, and two
provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Mercury
(Birmingham) and the Sunday Sun (Newcastle
upon Tyne)—sell 146,500 and 127,700 copies
respectively. Circulation figures of evening
papers start at about 10,000 and most are in
the 20,000 to 100,000 range. Those with much
larger sales include the Manchester Evening
News (194,000), Wolverhampton’s Express and
Star (210,000) and the Birmingham Evening
Mail (201,000). Paid-for weekly papers have a
mainly local appeal and most have circulations
in the 5,000 to 60,000 range.
London has one paid-for evening paper,
the Evening Standard, with a circulation of
462,000. It covers national and international
news as well as local affairs. A number of
evening papers are published in the outer
metropolitan area. Local weeklies include
papers for every district in Greater London,
which are often different local editions of one
centrally published paper.
Wales
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the
Western Mail, with a circulation of 64,600, and
Wales on Sunday, with a circulation of 61,000.
Both are published in Cardiff. Evening papers
published in Wales are the South Wales Echo,
THE MEDIA
Cardiff; the South Wales Argus, Newport; the
South Wales Evening Post, Swansea; and the
Evening Leader, Wrexham. Circulations range
from 32,000 to 80,000. North Wales is also
served by the Daily Post, published in
Liverpool, and the Liverpool Echo.
The weekly press (83 publications)
includes English-language papers, some of
which carry articles in Welsh; bilingual
papers; and Welsh-language papers. Welsh
community newspapers receive an annual
grant as part of the Government’s wider
financial support for the Welsh language.
Scotland
The daily morning papers, with circulations
of between 8,500 and 750,000, are The

papers have circulations in the range of
20,000 to 140,000 and include the Edinburgh
Evening News, Glasgow’s Evening Times,
Dundee’s Evening Telegraph, Aberdeen’s
Evening Express and the Greenock Telegraph.
Local weekly newspapers number about 140.
The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail,
the Sunday Post and a quality broadsheet
paper, Scotland on Sunday. The national
Sunday Express has a Scottish edition (printed
in Manchester) and the Observer and the
Sunday Times carry Scottish supplements.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has two morning
newspapers, one evening and two Sunday

Telegraph, Sunday Life and Sunday World
(Northern Ireland edition).
There are about 50 weeklies. Newspapers
from the Irish Republic, as well as the
British national press, are widely read in
Northern Ireland.
495
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Free Distribution Newspapers
About 800 free distribution newspapers,
mostly weekly and financed by advertising,
are published in Britain; over half are
produced by established newspaper
publishers. They have enjoyed rapid growth
in recent years and now have an estimated
total weekly circulation of about 33 million.
Ethnic Minority Publications
Many newspapers and magazines in Britain
are produced by members of ethnic
minorities. Most are published weekly,
fortnightly or monthly. A Chinese newspaper,
Sing Tao, the Urdu Daily Jang (see below)
and the Arabic Al-Arab, however, are dailies.
Afro-Caribbean newspapers include the
Gleaner and West Indian Digest. The Voice
and Caribbean Times, both weeklies, are
aimed at the black population in general. The
Weekly Journal, the first ‘quality’ broadsheet
aimed at Britain’s black community, was
launched in 1992.
The Asian Times is an English language
weekly for people of Asian descent; the Sikh
Courier is produced quarterly. Examples of
ethnic language newspapers include the Urdu
Daily Jang, an offshoot of the largest circulation
paper in Pakistan, and the weeklies Garavi
Gujarat and Gujarat Samachar. Publications
also appear in Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi. The
fortnightly Asian Trader and Asian Business are
both successful ethnic business publications,
while Cine blitz International targets those
interested in the Asian film industry.
Many provincial papers print special
editions for their local populations. The
Leicester Mercury, for example, publishes a
daily Asian edition, incorporating news from
the South Asian sub-continent.
THE PERIODICAL PRESS
The 7,700 periodical publications are
classified as ‘consumer general interest’,
‘special interest’ and ‘business-to-business’.
There are also several hundred ‘house
magazines’ produced by businesses or public
services for their employees and/or clients.
Directories and similar publications number
more than 2,000. The ‘alternative’ press
comprises a large number of titles, many of
them devoted to radical politics, community
matters, religion, the occult, science or ecology.
Consumer general and specialist periodicals
comprise magazines for a wide range of
interests. These include women’s magazines;
publications for children; religious periodicals;
fiction magazines; magazines dealing with
sport, motoring, gardening, youth interests
and music; humour; retirement; and computer
magazines. Learned societies, trade unions,
regiments, universities and other organisations
also produce publications.
Weekly periodicals with the highest sales
are those which carry full details of the
forthcoming week’s television and radio
programmes, including the satellite schedules
What 5 on TV has a circulation figure of over
1.6 million, followed by the Radio Times with
1.4 million and TV Times with 1 million.
Woman's Weekly, Woman's Own, Woman,
Weekly News (which sells mainly in
Scotland), Woman’s Realm and My Weekly
have circulations in the 293,000 to 790,000
range. In recent years several women’s
magazines owned by overseas publishing
houses have achieved large circulations: Puma
and Best, for instance, each sell over 550,000
copies, while Bella and Hello! are also widely
read. There is a growing market for men’s
general interest magazines—for example,
GQ,, Esquire and Loaded, with circulations
ranging from about 92,000 to 115,000. Focus
and Arena are also popular titles.
Smash Hits, with a circulation of 275,000,
is a fortnightly magazine dealing with pop
music and teenage lifestyles. Viz, a cartoon
comic aimed at young adults, sells 558,000
copies. Of monthly magazines, Reader’s Digest
has the highest circulation (1.7 million).
The leading journals of opinion include
The Economist, an independent conservative
publication covering a wide range of topics.
New Statesman and Society reviews social
issues, politics, literature and the arts from an
independent socialist point of view, and the
Spectator covers similar subjects from an
independent conservative standpoint.
New Scientist reports on science and
technology in terms that the non-specialist
reader can understand. Private Eye, a satirical
496
THE MEDIA
fortnightly, also covers public affairs. Weekly
‘listings’ magazines, such as Time Out,
provide details of cultural and other events in
London and other large cities.
Literary and political journals, and those
specialising in international and Commonwealth
affairs, appear monthly or quarterly, and
generally appeal to a more academic
readership. Many of the business, scientific
and professional journals, whose publication
ranges from twice weekly to quarterly, have a
considerable circulation overseas.
NEWS AGENCIES
The principal news agencies in Britain are
Reuters, based in London, the Press Association
and FT Extel/AFP-Extel News Ltd.

features is not as common in Britain as in
some countries, but a few agencies specialise
in this type of work.
PRESS INSTITUTIONS
Trade associations include the Newspaper
Publishers Association, whose members
publish national newspapers, and the
Newspaper Society, which represents regional
and local newspapers in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The Scottish Daily
Newspaper Society represents the interests of
daily and Sunday newspapers in Scotland;
the Scottish Newspaper Publishers’
Association acts on behalf of the owners of
weekly newspapers in Scotland; and
Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers is
made up of proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland. The membership of the
Periodical Publishers Association includes
most independent publishers of business,
professional and consumer journals.
Organisations representing journalists are
the National Union of Journalists, with
around 25,000 members, and the Chartered
Institute of Journalists, with about 1,500
members. The main printing union is the
Graphical, Paper and Media Union, with a
membership of around 270,000.
The Foreign Press Association was formed
in 1888 to help the correspondents of
overseas newspapers in their work by
arranging press conferences, tours, briefings,
and other services and facilities.
The Guild of Editors is the officially
recognised professional body for newspaper
editors and their equivalents in radio and
television. It has approximately 420 members
and exists to defend press freedom and to
promote high editorial standards. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is
the professional organisation for editors of
house journals. The Association of British
Editors represents the whole range of
media, including radio, television, newspapers
and magazines.
TRAINING AND EDUCATION
The National Council for the Training of
Journalists (NCTJ), which represents many
regional newspaper publishers, sets and
conducts examinations, and organises short
training courses for journalists.
The two main methods of entry into
newspaper journalism are selection for NC1J
pre-entry courses at a college of further or
higher education or direct recruitment by a
regional or local newspaper. Both types of
entrant take part in ‘on-the-job’ training.
Similar courses exist for press photographers.
The first undergraduate courses in
journalism in Britain started in 1991 at City
University, London, at the University of
Central Lancashire and at the London
College of Printing, which also provides GCE
(General Certificate of Education) Advanced
(A) level courses in journalism. Postgraduate
courses in journalism are available at the
University of Wales, Cardiff; City University,
London; the London College of Printing;
Strathclyde University/Glasgow Caledonian
University; and the Universities of Central
Lancashire and Bournemouth.
Courses for regional newspapers in such
subjects as newspaper sales, advertising, and
management are provided by the Newspaper
Society’s training service. Some newspaper
publishers carry out journalist training
independently of the NCTJ, awarding their
own certificates or diplomas. National
Vocational Qualifications (see p. 442) are now
available in newspaper journalism.
Specialist training courses for journalists
and broadcasters from developing countries
and from Eastern Europe are offered by the
Thomson Foundation in Cardiff. The
Foundation runs training courses overseas
and provides consultants to assist newspapers
and news agencies in editorial advertising as
well as broadcast management.
Newspapers in Education, a worldwide
scheme using newspapers to improve
standards of literacy among young people, is
run in Britain by the Newspaper Society.
The scheme involves using newspapers in
schools for teaching a wide range of subjects
at all levels of education. The scheme has
over 600 projects operated by regional
newspapers in partnership with local schools.
Through its charitable trust—the Reuter
Foundation—Reuters offers assistance to
overseas journalists to study and train in
498
THE MEDIA
Britain and other parts of the world. The
Foundation awards fellowships to overseas
journalists to spend up to one year at Oxford
University. It also runs shorter practical
training programmes in London for
journalists from the former communist
countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
The Periodicals Training Council is the
official training organisation in periodical
publishing. It offers a range of short courses
covering management, editorial work,
advertisement sales and circulation sales. It
has special responsibility for editorial training
and administers an editorial training scheme
for those already in employment.
PRESS CONDUCT AND LAW
The Press Complaints Commission
The Press Complaints Commission, a non-
statutory body, was established in 1991
following recommendations in a report on
privacy and related matters by a
government-appointed independent
committee. The Commission was set up by
the newspaper and periodical industry in a
final attempt to make self-regulation of the
press work properly. It is funded by
PRESSBOF (the Press Standards Board of
Finance), which co-ordinates and promotes
self-regulation within the industry. These
measures were prompted by growing criticism
of press standards, with allegations of
unjustified invasion of privacy and inaccurate
and biased reporting, among other abuses,
resulting in calls for government regulation of
the press.
In its White Paper {Privacy and Media
Intrusion: The Government's Response)
published in July 1995, the
Government rejected proposals for
statutory regulation of the press, and
for legislation to give protection to
privacy. Instead, it endorsed self¬
regulation under the Commission,
and recommended further measures
to make self-regulation more effective.
The Commission’s membership is drawn
from newspaper and magazine editors and
from people outside the industry. It deals
with complaints by members of the public
about the contents and conduct of
newspapers and magazines, and advises
editors and journalists. It operates a code of
practice agreed by editors governing respect
for privacy, opportunity to reply, corrections,
journalists’ behaviour, references to race and
religion, payments to criminals for articles,
protection of confidential sources and other
matters. The Commission publishes regular
reports of its findings.
The industry and the Press Complaints
Commission have reinforced voluntary
regulation through, for example:
• measures to increase the number of
independent members of the Commission
to ensure a lay majority;
• a strengthening of the code of practice,
and the incorporation of the code into
the contracts of employment of most
editors and journalists;
• the setting up of a helpline service for
members of the public who fear the code
of practice has been, or is about to be,
breached; and
• the appointment of a Privacy
Commissioner with special powers to
investigate complaints about privacy.
The Press and the Law
There is no state control or censorship of the
newspaper and periodical press, and
newspaper proprietors, editors and
journalists are subject to the law in the
same way as any other citizen. However,
certain statutes include sections which apply
to the press.
There are laws governing:
• the extent of newspaper ownership in
television and radio companies (see
p. 501);
• the transfer of newspaper assets; and
• the right of press representatives to be
supplied with agenda and reports for
meetings of local authorities and
reasonable facilities for taking notes and
telephoning reports.
499
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There is a legal requirement to reproduce
‘the printer’s imprint’ (the printer’s name and
address) on all publications, including
newspapers. Publishers are legally obliged to
deposit copies of newspapers and other
publications at the British Library (see
p. 476).
Publication of advertisements is governed
by wide-ranging legislation, including public
health, financial services and fraud legislation.
Legal restrictions are imposed on certain
types of prize competition; copyrights come
under various copyright laws.
Laws on contempt of court, official secrets
and defamation are also relevant to the press.
A newspaper may not publish comments on
the conduct of judicial proceedings which are
likely to prejudice the reputation of the
courts for fairness before or during the actual
proceedings, nor may it publish before or
during a trial anything which might influence
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and
publication of official information in such
areas as defence and international relations,
where such unauthorised disclosure would be
harmful, are offences under the Official
Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989. However, these
are restrictions on publication—that is, on
dissemination to the public by any means—
not just through the printed press.
Most legal proceedings against the press are
libel actions brought by private individuals.
Defence Advisory Notices
Government officials and representatives of
the media form the Defence, Press and
Broadcasting Advisory Committee, which has
agreed that in some circumstances the
publication of certain categories of
information might endanger national security.
Details of these categories are contained in
Defence Advisory Notices (DA Notices)
circulated to the media, whose members are
asked to seek advice from the Secretary of
the Committee, a retired senior military
officer, before publishing information in these
areas. Compliance with any advice offered by
the Secretary is expected but there is no legal
force behind it and the final decision on
whether to publish rests with the editor,
producer or publisher concerned.
The Notices were published for the first
time in July 1993 to promote a better
understanding of the system and to
contribute to greater openness in government.
Advertising Practice
Advertising in all non-broadcast media, such
as newspapers, magazines, posters, sales
promotions, cinema and direct mail, is
regulated by the Advertising Standards
Authority, an independent body funded by a
levy on display advertising expenditure. The
Authority aims to promote and enforce the
highest standards of advertising in the
interests of the public through its supervision
of the British Codes of Advertising and
Sales Promotion.
The Codes’ basic principles are to ensure
that advertisements:
• are legal, decent, honest and truthful;
• are prepared with a sense of
responsibility to the consumer and
society; and
• conform to the principles of fair
competition as generally accepted in
business.
The Authority monitors advertisements to
ensure their compliance with the Codes and
investigates any complaints received.
The advertising industry has agreed to
abide by the Codes and to support them
with effective sanctions. Free and
confidential pre-publication advice is
offered to assist publishers, agencies and
advertisers. The Authority’s main sanction
is to recommend that advertisements
considered to be in breach of the Code
should not be published. This is normally
sufficient to ensure that an advertisement is
withdrawn or amended. The Authority also
publishes monthly reports on the results of
its investigations.
The Authority is recognised by the Office
of Fair Trading as the established means of
controlling non-broadcast advertising. It can
refer misleading advertisements to the
Director General of Fair Trading, who has
the power to seek an injunction to prevent
their publication.
500
THE MEDIA
Media Ownership
Existing Rules
The Broadcasting Act 1990 established rules
designed to enable the ITC and Radio
Authority to keep ownership of the
broadcasting media widely spread and to
prevent undue concentrations of single and
cross-media ownership. Ownership of
broadcasters by companies based outside the
European Union is largely prohibited.
Newspapers are allowed relatively small
stakes in Channels 3 (and 5), and national
and local radio, but are not restricted in
non-domestic satellite broadcasters. Public
telecommunications operators are not
allowed to have controlling interests in any
Channel 3, Channel 5, national radio or
domestic satellite licence; and political
bodies and local authorities are barred from
holding licences.
Following a limited relaxation of the ITV
(independent television) ownership rules at
the beginning of 1994, a company may hold
any two regional licences (except in London),
a 20 per cent stake in a third company, and
5 per cent in any further licences. A local
newspaper can own a local radio station if the
station does not serve an area overlapping
that served by the newspaper.
Government consent is needed to transfer
a newspaper or newspaper assets to a
proprietor whose newspapers have an average
daily circulation amounting, with that of the
newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or
more copies. Except in certain limited cases,
consent may be given only after the President
of the Board of Trade has referred the matter
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
and received its report.
Policy Document
Following a review of media ownership
regulation, the Government issued a policy
document in May 1995. This concludes:
• that there is a continuing case for specific
regulations governing media ownership,
beyond those which are applied by the
general competition law; but
• that there is a need to liberalise the
existing ownership regulations both
within and across different media sectors.
The Government intends to enact
legislation which would, among other things:
• allow newspaper groups with less than
20 per cent of national newspaper
circulation to apply to control television
broadcasters constituting up to 15 per
cent of the total television market;
• give an independent regulator the power
to disallow such control when it is not in
the public interest; and
• prevent the development of local media
monopolies by disallowing newspaper
groups from controlling any regional
Channel 3 or local radio licence in areas
where the newspaper group has more
than 30 per cent of regional or local
newspaper circulation.

A to Z of Popular Sports 513
Over 100 British sportsmen and women currently hold world championship
titles in sports ranging from athletics to windsurfing. The most popular
participation sports include swimming, cycling and keep fit/yoga. More
than half the population of Britain regularly takes part in some form of
sporting activity.
PARTICIPATION
Improvements in facilities and growing
awareness of the importance of regular
exercise for good health have contributed to
increasing levels of participation in sport.
It is estimated that 29 million people over
the age of 16 regularly take part in sport or
exercise. The 1993 General Household Survey
found that almost two-thirds of those
interviewed had taken part in at least one
sporting activity during the previous four
weeks. The most popular participation sports
or activities are walking (including rambling
and hiking), swimming, snooker/pool, keep
fit/yoga and cycling.
Men were more likely than women to have
participated in a sporting activity, with 72 per
cent of men claiming to have taken part in at
least one sport during the previous four
weeks compared with 57 per cent of women.
Sport: Raising the Game
The Government aims to encourage
greater participation in sport from an early
age. In July 1995 it published a policy
statement on sport—Sport: Raising the
Game—which sets out its proposals for
providing the highest standards of sporting
provision and facilities from grass roots
through to international level. The main
proposals include:
• increased investment in coaching schemes
for teachers with the opportunity for
them to acquire coaching qualifications;
• a further £1 million to be provided by
the Sports Councils (see p. 505) for
coaching opportunities via the National
Coaching Foundation (see p. 506) and
the governing bodies of sport;
• a new £2 million challenge fund for
promoting links between schools and
clubs;
• the setting up of a working group to
advise on increasing sports scholarships
in higher education; and
• the establishment of a British Academy
of Sport as the focal point of a national
network of centres of excellence.
502
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
The Government envisages that the
Academy would be funded by the National
Lottery (see p. 512) and would offer a wide
range of services and facilities for sportsmen
and women and their coaches. These would
include sports medicine and science services
and financial support for individual athletes
in the form of scholarships. The proposals
are to be developed by the Sports Council.
A parallel paper—Scotland's Sporting
Future: A New Start—tailored to the specific
needs and circumstances in Scotland was also
launched in July 1995.
I Women and Sport
Efforts to narrow the gap between men’s and
women’s participation in sporting activities
have resulted in an increase in the number of
women taking part in sport. This includes
traditionally male dominated sports, such as
football, rugby and snooker. Emphasis has
now switched to encouraging women to adopt
leadership roles—as coaches, officials and
administrators, for example. Projects to
promote coaching opportunities have been
established by the Sports Councils in
partnership with the National Coaching
Foundation and the Women’s Sports
Foundation (WSF).
The WSF is a voluntary organisation
promoting the interests of women and girls in
sport and active recreation. With Sports
Council funding, the WSF encourages the
establishment of women’s sports groups
throughout Britain and organises a wide
range of events and activities. It runs both
the Sportswomen of the Year Awards and
an annual nationwide awards scheme for
girls and young women between the ages of
11 and 19.
Sport for People with Disabilities
The governing bodies of sport are
increasingly taking responsibility for people
with disabilities. Close liaison takes place
with the Sports Council, which provides
advice to governing bodies on encouraging
the integration of people with disabilities.
The key organisations for people with
disabilities are the British Sports Association
for the Disabled (BSAD), the United
Kingdom Sports Association for People with
Learning Disability (UKSAPLD), the British
Paralympic Association (BPA—see p. 506)
and a range of bodies concerned with
individual disabilities and single sports. These
include the Riding for the Disabled Association,
which caters for some 25,000 riders.
The BSAD is a national body working
across all the disabilities. It organises regional
and national championships in a wide range
of sports and also runs training courses,
coaching courses and development days. The
Scottish and the Welsh Sports Associations for
the Disabled and Disability Action (Northern
Ireland) have similar co-ordinating roles.
The UKSAPLD is a co-ordinating body
with a membership of over 20 national
organisations. It promotes and develops
opportunities in sport and recreation for
people with learning disability throughout
Britain. It is also responsible, in partnership
with the BPA, for the training and preparation
of the Great Britain team in the Paralympics.
There are five national disability sports
organisations concerned with individual
disabilities. These organisations provide
coaching and help to organise national
competitions in conjunction with the national
governing bodies of sport and the BSAD.
They comprise:
• the British Amputee and Les Autres
Sports Association;
• British Blind Sport;
• the British Deaf Sports Council;
• the British Wheelchair Sports
Foundation; and
• Cerebral Palsy Sport.
Young People
Special programmes of activity for young
people are run by the governing bodies of
individual sports. In addition, the four
Sports Councils (see p. 505) help to
organise local and national initiatives to
encourage more young people to take part
in sport. Young people also have the
opportunity to take part in a wide variety of
sports in school (see p. 504).
503
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SPORT IN SCHOOLS
All schools (except those solely for infants)
are expected to have a playing field or the use
of one, and most secondary schools have a
gymnasium. Some have other amenities, such
as swimming pools, sports halls and halls
designed for dance and movement.
National Curriculum
The Government believes that all young
children should have the opportunity to learn
basic sports skills. It has therefore made
physical education (PE), which includes sport,
a compulsory subject in the National
Curriculum (see p. 435) for all pupils aged
5 to 16 in state-maintained schools in
England and Wales.
A revised National Curriculum introduced
in August 1995 places a greater emphasis on
traditional team games and competitive
sports. The Curriculum also states that all
pupils should be able to swim at least 25
metres by the age of 11.
In Scotland the Secretary of State for
Scotland has issued National Guidelines
which contain programmes of study and
attainment targets for physical activity for
pupils aged 5 to 14.
Sportsmark
The Government has announced that it
intends to establish a Sportsmark scheme to
recognise schools that have effective
policies for promoting sport, with
additional ‘Gold Star’ awards for the most
innovative. The scheme sets the target of four
hours of sporting provision a week outside
formal lessons and will be managed by the
Sports Council.
Accountability and Inspection
The Government is to require schools to
include in their annual prospectuses details of
their sporting aims and the provision for
sport and to record in their annual governors’
reports how they have met these aims. In
addition, the Government is to ask OFSTED
(see p. 439) to inspect the quality and range
of games offered by schools and to report
annually to Parliament on its findings.
Partnerships with the Local Community
The Government is encouraging stronger
links between schools and the wider
community to ensure that children have
access to the sports amenities which clubs
and associations can make available outside
school hours. Efforts to strengthen these links
have been promoted by schemes such as
‘Team Sport Scotland’, which aims to
promote the development of school-aged team
sport, with support from The Scottish Office.
Since its inception in 1991, Team
Sport Scotland has provided
significant opportunities for coach
education and in-service training of
teachers, covering 700 courses
involving over 10,000 participants. It
has also organised almost 1,500 events
attracting over 100,000 school-aged
participants. The initiative has now
been extended to include non-team
sports, such as athletics and
swimming, as well as sport for people
with disabilities.
The Government wants to increase
business sponsorship in schools by
encouraging the private sector to sponsor
school teams, adopt a sporting facility or
sponsor inter-school competitions.
ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION
Responsibility for government policy on sport
and active recreation in England rests with
the Secretary of State for National Heritage.
The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland are responsible for
sport in their countries.
Responsibility for the organisation and
promotion of sport is largely decentralised,
and many sport and recreation facilities are
provided by local authorities. The main
mechanism by which the Government
directly channels financial assistance to sport
is through the Sports Councils.
504
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Sports Councils
The Sports Councils, appointed and directly
funded by the Government, are the
Government’s principal advisers on sporting
matters. The Government works closely with
them in implementing its sports policies.
There are currently four Councils:
• the Sports Council—for general matters
affecting Great Britain and specifically
English matters;
• the Sports Council for Wales;
• the Scottish Sports Council; and
• the Sports Council for Northern
Ireland.
The Councils make grants for sports
development, coaching and administration to
the governing bodies of sports and other
national organisations, and administer the
National Sports Centres (see p. 507). Grants
and loans are also made to voluntary
organisations, local authorities and
commercial organisations to help them
provide sports facilities. In 1994-95 the
Councils received government funds of
approximately £67 million.
Facilities receiving support from the
Sports Councils include sports halls, indoor
swimming pools, intensive-use pitches, indoor
tennis halls and school facilities.
Development of Sport
Strategies for the development of sport have
been drawn up by the four Sports Councils.
The aims are broadly to ensure that:
• all young people have the opportunity to
acquire basic sports skills;
• everyone has the opportunity to take part
in the sports or active recreation of their
choice; and
• everyone with the interest and the ability
has the opportunity to improve their
standard of performance in sport and
fulfil their potential.
The Sports Councils are increasingly
focusing resources on young people and the
development of excellence.
Restructuring
The Sports Council will be replaced in
January 1996 by two new bodies: the United
Kingdom Sports Council (UKSC) and the
Sports Council for England.
The UKSC will have ten members: an
independent chairman; the chairmen of the
four other Sports Councils; the chairman of
the British Olympic Association; and
representatives of amateur and professional
sport. It will represent Britain and seek to
increase its influence in international sport,
with a co-ordinating role for bringing major
international events to Britain. The UKSC
will not have a supervisory role, but instead
will co-ordinate matters where the
Government considers that there is a need
for a policy covering the whole of Britain.
These include doping control, sports science,
sports medicine and coaching.
The Sports Council for England will
concentrate its resources on an increased
programme of direct support to governing
bodies to help the ‘grass roots’ of sport, and
on services in support of sporting excellence,
such as the National Sports Centres in
England. The new council will give
particular support to the pursuit of high
standards of sporting achievement,
concentrating a greater proportion of its
funding on fewer sports than at present.
Governing bodies will be required to prepare
plans with specific targets for the
development of their sports, from the grass
roots to the highest competitive levels.
Local Authorities
Local authorities are the main providers of
basic sport and recreation facilities for the
local community. In England local authorities
manage over 1,500 indoor centres, largely
built in the last 20 years, as well as numerous
outdoor amenities. The facilities include
parks, lakes, playing fields, sports halls,
tennis courts, golf courses, swimming pools,
gymnasiums and sports centres catering for a
wide range of activities.
There has been a rapid growth in the
provision of artificial pitches—largely for
hockey—and a similar increase in the number
505
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of leisure pools, which offer wave machines,
waterfalls, jacuzzis and other leisure
equipment. Gross annual expenditure by local
authorities on sport and recreation amounts to
some £900 million in England alone.
National Sports Associations
The Central Council of Physical Recreation
(CCPR) is the largest sport and recreation
federation in the world. It comprises 202
British bodies and 66 English associations,
most of which are governing bodies of sport.
Similar associations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are the Scottish Sports
Association, the Welsh Sports Association and
the Northern Ireland Council of Physical
Recreation (NICPR). Their primary aim is to
represent the interests of their members to
the appropriate national and local authorities,
including the Sports Councils, from which
they receive funding. Award schemes run by
the associations include the CCPR’s
Community Sports Leaders Award scheme
and the NICPR’s Service to Sport Awards.
British Olympic Association
The British Olympic Association (BOA) is
the National Olympic Committee for Britain
and comprises representatives of the 33
governing bodies of Olympic sports. Its
primary function is to organise the
participation of British teams in the Olympic
Games, but it is also responsible for nominating
British cities for staging the Olympics.
The BOA determines the size of British
Olympic teams and sets standards for
selection, raises funds and makes all necessary
arrangements for Britain’s participation in the
Olympics. It also makes important contributions
to the preparation of competitors in the period
between Games. The Association’s British
Olympic Medical Centre at Northwick Park
Hospital in north London supplies a medical
back-up service for competitors before and
during the Olympic Games. The BOA is
supported by sponsorship and by donations
from the private sector and the public.
The BOA is investigating whether a British
city could submit a viable bid for the 2008
Olympic Games. The Sports Council’s choice
of venue for Britain’s new national stadium is |
likely to influence the BOA’s decision.
British Paralympic Association
Britain’s participation in the Paralympics is
organised by the BP A, which liaises closely
with the BOA. The BPA assists in the
preparation and training of Paralympic and
other international teams, and advises the
Sports Council on the distribution of grants
for all international disabled sports events.
Sports Governing Bodies
Individual sports are run by over 400
independent governing bodies, whose
functions include drawing up rules, holding
events, regulating membership, and selecting
and training national teams. Governing
bodies receiving funding from the Sports
Councils are required to produce four-year
development plans which should include their
proposals for young people. There are also
organisations representing people who take
part in more informal physical recreation,
such as walking and cycling. The majority of
the sports clubs in Britain belong to the
appropriate governing body.
National Coaching Foundation
The National Coaching Foundation (NCF)
works closely with national governing bodies
of sport, local authorities, and higher and
further education. Supported by the Sports
Councils, it provides a comprehensive range
of coach education and coaching development
services for coaches in all sports. The NCF
network has ten regional offices in England.
The NCF also runs Champion Coaching,
a programme which provides after-school
coaching in a wide variety of sports in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland for
those aged 11 to 14. In 1995-96 there will be
76 schemes, with about 55,000 children and
6,000 coaches participating.
Sports Clubs
A wide variety of recreational facilities are
provided by local sports clubs. Some cater foi
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
indoor recreation, but more common are
those providing sports grounds, particularly
for cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis
and golf. It is estimated that there are over
150,000 voluntary sports clubs affiliated to
the national governing bodies of sport. Many
clubs linked to business firms cater for
sporting activities. Commercial facilities
include tenpin bowling centres, ice and
roller-skating rinks, squash courts, golf
courses and driving ranges, riding stables,
marinas and, increasingly, fitness centres.
Countryside Bodies
The Countryside Commission (for England),
the Countryside Council for Wales and
Scottish Natural Heritage are responsible for
conserving and improving the natural beauty
of the countryside, and for encouraging the
provision of facilities for open-air recreation.
They are also responsible for designating
National Parks, ‘areas of outstanding natural
beauty’, heritage coasts and National Scenic
Areas (see p. 363).
In Northern Ireland the Ulster
Countryside Committee advises the
Department of the Environment on the
preservation of amenities and the designation
of ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’.
British Waterways
British Waterways is a publicly owned body
responsible for managing and developing
much of Great Britain’s inland waterways.
Many leisure and recreational pursuits, such
as angling and various types of sailing and
boating, are enjoyed on waterways and
reservoirs. British Waterways, which is
responsible for approximately 2,000 miles
(3,220 km) of canals and water navigations,
actively promotes water safety and organises
community activities.
National Playing Fields Association
The National Playing Fields Association
(NPFA) is a registered charity which aims to
ensure that there are adequate playing fields
and playspace available for use by the
community. There are affiliated associations
in the English and Welsh counties and
independent organisations in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
A major study of England’s recreational
land was completed in 1993 as part of a
strategy to safeguard playing fields. It
revealed that England has over 73,000
pitches on about 24,000 sites, about half
of which are owned by education
authorities. The Government intends to
take action to prevent the future loss of any
playing fields.
Commonwealth Games in Manchester
Manchester is bidding to stage the
Commonwealth Games in 2002. As the sole
bidder, Manchester should be confirmed as
the host city in a formal announcement by
the Commonwealth Games Federation in
November 1995. It will be the first time
Britain has staged the Games since 1986,
when they were hosted by Edinburgh.
Preparations for the Games are already
under way. This includes the construction of
a £55 million indoor arena with seating for
7,500 and a 3,500-capacity velodrome
(see p. 508), which was opened in 1994. The
two facilities were assisted by a government
grant of some £43 million.
Manchester is also planning to build an
80,000-capacity stadium at a cost of
£115 million on the eastern outskirts of the
city. The site has already been purchased and
cleared with the help of a government grant
of £30 million originally provided for
Manchester’s Olympic bids.
NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRES
The four Sports Councils operate a total of
13 National Sports Centres, which provide
world-class facilities for training and
competition at the highest level. First
priority at the Centres is given to the
governing bodies of sport for national squad
training and for the training of coaches.
However, the Centres also make their
facilities available to top sportsmen and
women for individual training and to the
local community. Most of the Centres
provide residential facilities.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
England
In England the Sports Council operates five
major National Centres and a minor
National Centre for climbers at Harrison’s
Rocks in Kent.
Crystal Palace in London is a leading
competition venue for a wide range of sports
and a major training centre for national
squads, clubs, schools and serious enthusiasts.
Its facilities are used by over 20 separate
governing bodies, and the Centre is a
regional centre of excellence for athletics,
netball, weightlifting and swimming. Crystal
Palace stadium is Britain’s major international
athletics venue, with capacity for 17,000
spectators. Other facilities include an
Olympic-size swimming pool and a sports
injury centre.
Bisham Abbey in Berkshire caters for a
number of sports, including tennis, football,
hockey, weightlifting, squash, rugby and golf.
The England football, rugby and hockey
squads train at the Centre. Bisham Abbey has
long-standing partnerships with the British
Amateur Weightlifters Association and the
Lawn Tennis Association, which has helped
to develop the Abbey as the National Tennis
Training Centre.
Lilleshall National Sports Centre in
Shropshire offers extensive sports facilities,
which are used by a variety of national teams.
Facilities include a world-class gymnastic
training centre, regularly used by the British
gymnastic squads, and extensive playing
fields for football and hockey. The football
Association (FA) uses Lilleshall as its base for
major coaching activities and has established
a training school there. Founded in 1984, the
school has 32 places for boys aged 15 and 16,
who each take up a two-year residency
funded by an FA scholarship.
The National Watersports Centre at
Holme Pierrepont in Nottinghamshire is one
of the most comprehensive water sports
centres in the world, with facilities for
rowing, canoeing, water-skiing, powerboating,
ski-racing, angling and sailing. Its main
feature is a 2,000-metre regatta course.
England’s fifth major National Sports
Centre—the National Cycling Centre—was
opened in Manchester in September 1994. It
is Britain’s first indoor velodrome and will be
the venue for cycling’s 1996 World Cup. Its
construction was assisted by a government
grant of £8 million.
Wales
The Sports Council for Wales runs two
National Sports Centres: the Welsh Institute
of Sport and the National Watersports
Centre. A further Centre—Plas y Brenin—is
run by the Sports Council.
The Welsh Institute of Sport in Cardiff is
the country’s premier venue for top-level
training and for competition in a large
number of sports. Facilities include a world-
standard gymnastics hall, a sports science
laboratory and a sports injury clinic.
The National Watersports Centre at Plas
Menai in north Wales is primarily a centre of
excellence for sailing and canoeing, with an
extensive range of activities including dinghy
and catamaran sailing, offshore cruising and
powerboat training.
Plas y Brenin National Mountain Centre,
situated in Snowdonia National Park in north
Wales, offers a variety of courses in rock
climbing, mountaineering, sea and river
canoeing, orienteering, skiing and most other
mountain-based activities.
Scotland
Scotland has three National Sports
Centres, which are operated by the Scottish
Sports Council.
The National Outdoor Training Centre at
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore caters for a
wide range of activities, including hill
walking, rock climbing, mountaineering,
skiing, kayaking and canoeing. Its main
purpose is to provide top-quality training for
those who intend to lead or instruct others in
outdoor activities. The Scottish Sports
Council invested nearly £500,000 in
Glenmore Lodge in 1994 for the
redevelopment and provision of training
courses. A purpose-built biathlon and cross¬
country skiing facility was opened in the
same year.
The Inverclyde National Sports Training
Centre at Largs has a large number of
508
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
facilities, including a gymnastics hall, a golf
training facility and a laboratory for fitness
assessment. The Centre also acts as an
important competition venue for major
national and international championships.
Inverclyde was used by 26 governing bodies
of sport in 1994, many of them using it as
their national training base.
The Cumbrae National Water Sports
Training Centre on the island of Great
Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde offers an
extensive range of courses catering for all
levels of ability. The Centre has a
comprehensive range of modern craft for a
wide variety of sailing activities, as well as
sub-aqua diving equipment. Cumbrae
regularly hosts major sailing championships.
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland Centre for Outdoor
Activities at Tollymore in County Down,
run by the Sports Council for Northern
Ireland, offers courses in mountaineering,
rock climbing, canoeing and outdoor
adventure. Leadership and instructor courses
leading to nationally recognised qualifications
are also available.
A new Northern Ireland Sports Centre
is being built at Upper Malone, Belfast,
with the assistance of a £1 million grant
from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts
(see p. 511). The Centre’s first facilities will
be a number of synthetic pitches.
SPORTS MEDICINE AND SCIENCE
Sports Medicine
The National Sports Medicine Institute, set
up by the Sports Council, provides clinical
services aimed at assessing and improving
fitness as well as treating and preventing
sports injuries. Based at St Bartholomew’s
Hospital, London, its facilities include a
physiology laboratory and an information centre.
Work is in progfess to develop a network
of regional centres to provide both clinical
and educational services, which will be linked
with new support services at the National
Sports Centres. The Sports Council has
allocated £566,000 towards sports medicine
for 1995-96. In Scotland a network of 33
sports medicine centres provide specialist
help with sports injuries.
In 1994 the Scottish Sports Council
developed a partnership with the Universities
of Strathclyde and Aberdeen to create the
Scottish Institute of Sports Medicine and
Sports Science.
Sports Science
The development of sports science support
services for the national governing bodies of
sport is being promoted by the Sports
Councils, in collaboration with the BOA
and the NCF (see p. 506), in an effort to
raise the standards of performance of
national squads. Some 27 governing bodies
are involved in the Sports Council’s Sports
Science Support Programme. In 1995-96 the
Sports Council is contributing £635,000 in
support of sports science studies. The
Sports Council for Wales has established a
sports science service at the Welsh Institute
of Sport with support from the Welsh
Office (see p. 533).
Drug Abuse in Sport
The Sports Council’s independent drugs-
testing regime provides for random testing in
and out of competition by independent
sampling officers, and the publication of
adverse findings. The Council also funds an
international laboratory, accredited by the
International Olympic Committee, at King’s
College, University of London, which
carries out analysis and research into methods
of detection for new drugs which unfairly
aid performance.
The Sports Councils have intensified their
drugs-testing programmes, with greater
emphasis being placed on out-of-competition
tests. In 1994-95 the Sports Council carried
out 4,374 tests in 50 sports, with 1.5 per cent
proving positive. Funding in Britain by the
four Sports Councils for the programme
exceeded £900,000 in 1994-95.
The Home Secretary is planning to
introduce greater penalties for supplying
anabolic steroids in an attempt to curb their
use in sport.
509
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain has fully implemented the provisions
of the Council of Europe’s Anti-doping
Convention, which aims to provide an
international framework within which national
anti-doping campaigns can work effectively.
SPECTATOR SAFETY
Safety at sports grounds is governed by
legislation. The main instrument of control is
a safety certificate which is issued by the
relevant local authority. When determining
the conditions of a safety certificate, the local
authority is expected to comply with the
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds produced
by the Home Office and The Scottish Office.
This was revised in 1990 to include the
relevant safety recommendations of the
Taylor Report on the Hillsborough stadium
disaster in Sheffield in 1989, which resulted
in the death of 96 spectators.
The Taylor Report
The Taylor Report, published in 1990,
contained 76 recommendations for
promoting better and safer conditions at all
sports grounds. Its major recommendation
was that standing accommodation should be
eliminated at all grounds designated under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. The
Government accepted the report but limited
the all-seating requirement to football in
view of the particular problems of safety
and crowd control in that sport. It also set
a timetable for all-seater football stadiums.
Following a review in 1992, the timetable
was modified. In addition, clubs in the
Second and Third Divisions of the Football
League are permitted to keep some standing
accommodation, providing that the terracing
is safe. In England and Wales the all-seater
policy is being enforced through licences
issued by the Football Licensing Authority.
Conditions in these licences require all
Premier League and First Division clubs to
have all-seater grounds; these conditions have
now largely been satisfied.
In Scotland the all-seating policy is
being implemented through a voluntary
agreement under the direction of the Scottish
football authorities.
The Football Trust
Founded in 1990 by the football pools
companies, the Football Trust provides grant
aid to help football clubs at all levels. Its
income is about £36 million a year and it is
funded partly by the pools companies from
their spot-the-ball competition and partly
from a 2.5 per cent reduction in pool betting
duty. This concession has provided over
£136 million to football to assist clubs in the
Premier League, the Football League and
the Scottish Football League to finance
projects to improve the comfort and safety
of spectators in line with the Taylor Report
recommendations.
In 1995 the betting duty concession was
extended for a further five years in order to
help clubs in the lower divisions of the
Football League and the Scottish Football
League to meet the safe terracing requirements.
The Government has given the Football
Trust a new wider role to enable it to fund
up to £8 million a year of safety work at
rugby league, rugby union, cricket and non¬
league football grounds. The work will be
financed through the Foundation for Sport
and the Arts (see p. 511).
Crowd Control
The Government has worked closely with the
police, football authorities and the
governments of other European countries to
implement crowd control measures.
Legislation has made it an offence in
England and Wales to throw objects at
football matches, run onto the playing area or
chant indecent or racist abuse. There are also
controls on the sale and possession of alcohol
at football grounds and on transport to and
from grounds.
Courts in England and Wales have the
power to prohibit convicted football hooligans
from attending football matches. They also
have powers to impose restriction orders on
convicted football hooligans to prevent them
travelling abroad to attend specified matches.
The National Criminal Intelligence Service
Football Unit co-ordinates police intelligence
about football hooligans and liaises with
overseas police forces.

SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
SPONSORSHIP AND OTHER
FUNDING
Sport is a major industry in Britain. In
addition to professional sportsmen and women,
over 450,000 people are employed in the
provision of sports clothing, publicity, ground
and club maintenance and other activities
connected with sport. In total an estimated
£9,750 million is spent on sport annually in
Britain. The private sector makes a
substantial investment in sports sponsorship,
contributing over £265 million a year. This
involves more than 2,000 British companies.
Sponsorship may take the form of
financing specific events or championships,
such as horse races or football/cricket leagues,
or of grants to sports organisations or individual
performers. Motor sport and football receive
the largest amounts of private sponsorship.
Sponsorship of sport is encouraged by a
number of bodies, including:
• the Institute of Sports Sponsorship, set
up by the CCPR (see p. 506) to develop
sponsorship at local, national and
international level. It currently comprises
some 80 British companies involved in
the sponsorship of sport;
• the Sports Sponsorship Advisory Service,
administered by the CCPR and funded
by the Sports Council, which has helped
sporting bodies to raise over £1 million
in England over the last three years;
• the Scottish Sports Council’s
Sponsorship Advisory Service, which
raised £300,000 for Scottish sport in
1993-94; and
• the Sports Council for Wales’s
Sponsorship Advisory Service, which
generated more than £190,000 for Welsh
sport in 1993-94.
Successive governments have negotiated
voluntary agreements with the tobacco
industry to regulate tobacco companies’
sponsorship of sport.
Sportsmatch
Launched by the Government in 1992,
Sportsmatch is a business sponsorship
incentive scheme which aims to increase the
amount of business sponsorship going into
‘grass roots’ sport and physical recreation.
The scheme offers matching funding for new
sponsorships and extension of existing
sponsorships. In England funding is subject
to a minimum of £1,000 and a maximum of
£75,000; in Scotland and Wales the
minimum is £500 and in Wales the
maximum is £25,000. Priority is given to
projects involving groups such as the young,
disabled people and ethnic minorities and to
projects in deprived areas. Recent awards
include a grant of £63,000 to help set up a
new British football league for people with
learning disabilities.
In England the Institute of Sports
Sponsorship runs the scheme on behalf of the
Department of National Heritage. Since its
inception, Sportsmatch has approved over
1,000 awards in England, totalling nearly
£9 million. In Scotland and Wales the scheme
is managed by the appropriate Sports Council’s
Sponsorship Advisory Service. Between April
1993 and August 1994 the Scottish Awards
Panel approved some 200 awards totalling
nearly £700,000. In Wales some 120 awards
were allocated in 1993-94 totalling more than
£200,000. Northern Ireland has its own sports
sponsorship incentive scheme, which is
currently being reviewed.
Sportsmatch is to set aside £1 million
specifically for schools projects, to be matched
by £1 million of commercial sponsorship.
Sports Aid Foundation
The Sports Aid Foundation raises and
distributes funds from industry, commerce
and private sponsors in order to assist the
training of talented individuals. Grants are
awarded on the recommendation of the
appropriate governing bodies to British
competitors who need help preparing for
Olympic, World and European
championships. The Scottish and Welsh
Sports Aid Foundations and the Ulster Sports
and Recreation Trust have similar functions.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was
set up by the football pools promoters in
511
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1991 to channel funds into sport and the arts.
The pools promoters are providing the
Foundation with some £45 million a year. A
further £22.5 million a year is received as a
result of the 2.5 per cent reduction in pool
betting duty announced in the 1990 Budget.
This was extended for a further five years in
the 1994 Budget. About £41 million a year is
available for sport. Since its launch, the
Foundation has made some 8,300 awards to
schemes benefiting over 100 sports and
totalling over £150 million.
Horserace Betting Levy
Most betting in Britain takes place on horse
racing and greyhound racing. Bets may be
made at racecourses and greyhound tracks,
or through over 9,000 licensed off-course
betting offices, which take about 90 per cent
of the money staked. A form of pool
betting—totalisator betting—is organised on
racecourses by the Horserace Totalisator
Board (the Tote). Racecourse bets may also
be placed with independent on-course
bookmakers.
Bookmakers and the Tote contribute an
annual levy—a fixed proportion of their
turnover—to the Horserace Betting Levy
Board. The amount of levy payable is decided
by the racing and bookmaking industries or,
in cases where agreement cannot be achieved,
by the Home Secretary. The Levy Board
promotes the improvement of horse breeds,
advancement of veterinary science and the
improvement of horse racing.
In 1993-94 the total money staked in all
forms of gambling, excluding gaming
machines, was estimated at £10,319 million.
National Lottery
Launched in November 1994, the National
Lottery is providing significant new funding
for five good causes: sport, charities, the arts,
heritage and projects to mark the millennium.
Each receives one-fifth of the money
generated for good causes. Funds are being
distributed to a wide range of schemes by the
Sports Councils, the Charities Board, the Arts
Councils, the National Heritage Memorial
Fund and the Millennium Commission. By
September 1995 the amount raised for good
causes amounted to some £1,000 million.
About 28 per cent of the Lottery’s net
proceeds is being distributed to good causes.
The remainder is divided between prizes (50
per cent), tax (12 per cent), retailers’
commission (5 per cent) and operating costs
and profit (5 per cent). The Lottery is run by
a private sector company—Camelot Group
pic—and regulated by the Director General
of the National Lottery.
It is estimated that three-quarters of all
households in Britain regularly play the
Lottery, which has an average weekly jackpot
of £8 million. The average spent on tickets is
£2.10 a week per household.
The first awards of National Lottery
money for sport were announced in spring
1995. Schemes in England, Scotland and
Northern Ireland received £3 million, £1.8
million and £440,000 respectively. Further
grants are being awarded on a monthly basis.
By September 1995 the Sports Council had
distributed awards totalling £95.9 million to
520 schemes in England in 45 sports.
TELEVISED SPORT
Major sporting events receive extensive
television coverage and are watched by
millions of viewers. In 1994 some of the
highest viewing figures were achieved by:
• horse racing: the Grand National
(17 million viewers);
• football World Cup finals (13.5 million);
and
• the FA Cup Final (12 million).
The largest ever audience for a sporting
event shown on one channel was achieved by
Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who
attracted 23 million viewers for their
performance in the ice dance competition at
the 1994 Winter Olympics.
The advent of satellite television and the
greater availability of cable have increased
substantially the amount of sport on
television, including a number of minority

A TO Z OF POPULAR SPORTS
Some of the major sports in Britain, many of
which were invented by the British, are
described below. Additional information on
these and other sports not covered here can
be found in A Digest of Sports Statistics for
the UK, published by the Sports Council.
Angling
One of the most popular countryside sports is
angling, of which there are three main types:
coarse, game and sea.
Angling is an overwhelmingly male sport,
with an estimated ten times as many male as
female participants among Britain’s 4 million
anglers. Many fish for salmon and trout,
particularly in the rivers and lochs of
Scotland and in Wales. In England and Wales
the most widely practised form of angling is
for coarse fish. Separate organisations represent
game, coarse and sea fishing clubs in England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The National Federation of Anglers in
England organises national championships for
coarse fishing and enters a team in the world
angling championships.
Athletics
Athletics is governed in Britain by the British
Athletic Federation (BAF), which is affiliated
to the International Amateur Athletic
Federation. The BAF is responsible for the
selection of British teams for international
events, and also administers coaching
schemes. For the Olympic Games and the
World and European championships one
team represents the whole of Britain.
Athletics is attracting increasing numbers
of participants. In recent years there has been
a significant growth in mass participation
events, such as marathons and half
marathons. The London Marathon, which
takes place every spring, regularly attracts
over 25,000 runners.
At the 1995 World Athletics Championships
in Gothenburg Jonathan Edwards won a gold
medal in the triple jump with a new world
record. In so doing, he became the first man
to jump beyond 18 metres.
In February 1995 Linford Christie set a
new indoor world record in the 200 metres at
Lievin, France.
Badminton
Badminton takes its name from the Duke of
Beaufort’s country home, Badminton House,
where the sport was first played in the 19th
century. The game is organised by the
Badminton Association of England and the
Scottish, Welsh and Irish (Ulster branch)
Badminton Unions. Around 5 million people
play badminton in Britain and there are over
5,000 clubs. The All England Badminton
Championships, held at the National Indoor
Arena in Birmingham, is the premier
tournament in the world grand prix circuit.
A mini version of the game—Short
Badminton—and badminton for the disabled
have been introduced in recent years.
Basketball
In Britain over 3 million people participate in
basketball. The English Basket Ball
Association is the governing body in England,
and there are similar associations in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. All the
associations are represented on the British
and Irish Basketball Federation, which acts as
the co-ordinating body for Britain and the
Irish Republic.
The leading clubs play in the National
Basketball Leagues. Mini-basketball and
513
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
micro-basketball are versions of the game
which have been developed for players
under the age of 13.
Wheelchair basketball is played under the
same rules, with a few basic adaptations, and
on the same court as the running game. Over
30 teams play in the National League.
In 1995 the English Basket Ball
Association started a new coaching scheme for
schoolchildren which aims to increase
participation and improve the quality of
basketball throughout England. The scheme
has received a £75,000 Sportsmatch award
(see p. 511).
Bowls
The two main forms of bowls are lawn (flat
green and crown green) and indoor bowls.
The game is increasingly enjoyed by adults of
all ages. In recent years the most notable
increases have been in the number of women
taking part. Bowls is also popular among
people with disabilities.
About 4,000 lawn bowling clubs are
affiliated to the English, Scottish, Welsh and
Irish Bowling Associations, which, together
with Women’s Bowling Associations for the
four countries, play to the rules of the World
Bowls Board. Crown green bowls and indoor
bowls have their own separate associations.
In 1995 Andy Thomson won the world
indoor singles championships for the second
year in succession.
Boxing
Boxing in its modern form is based on the
rules established by the Marquess of
Queensberry in 1865. In Britain boxing is
both amateur and professional, and in both
strict medical regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England is
controlled by the Amateur Boxing Association
of England. There are separate associations in
Scotland and Wales, and boxing in Northern
Ireland is controlled by the Irish Boxing
Association. The associations organise
amateur boxing championships as well as
training courses for referees, coaches and
others. The wearing of headguards is now
compulsory in all British amateur competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the
British Boxing Board of Control. The Board
appoints inspectors, medical officers and
representatives to ensure that regulations are
observed and to guard against overmatching
and exploitation. Britain currently has four
world champions: Frank Bruno (World
Boxing Council—WBC—heavyweight), Nigel
Benn (WBC super-middleweight), Naseem
Hamed (World Boxing Organisation—
WBO—featherweight) and Eamonn Loughran
(WBO welterweight).
Cricket
The basic rules for cricket were drawn up in
1835 by the Marylebone Cricket Club
(MCC), which still frames the laws of the
game today. The MCC and the Test and
County Cricket Board (TCCB), which
represents first-class cricket in England, are
both based at Lord’s cricket ground in north
London, the administrative centre of the
English game. Men’s cricket in Britain is
governed by the Cricket Council, consisting
of representatives of the TCCB, the National
Cricket Association (NCA—representing club
and junior cricket), the Minor Counties
Cricket Association and the MCC.
The TCCB is likely to be replaced before
the end of 1996 by an English Cricket Board,
which will govern all domestic cricket. The
Board is expected to undertake a fundamental
review of English cricket and to submit
proposals on the future funding of the
domestic game.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and
universities, and amateur teams play weekly
games in cities, towns and villages.
Throughout Britain there is a network of
cricket consisting of first class, minor counties
and club games with a variety of leagues.
The main competition in professional
cricket is the Britannic Assurance County
Championship, played by 18 first-class
county teams in four-day matches. There
are also three one-day competitions: the
Benson and Hedges Cup, the National
Westminster Trophy and the AXA Equity &
Law Sunday League.
Every year there is a series of five-day
Cornhill Insurance Test matches played
514
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
between England and one or more touring
teams from Australia, India, New Zealand,
Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, the West
Indies or Zimbabwe. A team representing
England usually tours one or more of these
countries in the British winter. A World Cup
limited-over competition takes place every
four years. In 1996 this will be held in India,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The governing body of cricket for women
and girls is the Women’s Cricket Association.
Women’s cricket is played at local, county
and international level. In 1993 England won
the Women’s World Cup for the second time.
Cycling
Cycling, one of Britain’s fastest growing
outdoor activities, includes road and track
racing, time-trialling, cyclo-cross (cross
country racing), touring and bicycle moto-
cross (BMX). All-terrain or mountain bikes
have grown significantly in popularity.
The British Cycling Federation has 17,360
members and is the governing body for
cycling as a sport. The Cyclists’ Touring
Club (CTC), with 40,000 members, is the
representative body for recreational and
urban cycling. Scotland and Wales have their
own Cyclists’ Unions. Northern Ireland has
two separate Cycling Federations.
In recent years three British cyclists—
Chris Boardman, Graeme Obree and Yvonne
McGregor—have broken the one-hour world
record; in 1993 Chris Boardman became the
first man to break through 52 km. Yvonne
McGregor broke the women’s one-hour
world record in Manchester in June 1995,
covering 47.4 km. Graeme Obree regained his
world 4,000 metres pursuit title in Bogota,
Colombia, in September 1995.
Major cycling events taking place each
year in Britain include the Tour of Britain
and the CTC rally at York. In July 1994
Britain hosted two stages of the Tour de
| France around Dover and Portsmouth.
Britain’s first indoor velodrome was opened
in 1994 (see p. 508).
Equestrianism
Equestrian activities include recreational
riding, dressage, endurance riding, carriage
driving, one- and three-day eventing and
show jumping.
The arts of riding and driving are
promoted by the British Horse Society,
which is concerned with the welfare of
horses, road safety, riding rights of way and
training. It runs the British Equestrian
Centre at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire. With
some 62,500 members, the Society is the
parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding
Club movements, which hold rallies,
meetings and competitions culminating in
annual national championships.
Leading horse trials, comprising
dressage, cross-country and show jumping,
are held every year at a number of
locations, including Badminton (Avon) and
Gatcombe Park (Gloucestershire). In July
1994 the British team of Charlotte Bathe,
Karen Dixon, Kristina Gifford and Mary
Thomson won the three-day event team
title at the World Equestrian Games in
The Hague.
Show jumping is regulated and promoted
by the British Show Jumping Association.
The major show jumping events each year
include the Royal International Horse Show
at Hickstead (West Sussex) and the Horse of
the Year Show at Wembley in London.
The authority responsible for equestrian
competitions (other than racing) at
international and Olympic level is the British
Equestrian Federation, which co-ordinates
the activities of the British Horse Society and
the British Show Jumping Association.
Football
Association football is controlled by separate
football associations in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England
340 clubs are affiliated to the Football
Association (FA) and more than 42,000 clubs
to regional or district associations. The FA,
founded in 1863, and the Football League,
founded in 1888, were both the first of their
kind in the world.
A new FA Premier League was started in
England and Wales in 1992, comprising 22
clubs. This was reduced to 20 clubs in
1995-96. The remaining 72 full-time
515
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
professional clubs play in three main divisions
run by the Football League. During the
season, which lasts from August until May,
over 2,000 English League matches are
played. Stan Collymore became Britain’s most
expensive footballer when he was transferred
from Nottingham Forest to Liverpool for
.£8.5 million in June 1995.
Three Welsh clubs play in the Football
League, while the National League of Wales
contains 20 semi-professional clubs. In
Scotland the Scottish Football League was
increased in 1994—95 to 40 clubs, equally
divided into four divisions. These include one
English club—Berwick Rangers. In Northern
Ireland, 16 semi-professional clubs play in the
Irish Football League.
The major annual knock-out competitions
are the FA Cup and the Coca-Cola Cup (the
League Cup) in England, the Tennents
Scottish Cup, the Coca-Cola Cup (the
Scottish League Cup), the Irish Cup and the
Welsh FA Cup. England is to host the
European Championship finals in June 1996.
Gaelic Games
Gaelic Games, increasingly popular in
Northern Ireland, cover the sports of Gaelic
football, hurling, handball, camogie (a
modified form of hurling) and rounders.
There are over 700 clubs in Northern Ireland
affiliated to the Gaelic Athletic Association,
the official governing body responsible for
Gaelic Games.
Golf
Golf originated in Scotland and is ruled by
the Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R & A),
which is situated at St Andrews on the east
coast of Scotland. The Golfing Union of
Ireland and parallel unions in Wales, Scotland
and England are the national governing
bodies for men’s amateur golf. These bodies
are affiliated to the R & A and are
represented on the Council of National Golf
Unions, which is the British co-ordinating
body responsible for handicapping and
organising home international matches.
Women’s amateur golf is governed by the
Ladies’ Golf Union. Club professional golf is
governed by the Professional Golfers’
Association (PGA) and tournament golf by
the European PGA Tour and the Women’s
PGA Tour.
The main event of the British golfing year
is the Open Championship, one of the
world’s leading tournaments. Other important
events include the Walker Cup and Curtis
Cup matches for amateurs, played between
Great Britain and Ireland and the United
States, and the Ryder Cup match for
professionals, played every two years between
Europe and the United States. In September
1995 Europe regained the Ryder Cup at Oak
Hill in the United States.
There are about 1,900 golf courses in
Britain. Some of the most famous include St
Andrews (which hosted the 1995 British
Open Championship), Muirfield and Royal
Birkdale. Nick Faldo and Colin Montgomerie
are both in the top ten in the world rankings.
In the women’s game Laura Davies is
currently ranked number one in the world.
Greyhound Racing
Greyhound racing is one of Britain’s most
popular spectator sports and takes place at 37
major tracks. Meetings are usually held three
times a week at each track, with at least ten
races a meeting. The main event of the year
is the Greyhound Derby, run in June at
Wimbledon Stadium, London. There are
also about 50 mainly small tracks which
operate independently. Like the major
tracks, they are licensed by local authorities.
The first Sunday greyhound race meetings
took place in January 1995 at Canterbury,
Hove, Peterborough, Powderhall (Edinburgh)
and Wembley.
The rules for the sport are drawn up by
the National Greyhound Racing Club, the
sport’s judicial and administrative body. The
representative body is the British Greyhound
Racing Board.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is divided into four main
disciplines: artistic (or Olympic) gymnastics,
rhythmic gymnastics, sports acrobatics and
general gymnastics.
516
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
The governing body for the sport is the
British Amateur Gymnastics Association
(BAGA). Over the past decade the number of
clubs affiliated to the BAGA has nearly
doubled. The sport is particularly popular
with schoolchildren and young adults, and it
is estimated that between 3 and 4 million
schoolchildren take part in some form of
gymnastics every day.
Highland Games
Scottish Highland Games cover a wide range
of athletic competitions in addition to
activities such as dancing and piping
competitions. The main events include
running, cycling, throwing the hammer,
tossing the caber and putting the shot.
Over 70 gatherings of various kinds take
place throughout Scotland, the most famous
of which is the annual Braemar Gathering.
The Scottish Games Association is the
official governing body responsible for athletic
sports and games at Highland and Border
events in Scotland.
Hockey
The modern game of hockey was started by
the Hockey Association (of England), which
was founded in 1886 and acts as the governing
body for men’s hockey. The controlling body
of women’s hockey in England is the All
England Women’s Hockey Association;
separate associations regulate the sport in
Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Cup competitions
and leagues exist at national, divisional or
district, club and school levels, both indoors
(six-a-side) and outdoors, and there are regular
international matches and tournaments.
A National Hockey Centre in Milton
Keynes will be the venue for all major hockey
matches in England from the start of 1996.
Horse Racing
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing and
National Hunt (steeplechasing and hurdle)
racing. The main flat race season runs from
late March to early November, but all-
weather flat racing and National Hunt racing-
take place throughout the year.
The Derby, run at Epsom, is the
outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the 2,000 Guineas and
the 1,000 Guineas, both run at Newmarket;
the Oaks (Epsom); and the St Leger
(Doncaster). Floodlit racing takes place at
Wolverhampton all-weather racecourse.
Britain has 59 racecourses and about 13,000
horses currently in training.
The most important National Hunt
meeting is the National Hunt Festival held at
Cheltenham in March, which features the
Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle. The
Grand National, run at Aintree, near
Liverpool, is the world’s best-known
steeplechase and dates from 1839.
Sunday racing with on- and off-
course betting was introduced in 1995.
A total of 24 Sunday race meetings
are being held on 12 Sundays
throughout the year. The first two
took place at Salisbury and
Newmarket on 7 May 1995, when the
1,000 Guineas became the first British
classic to be run on a Sunday.
The British Horseracing Board is the
governing authority for racing in Britain. Its
responsibilities include the fixture list, race
programmes, relations with the Government
and the betting industry, and central
marketing. The Jockey Club, as the
regulatory authority, remains responsible for
licensing, discipline and security.
Ice Skating
Ice skating takes four main forms: figure
skating (solo and pairs), ice dancing, speed¬
skating (indoor and outdoor) and precision
skating. The governing body is the National Ice
Skating Association of United Kingdom.
Participation in ice skating is concentrated
among the under-25s, and is one of the few
sports that attracts more female than male
participants as individuals. There are over
70 rinks in Britain; almost half have opened
since 1985.
British couples have won the world ice
dance championship 17 times, the most
recent being Jayne Torvill and Christopher
517
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Dean, who won four consecutive world
championships between 1981 and 1984. The
couple returned to amateur competition in
1994 and won a gold medal at the 1994
European Championships in Copenhagen.
Britain won two bronze medals at the 1994
Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway:
Nicky Gooch (indoor speed skating) and
Torvill and Dean (ice dance).
In 1995 Britain hosted the World Figure
Skating Championships at the National Arena
in Birmingham.
Judo
Judo is popular not only as a competitive
sport and self-defence technique, but also as a
means of general fitness training. An
internationally recognised grading system is in
operation through the sport’s governing body,
the British Judo Association.
Britain has won medals for judo at every
Olympic Games since 1972. This includes
four at the 1992 Olympics, where women’s
judo was included for the first time.
At the 1995 European Championships,
which were held in Birmingham’s Indoor
Arena, Britain had two gold medallists
(Nicola Fairbrother and Nigel Donohue) and
finished second in the medals table.
Keep Fit
Keep fit encompasses various forms of
movement and exercise activities. In March
1994 the Sports Council launched the
Exercise Association of England as an
impartial advisory authority for the
organisations involved in these activities.
The Keep Fit Association, one of the
largest governing bodies in England, receives
funding from the Sports Council to promote
physical fitness and a positive attitude to
health in England. Its national certificated
training scheme for keep fit teachers is
recognised by local education authorities
throughout Britain. Autonomous associations
serve Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Martial Arts
A broad range of martial arts, mainly derived
from the Far East, has been introduced into
Britain during the 20th century. There are
recognised governing bodies responsible for
their own activities in karate, ju-jitsu, aikido,
Chinese martial arts, kendo, taekwondo and
tang soo do. The most popular martial art is
karate, with over 100,000 participants.
Motor-car Sports
The main four-wheeled motor sports include
motor racing, autocross, rallycross, rallying
and karting. In motor racing the Grand Prix
Formula 1 World Championship is the major
form of the sport.
The governing body for four-wheeled
motor sport in Britain is the RAC (Royal
Automobile Club) Motor Sports
Association. The Association issues licences
for a variety of motoring competitions. It also
organises the Network Q^RAC Rally, an
event in the contest for the World Rally
Championship, and the British Grand Prix,
which is held at Silverstone as part of the
Formula 1 World Championship.
Britain has had more Formula 1 world
champions than any other country, the latest
being Nigel Mansell in 1992. The following
year Nigel Mansell became the first person
to win the IndyCar World Series
Championship in his debut year. In 1994
Damon Hill was runner-up in the Formula
1 World Championship.
Three out of the seven British drivers who
competed in the 1995 Formula 1 World
Championship recorded Grand Prix victories:
Damon Hill, Johnny Herbert and David
Coulthard.
British car constructors, including
McLaren and Williams, have enjoyed
outstanding success in Grand Prix racing and
many other forms of racing.
Motor-cycle Sports
Motor-cycle sports include road racing,
moto-cross, grass track, speedway, trials, drag
racing and sprint. It is estimated that there
are between 40,000 and 50,000 competitive
motor cyclists in Britain.
The governing bodies of the sport are the
Auto-Cycle Union in England and Wales, the
518
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Scottish Auto-Cycle Union and the Motor
Cycle Union of Ireland (in Northern Ireland).
The major events of the year include the Isle
of Man TT races and the British Road Race
Grand Prix. The Auto-Cycle Union also
provides off-road training by approved
instructors for riders of all ages.
Mountaineering
All forms of mountaineering, which includes
mountain walking and rock-climbing, are
growing in popularity. A recent survey
estimated that there were 700,000 climbers
in Britain.
The representative body is the British
Mountaineering Council, which works closely
with the Mountaineering Councils of
Scotland and Ireland. The main areas of
work include access and conservation. There
are over 300 mountaineering and climbing
clubs in Britain, and four National Centres
for mountaineering activities run by the
Sports Councils (see p. 505). Organisations
such as the Scottish Mountain Safety Group
help to promote the safe enjoyment of the
hills.
British mountaineers have played a leading
role in the exploration of the world’s great
mountain ranges. The best-known is Chris
Bonington, who has climbed Everest and led
many other successful expeditions. Some of
the world’s hardest rock climbs are found on
cliffs in Britain, and leading British climbers,
such as Jerry Moffat and Ben Moon, have set
new standards of difficulty on cliffs overseas.
In May 1995 Alison Hargreaves became
the first woman to climb Everest unaided and
without additional oxygen; she achieved the
same feat on K2 in August 1995, where she
met her death on descending the mountain.
Netball
More than 60,000 adults play netball
regularly in England and a further 1 million
participants play in schools. The sport is
played almost exclusively by women and girls
both indoors and outdoors.
The All England Netball Association is the
governing body in England, with Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland having their own
governing bodies. The number of clubs
affiliated to the All England Association has
grown steadily in recent years and currently
stands at 3,750. The biggest growth has been
in the youth development programme.
National competitions are staged annually for
all age groups.
The 1995 World Netball Championships
were held at the National Indoor Arena
in Birmingham.
Rowing
Rowing is taught in many schools, universities
and rowing clubs throughout Britain. The
main types of boats are single, pairs and
double sculls, fours and eights. The governing
body in England is the Amateur Rowing
Association; similar bodies regulate the sport
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The University Boat Race, between eight-
oared crews from Oxford and Cambridge, has
been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River
Race, also on the Thames, is the largest
assembly of racing craft in the world, with
more than 420 eights racing in procession. At
the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire crews
from all over the world compete each July in
various kinds of race over a straight course of
1 mile 550 yards (about 2.1 km).
At the 1995 World Rowing Championships
in Tampere, Finland, Britain won two gold
medals: the coxless pairs (Steven Redgrave
and Matthew Pinsent) and the lightweight
single sculls (Peter Haining). Overall, Britain
recorded its best tally in a world
championships, winning a total of six medals.
Rugby League
Rugby league (a 13-a-side game) originated in
1895 following the breakaway from rugby
union (see p. 520) of a number of clubs in
the north of England. Rugby league has kept
many of the features of the union game but
has its own distinct set of rules and is
concentrated in the north of England.
The governing body of the professional
game is the Rugby Football League while the
amateur game is governed by the British
Amateur Rugby League Association. The
519
BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
major club match of the season is the
Challenge Cup Final, which is played at
Wembley Stadium in London. In 1995 the
Cup was won by Wigan for the eighth year in
succession. Rugby league’s centenary world
cup took place in England and Wales in
October 1995. A Great Britain team will tour
Australia and New Zealand in autumn 1996.
Rugby league is to be revolutionised
in 1996 with the creation of a summer
Super League. This will consist of 12
clubs: ten from the north of England,
one from London and one
representing Paris. Matches will be
played in a season lasting from
March to October. In the autumn the
top four Super League clubs will have
play-offs against the top four teams
in the Australasian Super League.
Under the new format, there will also
be a First Division of 11 clubs and a
Second Division of 10.
Rugby Union
Rugby union football (a 15-a-side game) is
thought to have originated at Rugby School
in the first half of the 19th century.
The sport is played under the auspices of
the Rugby Football Union in England and
parallel bodies in Wales, Scotland and
Ireland. Each of the four countries runs
separate national league and knock-out
competitions for its domestic clubs.
An annual Five Nations Championship is
contested by England, Scotland, Wales,
Ireland and France. In 1995 England won the
Grand Slam (defeating all its opponents) for
the third time in five years. Overseas tours
are undertaken by the national sides and by
the British Lions, a team representing Great
Britain and Ireland. Tours are also made to
Britain by teams representing the major
rugby-playing nations.
The Rugby World Cup, which is held
every four years, was hosted and won by
South Africa in 1995. Among the home
nations, England achieved the most success
by reaching the semi-finals. The Women’s
World Cup was won in April 1994 by England.
Wales has been selected by the
International Rugby Board to host the finals
of the 1999 World Cup. Other matches in the
competition will be shared among England,
Scotland, Ireland and France.
Tournaments of seven-a-side rugby union
include the Middlesex Sevens, which is held
every year at Twickenham. An inaugural
World Cup Sevens, held in Edinburgh in
1993, was won by England.
The sport of rugby union abandoned its
amateur status in 1995, when the
International Rugby Board repealed the
sport’s amateur regulations and replaced them
with a new dispensation ending any
prohibition on payment or material benefit
for anyone involved as a player or official at
any level of the game.
Skiing
Skiing takes place in Scotland from
December to May and also at several English
locations when there is sufficient snow. The
five established winter sports areas in
Scotland are Cairngorm, Glencoe, Glenshee,
the Lecht and Nevis Range, all of which have
a full range of ski-lifts, prepared ski runs and
professional instructors.
There are over 115 artificial or dry ski-
slopes located throughout Britain, and it is
estimated that 1.5 million people in Britain
take part in the sport. The sport’s governing
body is the British Ski Federation.
Snooker and Billiards
Snooker was invented by the British in India
in 1875 and is currently played by
approximately 7 million people in Britain.
British players have an outstanding record in
the game and have dominated the major
professional championships. The main
tournament is the annual Embassy World
Professional Championship, held in Sheffield.
In the 1980s Steve Davis won the world title
six times and in 1995 Stephen Hendry
became world champion for the fifth time.
The controlling body for the non¬
professional game in England is the English
Association for Snooker and Billiards.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have
520
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
separate associations. The World Professional
Billiards and Snooker Association is
responsible for professional players, organises
all world-ranking professional events and
holds the copyright for the rules.
A growing number of women play snooker
and billiards. Their representative body is the
World Ladies’ Billiards and Snooker
Association, with around 250 members. A
women’s world snooker championship is
played every year in London. The Embassy
World Professional Championship was opened
to women in 1992.
Squash
Squash derives from the game of rackets,
which was invented at Harrow School in the
1850s. The governing body for squash in
England is the Squash Rackets Association;
there are separate governing bodies in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. The British
Open Championships is one of the major
world events in the sport.
The number of players in Britain is
estimated at over 2 million, of whom more
than 500,000 compete regularly in inter-club
league competitions. There are nearly 9,000
squash courts in England. The main
providers of facilities are member clubs,
commercial organisations and local authorities.
England won both the men’s and women’s
finals in the European Team Championships
in Amsterdam in April 1995.
Swimming
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people
with a wide range of abilities from all age
groups. All forms of competitive swimming are
governed by the Amateur Swimming
Association (ASA) in England and by similar
associations in Scotland and Wales. These three
associations combine to form the Amateur
Swimming Federation of Great Britain, which
acts as the co-ordinating body for the selection
of Great Britain teams and the organisation of
international competitions. Northern Ireland
forms part of the Irish Amateur Swimming
Association. Instruction and coaching are
provided by qualified teachers and coaches who
hold certificates awarded mainly by the ASA.
Mark Foster set a new short course world
record in the 50 metres butterfly at a World
Cup meeting in Sheffield in February 1995.
Table Tennis
Table tennis developed in Britain in the
second half of the 19th century. It is popular
with all sections of the community and widely
played in a variety of venues. The sport is also
a major recreational and competitive activity
for people with disabilities.
The governing body in England is the
English Table Tennis Association. There are
separate governing bodies in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland.
England is to host the 1997 World Table
Tennis Championships at the Indoor Arena
in Manchester.
Tennis
The modern game of tennis originated in
England in 1872 and the first championships
were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The
governing body for tennis in Great Britain is
the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), to which
the Welsh and Scottish LTAs are affiliated.
Tennis in Northern Ireland is governed by
Tennis Ireland.
The Wimbledon Championships, held
within the grounds of the All England Club,
are one of the four tennis ‘Grand Slam’
tournaments. Prize money totalled over £6
million in 1995. An extensive redevelopment
of the All England Club is taking place. The
first phase, a new No 1 Court, is due to be
opened in 1997.
Since 1981 the Championships have
generated over £125 million for British tennis.
This has been used for schemes such as the
Indoor Tennis Initiative, which since 1986 has
produced 35 public centres throughout Britain.
Club players take part in national and
county championships. To encourage younger
people to play tennis, national competitions
are organised for boys’ and girls’ schools,
and short tennis has been introduced for
children aged five and over. The game is
played in over 3,000 schools and in leisure
centres. In all, about 3 million people play
tennis in Britain.

BRITAIN 1996: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Tenpin Bowling
It is estimated that about 4.8 million people
take part in tenpin bowling every year in
Britain. There are over 200 national
tournaments and an annual National
Championship.
Britain has over 200 indoor bowling
centres, the first having opened in 1960.
More than 30,000 people belong to the
sport’s governing body, the British Tenpin
Bowling Association.
Volleyball
The English Volleyball Association and
parallel associations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland act as the sport’s governing
bodies. To encourage more children to play
volleyball, the Association organises national,
regional and area championships for a variety
of ages, from under 13s to under 19s.
Mini-Volley is a three-a-side version of the
game adapted for children under 13.
Grass and beach volleyball tournaments
are proving very popular with children and
are leading to an increase in the number of
schools playing volleyball.
Yachting
Yachting comprises sailing, powerboating and
windsurfing on both inland and offshore
waters. Racing in sailing boats takes place
between one-design classes or under handicap,
which provides level racing for boats of
different size and shape. The most well-
known ocean races include the Whitbread
Round The World Yacht Race and the
Fastnet Race. A new round-the-world yacht
race is to take place in 1996-97. The Grand
Mistral Race will be held in identical boats,
putting the emphasis on sailing skills rather
than design and technology.
Powerboat racing has two main forms:
inland circuit racing and offshore racing.
Events take place at many locations, including
Liverpool and Cardiff docks.
The Royal Yachting Association is the
governing body for all yachting in Britain. It
is estimated that about 3 million people
participate in the sport.

AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
From the environment to eating habits, and from the economy to
equestrianism, Britain: An Official Handbook combines background
material and up-to-date detail with in-depth coverage of all the latest
policy developments in Britain today. Now in its 47th edition, the
Handbook has long since become the most authoritative and respected
annual compendium of the United Kingdom.
As always, numerous tables, maps, diagrams and colour
photographs illuminate a wide range of topics, and, to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Central Office of Information, there is a special
selection of photographs reflecting life in Britain over the past five decades.
